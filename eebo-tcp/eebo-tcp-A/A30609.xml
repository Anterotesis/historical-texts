         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF a Heathen Poet could ſay, <hi>Non
omnis moriar,</hi> I ſhall live though I
die; ſuppoſing his Works im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
though himſelfe were mortall;
Upon how much better an account
may a Prophet of the Lord ſay, <hi>Non
moriar, ſed vivam,</hi> I ſhall not die, but
live; both in reſpect of his immortall
<pb facs="tcp:40441:3"/>
ſoule, to which death is as the gate of
life; and in reſpect of the immortall
travell of his ſoule, being converſant in
the Word of the Lord that abideth
for ever.</p>
            <p>The workes of the Saints of God
in whom is the ſpirit of prophecie, not
onely live when they are dead; but are
inſtrumentall in the hand of grace, both
to plant life where it is not, and water
it where it is, that it may ſpring forth
more abundantly.</p>
            <p>The choſen Veſſell of the Lord, by
whoſe Miniſtry he was pleaſed to give
out the Heavenly treaſures laid up
in theſe Sermons, hath ſome yeares
ſince put off his earth, and put on
that Inheritance of the Saints in light,
for which the Lord ſeemed <hi>earlie</hi> to
have fitted him, by his earneſt and
<pb facs="tcp:40441:3"/>
aſſiduous Travail in ſitting others.
But though the Veſſell be broken, or
rather indeed refined and tranſlated to
his maſters more immediate uſe, yet
the Treaſures abide for the common
enrichment of the Saints. For ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Treaſures (like the loaves bleſſed
by our Saviour) multiply in their uſe,
and when thouſands have been enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them, doe ſtill remaine ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to enrich thouſands.</p>
            <p>To you honoured Sir, is this ſmall,
but Precious treaſury preſented, not
as though your own ſtore were not
already full; for who knowes not
how many precious Jewels (through
the riches of Chriſt in you) you have
richly ſet and poliſhed for the ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Bride the Lambs wife? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſpirit of Chriſt ſeemes to have
<pb facs="tcp:40441:4"/>
choſen and ſealed your Spirit to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
his own Nuptials in your Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Marriage and ſong of loves.</p>
            <p>But as gold, beſides its own internal
worth, receives an Authentick impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of the Prince: And as in honouring the
Lord with the beſt part of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
An humble acknowledgement
of his Intereſt both in the whole and
our ſelves (not any Addition to his

preſented to the touch and teſt
of your Judgement, Firſt as the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard

            <head>To the Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>THe Authour of theſe enſuing Sermons
hath ſo abundantly approved himſelfe
to the Church of God by his former labours,
both in preaching and writing, that it would
be rather a diſparagement to him to offer any
thing by way of commendation. His name is
yet like a precious Oyntment; and ſo may it
be ſo long as the Sunne and Moon endures.
Theſe Sermons will diſcover themſelves to be
his genuine iſſue; the ſeverall lineaments and
proportions of his ſtile (though ſtiles differ
as much as faces) are here diſcernable. Thoſe
that had the happineſſe to be converſant
with him, and auditors to him, are able
to ſay, <hi>Sic oculos, ſic ille manus, ſic ora fere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,</hi>
So he opened his Text, ſo he handled his
Doctrine, ſo he delivered his Application. It
is true, theſe fragments of his are under the
<pb facs="tcp:40441:5"/>
prejudice of being Poſthumus works; yet we
may ſay of them as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
We ſuppoſe they are not inferiour to
the reſt of his Works, though they are born out
of due time; and fragments though they are,
yet are they to be eſteemed, <hi>Ramenta auri ſunt
pretioſa.</hi> Theſe Sermons are to be prized for
their own worth and intrinſecall excellency,
whoever was Authour. And this Authour is to
be honoured for his reall worth, whatſoever he
is the authour of.</p>
            <p>We ſhall adde this alſo for thy encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that theſe Sermons have been very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
taken by the pen of a ready writer, Mr. <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
now a Teacher of Shortwriting; one
who hath given ample teſtimonie of his great
skill and dexteritie in writing Short-hand.
We think we may ſay, there are not many
words delivered by the Author, that are left
out. However, confident we are that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
materiall which was by him preached,
but is here by the care and faithfulneſſe of the
Scribe preſented to thy view.</p>
            <p>The deſire of the publiſhers is, that the name
of this worthy man of God may be kept in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb facs="tcp:40441:6"/>
that thou maiſt transferre theſe things to
thy own uſe, and expreſſe them in thy life, that
what was ſpoken to ſome may be common to all;
what was accepted by them that heard it, may
be received and improved by thoſe that read it.
This is all we have to communicate to thee; it
would be an injury to detaine thee longer from
the reverend Author; we only commend thee to
the grace of God which is able to make thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in every good work, and bid thee Fare-well.</p>

of Gods people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo a Type of the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Gods people from the bondage of Antichriſt; therefore
it is very obſervable, that this ſong was to be ſung againe when
the people of God ſhould be delivered from Antichriſt; In <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.
15.</hi> and the beginning, you may ſee Gods judgements upon
Antichriſt. and in verſ. 3. it is ſaid <hi>they ſing the ſong of</hi> Moſes <hi>the
ſervant of God, and the ſong of the Lamb, ſaying, Great and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
are thy workes Lord God almighty; juſt and true are thy wayes,
thou King of Saints.</hi> By this you may ſee that God would ſhew
us, that the bondage under Antichriſt is like the bondage in
<hi>Egypt;</hi> and therefore <hi>Rome</hi> is called <hi>Egypt</hi> in the <hi>Revelations,</hi>
becauſe when we ſhall be delivred from Antichriſtian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
we ſhall renew this ſong of <hi>Moſes:</hi> So that if we now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
deliverance from bondage under Antichriſt, it is good for
us to acquaint our ſelves with this ſong, becauſe it is that which
ſhall be ſung over againe when the bondage of Antichriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.

It is a miraculous ſong according to the opinion of
<hi>Auſtin;</hi> he brings in this ſong as one of the miracles, that is, that
God did at the ſame time by the ſpirit inſpire all the people
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſung together one and the ſame ſong; and
therefore it was miraculous true if it had been ſo, but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not cleere in that.</p>
               <p>But we leave generalls and come to the words; though
there be many excellent things in the Chapter to make way to
that I have read; yet becauſe I would not be hindered, I will
come inſtantly to the words, which are as it were a recapitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all, containing the ſubſtance of all; as if he had ſaid,
I have ſpoken of many particulars that God doth for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<hi>but there is none like unto the Lord, who is glorious in holineſſe,
fearefull in praiſes, doing wonders.</hi> There are four things (you
ſee then) wherein the name of God is advanced here: Firſt,
there is none like the Lord: Secondly, glorious in holineſſe:
Thirdly, fearefull in praiſes: Fourthly, doing wonders.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe when my thoughts were firſt to ſpeake upon this
Text, I intended onely the third particular, the opening of that
Title of God, <hi>fearefull in praiſes;</hi> we finde not any ſuch Title
that I know of in all the book of God but onely in this place;
but becauſe I ſaw there was much of God in the two former,
therefore I thought it might be uſefull to ſhew you what there
is of God in them, and was unwilling to paſſe them by. For the
two firſt then, <hi>who is like to thee, O Lord,</hi> amongſt the Gods,
<hi>who is like unto thee, glorious in holineſſe, who is like to thee?</hi> this
you ſee is put by way of interrogation; now interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Scripture are eſpecially brought in two wayes: Firſt, by
way of admiration. Secondly, by way of negation. Sometimes
by way of admiration, <hi>Iſaiah 63. 1. Who is this that cometh from
Edom with died garments from Bozrah!</hi> Many others we might
name by way of admiration: and by way of negation you
know there are hundreds of examples; and both theſe we are
to underſtand here in the Text: Firſt, by way of admiration,
<hi>who is like unto thee O Lord amongſt the Gods,</hi> &amp;c. The ſpirit of
<hi>Moſes</hi> and the people being ſtruck with aſtoniſhment at the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, now manifeſted by the great workes he did, they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mire and ſay, <hi>who is like unto thee O Lord?</hi> and then by way
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40441:8"/>
of negation, <hi>who is like unto thee O Lord?</hi> that is, there is none
like unto thee; that is the firſt expreſſion of the glory of God,
the lifting up of the name of God above all things whatſoever;
<hi>there is none like to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And God doth much glory in this expreſſion of his glory,
that there is none like to him; we have it very often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
1 <hi>Chron. 17. 20. O Lord there is none like thee, neither is there
any God beſides thee, according to all that we have heard with our
eares:</hi> So in <hi>Pſalm. 86. 8. Among the Gods there is none like unto
thee, O Lord:</hi> and <hi>Pſalm. 89. 6. For who in the heaven can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
unto the Lord? who among the ſons of the mighty can be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto the Lord?</hi> we might name divers other places where
God glories much in this expreſſion of his glory: and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God have gloried much in it; and there is great cauſe
they ſhould doe ſo. It is ſaid of the godly <hi>Machabees</hi> that at
firſt by reaſon their name was an offence, meeting with this
ſentence,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>who is like unto thee O Lord amongſt the Gods?</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much taken with it, they wrote the firſt Hebrew Letter of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
word in this ſentence in their enſignes of warre, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them about with them; and upon this ground they were
called the <hi>Machabees,</hi> glorying in this Title of God, <hi>who is like
unto thee?</hi> And upon this ground the Holy Ghoſt concludes,
that all ſhould honour and glorifie God, becauſe there is none
like unto him. <hi>Pſal. 86. 8. Among the Gods there is none like unto
thee O Lord, neither are there any works like unto thy works.</hi> Mark
what followes in 9. 10. 11. 12. verſes. <hi>All Nations whom thou haſt
made, ſhall come and worſhip before thee, O Lord, and ſhall glorifie
thy name; for thou art great and doeſt wondrous things, for thou art
God alone; teach me thy way, O Lord, I will walke in thy truth; unite
my heart to feare thy name; I will praiſe thee O Lord my God, with
all my heart, and I will glorifie thy Name for evermore.</hi> Thus you
ſee how the holy Prophet was taken with this expreſſion of
God; that there is none like to him, therefore <hi>teach me thy way,
O Lord, I will walke in thy truth, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is none like unto the Lord amongſt the Gods:</hi> So it is here,
it may be tranſlated as well amongſt the mighties. God is lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up here not onely above the Heathen gods, ſo that there is
none like to him amongſt them; but he is lifted up above what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40441:8"/>
hath any excellency in it; there is none like to thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the mighties: who ever is mighty &amp; great, or let there be
what might and greatneſſe and excellency ſoever in the world,
yet God is infinitely above all. It would take up too much of
our time, if we ſhould dilate our ſelves in ſhewing to you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the glory of God in this, how he is above all things,
and that there is none like to him: I will therefore but briefly
name a few paſſages, and apply this particular, and paſſe to the
ſecond, that we ſhall dwell longer upon.</p>
               <p>There is none like to God: Firſt, in that whatever is in God,
is God himſelfe; this is a propriety of God: there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath any excellency in it that reaches to this excellency,
that whatever is in that creature ſhould be the being of it, all
creatures being made up of ſeverall things; but now whatever
is in God is God himſelfe. Againe, there is an univerſall
goodneſſe in God, and there is none like to him in that; one
creature hath one good in it, and another, another: but God
hath all good in him, there is all excellency and beauty in God
in an eminent manner; there is none like to him in that. And
then all beings are but one excellency in God, however we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
God in ſeverall excellencies; one attribute ſhining
through one creature, and another through another, yet all are
united in God; And all that is in him is primitively in him,
he is of himſelfe, and from himſelfe, and for himſelfe. And then
none can communicate himſelfe ſo as God can; none can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
evill, or convey good ſo as God can, and that this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of God hath reference too: for it is peculiar to God to
communicate as much of himſelfe as he will, which no creature
can doe; though the creature hath but little, ſome drops onely
of goodneſſe in compariſon of the infinite Ocean that is
in God, yet the creature cannot communicate of thoſe drops as
it will; it is the propriety of God onely to communicate of
his goodneſſe as he will. And not onely ſo, but he can make
the creature that he communicates his goodneſſe to, to be as,
ſenſible of his goodneſſe as he pleaſes, which none elſe can doe;
though one creature can communicate good to another, yet it
cannot make that creature as ſenſible of that good as it will,
which God can doe. And ſo in inflicting of evill there is none
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40441:9"/>
like to the Lord in that, the Lord is able to let out all evill, to
bring all evill at once; which none elſe can doe; and he is able
to make the creature upon whom he inflicts an evil, to be as
ſenſible of that evill as he will; one that hurts another, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make him as ſenſible of that hurt as he pleaſes, but this is
the propriety of God; as he can bring all evill together, ſo he is
able to make the creature as ſenſible of all as he will; and God
challengeth this as his own propriety, that he alone can doe
good, and he alone can doe evill; and therefore there is none
like to him; from hence it follows then, that there is none to
be worſhipt as the Lord, there is none to be honoured as the
Lord; the Heathen gods, becauſe they did but communicate
ſome particular good, therefore they challenged but particular
ſervice; externall worſhip, and worſhip in ſome particulars
would ſerve the Heathen gods, and they were ſatisfied with it,
and required no more; and there was reaſon for it, becauſe
they could not challenge to themſelves a communication of a
univerſall good; for one god was for one particular good, and
another for another particular good; and therefore they had
but particular worſhip ſutable thereunto: but now there is none
like to the Lord, he challengeth a univerſall worſhip and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
and ſoul, and ſtrength: ſo that there is no ſuch worſhip to
be given to any as is given to God; and all becauſe there is none
like to him in the excellency of his nature, and in the way of
communicating of himſelfe unto his creature.</p>
               <p>Now this that I have ſpoken, is exceeding uſefull in the whole
courſe of our lives, in ordering of our wayes and thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God: conſider how uſefull this is, thus: It ſhould be our
care in beholding any beauty, any good, or excellency in the
creature, to keep ſtill in our thoughts and hearts, the ſenſe and
apprehenſion of the infinite diſtance that there is between God
and that creature; the want of this is the cauſe of almoſt all the
evill that there is in the world, and the true apprehenſion of
this is a ſpeciall meanes to enable us to glorifie God as a God.
I ſay thus, when thou beholdeſt any excellency, beauty, or
comlineſſe in a creature, and taſteſt any ſweetneſſe in it, be ſure
thou doeſt then keep in thy heart the ſenſe of this truth, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40441:9"/>
though there be ſome ſweetneſſe here, yet God is infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the creature, and there is an infinite diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that good, and beauty, and excellency that is in theſe
creatures, and that which is in God himſelfe. God gives us
leave to let out our hearts upon, and to take the comfort of
the creature, when we ſee a beauty and excellency in it; and
that becauſe it is his ſimilitude upon the creature, and it is Gods
excellency that is there, and a ſpirituall heart hath more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to let out it ſelfe to the comforts of the creature then any
in the world beſides, becauſe he can meet with, and taſte God
there; but though God give us leave to doe this, yet evermore
ſo that we be ſure to reſerve our hearts to God; to be ſenſible
of the infinite excellency that is in God above any creature;
and if we be not carefull of this, we ſhall ſoon fall off from glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
God as God, and our hearts will ſticke in the creature.
And this hath been the ground of all the outward Idolatry and
ſpiritual Idolatry in the world: Of outward Idolatry, which
did ariſe thus; men at firſt ſeeing ſome excellency and worth in
the creature, as the Sun and Moon, and Stars, they did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
God above them; and that theſe were but creatures, and
that there was more excellency in God then in any of theſe:
but at laſt comming to look upon the creature too much, and
being taken with the excellency they ſaw there, their hearts
ſtuck in the creature, and they loſt the apprehenſion of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
excellency of God above the creature, and ſo fell from
God, and worſhipt them that were no gods.</p>
               <p>And ſo for ſpirituall Idolatry; thoſe that commit Idolatry
with riches, or any creature: come to them at firſt, and ſay to
them, how doe you apprehend the comforts of the creature?
is there not infinitely more in God then there is in the creature?
yes, they will ſay. I but by letting our hearts out upon the
creature, and by poring upon the beauty of the creature, we
begin at length to loſe the power of this apprehenſion that was
at firſt upon our hearts, and ſo commit ſpirituall Idolatry with
the creature; and therefore it muſt be our care to keep intire and
freſh our apprehenſion and ſenſe of that infinite diſtance that
there is between God and all the comforts of the creature: and
ſo long as thou doeſt keep thy apprehenſions freſh and ſtrong
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40441:10"/>
here, there is no danger, and thou ſinneſt not in letting thy
ſelfe out to the creature, if it have not abated thy apprehenſions
of the infinite diſporportion that there is between God and all
creatures, therefore now ſeeing there is an infinite ſtupendious
height of excellency in God above all creatures, there ſhould
be the like thoughts in our hearts towards God and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
thus: as there is an infinite diſtance between the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God and the excellency of all creatures, ſo there ought to
be a kinde of infiniteneſſe in the diſtance and diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that eſteem and delight, and dependance we have in, and
upon the creature, and that we have in and upon God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ſhould not ſatisfie your ſelves in this that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
God above the creature, for all will do ſo; but you
are to finde in your ſouls ſuch a diſproportion between your
eſteem and joy, and deſire after the creature, and that you have
after God, as is ſomewhat like the diſtance that there is between
God and the creature, now the diſtance is infinite that is between
God and the creature, therefore there ſhould be a kinde of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſſe
in the diſtance between your eſteem of, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of your hearts and endeavours after the creature; and that
eſteem and working of your hearts and ſouls which you have
towards God; and this is to glorifie God as a God; this is the
ſoul worſhip we owe to God in the world; this is the true ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
of the name of God when this comes practically upon
our hearts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if there be none like to God, then it followes that
there is none like to the people of God; for as a mans god is, ſo
is he; look what god a man chuſeth, he is as his god is; a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
man, if he make riches his god, he is ſo to be judged; and
ſo a voluptous man or a Heathen. Now if the Saints of God
have choſe this God to be their God, and there be none like to
him, then it muſt needs follow, that there is no people like to
Gods people: and marke how the Holy Ghoſt makes this refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in divers Scriptures, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 26, 29. compared: verſe
26. <hi>There is none like unto the God of Ieſurun, who rideth upon the
Heaven, in thy help and in his excellency in the skie;</hi> what is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the Holy Ghoſt upon this? verſe 29. <hi>Happy art thou O
Iſrael, who is like unto thee, O people ſaved by the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. So that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40441:10"/>
you ſee according to the glory of God in any particular there is
a reflection of it upon the Saints of God, and this is the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
excellency of Gods Saints to have the reflection of God
upon them, happy are they that have God to be their God; if
God be excellent, ſo are they: if God be above all, and there is
none liketo him, ſo are they above all, and there is none like
to them. You have the ſame inference of the Holy Ghoſt, 2 <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
7. 22, 23. Wherefore thou art great, O Lord God, for there is
none like thee, neither is there any God beſides thee; according to all
that we have heard with our eares.</hi> Marke what followes, <hi>and what
one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Iſrael?</hi> &amp;c. So
that there is none like the people of God; and it muſt needes
follow from hence, for they are as their God; therefore ſayes
<hi>Moſes</hi> (when he ſpeaks of the people of God) <hi>Exod. 33. 16. So
ſhall we be ſeparated, I and thy people, from all the people that are
upon the earth,</hi> ſo you read it in your Bibles; but the word in the
originall ſignifies <hi>wonderfully ſeparated;</hi> Gods people are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
ſeparated from the world; as God is wonderfully high
above all creatures ſo are his people, therefore in <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 9.
it is ſaid that <hi>Gods people ſhall dwell alone, and ſhall not be reckoned
among the Nations:</hi> why becauſe they are the people of God and
the people of that God that hath none like to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is none like to them; that is for the conſolation of
the Saints of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it followes from hence, that therefore it ſhould be
our care that none ſhould doe for their gods ſo as we doe for
ours: for if there be none like to our God, then it is a ſhame,
that any that chuſe other gods ſhould doe that for them that is
above that which we doe for our God. As now for Idolators,
to inſtance in outward and ſpirituall Idolatry: why, there is
none like to our God, certainly all the Idolaters in the world
have not ſuch a God as we have, <hi>their rocke is not as our rocke, our
enemies themſelves being judges.</hi> What a ſhame then were it, if
we ſhould not doe more for our God then they doe for theirs?
yea, we ſhould labour to doe that for our God that may come
up to that height of excellency which we apprehend to be in
him. Will you ſee what Idolaters doe for their Gods:
Firſt, obſerve the earneſtneſs of the ſpirits of Idolaters after their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40441:11"/>
gods, their hearts are enflamed after their Idols: ſo we have it
<hi>Iſaiah 57. 5. enflaming your ſelves with Idols under every green Tree:</hi>
their hearts were enflamed after their Idol gods, which are not
like our <hi>God:</hi> O how then ſhould our hearts be enflamed after
our God! ſhould we content our ſelves with, and reſt ſatisfied
in cold and in dead ſervices to our God! how much ſtrength
ſhould that exhortation of the Apoſtle have upon us <hi>Rom, 12. 11.
Be fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord?</hi> It is the Lord we ſerve, it is
our God, the great and glorious God, and therefore we ſhould
be fervent in ſpirit, ſerving him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Scripture ſayes that Idolaters, thoſe that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
falſe gods, are mad upon their Idols <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 38. The people
of God then ſhould have their hearts run after God, ſo that
thoſe that are carnall and not able to judge, ſhould look upon
them even as mad men, and indeed they doe ſo: whenſoever the
hearts of the Saints are after God fully, they are lookt upon as
mad men; St. <hi>Paul</hi> was counted a mad man by <hi>Feſtus, Acts 26.
24.</hi> and we ſhould not be afraid of the reproaches of the world
in this kinde; though they deſpiſe us and thinke us baſe and
vile, and out of our wits: Why Idolaters are mad upon their
Idols, therefore if there be any thing God calls for at our hands,
though the world account it madneſſe, yet our hearts muſt
worke after God in it: and it is a ſhame that any mens hearts
ſhould be more after their gods, then our hearts are after ours;
becauſe there is none like unto our God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the earneſtneſſe of the hearts of Idolaters after their
Idoll gods appeares from <hi>Jer. 8, 1, 2. At that time ſaith the Lord,
they ſhall bring out the bones of the Kings of Judah.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And they
ſhall ſpread them before the Sun, and the Moon, and all the hoſt of
Heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have ſerved, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whom they have walked, and whom they have ſought, and whom
they have worſhipped: they ſhall not be gathered, nor be buried,</hi> &amp;c.
I have often thought of this Scripture, it is exceeding remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
I know no one Scripture in all the book of God, that hath
ſo many expreſſions together, to ſhew the ſtrength of the hearts
of Gods people after God, as here we have to ſhew the ſtrength
of Idolaters after their Idols: <hi>And they ſhall ſpread them before the
Sun, and the Moon, and all the hoſt of Heaven.</hi> Marke, 1. <hi>Whom they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40441:11"/>
have loved. 2. Whom they have ſerved. 3. After whom they
have walked. 4. Whom they have ſought. 5. Whom they have
worſhipped;</hi> and all in ſo few words. Thus their hearts were
after their Idoll gods: how much more then ought it to be ſaid
of us concerning our God, whom we have loved, and whom we
have ſerved, and after whom we have walked, and whom we
have ſought, and whom we have worſhipped?</p>
               <p>Againe, obſerve how the Scripture ſets out the ſpirits of men
after their Idoll gods, in regard of the coſt they are willing to
beſtow upon them. <hi>Iſa. 46. 6. They ſhall laviſh gold out of the
bag, and weigh ſilver in the ballance, and hire a goldſmith, and he
maketh it a god.</hi> They care not what coſt they are at to worſhip
their Idols. O what a ſhame would it be if we ſhould not be
willing to part with much of our eſtates for the true worſhip of
the true God: and though we ſhould loſe our eſtates, yet if
we can ſerve God better, and in a purer way, we ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
for Idolaters will laviſh gold out of the bag upon their
Idols. Now there is none like to our God; therefore it is a
ſhame that they ſhould doe more for their gods then we doe for
ours. And then what are Idolaters willing to ſuffer for their
gods? 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 28. how did <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts there cut themſelves
after their manner, with Knives and Lancers, till the blood gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
out, to ſhew their reſpect to their Idols: let us then be
willing to ſuffer any thing that God calls us to. And how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
were they to their Idols therefore ſayes God, <hi>Jer. 2. 10, 11.
Conſider diligently and ſee, if there be ſuch a thing: hath a Nation
changed their gods which are yet no gods? but my people have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their glory for that which doth not profit;</hi> how ill doth God
take this that Idolaters ſhould not change their gods that are
infinitely below him, and yet that his people ſhould change
their God who is infinitely above them?</p>
               <p>Againe let us take heed leſt there be any found that ſhould
have their hearts ſet more upon their luſts, then we are upon
God: take all the excellencies in the world, and they are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
below God; how much more then is a luſt? for what is a
luſt in compariſon of all creatures in heaven and earth? and yet
how are mens hearts ſet upon their luſts? yea, how hath thy
own heart been ſet upon wicked luſt heretofore? thinke then
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40441:12"/>
with thy ſelfe what an infinite unreaſonable thing is it that the
heart of any man in the world, or thy own heart, ſhould be ſet
more upon a baſe luſt then upon the living, eternall, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
God. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he ſold himſelfe to worke
wickedneſſe, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 20. be thou willing then to ſell thy ſelf
to God, to give up thy ſelf to God; <hi>the hearts of the ſonnes of men,</hi>
(it is ſaid) <hi>are ſet, and fully ſet to doe evill, Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 11. doe not
thou content thy ſelfe with ſome faint wiſhes and deſires after
God, but let thy heart be ſet and fully ſet for God. In <hi>Micah 7.
3.</hi> it is ſaid <hi>they doe evill with both hands earneſtly;</hi> marke, they
doe evill, and they doe evill earneſtly, and they doe evill ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
with both hands. Now then, for ſhame be not thou ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh
in doing ſervice for thy God; doe that which is good, and
doe it with both thy hands, and doe it earneſtly with all thy
heart.</p>
               <p>Againe, we have one notable Scripture more that ſhewes how
the hearts of men are ſet upon that which is evill, <hi>Prov. 19. 28.
The mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity;</hi> 'tis an elegant expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Holy Ghoſt; its a metaphor taken from the practice
of brute creatures; as now take a beaſt that hath been kept from
drink a long time, and is exceeding thirſty, if you bring it to
the water, it will thruſt its head into the water, as if it would
devour the whole River, and could never be ſatisfied: that is
the meaning of this phraſe, <hi>the mouth of the wicked devoureth ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
that is, when he comes to his ſinne, he is as greedy upon it,
as the beaſt that hath been kept long from water is greedy of
water. O how ſhould our hearts be infinitely more greedy after
God, and his ſervice, then wicked men are or can be after the
ſervice of their luſts! to conclude all this, with that you have
<hi>Exodus</hi> 30. from verſe 34. to the end; there was a perfume there
to be made by the compoſition of the Apothecary; but there
was this charge given, <hi>as for the perfume which thou ſhalt make,
you ſhall not make to your ſelves, according to the compoſition thereof,
it ſhall be unto thee holy for the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. So I conclude this point,
there is none like to God, he being above all: when your hearts
therefore are in any good frame towards God, perfumed and
lifted up towards God, take heed they be not lifted up towards
any creature in the ſame manner as they are towards God: for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40441:12"/>
your ſervice to God muſt be ſutable to the nature of God; now
there is none like to God, therefore there ſhould be no ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
tendred to any, as is tendred to God: thus much for the
firſt thing, whereby the name of God is advanced here; <hi>who is
like unto thee O Lord among the gods!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We come now to the ſecond, <hi>glorious in holineſſe;</hi> The word
tranſlated here <hi>glorious,</hi> doth as well ſignifie <hi>magnificent, noble,</hi>
and ſo it is uſed in many places: <hi>thou art magnificent and noble
in thy holineſſe.</hi> Brethren, it is the greateſt magnificence, the
greateſt nobility, and height of ſpirit, that can be, to be holy:
God himſelfe is a magnificent God, and he is ennobled by his
holineſſe: this ſets out the excellency of holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>glorious in holineſſe,</hi> it is rendred by ſome glorious in
holy things: that is, glorious in thy holy Angels, glorious in
thy holy Saints, glorious in thy holy word, glorious in thy
holy Ordinances, glorious in thy holy worſhip; God indeed is
very glorious in his Angels, and in his Saints, and in his word,
and in his worſhip, and in his Ordinances; but we will take
the words as you have them here, <hi>glorious in holineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the explication of the glory of God in this Title,
there are theſe three things to be done: Firſt, to ſhew you a
little what holineſſe in God is. Secondly, I ſhall open unto you,
how God is ſaid to be glorious in holineſſe. And then Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I ſhall ſhew you why God hath this Title given him here in
this place; why he is rather ſaid here to be glorious in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
then glorious in power: for it was an act of power rather,
that God did put forth in the deſtruction of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and
deliverance of his people.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: what is holineſſe in God; we underſtand this
(as generally we doe almoſt all things of God) rather by way
of negation then otherwiſe; rather by what it is not, then by
what it is, therefore we uſe to ſay that Gods holineſſe is that
whereby his nature is free from all kinde of mixture, and from
the leaſt ſoil and filth of ſinne; therefore God is called light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
light is ſo pure a creature and ſo free from any mixture
of pollution, that it can be amongſt filthy things without any
defilement of it ſelfe: ſo God can worke with ſinne it ſelfe, and
yet without any defilement of his nature; but beſides this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40441:13"/>
if you would know ſomewhat poſitively, what the
holineſſe of God is, I would deſcribe it briefly to you thus: <hi>It
is the infinite rectitude and perfection of the will of God eſpecially,
whereby he doth will and worke all things ſutable to the infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of his own being;</hi> the excellency of God is the higheſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
therefore the rule of all excellency; and the will of God being
alwayes ſutable to his owne infinite excellency, and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to vary in the leaſt from it, therefore his will is the rule of
all holineſſe. Let us conſider it a little by looking into the
holineſſe of the creature, and by that we ſhall ſee ſomewhat of
the holineſſe of God: for as we cannot ſee the glory of the Sun
by looking directly upon it, it being too bright an object for
us: but by the reflection of its beames in the water we may
behold its glory: ſo, the holineſſe of God is too bright to be
beheld in it ſelfe; we cannot behold the infinite purity and
holineſſe of God immediately: but by looking upon the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the creature, which is as it were the reflection of Gods
holineſſe upon it, and a ray and beam of it, we may come to
ſee ſomewhat of the holineſſe of God. Now the holineſſe of a
creature is this, the ſeparation of it from common things to a
holy uſe, or the dedication of a creature in ſome immediate
manner to God, for the lifting up of the name of God; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
of the Saints is this, the ſeparation of their ſpirits from
all common things to God as the higheſt and laſt end. And
when they are able to worke to God as the utmoſt end, and to
will that they doe in order to God as the laſt end; and ſo as is
ſutable to God as the higheſt end, that is the holineſſe of their
wills: ſo it is in Gods holineſſe: Gods holineſſe is a dedication,
as it were, of God to himſelfe: that is, God being of and from
himſelfe, and himſelfe being his own laſt end, he gives up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
unto himſelfe, and wills himſelfe as the higheſt and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
end, and ſo wills all things in order to himſelfe as the
laſt and higheſt end: this is the holineſſe of God; and the image
of this holineſſe is that ſtampe and worke of grace that is upon
the creature: when the creature is enabled to will God as the
higheſt end, and all things in ſubordination to him, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is then ſaid to be holy, becauſe it hath a ſtampe of God
upon it: this is Gods holineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:40441:13"/>
But <hi>glorious in holineſſe:</hi> how is God glorious in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?
God is glorious in all his attributes and workes: and the
truth is, there is not one thing in God more glorious then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
every attribute of God being in it ſelfe equally glorious;
but in regard of manifeſtation and according to our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſo one thing appeares more glorious then another; and
God is pleaſed to ſpeak to us according to our apprehenſions:
therefore you may ſee how the Saints doe eſpecially glory in
God as a holy God: looking upon him as a holy God, they doe
exceedingly rejoyce and glory in him: therefore ſayes the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,
Pſal. 99. 3. Let them praiſe thy great and terrible name, for it
is holy:</hi> and verſe 5. <hi>Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worſhip at his
foot-ſtool, for he is holy:</hi> and again, verſe 9. <hi>exalt the Lord our
God and worſhip at his hily hill, for the Lord our God is holy.</hi> Thus
the people of God look upon God in his holineſſe as the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
ground of his praiſe and exaltation; yea the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in heaven, look upon God in his holineſſe, and eſpecially
exalt him from thence, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6. 3. the <hi>Cherubims</hi> and <hi>Seraphines</hi>
cry three times, <hi>holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hoſts.</hi> You never finde
any of Gods attributes mentioned ſo three times together:
though it is true, God is infinite in power, and in wiſedome,
as well as in holineſſe; yet you never finde in Scripture that
God is ſaid to be wiſe, wiſe, wiſe, or, almighty, almighty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:
but <hi>holy, holy, holy,</hi> three times together: and as the
Angels of Heaven adore God eſpecially for his holineſſe, ſo the
Church of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 8. cryes out, <hi>holy, holy, holy, Lord God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi>
ſhewing the bleſſed condition of the Church of God,
when it ſhall be hereafter more ſanctified, and God ſhall dwell
amongſt them, they ſhall exceedingly then adore God in his
holineſſe above any other attribute: yea God himſelfe ſeemes
to glory in his holineſſe above any other attribute; therefore
when God would lift up himſelfe in his glory, and give you the
higheſt expreſſion of himſelfe, he doth it in this, as he is holy.
<hi>Iſaiah 57. 15. For thus ſaith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth
eternity, whoſe name is holy.</hi> When God would lift up himſelfe,
it is in this <hi>whoſe name is holy:</hi> and ſo when God would ſweare
by himſelfe <hi>(Amos 4. 2.)</hi> he ſweares by his holineſſe. Now as the
Scripture ſayes, when God could ſweare by no greater, he ſware
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40441:14"/>
by himſelfe: ſo I may ſay, when God could ſweare by no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
above this, he ſwares by his holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Again, God glories in heaven it ſelfe as the habitation of his
holineſſe: heaven is the habitation of Gods glory, there God
lets out his glory fully: but what is that glory? why the top of
all, is, the holineſſe of God. <hi>Iſaiah 63. 15. Looke downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and behold from the habitation of thy holineſse and thy glory:</hi>
yea the throne of God is Gods holineſſe, <hi>Pſal. 47. 8. God ſitteth
upon the throne of his holineſſe;</hi> you know Kings upon their
thrones are exalted and lifted up, ſo is God lifted up upon the
throne of his holineſſe. <hi>Solomon,</hi> he made himſelfe a throne of
Ivory, and overlaid it with the beſt gold, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 18. But
the throne of God is a throne of holineſſe, a throne of bright
ſhining holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Again, when God reloyces in his people, he doth it as they
are a holy people, <hi>Deut. 7. 6. For thou art a holy people unto the
Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath choſen thee to be a peculiar
people unto himſelfe above all the people that are upon the face of the
earth.</hi> Yea further, you ſhall finde that this attribute of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is more eſpecially aſcribed to the third perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
God the Father is a holy God; the Son, he is the holy one
of God; but the Holy ghoſt hath his name from Holineſſe:
and tis very obſervable, that all the three perſons challenge an
equall ſhare in the working of holineſſe in the creature, it being
ſuch a part of Gods glory, that all the three perſons work it
whereſoever it is: as the Father, he is a Sanctifier. <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks
of the work of ſanctification wrought by God the Father in
the firſt verſe of his Epiſtle, <hi>To them that are ſanctified by God
the Father.</hi> And then for the Son, <hi>Eph. 5. 25, 26. Husbands, love
your wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelfe
for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by the Word.</hi> Chriſt he gives himſelfe for his Church; to
what end? Not that he might bring it to Heaven onely, but
that he might ſanctifie it alſo; and then the Spirit of God, 1
<hi>Cor. 6. 11. And ſuch were ſome of you: but ye are waſhed, but ye are
ſanctified, but ye are juſtified, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and
by the Spirit of our God.</hi> So that all the three perſons come in for
a ſhare in this work: this is the glorious work of Father, Son, and
Holy ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:40441:14"/>
But yet further for the demonſtration of it: holineſſe muſt
needs be the glory of God, becauſe it is the higheſt perfection
and rectitude of an Intelligent free Agent. An Intelligent free
Agent is the higheſt being of all, and holineſſe is the rectitude
of that being, and therefore muſt needs be glorious. Hence it
is, that grace is called Gods image, becauſe it is that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
God in his higheſt excellency: for that is properly an
Image of another thing, that ſets it out in the excellency of it:
if it doe it onely in a common and generall way, it is not an
Image of it. And then, in Scripture, holineſſe is called the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God, <hi>Pſalm. 27. 4. One thing have I deſired of the Lord, that
I will ſeeke after, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the dayes
of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his
Temple.</hi> Now what is Gods beauty but the beauty of holineſſe,
the holineſſe of God appearing in his Ordinances, and his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is the luſter and beauty of the infinite glory of God, as
<hi>Pſalm.</hi> 110. 3. the Ordinances are called the beauty of holineſſe:
<hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power in the beauties of
holineſſe,</hi> &amp;c. Yea holineſſe, ſome ſeeds of it, the very Image of
it, onely in the creature, is called the glory of God, <hi>Rom. 3.
23. All have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God;</hi> the very
beginnings of the work of holineſs in the hearts of Saints is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the glory of God; much more then the infinite holineſſe of
Gods own nature. Further, it is holineſſe that puts a luſter
upon all the other attributes of God, and makes them glorious
and honourable, <hi>Pſalm. 111. 9. Holy and reverend is his name;</hi> the
name of God is therefore reverend, becauſe holy; ſo take all
the height of excellencies that are in God, yet if they be ſuch as
you can conceive them ſeparated from his holineſſe, they doe
not make his name reverend: and this ſhewes how infinitely it
concernes us to labour after holineſſe; if all the excellencies of
God cannot make his name reverend, being ſeparated from holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
then let the creature have what excellency it wil, for parts,
for eſtate, for dignity, and honour in the world; take away holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
&amp; you cannot ſay reverend is his name; but, <hi>holy and reverend
is his name;</hi> ſo it is ſaid of God, his name is reverend, becauſe holy.</p>
               <p>Again, Gods name is glorious by holineſſe, becauſe it is the
ſpeciall end of all his works, to advance holineſſe: a workman
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40441:15"/>
when he drawes a worke, he ſhewes Art in the beginning of it:
but when he comes to the top of it, there he ſhewes the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of his workmanſhip: 'tis ſo with God, God will be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in all his workes, of creation and providence: but now
come to the height and pitch of all, and 'tis that he might be
honoured as a holy God; and that he might have a holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to honour him here, and to all eternity. I ſay holineſſe is
that which God aymed at in creating of heaven and earth; 'tis
that which God aymes at in all the wayes of his providence:
It is the great buſineſſe for which the ſon of God came into the
world, that he might redeem to himſelfe a people to ſerve him
in holineſſe: 'tis the end of the great councell of God from all
eternity; yea and that he might manifeſt the beauty of his own
holineſſe in thoſe two great attributes, Mercy and Juſtice,
which are the branches of his holineſſe, that he might make
them ſhine to all eternity: this is that God aymes at; therefore
holineſſe muſt needes be the glory of Gods name.</p>
               <p>Now a little for the third: but what is the reaſon that this
Title is given to God here in this Song of <hi>Moſes, glorious in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</hi>
the reaſon is this: to ſhew, that the infinite excellency of
Gods power is ſuch, that it is without any mixture of the leaſt
evill in the exerciſe of it: here was an act of mighty power put
forth, and God was infinitely holy in this act of his power. It
is otherwiſe with men (obſerve the difference between God and
man) It is a very hard thing for a man to doe great things,
and to manifeſt great power without a mixture of evill: as 'tis
with the waters, while they run ſhallow, they may run clearely:
but when once the waters riſe and overflow, they run muddy,
and uſually there is a great deale of filth comes in with great
ſtreames: ſo though in common and ordinary workes we doe
not manifeſt our uncleanneſſe, yet 'tis ſeldome when we ayme
to doe great things, but we manifeſt a great deale of filthineſſe:
but it is otherwiſe with God; God is great in power, and in that
keeps the glory of his holineſſe. And God manifeſted here the
greatneſſe of his wrath upon his enemies, and yet the glory of
his holineſſe too. It is a very hard thing for men to doe ſo; let
men have their anger ſtirr'd a little, O how much filth doe they
preſently diſcover? how many have we that all the while they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40441:15"/>
are pleaſed are exceeding meeke and loving, but let any thing
ſtirre their paſſion, and O what a great deale of filth appeares,
like a pond that is full of mud at the bottome, and cleare at
top, but ſtirre it a little and then its nothing but filth. A fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or a mother cannot tell how to be diſpleaſed with a childe
or correct it, but abundance of corruption comes with that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and ſo a governour a ſervant. Who can execute Juſtice upon
others, but there will be much of ſelf, ſelf-ends and ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;
but now here is the glory of God, that when he manifeſteth
his wrath, though it be ſore wrath, yet he is glorious in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in great wrath; he is infinitely powerfull in his wrath,
and in the execution of his Judgements, and yet infinite in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
too; therefore the vials of Gods wrath are ſaid to be of
gold, which is the pureſt mettall; ſo is God in the executing
of his Judgements. O let us labour to imitate God in this:
thou that haſt a paſſionate ſpirit, and art ſoon provoked, and
diſcovereſt abundance of filthineſſe, ſee how unlike thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God; though thou ſhouldeſt be diſpleaſed with that which is
ſinfull, and mayſt correct thy children and ſervants, yet be
ſure to keep that which is the beauty of all in thy correcting of
others, and that is holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, this Title is given to God here, becauſe in this great
worke of his he did manifeſt his faithfulneſſe in fulfilling of his
promiſes to his people; many promiſes God had made to his
Church for their preſervation and deliverance: and God in this
worke of his did fulfill theſe promiſes: now Gods faithfulneſſe
is a branch of his holineſſe; therefore becauſe he manifeſted his
faithfulneſſe in this worke, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the people extoll his
name by this Title, <hi>glorious in holineſſe.</hi> It is obſervable, and it
is of great uſe to us, that Gods faithfulneſſe is a branch of his
holineſſe: if you compare two Scriptures, you will finde it ſo;
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55. 3. ſayes God, <hi>I will make an everlaſting covenant with
you, even the ſure mercies of David.</hi> and this Scripture is quoted
<hi>Acts 13. 34. I will give you the ſure mercies of David:</hi> ſo we read it;
but in the originall it is <hi>the holy and faithfull things of David:</hi> ſo
that when God comes to ſhew mercy according to his word, he
doth manifeſt the glory of his holineſſe, and it is of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
uſe to Gods people to ſtrengthen their faith. You have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40441:16"/>
heard that the glory of God is his holineſſe, now one part of
this holineſſe is his faithfulneſſe, in fulfilling his promiſes to his
people: therefore it concernes God as he loves his own glory,
to be faithfull in fulfilling of his promiſes, and God lookes at
it as his glory to doe it; thy comforts are deere to thee, and thy
preſervation is deere to thee, but Gods glory is dearer to him,
yea Gods glory is dearer to him then thy ſoul, or thy eternall
eſtate can be to thee; and the top of Gods glory is his holineſſe;
and his holineſſe conſiſts in this (in one thing) his faithfulneſſe
in his promiſes.</p>
               <p>Now for the application of this, firſt: hence you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
whether ever you underſtood God aright or no; let me
put this queſtion to you, what is that excellency of God that
your ſoul cloſeth with? we ſpeak much of Gods excellency,
and we all ſay, we love God, and delight in God, and bleſſe
God; but now, what is it in God that drawes thy heart ſo to
him, and cauſeth thy ſoul to love thy God, and to bleſſe thy
God, and to delight in thy God (as thou ſayeſt) ſince the time
that ever thou kneweſt him? what, is it that God will ſhew
mercy to thee, and pardon thy ſinne, and ſave thy ſoul, and
bring thee to heaven? theſe are things indeed that we are to love
and bleſſe God for: but there muſt be more; it is the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of God himſelfe that our hearts muſt be taken with, and it
muſt be the perſon of God in his excellency: and what is that?
his holineſſe; therefore hath ever the luſter of the infinite holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of God ſhined upon thy heart, and drawne thy heart to
God, and cauſed thee to ſtand and adore him, and admire
him; and hath thy heart leaped upon the ſight of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his holineſſe? and doeſt thou therefore love him? if ſo,
thou knoweſt God aright and thy heart hath been aright drawn
to him: ſayes <hi>David, Pſalm. 119. 140. thy word is very pure, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy ſervant loves it.</hi> Canſt thou ſay ſo, O Lord, thou art
pure, thou art holy, therefore doth thy ſervant love thee; and
thy word is holy, and thy worſhip is holy, and thy ſervants are
holy, and thy Ordinances are holy, and therefore doth thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
love all theſe: for if the beauty of Gods holineſſe be that
which drawes thy heart forth in love unto God, then propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
it will be the beauty of holineſſe in all holy things
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40441:16"/>
that will draw thy heart to love and delight in them: then thou
wilt looke upon his Saints as glorious in holineſſe, and upon
his worſhip, and word, and Ordinances, as glorious in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and ſo thy heart will be drawn unto them. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 33. 21.
you ſhall ſee there how the Saints of God did rejoyce in the
Lord, and had their hearts drawn to him, becauſe of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
<hi>for our hearts ſhall rejoyce in him becauſe we have truſted in
his holy name:</hi> the truſting in Gods holy name, is that which
makes our hearts rejoyce in him.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, hence the people of God ſhould exceedingly
comfort themſelves in God; in that they have to deal with him
as a holy God: that though they meet with much unholineſſe
in the ſpirits of men with whom they doe converſe: yet there is
in God nothing but holineſſe, yea the very beauty and glory of
holineſſe: Brethren, it is a delightfull thing, yea a rare and a
bleſſed thing, to meet with a friend that hath a cleane and a
pure heart, that hath no mixture in him, that is holy in his
ends and aymes, and that hath a ſpirit free from guile: O what
rejoycing is there, when one friend that hath a heart pure and
cleane, and free from guile, can meet with another ſuch as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and can cloſe together in every point! but what a delight
then is it to meet with a God that is infinite in purity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
in whom there is no mixture at all! God he takes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in us, becauſe we have but ſome drops of his holineſſe. O
how ſhould we then rejoyce in him who is infinite in holineſſe:
Indeed when we deal with men, we doe not alwayes finde them
as we expect; we many times meet with men of excellent parts
and gifts; but when we come to cloſe with them we doe not
finde their wayes and ſpirits ſutable to the eminency and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of thoſe parts and gifts; and this is a grievous vexation
to the Saints, when they look upon men that are eminent and
excellent, and hope to finde a proportion of ſpirit ſutable
thereunto, but inſtead thereof finde abundance of filth in their
ſpirits; though this may trouble thee, yet bleſſe thy God in this
that when thou art to deal with God thou ſhalt finde nothing
but holineſſe in him, thou ſhalt finde him working according
to his excellency; for that I told you was the nature of Gods
holineſſe, 'tis the perfection of his will whereby he workes all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40441:17"/>
things ſutable to his eminency and excellency. Man hath an
excellency in him, but not alwayes grace in his heart to worke
ſutable to it; but God, I ſay, alwayes workes ſutable to his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
and excellency. Now when our hearts are raiſed with the
ſight of Gods excellency, and then thinke with our ſelves we
ſhall alwayes finde God working according to it, O what a
comfort is this to a gracious ſoul againſt all the evill he meets
with in the ſpirits of men, amongſt whom he converſeth?</p>
               <p>Againe, further for the comfort of the Saints, if God be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in holineſſe (then as in the former point, as there is none
like to God, ſo there is none like to his people; for as a mans
god is, ſo is he,) ſo are the Saints glorious in holineſſe too;
for that which can make an infinite God glorious, muſt needes
make a poor worme a glorious creature. It is true, that which
will make a poor man glorious, will not make a King glorious,
but that which will make a King glorious muſt needs make a
begger glorious: now holineſſe puts a luſter and glory upon
the divine nature it ſelfe, upon the infinite God: ſo that if thou
have it, it muſt needs put a glory upon thee: therefore it is
obſervable, that the communication of Gods holineſſe to us is
expreſt in another way then when he communicates any other
attribute to us: when God communicates his knowledge to us,
we are not ſaid to partake of the divine nature by it; and ſo his
power, and the like: but when he communicates his holineſſe
to us, we are then ſaid to be made partakers of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
the holineſſe of the Saints is the ſame with Gods holineſſe;
as it were a beame of his: ſo ſayes the Scripture, <hi>Heb. 12. 10. He
chaſtneth us for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſſe.</hi>
Marke, <hi>his holineſſe:</hi> and therefore it puts a wonderfull glory and
excellency upon us; for it enables us to worke as God, and to
live as God: for what is Gods holineſſe, as I ſaid before, but
that whereby he workes to himſelfe as his laſt end, ſutable to
his own excellency? ſo the Saints come to worke to God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their meaſure, as their laſt end, ſutable to the infinite
excellency of God himſelfe: and ſo they live as God lives and
worke as God workes, and ſo are fitted to have communion
with God; as the life of a plant makes it not fit to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with beaſts: nor the life of beaſts with men: nor men
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40441:17"/>
with the life of God. Now holineſſe is the higheſt life of all
beings, being the life of God: and therefore fits for communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God: for in communion there muſt be the ſame life:
therefore no creature can have communion with God, that
doth not live the ſame life that God doth: but if thou partakeſt
of holineſſe, thou liveſt the life that God doth, and ſo art fit to
have communion with God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Further, it puts not onely a glory upon thy perſon, but upon
all thou haſt and doeſt: it ſanctifies all; as the gold was ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Altar: ſo the very naturall actions, and the wayes
of Gods common providence, are ſanctified to Gods people:
there is a luſter upon all the good they enjoy, by vertue of that
holineſs which God puts in them: as Gods holineſs puts a luſter
upon all his attributes, ſo holineſſe in the Saints puts a luſter
upon their parts, names, eſtates, converſe with others; there is
a beauty upon all by holineſſe; take a man that hath excellent
naturall parts, if he have no holineſſe, there is no luſter and
beauty in him: but take a man that hath able parts, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
too, O the luſter that then appeares in him.</p>
               <p>Againe, holineſſe is the very principle of eternall life, the
very beginning of eternall life in the heart, and that which
will certainly grow up to eternall life. Againe, holineſſe is the
proper object of Gods delight; God delights not in the legs of
a man, but in his holineſſe; let a man be what he will, if God
ſee any impreſſion of holineſſe in him, the ſoul of God cloſeth
with that ſoul.</p>
               <p>Further, holineſſe is that which is the ſeparation of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for God, and eternall life: there is (you know) a twofold
ſeparation of a creature for God: you have the expreſſion,
<hi>Pſalm. 4. 3. The Lord hath ſet apart him that is godly for himſelfe:</hi>
he is ſet apart paſſively; and then he hath an active principle to
ſet apart himſelfe for God. God in his eternall election ſets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
thoſe he intends to ſave for himſelfe; here are thoſe, ſayes
God, that I have ſet apart from the common lumpe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
to magnifie the riches of my grace upon, and to live with
me to all eternity. If God ſhould now look from heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a man or woman in the congregation, and ſay, Be it known
to all the word that I from eternity have ſet apart ſuch a man
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40441:18"/>
and woman, to glorifie them with my ſelfe for ever: every one
would look upon ſuch a man and woman as glorious creatures
indeed: but now know, that if God hath ſtampt the image of
his holineſſe upon thee, thou haſt as much honour from God,
as if he ſhould thus ſpeak to thee: and in ſome reſpects more:
for if God ſhould declare, that from all eternity thou art ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from the creature for God, this were glorious; but when
God hath put a principle of his own ſpirit into thee, to enable
thee to ſet apart thy ſelfe, and to conſecrate thy ſelfe, and thy
all to God, this is more: for in the other thou art but paſſive,
in this thou art active: As on the contrary, there is more
dreadfull evill in unholineſſe then in reprobation; men are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of reprobation, that God ſhould ſet them apart from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
to magnifie the glory of his Juſtice upon them; and 'tis
true, this is terrible: but while thou apprehendeſt this as terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
thou thy ſelfe art active in that which is more terrible;
that is, by the filthineſſe and wickedneſſe of thy heart and life,
thou doſt actively ſet thy ſelfe apart for eternall wrath and
miſery: the other is paſſive, and thou art onely ſet apart: but
in the wickedneſſe of thy heart thou art active, and ſetſt thy
ſelfe apart: For as holineſſe is the dedication of the creature
to God, the ſeparation of it from all other things unto God by
an active principle; ſo on the contrary, ſinne is the ſeparation of
the creature by an active principle from God to all miſery. I
thought to have enlarged my ſelfe in comparing the glory and
happineſſe of the Saints, and the miſery of the wicked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but time will not give leave.</p>
               <p>Further, as holineſſe makes the name of God to be reverend,
ſo holineſſe in the Saints puts a reverend reſpect upon them in
the very conſciences of wicked men: take the vileſt of wicked
men, though they cry out of thee; yet know, if thou walkeſt
ſtrictly, thy cloſe walking with God will gaine reſpect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
from their hearts, in ſpite of their hearts. And the
reaſon why the people of God gaine not reſpect and eſteeme,
is, becauſe they doe not walke ſtrictly; many men miſtake
themſelves: they thinke that ſtrictneſſe is ſlighted and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and therefore they begin to leſſen and abate in their exact
walking: but this makes them diſeſteemed; and it is juſt with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40441:18"/>
God it ſhould be ſo: doth the abating of holineſſe helpe thee
to a reverend reſpect? no, walke more cloſely with God, and
thou wilt have reſpect from mens conſciences: doe what they
can, thou wilt anger their luſt; but thou wilt convince their
conſciences: and in their moſt ſerious mood they will ſay, O
that my ſoul were in this mans ſouls ſtead: and how often doe
they ſay ſo on their death bed? and if holineſſe put an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
and glory upon low and meane things, as in the law
what a glory did it put upon a piece of Wood, or Leather, or
Braſſe, when once it was conſecrated to a holy uſe? becauſe
that was Gods Ordinance, God did put it in it, and not man:
for a man to thinke it is in the power of his will to make God
eſteem, or that others in reference unto God ſhould eſteeme of
a creature, more then what God hath put into it, is a great
miſtake: that common ſtones by my will ſhould be holy, and
conſecrated to God, and muſt not be medled with, that I ſhould
put a divine excellency upon that which hath onely a naturall
excellency in it; what a boldneſſe would this be in me: but
now, if Gods Ordinance be ſo, then there is a glory put upon
it, as in the Temple, becauſe it was dedicated to God by divine
inſtitution, there the very wood, and braſſe, and every thing
had an excellency upon it. Now I would argue thus, ſhall cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
holineſſe put ſuch an excellency upon a piece of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!
what then ſhall the image of God put upon an immortall
ſoul!</p>
               <p>A further uſe ſhould have been this, If God be glorious in
holineſſe, then certainly (brethren) God will maintaine holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the world: and this is one reaſon amongſt others, of
this Title given to God here, becauſe he did worke for his
Church: God will honour his own Ordinances and worſhip,
and will maintaine his Saints that are holy; <hi>preſerve me O Lord</hi>
(ſayes <hi>David) for I am holy: and thou wilt not give thy holy one to
ſee corruption.</hi> If thou beeſt Gods holy one, he will not leave thee
to the power of corruption, he will defend thee and maintaine
thee: therefore ſayes the Pſalmiſt in <hi>Pſalm. 68. 35. O God thou
art terrible out of thy holy places;</hi> what are there any that will be
injurious to Gods people when they are in the way of his holy
worſhip? God will be terrible out of his holy places unto ſuch;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40441:19"/>
theſe expreſſions are againſt the enemies of God, becauſe it is
the holineſſe of God, and the people of Gods holineſſe that
they ſet themſelves againſt. And let all men take heed what
they doe in oppoſing the Saints, and the wayes of Gods holy
worſhip; for God will maintaine holineſſe: therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
us all to honour holineſſe our ſelves, and to ſet up the
glory of Gods holineſſe as much as we can in the world. O let
us labour all to be holy, as our heavenly Father is holy: let
that be our prayer, <hi>Pſalm. 90. 17. Let the beauty of the Lord our
God be upon us.</hi> O grow up more in holineſſe, which is the
beauty of God: converſe much with God, that thou may eſt be
holy: when <hi>Moſes</hi> was forty dayes in the Mount converſing with
God, he came downe with his face ſhining: and certainly,
thoſe people that converſe much with God will have their faces
ſhine with holineſſe: there is much to be had in converſing
with God, who is a holy God. And ſhew forth the beauty of
holineſſe in thy converſation, that others may ſay, if one beame
of holineſſe be ſo delightful in ſuch a man or woman, O how
glorious in holineſſe then is God himſelfe! I remember what a
heathen ſaid of the God of the Chriſtians, when he ſaw the
courage of the Chriſtians, certainely (ſayes he) the God of the
Chriſtians is a great God: why let us walke ſo holily before
others that they may read holineſſe in our converſations, and
be forced to ſay, certainly the God of this people is a holy God:
Eſpecially looke to thy heart to cleanſe that when thou draweſt
neere to this holy God, in this holy worſhip, then labour to
ſanctifie his name; looke to thy feet, come not in thy filth into
the preſence of ſo holy a God; 'tis a notable expreſſion of
<hi>Joſhua, Joſhua</hi> 24. 19. when the people ſay, <hi>we will ſerve the Lord,
for he is our God:</hi> ſayes <hi>Joſhua, you cannot ſerve the Lord, for he is
an holy God, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, it is another manner of
buſineſſe to ſerve the Lord then you thinke for, for you have to
deal with a holy God, and 'tis not externall worſhip will ſerve
his turne. It is an argument people doe not know God, when
they can turne his ſervice off ſo ſlightly: the ſight of God
would put thee into another frame; didſt thou know God in
his holineſſe, thou wouldſt look upon the ſervice of God as a
great ſervice; thou ſerveſt a holy God, as they ſay, <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 6. 20.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40441:19"/>
who can ſtand before this holy God? ſo, didſt thou apprehend
God to be a holy God, thy heart would be ſtricken with feare
and awe, and thou wouldſt ſay, who can ſtand before this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God? <hi>God is greatly to be feared in the aſſembly of the Saints,
and to be had in reverence of thoſe that are round about him, Pſalm.
89.</hi> 7. God is to be had in reverence of all men; but if you come
neer to him, certainly then you muſt labour to ſanctifie your
hearts. How canſt thou come before the luſter and beauty of
Gods holineſſe with wilfull uncleanneſſe in thy heart? that
Text in <hi>Job</hi> is very remarkable <hi>Job 13. 11. Shall not his excellency
make you afraid?</hi> You have heard that Gods holineſſe is his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency:
now I ſay, to thee that haſt to deal with him, ſhall
not his excellency make thee afraid? art thou conſcious of thy
uncleanneſſe and doeſt thou come into the preſence of a holy
God and not feare and tremble before him? O bold daring
heart that thou haſt, that canſt come into the preſence of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God with an unholy heart, and not tremble: it would be
of admirable uſe in all our dealings with God, to have cleare
apprehenſions of his holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, labour to magnifie God this way: as God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in holineſſe, ſo ſet him out in his glory by keeping his
worſhip pure. It is a ſpeciall thing God lookes at, that we take
heed what we doe in defiling of his worſhip. Gods Ordinances
are the beauty of his holineſſe, therefore we muſt labour to
come pure and cleane unto them: 'tis that which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
his Church, to keep the veſſels of his ſanctuary holy,
and thoſe are the ordinances: and we are unfaithfull in our
charge, if we doe not keep the ordinances holy: in <hi>Exod. 20.
24.</hi> 25. God gives them charge there to make him an Altar: but
ſayes God, <hi>If thou wilt make me an Alter of ſtone, thou ſhalt not
build it of hewen ſtone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou haſt
polluted it.</hi> What, might they ſay, ſhall we have an Altar of rude
ſtone? ſhall we not poliſh and make it fine and ſumptuous?
will not that make it more ſpecious to look upon? no, ſayes
God; if you lift up a tool upon it you pollute it. We are apt to
thinke, that ſuch and ſuch mixtures of men, and ſuch and ſuch
ceremonies would make the worſhip of God glorious; but this
is a great miſtake. It is a uſuall thing for whores to paint their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40441:20"/>
faces; they will not be content with their naturall beauty,
but are more pompous in their apparell then the chaſt Matrons
are. It is ſo with the whore of <hi>Babylon:</hi> how glorious are they in
all their worſhip? and what ſtrange things have they to take the
outward ſenſes? they are faine to dreſſe and trick up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
having not the purity of Gods worſhip: but certainely
theſe things defile the worſhip of God: compare two Texts for
this, <hi>Iſai. 44, 9. They that make a graven Image are all of them va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and their delectable things ſhall not profit:</hi> marke, the Images
of Idolaters are delectable things in their eſteeme: but ſee what
God ſpeakes of them, <hi>Ezek. 7. 20. As for the beauty of his orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he ſet it in Majeſty: but they made the Images of their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
and of their deteſtable things therein.</hi> They call them
delectable things, but God accounts them deteſtable: but when
God ſpeakes of his own ordinances, he ſayes, as for the beauty
of his ornament he ſet it in Majeſty. O the worſhip of God in
the plainneſs and ſimplicity of the Goſpell it is the ornament of
God, the beauty of his ornament, and the beauty of his orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſet in Majeſty: what phraſes are here? this is Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
but if man mix any thing of his own in Gods worſhip, it
is deteſtable to God: therefore if we would honour and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
God in his holineſſe, let us keep pure his worſhip; for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
becomes the worſhip of God for ever.</p>
               <p>And then the conſideration of this ſhould humble us, and
make us aſhamed, for the remainder of all that unholineſſe that
is in our hearts; the ſight of Gods holineſſe made <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cry
out, <hi>Iſaiab 6. 5. Woe is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of
uncleane lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a people of uncleane lips,
for mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of hoſts.</hi> And certainely
there is nothing in the world hath that power to humble the
heart ſo as Gods holineſſe: and then is your heart humbled
for ſinne aright, when you look upon it as that which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the pure nature of God. I am not onely troubled for my
ſinne becauſe I am afraid it will bring hell along with it, but
becauſe I have had a ſight of the infinite holineſſe of God, and
the purity of his nature: and O that I ſhould have a nature ſo
filthy, and oppoſite to that infinite holineſſe of his. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
examine your hearts whether your humiliation be right or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40441:20"/>
no; and this is one good argument, when the infinite holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of God hath made you ſee your uncleanneſſe, and upon
that hath humbled you.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, what need have we all of Jeſus Chriſt! if God be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in holineſſe, we ſhould all of us ſay, who can ſtand before
ſo holy a God! were it not for the holineſſe of the bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
who ſtands between the father and us, and preſents his
infinite ſatisfaction to the father for our ſinnes, and clothes us
with his righteouſneſſe, woe, woe unto us: if you could
poſſibly imagine that all the excellencies of heaven and earth
were put into one creature, except holineſſe, yet if that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had but the leaſt drop of uncleanneſſe and unholineſſe in
it, God would eternally hate that creature; and were there not
a mediator between that creature and God, God would eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
let out his wrath upon it: for God is ſo glorious in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that he doth infinitely hate filthineſſe: we wonder to heare
of ſuch great miſery threatned to wicked men, but we ſhould
not wonder, did we know Gods holineſſe: God doth ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
hate ſinne that he did inſtantly ſend all the Angels that
fell, downe in chaines of eternall darkneſſe, and refuſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the leaſt parly with them, or to be reconciled to them
for ever. Now what is the reaſon, that though we have ſo much
uncleanneſſe in us, yet God is pleaſed to be reconciled to us,
and to admit us into his preſence, and give us hopes to ſee his
face with joy to all eternity? 'tis this, becauſe we have a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
and they have none: were it not for that, could we weep
ſtreames of blood from our eyes, yet God would hate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
us, and his wrath would eternally ſeize upon us. And
therefore, though you may rejoyce in inherent holineſſe, yet
let your hearts eſpecially be upon the perfect holineſſe of Jeſus
Chriſt, and tender up that to God: and though thou haſt much
uncleanneſſe in thy ſelfe and in thy duties (for alas what is it
for us to tender duty to the holy God) yet let this comfort
thee, thou haſt not to deal with God in thy ſelfe, but through
Chriſt; and in him thou haſt liberty to come, and mayeſt look
upon Gods face with boldneſſe; this is the great miſtery of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
revealed in the Goſpell, that notwithſtanding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſſe
of Gods holineſſe, yet there ſhould be a way for us
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40441:21"/>
polluted creatures to looke upon this God with joy. This
myſtery is onely taught in the Goſpel. Though men now thinke
they can come and cry to God for mercy; yet hereaafter when
God ſhal let out the brightneſſe of his holineſſe to thee, and thou
comeſt to ſee thy uncleanneſſe, then thy heart will ſinke down in
eternall deſpaire; thou wilt not endure to behold God then: And
if thou beeſt not acquainted with God in this way of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
thou art undone for ever; therefore ſtudy the myſtery
of the Goſpell, and make uſe of Chriſt, that the glory of Gods
holineſſe may not be to thy terrour, but to thy comfort.</p>

               <p>IT is not long ſince (as ſome of you may remember) that
in this place that ſubject was handled of the Saints enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, to be <hi>all in all,</hi> out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. v. 28. and then I
told you we had ſuch an expreſſion in Scripture but onely
twice: applyed to God in the happineſſe of the Saints enjoyment
of him in heaven, and applyed here to Chriſt, of what Chriſt
is to them for the preſent. That which was handled about
Gods being <hi>all in all,</hi> is the end: this that is to be delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Chriſt being <hi>all in all,</hi> is that which brings the ſoul to
that bleſſed end. Wherefore then, as Chriſt him ſelfe ſayes, <hi>John
14. 1. Yee believe in God, believe alſo in me:</hi> So I ſay, as God ſhall
be all in all eternally to the Saints, doe you believe in that?
believe alſo in this, that I am to deliver to you this day, <hi>that
Chriſt, he is all and in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a choſen veſſell to beare the
name of Chriſt, to carry it up and downe in the world: and
indeed his ſpirit was full of Chriſt, he deſired to know nothing
but Chriſt, to Preach nothing but Chriſt, to be found in none
but Chriſt; the very name of Chriſt was delightfull to him:
he ſeekes in all his Epiſtles to magnifie Chriſt, and in theſe
words (that I have read unto you) he doth omnifie Chriſt;
he makes him not onely great, but makes him all. <hi>There is
neither Greeke nor Jew, circumciſion nor uncircumciſion, Barbarian,
Scythian, bond nor free, but Chriſt is all &amp; in all:</hi> that is, there is no
priviledge in the one to commend them to God, and no want
of any thing in the other to hinder them from God; let men
be what they will in their outward reſpects, what is that to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40441:22"/>
God? let them be never ſo mean in regard of all outwards,
that cannot hinder them from the enjoyment of God: for God
lookes not at theſe things, <hi>but Chriſt is all and in all to them;</hi> ſo
farre as <hi>God</hi> ſeeth Chriſt in any, he accepts of them: if Chriſt
be not there, whatever they have, he regards them not. Chriſt
<hi>is all in all,</hi> even in the eſteeme of the Father himſelfe: he was
the delight of the father from all eternity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30. and the
father tooke infinite contentment in him upon his willingneſſe
to undertake this bleſſed worke of the redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.
God the father is infinitely ſatisfied in Chriſt, he is all
in all to him: Surely if Chriſt be an object ſufficient for the
ſatisfaction of the father, much more then is he an object ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for the ſatisfaction of any ſoul.</p>
               <p>But that which is the maine ſcope here of the holy Ghoſt in
this high expreſſion of Chriſts tranſcendent excellency (that I
may come preſently to it) I ſhall deliver it in this doctrinall
propoſition, <hi>That Chriſt is the onely meanes of conveighance of all
good that God the father intends to communicate unto the children of
men, in order to eternall life; he is all, and in all.</hi> This that I am
now to Preach unto you, namely, Gods communicating of
himſelfe in his mercy to mankinde, through a mediatour, it
is the very ſum of the Goſpell, the great myſtery of godlineſſe,
'tis the chiefe part of the minde and counſell of God, that he
would have made knowne to the children of men in this world.
This is the great embaſſage that the miniſters of the Goſpell
have to bring unto the ſons and daughters of men, and 'tis the
moſt abſolutely neceſſary point in all Divinity.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe in the firſt hearing of it, every one yeilds to the
truth of it; 'tis true you will ſay, we can have no good from
God, but in and by Chriſt. Well, there is a great deal in that
you ſay, when you ſay all muſt come from God in Chriſt: in
all your prayers and petitions you uſually conclude them
through Jeſus Chriſt; but certainely this is many times ſpoken
when we ſee little of the glory of God that there is in ſuch an
expreſſion: and that which I ſhall this day endeavour, ſhall be
to ſhew you ſomewhat of the glory of God ſhining in this truth
that God doth communicate himſelfe through a mediatour,
through his ſon. This is the great point of Divinity that is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40441:22"/>
neceſſary to be known to eternall life: it is poſſible to
be ignorant of many other truths, and yet be ſaved; but there
muſt be ſome knowledge of this, or there can be no ſalvation:
the miſtake in this very thing is the miſcarriage, and the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
undoing of thouſand thouſands of ſouls; many there are
who believe that they have need of, and can never be ſaved but
by Gods mercy, and this the light of nature convinceth us of:
but that God is to communicate his mercy through a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
this they are ignorant of, and ſee not into the reallity of
this truth; and miſcarry and periſh eternally with cryes to
God for mercy, becauſe they come to God, but not through a
mediator. This is the ſum of the Goſpell, and the moſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
truth revealed in all the book of God. It is a truth
that was hidden almoſt from all the world for many ages; the
Scripture ſaith, <hi>The Princes of the world knew it not.</hi> A truth we
are not able to underſtand any thing of by the light of nature.
1 <hi>Cor. 1. 21. The world by wiſdome knew not God,</hi> that is, by all
their arts and ſciences, by all their naturall wiſedome, they
knew not God ſavingly; they did not know God in Chriſt.
There is no footſteps of this truth in all the works of creation
or providence; therefore in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 8. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, he was
appointed to Preach <hi>the unſearchable riches of Chriſt;</hi> that riches
that hath no footſteps: that is the propriety of the word; there
is no footſteps of the riches of the Goſpell in the creature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you cannot trace it there; whereas many other points of
religion have many footſteps in the creature, and by the light of
nature much may be diſcovered about God: as that all our
good conſiſts in communion with God, that when we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
God, we muſt ſeek to him for pardon and mercy, and the
like: But that God communicates himſelf through Chriſt, and
that not one drop of mercy in order to eternal life can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
from God, but through Chriſt the mediator, of this
there is not one foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep in all the works of God.</p>
               <p>This is that which is ſo ſupernaturall, that 'tis above per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
nature. <hi>Adam</hi> knew nothing of this in his perfect eſtate.
Yea this is that which the Angels themſelves deſire to pry into,
looking upon it as a mighty depth. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 12. the Angels
<hi>ſtoop downe</hi> (for ſo the word ſignifieth) 'tis as if a thing ſhould
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40441:23"/>
lye in a deep pit, and when any would ſee it, they ſtoop down
with their bodies to pry into the pit: thats the propriety of
the word: ſo the Angels they ſee a mighty depth in the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Goſpell, and they ſtoop downe to pry into it, that
they may know what it is. Yea this is that which requires a
worke of the ſpirit, beyond the ordinary work of the ſpirit of
God, to reveale it to the ſoul, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. ſpeaking there of
the Myſtery of the Goſpell, ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>The ſpirit that
ſearcheth the deep things of God, &amp;c.</hi> diſcovers this; that is the
ſpirit of God in an extraordinary worke of his, as he is a ſpirit
ſearching the deep things of God, ſo he is a diſcovering ſpirit
of this truth unto us: and therefore ſeeing it is thus, it is not
ſo light to be paſt over. I, you will ſay, 'tis true, all muſt come
through Jeſus Chriſt: well, you ſee a little at firſt, but there is
much more in this truth then we are aware of. 'Tis a truth that
is the moſt profitable of all the truths contained in the book of
God: there is no growing up in godlineſſe till we come to
know God in Chriſt: the knowledge of God is ſomething to
worke upon the heart, and many labour againſt their ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſee it is againſt the law of God, and ſet upon duties
becauſe God requires them; and this is well; but till they come
to underſtand indeed the myſtery of the Goſpell, of Gods let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelfe out unto his people through a mediator, they
doe but bungle in the wayes of godlineſſe, they doe not thrive
and grow up in them; and therefore theſe Chriſtians that
live under ſuch a miniſtry, where though they have many good
truths revealed to them, yet having but little of the myſtery
of Chriſt, as the mediator, their way of Chriſtianity is very
low, they doe not ſanctifie God in their converſation. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
a ſpeech that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> hath when they would have had
him write againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> and promiſed him a great Biſhopricke
for it; he anſwers, <hi>Luther is greater then that I can write againſt
him; for I am inſtructed more in one ſmall page of Luther, then out of
whole Thomas Aquinas,</hi> that was the great Schoolman. So cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the underſtanding but ſome one truth, ſome one ſentence
in the myſtery of the Goſpell, in this way of Gods communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of himſelfe unto us through his Chriſt, doth inſtruct the
ſoul, and cauſe it to thrive and grow up in godlineſſe abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40441:23"/>
more then thouſands of Sermons about meere morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and you have a moſt admirable Text for this, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17.
and ſo on, <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye
being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with
all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height,
and to know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge:</hi> marke what
followes, <hi>That yee might be filled with all the fulneſſe of God, v.</hi> 19.
By coming to know God in Chriſt, that is, to know Chriſt to
be the way of Gods communicating himſelfe unto us, we come
to be filled with all the fulneſſe of God: many Chriſtians their
hearts are very ſcant and empty, there is not a fulneſſe in their
ſpirits; and all becauſe they know ſo little of God in Chriſt, in
this myſtery of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there is no truth revealed in all the Scriptures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we can honour God ſo much as by this: this indeed is the
great honour that God would have in the world, to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his Son, and in the great deſigne he hath of bringing
forth glorious things by his Son: and therefore though we
know never ſo much of God, and would honour him meerely
as the Creator of heaven and earth, yet God doth not accept
of that honour, that is but to honour him in a naturall way;
we never know what it is to honour God aright, ſo as to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of him, till we come to honour him in an Evangelicall
way, to honour him in his Son: and yet the greateſt honour
he hath from moſt in the world, yea from multitudes in the
very Church of God, that heare the myſtery of Chriſt opened
to them, is tendred up to him meerly in a naturall way, and
not in this ſpirituall Evangelicall ſervice of God. You ſee now
the conſequence of the point, let us then fall to it.</p>
               <p>And Firſt I ſhall ſhew you the truth of it in Scripture.</p>
               <p>And Secondly how it comes to paſſe that there can be no
good communicated to us from God in order to eternall life
but by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And Thirdly, how Chriſt comes to be the meanes and way
of conveighance of all good unto us from his father.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I ſhall inſtance in ſome ſpeciall things, great things
wherein moſt of the goodneſſe of God is communicated to us,
and ſhew you how in them Chriſt is all in all to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:40441:24"/>
And Fifthly the reaſons why God will have this way of
communication of himſelfe unto us through his Son, why he
will not communicate himſelfe immediatly to us, but through
a mediator; theſe are the five things for the doctrinall part.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, the courſe of Scripture eſpecially of the new
Teſtament runs this way; you know that of Chriſt, <hi>John 14. 6.
I am the way, the truth and the life; no man cometh unto the father
but by me;</hi> there is no coming to the Father but by Chriſt,
and Chriſt <hi>he is the way:</hi> and that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. at the latter
end, ſayes the Apoſtle there: <hi>All things are yours, whether Paul,
or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things preſent,
or things to come, all are yours.</hi> How is that? marke, <hi>All are
yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods:</hi> God the Father
he is the principle of all good; all firſtly comes from him, but
it comes not from him immediatly: he doth not ſay, all are
yours, for ye are Gods; becauſe you have an intereſt in God,
therefore all comes to be yours: no, <hi>but all are yours, and you
are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods;</hi> ſo that you ſee here how that
Chriſt comes between yours and Gods.</p>
               <p>All good is in God, true; but how ſhall we come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of that good? there is ſuch a diſtance between theſe two
terms, yours and Gods, that were not Chriſt in the middle, they
would never come together. Yea, but Chriſts coming between,
and joyning them together, then <hi>all are yours, becauſe yee are
Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods;</hi> ſo that we may take the intent of
the Holy Ghoſt here, in this ſimilitude (though it be too low
for the great myſtery we are about to expreſſe.) Conceive
God the father as the fountaine of all good, and Chriſt as it
were the Ciſterne: and then from him, pipes conveiged to
every believer; and faith, that ſucks at the mouth of every
pipe, and drawes from God, but it comes from God through
Chriſt. The Father he fills the Son with all good, and ſo it
comes from the Father through the Son by faith unto the ſoul
of every beliver: we have a notable expreſſion further of this
myſtery in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> in the ſecond and third
Chapters, in Chapter 2. verſ. 12, having told them that they
had been <hi>without hope, and without God in the world;</hi> but ſaith he
verſ. 13. <hi>Ye who ſometimes were farre off, are made nigh by the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40441:24"/>
blood of Chriſt:</hi> It is by the blood of Chriſt that you have any
thing to doe with God; but eſpecially in <hi>Epheſ. 3. 12. In whom
we have boldeneſſe and acceſſe with confidence by the faith of him;
in whom?</hi> in Chriſt, we come to have boldneſſe and acceſſe:
<hi>boldneſſe,</hi> the word ſignifies liberty of ſpeech that we can come
with liberty of ſpeech before God, and we have <hi>acceſſe:</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nudction,
we are led by the hand of Chriſt to the father, there
is no coming to the father but by Chriſt, and Chriſt he takes
a believer by the hand and leads him to the father, and ſo he
comes to have boldneſſe: as if a Traytor ſhould be baniſhed,
the Court, and afterward the Prince ſhould be a meanes of his
reconciliation with the King, and comes and takes the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
by the hand, and ſayes to him, come, I will lead you in
my hand to my father, and though you have provoked him, yet
being in my hand, you need not be afraid, but may goe to
him with boldneſſe and confidence. Juſt the meaning of the
Text here, <hi>In Chriſt we have boldneſſe and acceſſe with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi>
and although before there was a dreadfull breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the father and us, yet being led by the hand of Chriſt,
there is acceſſe and freedome of ſpeech for us: well the truth
is cleare enough in the whole tenour of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>If you would know now how it comes to paſſe, that though
God be in himſelfe the fountaine of all goodneſſe and infinite
mercy; that yet there is ſuch a ſtoppage as it were that there
is not one drop of this mercy can be communicated to the
children of men but this way? that although we have to
deal with God, who in his owne nature is infinitely merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
yet ſuch is the caſe with man, and ſuch are the termes
between God and man, that there is not, I ſay, one drop of
this infinite ocean can be expected to come for ever from
God, but onely this way, It comes to paſſe thus:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe of the breach of the firſt covenant that God
made with mankinde; for onely men and Angels, the humane
and angelical nature, are capable of a covenant with God,
to ſpeak of a covenant properly: and becauſe they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of this way of Gods proceeding with them, God would
goe according to the nature of his creature; and therefore
at firſt makes a covenant with them, and intended to convey
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40441:25"/>
and communicate his goodneſſe to them by that convenant;
now this covenant being broken, and ſo there being a breach
between God and man, there is a ſtoppage made by vertue of
that breach: So that there is no good now to be had by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the firſt covenant: and unleſſſe there be a ſecond, there
can be no good at all expected; the firſt being broken, and we
being loſt by that.</p>
               <p>And further, there is ſuch an infinite diſtance between God
and us, that there can be no coming together; and that not
ſo much in regard of Gods excellency in himſelfe, and our
meaneſſe, that we are ſuch poor low creatures, as in regard
of the infiniteneſſe of his holineſſe, and our uncleaneſſe and
ſinfulneſſe, this makes the diſtance.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there is the ſtrength of the law; the curſe of the
law is upon every ſoul naturally, and that ſtops: there was
never veſſel ſtopt cloſer to be kept from having a drop of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
poured into it, then the curſe of the law is cloſe upon
every ſoul, to keep mercy from it, ſo farre as God looks upon
it meerly in its naturals, and not through his Son.</p>
               <p>Then there are the cryes of infinite Juſtice againſt men,
which muſt have ſatisfaction: and till Juſtice be ſatisfied mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
ſtirres not, unleſſe it be in a way of providing ſatisfaction
unto Juſtice: ſo that put theſe together, the breach of the firſt
covenant, the diſtance between God and man in regard of
Gods holineſſe and mans ſinfulneſſe, the power of the curſe of
the law upon man, and the cryes of divine Juſtice, that will
never be quiet till it hath received ſatisfaction: theſe things
being rightly apprehended, we may come to ſee that we are
farre off from receiving mercy from God, though he be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
fountaine of mercy, except there be ſome ſtrange way of
conveying it to us. We know, according to Gods dealing with
the fallen Angels, there is no way of conveying mercy to
them, but they are left to periſh for ever: if the thouſands of
Angels that fell from God ſhould be thouſands of thouſands
of yeares crying out for mercy, they could not obtain one
drop: why? becauſe there is no mediator between God and
them; and it would have been our caſe with them, had there
not been a mediator between God and us. Many thinke
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40441:25"/>
if they are ſenſible of their ſinnes, and can believe that
God is infinitely mercifull, they ſhall do well enough: but I
muſt tell you, that though there be infinite mercy in God, yet
if thou haſt no intereſt in Chriſt, thou mayeſt be undone for
ever.</p>
               <p>But how is Chriſt all in all to us in Gods communication of
good to us?</p>
               <p>The firſt ground of all is the covenant that God the Father
made with his Son from all eternity. Therefore in <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 2.
the Apoſtle ſpeakes of <hi>the promiſe that was before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</hi>
Now this promiſe can be meant onely of that covenant
that paſt between the Father and the Son: and therefore ſayes
the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 9. 10. Eye hath not ſeen, nor eare heard,
neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
prepared for them which love him: but the ſpirit which ſearcheth all
things, yea the deep things of God, he hath revealed them unto us,</hi>
that is, the ſpirit of God in the Goſpel diſcovers what were the
eternal thoughts and purpoſes of God concerning us, and what
the tranſactions were between the Father and the Son in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to man-kind before the world was. The covenant now
being between the Father and the Son, and the Father requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in this Covenant ſatisfaction to infinite divine juſtice,
Chriſt he yeilds to this.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the ſecond place, Chriſt he actually comes
to be the way of conveyance, by taking our nature upon him,
and ſo makes us reconcilable to God, by taking humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into ſuch a neer union to the divine nature, to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
perſon in the Trinity; ſo as that there ſhould be but
one <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but one perſon in them both, that there ſhould be
a perſonall union, which is the great myſtery of the Goſpell.
There are two great myſteries in the Goſpell; the one, that
there ſhould be divers perſons in one nature; and this is the
myſtery of the Trinity: the other that there ſhould be divers
natures in one perſon; and this is the myſtery of the hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
union of our nature with Chriſt. So that Chriſt taking
mans nature into ſuch a neer union to himſelfe, it was a
mighty preparative for God to have thoughts of peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
humane nature, rather then to the Angels: and it was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40441:26"/>
one part of his humility, and therefore hath a meritorious
efficiency in this worke of reconciling God to man. But this
was not ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the third place, Chriſt was content now to
come into the world, and be made the head of a ſecond cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
between God and mankinde; to performe what ever
God the Father ſhould require, for the ſatisfaction of divine
Juſtice: ſo that, look as <hi>Adam</hi> by being the head of the firſt
covenant, was the meanes of conveying all evill to us: ſo
Chriſt by being the head of the ſecond covenant, is the
meanes of conveying all good to us; by his ſubjecting to
this we come to receive all grace and mercy from God. And
it could not have been otherwiſe; for though God would
have thought of a ſecond covenant, yet if he had left it to us
to have performed the termes of it, we ſhould aſſoon have
broken that, as we did the firſt: but Chriſt undertaking to be
the head of the ſecond covenant, and performing whatever
the Father required in it, by his perfect obedience to the
law, and ſatisfaction to divine Juſtice, divine Juſtice had
nothing to lay to the charge of thoſe that Chriſt undertook
to ſatisfie for: This was a mighty way of Gods letting out
his grace and mercy to the ſouls of believers; for what is it
that ſtops the current of his mercy? 'tis the curſe of the law
and cryes of divine Juſtice: but now, Chriſt undertaking to
undergoe that curſe, and to ſatisfie divine Juſtice, God hath
as much honour now by his ſuffering, as he had diſhonour
by mans ſinning: ſo that mans ſinne is made up in this; and
that is it Juſtice requires. I have had diſhonour by ſinne ſayes
Juſtice, I muſt have this diſhonour made up by ſuffering, and
ſo much ſuffering as in which I muſt have as much honour
as I had before diſhonour in ſinning. Theſe are the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon which God will be reconciled to man; and upon
no other. I beſeech you conſider this, and herein you will
ſee an infinite neceſſity of Chriſt: God is with us upon theſe
termes: ſayes God, you have ſinned againſt me and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
me; how doe you think to be delivered? why Lord,
thou art mercifull: I, ſayes God, but I am reſolved upon this,
I will have as much honour by ſuffering, as I had diſhonour
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40441:26"/>
by ſinning. And Lord what would have become of us, if we
had been left to make up this breach. This is the very reaſon
why the damned in hell are there eternally, becauſe they are
there upon theſe termes; ſayes God, I am infinite, and I am
diſhonoured, and there they muſt lye, till I have as much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
by their ſuffering as I had diſhonour by their ſinning.
Now after they have been there thouſands of thouſands of
yeares, ſtill the honour of God calls for more: and therefore
they muſt lye there for ever. But now, Chriſt who is the
great Saviour, he comes, and entering into covenant with
God, and fulfilling that covenant, he layes downe God ſuch a
price, that God ſhall have as much honour in his ſuffering
for ſinne, as he had diſhonour before in the committing of
ſinne. Now this being done, the current of mercy being
unſtopt, and the paſſages of it opened, and God being infinite
in grace and mercy in himſelfe, what a glorious way is
made for the ſtreames of his mercy to iſſue and flow forth to
the children of men.</p>
               <p>And (take in this one particular more, and then we ſhall
have done with this head) In this we may ſee, that God in
forgiving of ſinne, and ſhewing mercy to ſinfull creatures is
juſt; and goes in a way of Juſtice, as well as in a way of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
therefore that Text <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. 26. is very obſervable (a
Text that <hi>Luther</hi> for a while was exceedingly troubled about
the meaning of it) <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation,
through faith in his bloud, to declare his righteouſneſse for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſinnes that are paſt, through the forbearance of God. To
declare, I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſſe, that he might be juſt,
and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus.</hi> This was that
which troubled <hi>Luther</hi> ſo much, that God ſhould declare his
righteouſneſſe in the remiſſion of ſinnes: that God declares
his mercy every one knowes, but that God declares his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
and that Chriſt is ſet to be a propitiation, that
God might declare his righteouſneſſe, this may ſeem ſtrange:
and then the Holy Ghoſt repeats it, <hi>To declare I ſay his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe:</hi>
as if he ſhould ſay, conſider that God in the pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of ſinne, doth not onely manifeſt his grace and mercy,
but declares his righteouſneſſe, <hi>That he might be juſt: and the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40441:27"/>
juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus;</hi> Not mercifull, but juſt:
thus wee ſee what way Chriſt takes to be the meanes of
conveying Gods goodneſſe to us; by performing the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and ſo ſatisfying divine Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he is the way of conveying good to us, as by his
ſatisfaction, ſo by his interceſſion: for he is now, and ſhall
for ever be, at the right hand of the Father in glory, making
interceſſion for his people: that is, continually preſenting
before his Father the worke of his mediation, his merits,
what he hath done and ſuffered, and as it were pleading
with his Father for the conveyance of all needfull mercy and
good unto the ſouls and bodies of his people whom he hath
redeemed. As if he ſhould every moment eternally ſpeake
thus to the Father: Father, behold here is my bloud, my
merits, my death, all my ſufferings; the worke of my humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
it is for theſe; yea for this poor ſoul, and for that
poor ſoul particularly: for know that Chriſt thinks not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the lumpe of believers in the generall, but particularly
of every believer, and is continually preſenting before the
Father his infinite merits, to plead with him for ſupply of all
grace and mercy to us: and thus he comes to be an infinite
way of conveyance of good to the ſouls of his people, and ſo
to be all and in all to them, both here and eternally: that is
the third particular; how Chriſt comes to be the way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.</p>
               <p>But now the fourth, and that is, to inſtance in ſome ſpeciall
things we have from God, and to manifeſt that Chriſt is all
in all in thoſe things; As now firſt, in the point of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the pardon of our ſinnes, the acceptation of us as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:
that is the great thing we ſtand in need of from God,
Chriſt is all in all to us here: this is the tenour of the Goſpell,
<hi>Rom. 3. 24. Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is in Jeſus Chriſt. Luther</hi> hath this expreſſion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
juſtification: ſayes he, in the point of juſtification, there
Chriſt and faith muſt be onely put together; they muſt be
alone, and nothing elſe with them; but in our converſation,
there indeed comes in good workes: juſt as it is between the
bridegroom and the bride, the bridegroom and the bride are
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40441:27"/>
alone in the bride chamber; but when they goe abroad,
there they have their traine and ſervants attending them: ſo
he compares juſtification to the bride chamber; none but
Chriſt and faith muſt be there; but when they come abroad
in their converſation, then all other graces attend them, and
good workes come in; but Chriſt is all in all here.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is not all we have done; no, nor all that we can
poſſibly doe, that can be our juſtification. You will ſay, true,
we have for the preſent done but little: I, but ſuppoſe any
of you ſhould doe your utmoſt in any particular that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires:
you will ſay, I hope if I doe what I can, God will
accept it of me: no, you miſtake exceedingly if you thinke
ſo; people are very apt to look upon God as if the termes
between God and them were no other then thus: God he is a
pittifull and a mercifull God; and 'tis true, we are weak and
can doe but little: but yet doing what we are able, God he
will accept the will for the deed: no, God accepts not the
will for the deed in point of juſtification. It is true, in thoſe
that are already juſtified, God in the performance of duty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
the will for the deed, ſo as to take delight in them: but
in point of juſtification, as to pardon of ſinne and acceptation
to righteouſneſſe, there he muſt have perfect obedience; and
though we endeavour never ſo much, yet unleſſe we can bring
God a perfect righteouſneſſe, we are undone for ever; yea,
woe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and woe to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and woe to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and
woe to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and to all the Prophets and Apoſtles,
notwithſtanding all their righteouſneſſe, if they had not had
a righteouſneſſe beyond what was in themſelves; If they had
not had a perfect righteouſneſſe to tender to their Father, they
had been utterly loſt for ever: therefore it is not for thee to
reſt upon this, that thou doeſt what thou canſt, and haſt good
wiſhes and deſires, and the like; for were all the righteouſneſſe
of all the righteous men that ever were in the world in one
man, it would not be ſufficient for his juſtification. I but it
may be you will ſay, true I can doe but little of my ſelf, but
if God enable me, then he will accept of me. Nay further, it
is not what God enables thee to doe, that can be the formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of thy juſtification: ſuch are the termes between God and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40441:28"/>
thee, that there is nothing thou canſt doe of thy ſelf, or canſt
be enabled to doe, that is accepted of him for thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to eternall life.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, it is true, though God ſhould enable me,
yet there may be imperfections; but God is mercifull, and
will paſſe them by: therefore I adde another conſideration,
that it is not onely what thou canſt do, or canſt be enabled to
doe, but 'tis not Gods mercy added (if barely conſidered, as
the mercy of God as a creator to his creature, and not under
this conſideration through Chriſt, and accepting a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
beyond thy own) that can eke out thy juſtification. This
is a great miſtake, many think that that which they have in
themſelves and what they are able to doe, is but little: but
when they have done ſomething, if God will come then and
adde his mercy to it, that they think will eke it out: no, it is not
that and mercy together that is thy juſtification, I ſay mercy
out of this notion we are ſpeaking of.</p>
               <p>And that you may underſtand it yet more clearly, conſider
it thus the work of Gods mercy in juſtification, it is not of
this uſe, that it ſhould be our juſtification, or ſhould eke out
what we are wanting in for our juſtification; but the work of
Gods mercy in juſtifying a ſoul is, to take him off from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
to unbottome him, and to make him ſee and be ſenſible
of his own unrighteouſneſſe and uncleaneſſe: this is a great
and mighty work of Gods mercy. I remember <hi>Luther</hi> ſayes
of himſelfe, that while he was a Papiſt, he was not obedient
out of worldly reſpects for a livelyhood, and the like; but he
did what he did out of conſcience: and yet ſayes he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
(after he knew God in Chriſt) <hi>That which I counted gain
was loſſe unto me.</hi> He did not think it enough to do what he did
out of conſcience, and that Gods mercy ſhould make up the
reſt: no, he was taken off of that way. 'Tis not the work of
mercy to do this, but to diſcover to the ſoul a righteouſneſſe
of a higher nature, even of the mediator God and man; and
to enable the ſoul by faith to tender up that righteouſneſſe to
God the father for ſatisfaction: this is the worke of Gods
mercy in point of juſtification. The miſtake of the way of
Gods mercy having an influence into our juſtification is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40441:28"/>
dangerous miſtake; and we had need be very wary in this
great point of juſtification, for all depends upon it. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>Luther</hi> in this, ſayes he, it is an eaſie matter to ſay we cloſe
with Gods grace, and the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt alone in
the point of juſtification, till the ſoul be brought to a conflict:
and then 'tis the hardeſt thing in the world to doe it, and the
people of God have found it ſo in the time of trouble of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
thats the firſt, that Chriſt is all in all in point of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is all in all in point of adoption, ſo ſayes
the Scripture, <hi>Gal. 3. 26. For ye are all the children of God by faith
in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and Chapter 4. <hi>v. 4. 5. But when the fulneſſe of
the time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made
under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we
might receive the adoption of ſons:</hi> and eſpecially that is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<hi>John 1. 12, But as many as received him, to them he
gave power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on
his name.</hi> The word tranſlated <hi>power,</hi> is another word in the
greek.—He gave them <hi>authority</hi> to become the ſons of God:
'tis a word that imports more then bare power. Every one
will challenge a part in ſonſhip, that they are the children
of God; but only thoſe that are in Chriſt have authority
to challenge it as their due. If a ſtranger ſhould ſay he was
the Kings ſon, and were heire to the Crown, it would coſt
him his life, becauſe he is none of the Kings ſon; but if one
be declared by Act of Parliament to be the right heire to the
Crown, then he hath authority to challenge it. 'Tis ſo here;
when once we come to be in Chriſt, then we have authority
to claime this priviledge, to be the ſons of God, and heires
of heaven. And this great priviledge that is ſo mightily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
us, we have it in Chriſt, not only by way of the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy
of his merit, but by our union with him, we are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to Chriſt; and by union with his perſon, are made one
with him; and ſo are ſons by vertue of his ſonſhip: And are
therefore ſons of God in a higher way then the Angels are;
the Angels are ſons by creation, but we are the ſons of God in
Chriſt, by vertue of our union in his ſonſhip: as Chriſt is the
ſon of God the ſecond perſon in Trinity, and we made one
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40441:29"/>
with him, ſo we come to be the ſons of God in a myſticall
way of union with him, and Chriſt is all in all in that.</p>
               <p>And then in point of reconciliation and peace with God,
Chriſt is all in all there, <hi>Being juſtified, by faith, we have peace
with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 5. 1. It is not all
the created power in heaven and earth that can bring true
peace to a troubled ſoul: there is no ſalve for a wounded ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but the bloud of Chriſt applyed unto it: tis he that is
the brazen Serpent that is onely able to cure the ſtrings of
conſcience; as <hi>Luther</hi> ſayes, it is a harder matter of comfort
an afflicted conſcience, then to raiſe the dead: few think it ſo,
and wonder what people meane in being ſo troubled in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
as they are: I tell you, were there not a mighty redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
the conſcience of a man or woman could never be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that once apprehends the wrath of God againſt them; ſo
that Chriſt is all in all there.</p>
               <p>And ſo he is all in all in point of all our ſanctification,
that is ſanctification to life. There is a generall kinde of
ſanctification the Scripture ſpeaks of, which comes ſome way
from Chriſt: but now I ſpeak of that ſanctification which
is our ſpirituall life. You know what the Scripture ſayes,
<hi>John 3. 36. He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life;</hi>
and <hi>John 1. 16. And of his fulneſſe have all we received, and grace
for grace.</hi> There is the fulneſſe of Chriſt conveyed into the
ſoul: ſo that our ſanctification is not only from him merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,
but efficiently, yea, and in a kinde materially too,
for he doth not only merit it, and work it by his ſpirit; but
through our union with him there is a kinde of flowing of
ſanctification from him into us, as the principle of our life: as
from the Liver there flowes bloud into all the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
ſo through our union with Chriſt, he having the fulneſſe
of the Godhead in him, from him as from a fountaine, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
flowes into the ſouls of the Saints: there ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
comes not ſo much from their ſtrugling, and endeavours,
and vowes, and reſolutions, as it comes flowing to them from
their cloſſing with Chriſt and their union with him; there may
be a great deal of ſtriving and endeavouring that may be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ineffectuall, for want of having recourſe unto Chriſt as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40441:29"/>
the ſpring and well head of all grace and holineſſe. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
a Germane Devine profeſſeth of himſelf, that before he
underſtood the grace of Chriſt in the Goſpell, he vowed and
vowed, and covenanted and covenanted a thouſand times,
and could never overcome his corruptions, till he underſtood
Gods letting out of his grace through Chriſt, and then he got
ſtrength againſt them: and the reaſon why we faile in point
of ſanctification is, becauſe we think to get it all by maine
ſtrength; but the ready way is to cloſe with Chriſt by faith,
and then there will flow in life and grace to the ſoul: there
may be many morallities by the light of nature, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of that light left in us; but that is not the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
that is to life. And hence it is, that there is ſo much
beauty and glory in the ſanctification of the Saints, becauſe
Chriſt is all in all in it; and that there is ſuch power and
ſtrength in it, becauſe it is of the ſtrength of Chriſt; for Chriſt
is all in all in it. And hence it is of an abiding nature, and
an immortall ſeed; And therefore of a higher nature then
that of <hi>Adams</hi> in innocency: that loſt, but ſo cannot
this; becauſe Chriſt is all in all in it; ſo that Chriſt is all
in our ſanctification likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Again, he is all in all in the want of all things, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we want: doe we want grace, doe we want gifts, doe we
want outward comforts in the world? there is enough in
Chriſt: it is Chriſt that is inſtead of all, that is better then all,
and that will ſupply all in his due time. Thoſe that know
Chriſt, and have acquaintance with him, though they have
this and that comfort taken from them, yet they know how to
make ſupply out of Chriſt: they have that skill, and art, and
myſtery of godlineſſe, that they can make Chriſt to be all in
all in the want of all: and it is a great skill and myſtery of
godlineſſe, to know how to make up all in Chriſt in the want
of all.</p>
               <p>Again, Chriſt to the Saints is all in all in the enjoyment of
all: when they enjoy never ſo much of creature comforts,
Chriſt is all in all in them; the ſatisfaction that their ſoules
have, is not ſo much that they have the creatures, that they
have larger eſtates, more friends, greater comforts then others;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40441:30"/>
but in this, they know how to enjoy Chriſt in all, and can
look upon it as a fruit of the covenant that God hath made
with them in Chriſt; and as coming from the fountaine of
Gods eternall love and mercy in his Son <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 11. God ſaies
there, <hi>As for thee alſo, by the blood of thy covenant, I have ſent forth
thy priſoners out of the pit wherein is no water.</hi> That which is
ſpoken there of the deliverance of the priſoners, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to all the mercies that a believer enjoyes: whatever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
he hath from evil, whatever good he is poſſeſſed of,
it is by the blood of the covenant; a believer can look upon
every bit of meat he hath, and upon all the good he enjoyes,
and ſee it all come ſtreaming to him in the blood of Chriſt;
and ſo it comes abundantly the ſweeter. As tis with the Sun,
when it ſhines through the aire it is not ſo warm, as when it
ſhines through a burning-glaſſe. Take a burning-glaſſe, and
hold it between you and the Sun, and the glaſſe will contract
the beames of the Sunne, ſo that it ſhall have an efficacy of
heat, even to burn again: So the goodneſſe of God that comes
to people through the generall bounty and patience of God,
hath not ſuch an efficacy to warm and heat their hearts, and
to draw them to God; but now, Chriſt is as it were the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-glaſſe,
that is held between God and the ſoule; and the
mercy coming through this burning-glaſſe, O how doth it
warm and heat outward comforts! therefore there is no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the world can enjoy outward comforts with ſo much
fulneſſe of contentment as the people of God doe, becauſe they
all come to them through Chriſt. Chriſt is all in all in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of all. And ſo I might ſhew you how he will be all in
all in Heaven to eternity.</p>
               <p>But to give you one particular more: as he is all in all in
the good we have from God, ſo he is all in all in whatever we
tender up to God; as in deſcent from God to us, ſo in aſcent
from us to God: Chriſt muſt come in there, he muſt be all in all
in our ſervices, let our ſervices be never ſo good; yea, though
ſpirituall, yet they muſt finde aceptance with the Father
through Chriſt. That Text is very remarkable for this, 1 Pet.
2. 5. <hi>Ye alſo, as lively ſtones, are built up a ſpirituall houſe, an holy
prieſthood, to offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40441:30"/>
Chriſt;</hi> marke, <hi>To offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices.</hi> I, but though the
ſacrifice be ſpirituall, that is not enough to make it accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but Chriſt he muſt come in; therefore he addes, <hi>acceptable
to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Many people offer up ſacrifice, and they
think that is enough; but the people of God they reſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the duty, no, nor in the ſpirituality of the duty, though
that be counted a great matter: but they goe one ſtep higher,
and ſo muſt you in all the duties you tender up to God, and
that is, not only to be carefull that your duties be ſpirituall,
but you muſt tender them to God in the hands of Jeſus Chriſt,
and expect acceptance through him. When thou haſt to deal
with God in all thy approaches to him be ſure thou doeſt
not omit the work of Faith, in laying hold upon Chriſt and
carrying him along with thee; or elſe thy ſervice will not
be accepted. We know the ſacrifices in the law, though they
were never ſo good, yet they were not accepted unleſſe a man
brought them to the Prieſt, and the Prieſt he muſt offer up
the ſacrifice, and then it was accepted. Now what was that to
ſignifie to us, but Chriſts Prieſtly office: this is the very work
of the Prieſtly office of Chriſt, to take all our ſacrifices that
we tender up to the Father, and to offer them up for us: for
we muſt not preſume to offer them our ſelves; and though
they offered a ſacrifice that was never ſo good, yet if they did
not offer it upon the right Altar, it was not accepted: ſo
Chriſt he is the right Altar upon which we muſt offer up all
our ſacrifices to the Father; we muſt look towards the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
towards Chriſt, in all that goes from us unto God, Chriſt
being all in all for acceptation of our duties.</p>
               <p>And thus we have done with the fourth particular, ſhewing
wherein Chriſt is all in all.</p>
               <p>But now it may be demanded; how it comes to paſſe that
God will have this way of communicating himſelf to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
and will not goe in that other way, that we by the
light of nature and reaſon would think he ſhould goe? true
indeed, we are ſinners: I, but God is mercifull, and we will
ſeek, and cry to him for pardon and mercy, and deliverance
from our ſins; and what needs there more? why will not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40441:31"/>
God ſave us this way? I will not ſtand now to diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the poſſibility of this, but we know this is not the
way.</p>
               <p>We are therefore now to enquire why God ſhould rather
take this ſtrange way, then goe any other way? and indeed it
is a wonderfull way, if we rightly conſider it: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the world that works ſo much upon a mans heart to
adore and admire God in the myſtery of the Goſpell, as the
underſtanding of this, that God ſhould have a peculiar way
of communicating himſelf to man, different from Angels, and
from all other creatures; that it muſt be through the ſecond
perſon in the Trinity; and he muſt take mans nature upon
him, and ſuffer, and dye, and all the mercy we have muſt be
through him: this is a wonderfull myſtery of godlineſſe; and
ſhould take up our ſerious thoughts in the conſideration of it.</p>
               <p>Now if you would know the reaſon of it; the firſt is this,
That hereby God might manifeſt to all the children of men,
what a dreadfull breach their ſins had made between God and
them: we cannot imagine any way how the breach between
God and man could have been ſo clearly ſet out, as by this
meanes; when we underſtand that ſuch was our condition
by nature, and ſuch our apoſtacy from God, that there was
no way of communication of any good from God to us, but
by this ſtrange and wonderfull way of a mediator between
God and man: that he ſhould obey and ſuffer, and dye for us,
we muſt needs apprehend now, that certainly there was ſome
mighty difference between God and us: and that mans eſtate
was very low, and his condition very deſperate, that muſt have
ſuch a remedy as this is. And this is that which God would
have men to know, even what that breach is between him and
their ſouls: and tis ſuch a breach that few think a right of it.
If I ſhould open the law to you, with all its curſes, and ſet the
torments of hell before you, all this could not ſet out the
dreadfulneſſe of the breach between God and you, ſo as this
point doth, when I tell you that it was ſuch as requires ſo
ſtrange and wonderfull a way of Gods being reconciled and
pacified towards you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:40441:31"/>
Secondly, God takes this way, becauſe he ſees it the moſt
advantageous way for the manifeſtation of his glory; firſt the
glory of his mercy: there is no way that could have been deviſed
by men or Angels to ſet out the glory of Gods mercy in mans
ſalvation, ſo as by this way: if God ſhould have ſaid to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde;
You poor creatures have ſinned againſt me, but I am
mercifull and will pardon you; God had been glorious in
this: but now there is infinitely more mercy ſhewed when
God ſhall ſay, You miſerable creatures have ſinned againſt
me; and ſuch is your condition, that except the Son of my
boſome be made a curſe for you, there can be no mercy for
you: well I am content that he ſhall not be ſpared; but ſhall
be given to be a curſe to prepare mercy for you: here is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
indeed. Therefore when Chriſt was borne, the Angels ſung,
<hi>glory to God in the higheſt, Luke</hi> 2. 14. As if they had ſaid,
this is the higheſt pitch of the glory of God, in providing ſuch
a way of reconciliation with the children of men; and God
was ſo ſet upon this work of ſhewing mercy to mankinde, that
though it coſt the death of his Son, he would have it, and that
ſhews it to be infinite mercy and love indeed, when it breakes
through ſuch mighty difficulties; there is the glory of his
mercy.</p>
               <p>And then ſecondly, there is the glory of his Juſtice: God ſets
out the glory of his Juſtice here, more then if all mankind had
been eternally damned: Gods Juſtice would not have been
honoured ſo much in that as in this way of Gods reconciling
man unto himſelf; and that in theſe two regards: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in Chriſt Gods Juſtice is glorified actively; whereas if
all men had eternally periſhed, it ſhould have been glorified
but paſſively: and tis more to have it glorified actively, then
paſſively: and as God delights more in active obedience then
in paſſive, ſo he delights more in the active glory of his Juſtice
then in the paſſive, (though there is a kinde of activeneſſe in
ſuffering, and ſo in Chriſts ſuffering: therefore that diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of active and paſſive is needleſſe; for his active obedience
was paſſive, and his paſſive obedience had activeneſſe in it.)</p>
               <p>But Secondly, Gods Juſtice is now glorified perfectly; the
debt is fully paid: whereas if all mankinde had been damned,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40441:32"/>
the debt ſhould have been but a paying, and not have been
paid to all eternity. As ſuppoſe a poor man oweth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds, and he payeth two pence a week, he may be
paying of it, but cannot pay it in all his life: but now if a
rich man ſhall come, and at once lay down the money for
him, the debt then is paid: and this is a great deal more then
if it ſhould have been alwayes paying. So I ſay, if all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
had been damned eternally, God ſhould have had his
debt but paying; but the debt would never have been paid: but
now Chriſt comes and layes down the payment at once upon
the borde, and asketh Juſtice whether it hath enough or no;
ſo that Juſtice is more glorified this way.</p>
               <p>And Thirdly, the infinite glory of his wiſdome appeares in
reconciling Juſtice and Mercy together: that God ſhould be
infinitely merciful and juſt both in one thing; this is that
that no Angell in Heaven could ever have imagined: ſuppoſe
God ſhould have ſaid thus to all the Angels in Heaven, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
is in a loſt and undone condition, yet I am willing to
ſave him, but ſo as that I will have infinite mercy and Juſtice
reconciled: if all of them ſhould have gone and conſulted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
they could not poſſibly have told how this ſhould be.
Now the infinite wiſdom of God, and nothing but infinite
wiſdom could finde out ſuch a way; as that God ſhould be
infinitely mercifull, and infinitely juſt too.</p>
               <p>And Fourthly, the infiniteneſſe of Gods holineſſe is hereby
manifeſted: if God in a generall way ſhould have thrown
his mercy as it were up and down in the world without any
more adoe, Gods holineſſe, and hatred of ſinne, would not
have appeared as now it doth, when nothing can expiate ſinne
but the death of his Son; if God ſhould carry any of you to
the brinke of hell, and there let you ſee all the miſeries of the
damned, and heare all their yellings under the fruits of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
wrath, O you would ſay, how doth God hate ſinne! but
be it known to you, in the ſufferings of Chriſt there is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
manifeſtation of Gods hatred of ſinne then in all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of hell: You that would know how infinitely hatefull
ſinne is to God, come and behold Chriſt, God and man ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
under the wrath of his Father; look upon him in the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40441:32"/>
garden, ſweating drops of blood: come and follow him to
the Croſſe, and heare him cry out in the bitterneſſe of his
ſoule that dolefull cry, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken
me?</hi> behold Jeſus Chriſt, God man, who was God bleſſed for
ever, made a curſe for ſinne, and for thy ſinne; look upon
ſinne in this glaſſe, and here ſee Gods hatred of ſinne. There
are two glaſſes wherein we ſee the evill of ſinne; the bright
chriſtall glaſſe of the law, and the red glaſſe of the ſufferings
of Chriſt: and this latter doth more fully, more ſenſibly
(I am ſure) ſet out the nature of ſinne, and Gods hatred of it:
and by this you may ſee the meaning of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. where the
Apoſtle ſpeaking of the myſtery of the Goſpell ſayes, <hi>But we
all with open face</hi> (marke) <hi>beholding as in a glaſſe the glory of the
Lord,</hi> &amp;c. We behold but Gods back parts in his works: as
God ſayes to <hi>Moſes;</hi> we behold but the footſteps of God in his
workes: but when we behold him in Chriſt, we behold him
with open face. Now look what difference there is in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a man when we only ſee the print of his foot upon ſand,
and when we look him in the face, ſo much difference there is
between the knowing of God and his glory as it ſhines in the
workes of creation, and as it ſhines in the face of Chriſt; that
God therefore might manifeſt his glory, he would not pardon
ſinne ſo freely as to ſay, you have ſinned, but yet I will pity
you, and pardon you, and there is an end; no, though he
would pardon ſinne, yet he would doe it this way.</p>
               <p>A Third reaſon why God would bring things about this
way, is this: becauſe God ſaw there could be no ſuch way
to draw poor ſinners to himſelf as this. When God ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
to a ſinner that he is not only a mercifull God, but that
he hath provided ſuch a ſtrange way to convey his mercy:
this hath a mighty efficacy to draw the ſoul to God: for the
poor ſoule apprehending its own guiltineſſe, and Gods hatred
of ſin; and underſtanding withall, that the heart of God is ſet
upon ſuch a way of mercy; is by this as by a mighty argument
prevailed with to draw neer to God in a way of dependance
upon him: for thus will the ſoul argue, Well, I heare that
God, to the end he might let out mercy to poor ſinners, hath
of his own infinite wiſdome provided ſuch a ſtrange way of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40441:33"/>
conveyance as this is; and when God hath made it appeare by
revealing to me the myſtery of the Goſpell how his heart is
ſet upon this way of ſhewing mercy to ſinners, I conclude
now, that the Lord is willing to be reconciled to me, and
why then ſhould I be unbelieving any more? why ſhould I
have hard thoughts of God any more? why ſhould I remaine
in my doubting condition any longer? thou canſt not be more
deſirous of the ſalvation of thy ſoul, then God is of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
his grace and mercy: and God hath done more for thee
then thou canſt poſſibly do for the ſalvation of thy ſoul. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
tis a mighty drawing argument; for by this meanes the
infinite diſtance that conicience apprehended to be between
God and the ſoul, is taken away: for when the ſoul ſees it
hath to deal with an infinite deity, that is ſo farre above it, it
ſtands ſhaking and trembling, and dares not draw nigh to
God. What have I to doe, ſaith the ſoul, with ſuch a God as
this is, who is ſo infinitely above me? but now when thou
knoweſt that Chriſt is between God and thee, then this diſtance
needs not ſcare thee; yea now all thy guiltineſſe and all the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
and pollution of thy ſoul, and all that the law hath to
ſay againſt thee, need be no diſcouragement to thee, when thou
ſeeſt thou haſt to deal with God through Jeſus Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no ſoul can ſtand off and ſay, how doe I know it belongs
to me? doe but take this one rule, for that there is nothing
can intereſt the ſoul in Chriſt but Chriſt himſelf: there is no
preparation to Chriſt, but Chriſt muſt be all in all in it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſtand not off, and ſay, how ſhall my heart be wrought to
theſe and theſe preparations, and work thus and thus, before
I have part in Chriſt? no; puzzle not thy ſelf about thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
but ſet before thy ſoul the myſtery of the Goſpell
in this glorious way of Gods communication of himſelf to
thee, and of reconciling man unto himſelf; and the very effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of theſe truths will have a power upon thy heart to draw
thee unto God in this way of reconciliation; and that is the
way of true comfort.</p>
               <p>The Goſpell it ſelf, though there be no preparation before,
yet hath an efficacy to draw the heart to Chriſt; for Chriſt is
all in all in that. And doe not ſay, I am a poor meane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40441:33"/>
I can doe nothing, I cannot remember a Sermon, I cannot
pray, or performe any good duty as I ought: why, remember
ſoul, Chriſt is all in all: true, if any thing were required of
thee in the buſineſſe of ſalvation, it were ſomewhat; but know
that God hath laid help upon one who is mighty; therefore
tis not thy weakneſſe, nor the diſtance between God and
thee, that can hinder, if thou rightly apprehendeſt God in
Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon might have been this: God doth it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare
his mercy to his Saints for ever; for indeed nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deares
Gods mercy to them ſo much as this, that they ſee it
come to them in ſuch a way of conveyance; and that which
will indear mercy to the Saints in heaven to all eternity, and
for which they ſhall be full of the praiſes of God, ſhall not be
ſo much for the good things they enjoy, as for that ſtrange
and wonderfull way by which they come to enjoy them. This
I ſay is that which ſhall take up the hearts, and be a great part
of the work of the glorified Saints in Heaven to all eternity,
even their admiring, adoring, and praiſing God in Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And then God delights to honour his Son, and that he
might ſet him up, he makes him to be the meanes of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of all good to thoſe he intends it to; as if a King were to
honour his Son, what way can he take to doe it more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
then this, that all the favour he meanes to ſhew to any
ſhall be only through his Son? ſo when God the Father would
honour his Son, he appoints from all eternity, that all the
grace and mercy that any ſhall have from him ſhall be only
through his Son. Therefore as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>All judgement is
committed to the Son, that all men might honour the Son, as they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Father:</hi> So I may ſay of the work and diſpenſation
of Gods grace, that all is conveyed to Chriſt, and by him
communicated to thoſe that have intereſt in him, that the Son
might be honoured to all eternity.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude in a few words of application, to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you this that hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if it be thus, let us ſtand a while and admire at the depths
of the councel of God, and the infinite glory of the riches of his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40441:34"/>
grace to mankinde; that God ſhould ever have ſuch thoughts
towards ſuch poor wormes as we are, that he ſhould not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have let ſuch deſpicable creatures eternally periſh, then
goe in ſuch a ſtrange way to ſhew mercy to them: Truly bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
God hath done more in bringing a poor ſoul to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
then in creating Heaven and Earth: the work of creating
Heaven and Earth is but a low piece of work in compariſon
of this wonderfull way of Gods conveying his grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to the children of men through his Son: this is the maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
of the workes of God, which he hath already done, or
will ever doe to all eternity: and God therefore is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
and adored in this. We are to glorifie God in every
creature, but how is God to be glorified then in his Son,
wherein ſo much of his glory doth appeare? If it be a ſinne for
us not to ſanctifie the name of God when we behold his glory
in his meaneſt workes, O what a ſinne is it not to ſanctifie the
name of God in beholding the myſtery of the Goſpell and his
glory ſhining in the face of Jeſus Chriſt! God, expects (brethren)
that thoſe who live under the Goſpel, ſhould ſpend their dayes
and thoughts, and talk, about that glory which he hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
in his Son. O you that have ſuch chaffy droſſy ſpirits,
that can ſpend your precious thoughts upon ſuch poor things
as you doe, know that here is an object to take up your
thoughts; and your ſinne is abundantly the greater in this, that
you ſpend your thoughts about ſuch vanities, when God ſets
before you ſo glorious an object to raiſe up your hearts unto
himſelf; and you that ſpend a great deal of your lives in vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
know, that this day you have heard of a truth that above
all things in the world ſhould take up your time and thoughts
in the contemplation of it.</p>
               <p>And you that have more time and greater eſtates then others,
and are not put upon it to get your bread as others are, and
ſo have greater opportunities for the worſhip and ſervice of
God, and for ſearching into his truth, yet how doe you ſpend
your time in vanity and light things, as if there were no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
matters to take up your hearts! It is a ſigne of a vaine and
frothy ſpirit, that when God propounds ſuch glorious things
to you, that yet it ſhould be the content of your ſouls to baffle
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40441:34"/>
out your time in vanity; and things that will not profit.
Well, if you would have an evidence to your ſouls, that Chriſt
is all in all to you, and ſhall be to all eternity, take it in this:
if ever God hath opened thine eyes to ſee his glory in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of the Goſpell; and that thy heart is taken with it, and
overcome by it, it is an argument that thou art indeed the
ſoul which God hath received to mercy in his Chriſt; but
ſayes the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 3. If our Goſpell be hid, it is hid to
them that are loſt.</hi> There are a great many to whom the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
is preached, and yet tis hidden to them; and it is hidden
to you if you ſpeak of Chriſt only in a formall way, and
think it enough to ſay, I hope to be ſaved by God in Jeſus
Chriſt; but doeſt thou ſee that in the Goſpell which raiſes
thy heart with admiration, and that darkens all the glory of
the world? doeſt thou ſee more of the glory of God ſhining
in that one ſentence, <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begotten Son, that whoſoever believes in him, ſhould not periſh,
but have everlaſting life,</hi> then thou ſeeſt in the whole frame of
the creation of Heaven and Earth? thou hopeſt thou ſayeſt to
get to Heaven; but what wouldeſt thou doe there? the work
of Saints and Angels in Heaven joyned together, is to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
God for this great work of his: doe thou then begin this
work here, and give God his glory, for the great things he
hath done for the children of men.</p>
               <p>The Second uſe ſhould have been this: If Chriſt be thus all
in all, then let us bleſſe God that ever we knew Chriſt; and
that the myſtery of the Goſpell hath been revealed to us: for
otherwiſe we had been without God in the world; and what
would have become of us had not this grace of God in the
Goſpell been revealed to us? could you ever have thought of
it your ſelves? could it ever have entered into your hearts?
certainly no; nor into the heart of any creature in Heaven or
Earth: therefore bleſſed are your eares, that heare the things
which you heare: and bleſſed are your eyes, that ſee the
things which you ſee: and know, that when you come to live
under the Miniſtry of the Goſpell, you enjoy the greateſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that ever you enjoyed ſince you were borne: the coming
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40441:35"/>
under a powerfull Miniſtry, that reveals Chriſt and brings
the day of ſalvation to the ſoul, it is no other then the fruit
of the prayer of Jeſus Chriſt for that ſoul: compare <hi>Iſaiah 49.
8.</hi> with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. 2. and you ſhall ſee this. <hi>Iſaiah 49. 8. Thus
ſaith the Lord, in an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a
day of ſalvation have I helped thee, &amp;c.</hi> Now it is apparent by
the context, that this is to be underſtood of Chriſt: that God
the Father ſpeakes there to his Son: well, what is this accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
time and day of Salvation in which Chriſt is heard? look
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. 2. in the chapter before he had told them, <hi>That they
were ambaſſadors for Chriſt. We then as workers together with
God, beſeech you alſo that ye receive not the grace of God in vaine:</hi>
Now what is this grace of God? tis the Miniſtry of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
<hi>For he ſaith I have heard thee in a time accepted:</hi> and
mark how he applyes it, <hi>Behold now is the accepted time: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay; the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time and day of ſalvation in which God the Father hath
heard Chriſt, is now: now that we the ambaſſadors of Chriſt
come and open the myſtery of the Goſpell to you; now is the
time wherein God the Father hears the Son for you: what
a mercy is this? and what an engagement upon you, that when
you heare any thing of the myſtery of the Goſpell opened to
you, you are to look upon it as the fruit of the prayer of Jeſus
Chriſt: and ſo when Gods ſends a faithfull Miniſter to any
congregation, tis the fruit of the prayer of Chriſt. Chriſt
prayes, O Father, that there might be an acceptable time for
ſuch a people, for ſuch a man and woman; it may be they
have gone on a long time in ignorance and prophaneſſe; I
but Chriſt hath been praying to the Father for them, and
when this acceptable time comes, then God diſpoſes of them,
that this man ſhall goe out of ſuch a wicked family, and ſhall
live in a godly family, or ſhall come to ſuch a Sermon, and
there ſhall heare the wonderfull things of the Goſpell opened
to him, and ſhall come to underſtand this great myſtery of
Gods letting himſelf out through Chriſt unto his people: and
there the Lord will renew him by a work of grace, and bring
his heart over unto himſelfe, this is the acceptable time when
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40441:35"/>
God reveales the myſtery of the Goſpell to any ſoul: therefore
bleſſe God for this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this ſhewes how dear Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be unto
us. O how ſhould we delight and take contentment in him
that brings the Treaſuries of grace from the boſome of the
Father, and opens them unto us: and not only opens the
minde of God the father to us, but comes and lets out the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Gods goodneſſe to us. It was ſtopt before, I but Chriſt
he opened as it were the flood gates, and lets the current of
grace and mercy in upon us. O how deare therefore ſhould
Chriſt be unto us? it was the ſpeech of that Martyr, Maſter
<hi>Lambert, None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt.</hi> Yea when he ſuffered
Martyrdome for Chriſt, then none but Chriſt was deare to
him; becauſe he ſaw that Chriſt was the way of conveyance of
all good unto him: as if God now make a man a meanes of
conveyance of a great deal of good to a nation, every man
will be ready to have his eye upon that man: I, but there was
never ſuch a way of conveyance of good to us as Chriſt is:
therefore how ſhould our hearts love him, and prize him, and
rejoyce at the very thoughts of him? If you have a friend,
and God makes that friend an inſtrument of mercy to you, O
how doth it indeare you to that friend: if the husband be an
inſtrument of good to the wife, or the wife to the husband;
if a Miniſter to his people, or people to their Miniſter, and ſo
in all relations: when we can look upon others as a meanes
of conveyance of Gods mercy to us, it is a mighty argument
to knit our hearts unto them, and indeed this is the way to
obtain love. It may be the wife complaines, ſhe hath not
love from her husband; or the husband complaines he hath
not love from his wife: Why now, be as inſtrumentall as you
can to convey the goodneſſe of God to them, and this will
mightily indeare and knit them to you; and if it doth ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
man and man: how ſhould it doe ſo much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and Chriſt, who is indeed the husband of his Church,
and through whom the fulneſſe of God is let out unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
O how deare and precious therefore ought he to be
unto us!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:40441:36"/>
Fourthly, is Chriſt all in all? then if we have an intereſt in
him, it ſhould ſatisfie and content us, though we have nothing,
or be nothing in our ſelves: Why, becauſe if we have Chriſt,
we have all; though thou wanteſt parts, friends, eſtate, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
comforts; yet know Chriſt is to be thy all, and is not
he enough? as he ſaid, am not I better to thee then ten ſons?
ſo ſayes Chriſt to the ſoul, what doeſt thou want? thou wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
this comfort, and the other comfort, but am not I all in
all to thee, and better then all? yea, be willing to be made
nothing, for all is made up in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, it ſhould have put us upon this, to be willing to give
up all we have to Chriſt; alas, our all is but a poor all: yet
give it to Chriſt; our parts, eſtates, intereſt, names; let Chriſt
have all becauſe he is our all.</p>
               <p>And let him be the rule of our prizing all things: ſo farre
as we ſee any thing of Chriſt, prize it ſutably: as tis reported
of Maſter <hi>Bucer,</hi> if he could ſee any thing of Chriſt in any man
or woman, though they were never ſo poor and meane, his
heart would cloſe with them. And tis ſaid of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that
before his converſion he took great delight in reading of <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's</hi>
workes; but afterward, ſayes he, I finde not the name
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in all <hi>Cicero;</hi> and that took off his heart from him:
ſo in all thou doeſt enjoy, look how much thou ſeeſt of Chriſt
in it, ſo farre let thy delight and eſteem be carried out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, and no farther.</p>
               <p>Again, with what mighty intention of ſpirit ſhould the
heart be put forth toward Jeſus Chriſt above all things!
what though God give thee an eſtate and honour in the
world: if thou haſt not Chriſt thou haſt nothing, thou
haſt not that that makes way for thee to eternity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be not ſatisfied with any thing without Chriſt. As <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
ſayes, <hi>What wilt thou give me Lord, ſeeing I goe child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe?</hi>
So ſay thou, Lord, thou haſt given me a portion in
the world, thou haſt given me credit and repute amongſt
men; but Lord, what is all this to me, if I goe Chriſtleſſe,
and have not him that is the conveyance of grace unto
my ſoul, that is all in all? O Lord, thou haſt this day
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40441:36"/>
taught me, that ſuch is the diſtance and breach betweene
thee and me, that unleſſe it be made up through a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
I muſt eternally periſh: therefore give me Chriſt,
whatever thou denyeſt me. O ſatisfie not your ſelves with
any thing, without Chriſt. Many hypocrites they ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
themſelves with gifts: if they have gifts, then they are
contented. Conſider that parable in the Goſpell, <hi>Matth.
13. 45, 46. The merchant-man ſought after goodly pearles, but
when he had found the pearle of price, then be went and ſold
all that be had, and bought it.</hi> Now gifts and parts, and
other atchievements are theſe goodly pearles: I but Chriſt
he is <hi>the pearle of price:</hi> therefore whatever thou haſt, be
willing to part with it for him: if God have diſcovered
to thee the pearle of price, let no goodly pearles ſatisfie
thee. Many ſouls periſh eternally becauſe they are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with goodly pearles, and doe not endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
this pearle of price.</p>
               <p>Againe, the application ſhould further have been, to
have endeavoured to work this upon you, that in your
ſeeking after God, you would be ſure to take Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with you.</p>
               <p>I will give you onely this note, if it were your laſt
time to pray to God, and your everlaſting eſtate did depend
upon Gods mercy, ſhould you now ſeek God never ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet if it were onely in a naturall way, as your creator,
your condition would be very dreadfull, and you would pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
eternally. If God ſhould lay any of you upon your ſick
beds, or death beds, and you ſhould cry to God, mercy, mercy
Lord, be ſure you take Chriſt along with you, and look upon
God through Chriſt, or elſe all your cryes will be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
It is a ſpeech of <hi>Luther,</hi> that God lookt upon out of
Chriſt, is moſt dreadfull and terrible; and it argues a great
deal of ignorance in us, when we think we can goe to God,
and ſhall finde mercy with him, without conſidering him as a
God that will be reconciled to us only through his Son. To
conclude all, as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>If I be lifted up, I will draw all men
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40441:37"/>
unto me:</hi> ſo this is the work of our Miniſtry, we have ſpent
time amongſt you that we might labour to lift up Chriſt to
you: and O that God would be pleaſed to draw all your
ſouls to him.</p>

               <p>IN the latter end of the former chapter the Apoſtle exhorts
to perſeverance, and ſhewes the great evill and danger of
drawing back. Now, to the end this evill might be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
he ſhewes what it is that will deliver us from it.
Whatever others doe, or whatever temptations or afflictions
we meet withall to draw us back, yet ſtill the juſt ſhall live
by faith: <hi>Now faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of things not ſeen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Chapter (therefore) he falls upon this argument, to
wit, the opening of the doctrine and practice of faith. And
the words read are an excellent deſcription of faith (not an
exact definition of it) <hi>It is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the
evidence of things not ſeen. The ſubſtance;</hi> the word in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
is very full, <hi>the</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it hath many ſignifications: the
fundamentall, the foundation of things hoped for; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
the ſubſtantiality of things hoped for: thoſe things
that in themſelves have no reall preſent ſubſiſtence to us, but
are things to come, and hoped for; yet faith gives them a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
reall ſubſtantiall being to us. <hi>The ſubſtance of things hoped
for, the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> The word tranſlated <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
is a Logicall terme, and ſignifieth ſuch a kinde of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
as is by way of diſpute and cleare demonſtration, ſo
as it muſt needs compell one to yield unto it; that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of the word, that although the objects of faith are things
not ſeen, either by the eye of ſenſe, or by the eye of reaſon,
yet faith brings ſuch a light with it, and makes them ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40441:38"/>
cleare, that it even forceth the ſoul to a beliefe
of them: ſo that it hath the fulleſt conviction of them that
poſſibly can be.</p>
               <p>Two things then (you finde) are here ſaid of faith:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it gives a ſubſtantiall reall preſent being to things
hoped for.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, that it is the evidence of things not ſeen. In
the firſt of theſe, we have theſe two things: Firſt, that there
are many glorious things which the Saints hope for, that yet
they have not: they are men of hopes. Secondly, that their
faith doth give a reall and ſubſtantiall being to thoſe things
which they hope for.</p>
               <p>In the Second of theſe we have likewiſe two things: Firſt,
that the things of God are things not ſeen. And Secondly
that faith is the evidence of thoſe things that are not ſeen.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, but briefly, <hi>There are great things that the Saints
hope for, that yet they have not; they are men of hopes.</hi> They hope
that they ſhall ere long be delivered from all ſinne and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows:
that they ſhall never ſinne more, never be tempted
more, never ſuffer more, never feare more; they hope that the
time is coming when it ſhall be ſaid of all their ſinnes, as
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Theſe your enemies that now you
ſee, you ſhall never ſee them more. They hope that theſe vile
bodies of theirs, theſe bodies of clay, bodies of vileneſſe, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of ſinne, ſhall ere long be made glorious bodies; that
theſe pieces of dirt ſhall (within a while) ſhine more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
then the Sun in the firmament. They hope that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God ſhall ere long be perfected in them, ſo as they
ſhall be fully united to God, and be made one with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the Father and the Son are one. They hope that they
ſhall meet with their bleſſed Saviour in the aire; and with
theſe their eyes behold him coming in his glory: They hope
that they ſhall be poſſeſſed of thoſe glorious manſions which
he is gone before to prepare for them. They hope that their
eyes ſhall be bleſſed with the glorious viſion of a deity that
they ſhall ſee God, and ſo ſee him, as to be like unto him.
They hope that they ſhall enjoy full communion with the
Lord; that they ſhall have the immediate and full lettings
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40441:38"/>
out of a deity into their ſouls and bodies, without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
They hope that they ſhall joyne with the bleſſed
Angels and Saints in eternall Hallelujahs, and ſhall be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
admiring and adoring the name of the great God,
for thoſe glorious myſteries of redemption by Chriſt. They
hope that they ſhall keep a perpetuall and eternall Sabbath,
and ſhall no more be combred with naturall things, with
the things of the earth, but ſhall have perfect and everlaſting
reſt in Chriſt, and ſhall live in God as in an infinite ocean of
all excellency; theſe things they hope for. I but are not
theſe conceits? are they not notions, pretty fine fancies, with
which they pleaſe themſelves? is there any reallity in theſe
things: indeed if theſe things were reall and ſubſtantiall, if
there were as great a reallity and as much ſubſtance in the
things they hope for, as there is in the things they enjoy in
the world for the preſent, and that they could ſee them as
certainly as they ſee the things that are before their eyes, it
were ſomewhat like. Well, ſayes the Apoſtle, there is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
to make all theſe things ſubſtantiall to you; and faith is
the ſubſtance of things hoped for. Theſe hopes are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
and notions, but they are raiſed up in their hearts by the
mighty power of the holy Ghoſt. <hi>Rom. 15. 13. Now the God of
hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound
in hope through the power of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> There needs not the
power of the holy Ghoſt to raiſe fancies and conceits in mens
hearts; but the hopes of the Saints are ſuch as are raiſed in
them by the power of the holy Ghoſt: And God himſelf is
ſtiled by their hopes: <hi>Now the God of hope, &amp;c.</hi> Now God is
not the God of fancies and conceits, but he is the God of the
hopes of his Saints? And theſe hopes are given to them, to the
end they might be kept from drawing back, and might be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
for the preſent in whatever they ſuffer. Therefore the
Scripture compares our hope to an Anchor, and to an Helmet:
you know that of all dangers, thoſe are the greateſt, of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
by Sea, and of enemies by Land: now our Hope is to
helpe againſt both: againſt our dangers by Sea, of ſhipwrack,
our hope is an Anchor: againſt our dangers by Land, of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
our hope is a helmet.</p>
               <p>The hope of the Saints for the preſent is as the corke to the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40441:39"/>
net that keeps it from ſinking to the bottome; though they
may be in the water, and the lead of troubles and afflictions
may weigh them down, yet their hope keeps them above wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
they have great hopes, and they have that which makes
their hopes ſubſtantiall; for their faith is the ſubſtance of
things hoped for. And that is the ſecond thing I now come
to: Carnall hearts think there is no ſubſtantiall reall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in any thing, but in the outward excellencies of the
world; they think that money, Lands, honours, the pleaſures
and delights of the fleſh, have ſubſtance in them; and that
there is ſomething of reallity in theſe: Now I beſeech you,
obſerve the difference between the judgement of the holy
Ghoſt, and the judgement of a carnall heart: whereas a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
heart looks upon outward things as the onely ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
things, (therefore you call your rich men ſubſtantiall
men: and ſo the Scripture, ſpeaking in the language of men,
calls a mans eſtate his ſubſtance, becauſe men count their
eſtate here their ſubſtance,) now the holy Ghoſt accounts all
thoſe things that the world lookes upon as ſubſtances, to be
but meer conceits: and thoſe things that the world accounts
conceits, to be ſubſtances: (and thoſe that judge according
to the judgement of the holy Ghoſt, doe the like.) For the
firſt, you know St. <hi>John</hi> reckons all things in the world in three
ranks; either ſuch as are profits, pleaſures, or honours: the
luſts of the fleſh, and the pride of life, and the delights of the
eye: now for thoſe things that the world counts their greateſt
ſubſtance, their eſtates, and riches, marke how the holy Ghoſt
thinks of them, <hi>Prov. 23. 4, 5. Labour not to be rich, ceaſe from
thine own wiſdome: wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not?</hi>
That which you call your ſubſtance, the holy Ghoſt ſayes, <hi>it is
not,</hi> it hath not being at all. Well, but honours and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have ſomewhat in them. Nay, they have nothing in
them neither. <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 23. tis ſaid, <hi>Agrippa and Bernice came
in great pompe to the judgement ſeat,</hi> glittering in their brave ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell;
but the word tranſlated <hi>great pompe,</hi> is, they came
with much fancy: what greater honour is there then for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to come in their robes upon the judgement-ſeat, glittering
before the eyes of their ſubjects? thus did they: and yet their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40441:39"/>
great glory in the judgement of the holy Ghoſt, was all but
a great fancy: And for the luſts of the fleſh, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. in verſe
5, 6. you have the ſenſualty of the people ſet out very fully,
<hi>They lie upon beds of Ivory, and ſtretch themſelves upon their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and eat the Lambes out of the flock, and the Calves out of the
midſt of the ſtall; they chant to the ſound of the violl, and invent to
themſelves inſtruments of muſick; they drink wine in bowles, &amp;c.</hi>
and in verſe 13. it comes all to this, <hi>Ye rejoyce in a thing of
naught,</hi> in that which hath nothing in it; there is no reallity,
no ſubſtantiall excellency in all theſe things; neither in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
honours, or pleaſures; but marke now how the holy
Ghoſt judges of ſpirituall things: what ſubſtance there is in
them, which are only conceits to carnall hearts, <hi>Prov. 8. 20,
21.</hi> (ſayes wiſdome there) <hi>I lead in the way of righteouſneſse
&amp;c. that I may cauſe thoſe that love me to inherit ſubſtance;</hi> to
inherit that which is; ſo <hi>Tremelius,</hi> as if nothing had a being,
but that which wiſedome cauſeth to inherit. And <hi>Hebr. 10.
33, 34. You were made a gazing ſtock both by reproaches and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
and took joyfully the ſpoyling of your goods, &amp;c.</hi> (but how
came this to paſſe? marke,) <hi>knowing in your ſelves that ye have in
heaven a better, and an enduring ſubſtance.</hi> So that that which
was but a conceit and notion to the world, by their faith they
ſaw it to be ſubſtantiall unto them: and <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 11. 10. It
is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>he looked for a City with foundations:</hi>
there was no City in the world that had foundations in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
eye, but only the City that he looked for; and it was
his faith that gave that City foundations. Thus we ſee the
different judgement of the holy Ghoſt and the world. As now
while we live upon the earth, we think the earth to be very
great, and the Sun and Moon and Stars to be but little things,
and they ſeem ſo to us: but were we in heaven, we ſhould
then ſee the Sun and Moon and Stars to be great and vaſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and the earth to be but a point in compariſon of them:
ſo while men have earthly hearts, they look upon the things
of heaven as conceits, and poore ſmall inconſiderable things,
not worth looking after: but if by divine principles they
were once lifted up to heaven and could converſe there, then
they would ſee the things of heaven to be great matters, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40441:40"/>
the things here below to be but a point; to be but poor low
inferiour things, not worth minding or affecting. Thoſe
things that are the objects of faith are ſubſtantiall things, and
faith gives them that ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>And they are ſubſtantiall things, Firſt, becauſe they have in
them more then appeares to be in them: we count that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
which hath in it more then it appeares for: thoſe
things that make a great ſhew, and have not that in them
which they make ſhew of, we count them vain, and without
ſubſtance, as a piece of cloth that hath not that in it which it
ſhewes for, we ſay it hath no ſubſtance in it.</p>
               <p>Now the things of God have more in them abundantly then
they ſhew for, and therefore they are ſubſtantiall: hence it is
that when Chriſt ſhall come in glory, the Text ſayes, <hi>He ſhall
be admired in all them that believe, 2. Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. They ſee for the
preſent a great deal of excellency in Chriſt, and they love
him, and their hearts are towards him for that they ſee in
him now; but hereafter he ſhall appeare abundantly more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
then they thought for: then they ſhall ſay, indeed we did
ſee much in Chriſt, but we ſee now infinitely more glory and
excellency then ever we imagined.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the things of heaven that are the objects of faith
are ſubſtantiall, becauſe there is moſt of God in them. Now
God is the infinite firſt being of all, and gives being to all: that
therefore which hath moſt of the firſt being in it, muſt needs be
the moſt ſubſtantiall and reall good: Now though it be true
that all creatures are filled with Gods excellencies, yet ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and heavenly things are above all other moſt filled with
God: the very divine of nature of God is in them, and there is
the very life of God, and the Image and glory of God, and
there God doth eſpecially communicate himſelf. God hath
two wayes of his communication: the one is to his Son, and
that is in an infinite way that we underſtand not: and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is to his creatures: and his ſpeciall communication of
himſelf to his creatures is in ſpirituall and heavenly things:
therefore they muſt needs be the moſt ſubſtantiall and reall
things to the ſoul.</p>
               <p>And then Thirdly, they are ſubſtantiall things and not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40441:40"/>
and conceits, becauſe they are the very center of the
thoughts and intentions of God himſelf, and that which he
aimes at in all his workes towards his creatures, and the very
center of the happineſſe of the moſt excellent creatures that
ever God made. Now that which is the very iſſue of the great
deſigne of God in making the world, and of all the workes he
doth in the world, and the higheſt good any creature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, certainly it is no conceit, but hath a great deal of
ſubſtantiall being in it: but the good we have in ſpirituall
and heavenly things, is the very iſſue of Gods deſigne from all
eternity, in his full communication of himſelfe unto his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and it is the higheſt good any creature is capable of:
therefore ſpirituall things are reall and ſubſtantiall.</p>
               <p>Againe, reall and ſubſtantiall things they are, becauſe we
finde they have a reall and ſubſtantiall operation upon the
ſouls of thoſe that are acquainted with them. O the mighty
work that appeares upon the hearts of the godly from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of ſpirituall things, that are the objects of faith!
how doe ſpirituall things tune and raiſe the hearts of men
that were low, and baſe, and droſſy, and vile before, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with God in the higheſt way and kinde that it is poſſible
for a creature to converſe with God in; and what great things
doe they enable the ſoul to doe! thoſe things that have ſuch
a ſubſtantiall operation, muſt needs be reall and ſubſtantiall.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they have an eternall ſubſiſtency, that ſhall never
vaniſh or fade away, that when all other things ſhall wither
as the graſſe, ſpirituall and heavenly things ſhall abide for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
therefore they are the only ſubſtantiall things.</p>
               <p>But then, as they are thus in themſelves, ſo how come they
to be thus to the ſoul? why it is by faith; faith gives them
the bottome, the foundation, the ſubſtantiallity of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And I note this the rather, becauſe the great reaſon
why our hearts are not taken with ſpirituall things, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we doe not ſee into the reallity and ſubſtantiallity
that is in them, and into the preſentneſſe of the good they
have.</p>
               <p>Now faith gives them this their ſubſtantiall being:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it is faith that carries the ſoul to contemplate
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40441:41"/>
upon God himſelfe, and enables the ſoul to diſcerne the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and glory that there is in God, to know much of
God in his own eſſence and being; and elevates the ſould to
converſe with God in a higher way abundantly then reaſon
can doe (though it is true, a great deal of God is underſtood
by reaſon.) And then by faith the ſoul comes to know what
riches there are in theſe excellent and glorious things of God.
It firſt ſees them in God, and then after that it ſees this God
to be infinitely willing to communicate and let out himſelf
to his creature; And then by faith the ſoul converſeth with
the deep and glorious councels of God, between himſelf and
his Son: It ſees into the great deſigne God had in ſending his
Son into the world for the working and bringing to paſſe
thoſe high and glorious intentions he had in communicating
himſelf to the children of men through a mediator. Again,
faith converſeth with the great things, of the covenant of grace,
and there ſees into thoſe unſearchable riches (as the Apoſtle
ſpeaks) that have no footſteps in the creature; ſo the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies;
we cannot ſee them by reaſon, or the creature. A ſpeciall
object faith works upon, is the covenant of grace in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and it ſees the riches that are revealed there: And faith
receives the teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt; the holy Ghoſt is
appointed by the Father and the Son to witneſſe theſe great
things, to manifeſt to the ſoul the deep things of God; thoſe
things that are but meer notions otherwiſe to the heart of a
man, the ſpirit of God diſcovers theſe to the ſoul; and ſo
faith working upon theſe objects, and cloſing with them as
the proper ſpheare for it to move in, it makes all thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things that are revealed concerning the happineſſe of thoſe
that God intends eternall good unto, ſubſtantiall and reall to
the ſoul; ſuch things as the ſoul can build upon, and dare
venture its ſelf, and its eternall eſtate upon; and we had need
have a good foundation in thoſe things we are content to
venture our eternall eſtate upon: and becauſe it muſt be the
work of faith (when God intends to ſave the ſoul) to have
ſuch apprehenſions of the Goſpell as to be willing to venture
its eternall condition upon it, therefore it had need have a
ſure foundation: and hence faith is the ſubſtance of things
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40441:41"/>
hoped for, and gives a reall being unto theſe things.</p>
               <p>And as it makes them reall and ſubſtantiall, ſo there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
thing included in this word, It makes them <hi>preſent;</hi>
though they are but things hoped for, yet by faith they have
a preſent ſubſiſtence to the ſoul; they are lookt upon by faith
as now ſubſiſting, though in themſelves they doe not: faith
partakes much of the nature of God, it hath a kinde of omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
power in it, out of nothing to create ſomething: there
are many excellent works of faith, and amongſt the reſt this
is a ſpeciall one, to give a being to that which in itſelf hath
none, to make it for the preſent a ſubſtantiall reall being to
the ſoul: the work of faith in this kinde is very obſervable:
for evill things that are very high, faith can make them at a
mighty diſtance; and for good things that are never ſo far off,
faith can make them to be as preſent to it. Obſerve what the
Scripture ſpeakes of it this way: firſt for evils that are very
nigh, and encompaſſe us round about, when we are in the midſt
of them, faith can put the evill at a diſtance, as <hi>Pſalm. 91. 7. A
thouſand ſhall fall at thy ſide, and ten thouſand at thy right hand,
but it ſhall not come nigh thee; not come nigh thee:</hi> If he had ſaid,
it ſhall not be upon thee, it had been ſomewhat; but to ſay, it
ſhall not come nigh thee, this is a ſtrange kinde of expreſſion;
how could it be ſaid not to come nigh him, when thouſands
fell on the both hands, and he was in the midſt of it? it was by
faith: faith put that at a diſtance which was juſt upon him.
The ſtrength of reaſon will help one, when the plague is a
great way off, then a man thinks, I am ſafe enough; becauſe
farre enough from it: but ſuppoſe the plague come into thy
houſe, into thy chamber; now to believe a promiſe, it ſhall not
come nigh thee, here is a mighty work of faith; faith puts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
preſent at a farre diſtance. And then on the other ſide,
for good things that are abſent, &amp; a great way off, faith can
make them as if they were really ſubſiſting: therefore <hi>(Heb.
11. 13.)</hi> It is ſaid of the Fathers, that they ſaw the promiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre
off, and <hi>embraced</hi> them: the word in the originall is <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted</hi>
the promiſes; now friends when they ſalute, muſt be
nigh one another; their faith made the promiſes which were
a great way off to be with them as if preſent: therefore it is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40441:42"/>
ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſaw Chriſts day, and rejoyced; and
the Scripture ſpeaks of taking hold of eternall life, and that
we doe by faith; and of being in heaven, <hi>receiving the end of
your faith:</hi> Tis not, you ſhall receive, but now you are receiving.
<hi>Pſalm. 108. 7. 8. God hath ſpoken in his holineſſe, I will rejoyce, I will
divide Sechem &amp;c. Gilead is mine, Manaſſeth is mine:</hi> marke, <hi>is
mine:</hi> he preſently concludes, as if the thing were already
done, for it was ſo by faith: faith gives a preſent ſubſiſtence
to things. Reaſon it ſelf hath a great deale of power to make
things that are future, to be as preſent, both in evill things
and in good. In evill things, a man that is a contemplative
man, and hath a wicked heart, he will fetch the ſweetneſſe of
his luſt and ſinne which is a great way off, and make it as
preſent by mediation, and roling it up and down in his
thoughts in a way of diſcourſe; and ſo acts his ſinne contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platively,
though he may be in hell before he act it really;
Now as reaſon and diſcourſe can fetch in a luſt, and make it
as if it were preſent: ſo reaſon can goe a great way in making
a future good thing as if it were preſent. And this is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between a rationall creature, and a ſenſuall: a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
creature is only for the things that are before it; but now
reaſon can fetch things that are abſent, and make them as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
and in regard of this, God hath a mighty advantage of
mankinde, either for the bringing of his wrath upon them, or
for beſtowing happineſſe upon them: as you can fetch in
your luſts that are abſent, and make them as preſent to you in
your thoughts, by the work and diſcourſe of reaſon: ſo by
the worke of this faculty, God can make evils and plagues
though future, yet to be as preſent with you. And in this reſpect
the wofull evill of thoſe that periſh eternally may be ſet out
dreadfully: namely thus, they being reaſonable creatures, by
the work of their reaſon they may fetch in all the miſery that
they ſhall indure to eternity, to fill up every moments miſery,
that all the miſery they ſhall indure to eternity, they ſhall
poſſeſſe it preſently and together: and therefore the torment
of a brute creature is infinitely ſhort of a reaſonable; ſuppoſe a
brute beaſt were in hell, yet its miſery would come infinitely
ſhort of a mans, becauſe a brute creature apprehends no more
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40441:42"/>
miſery, then that inſtant: but now, if a reaſonable creature
be in torment, and knowes it ſhall be in it eternally, by
thought and diſcourſe it can fetch into that very inſtant, all
the paine that it muſt endure for ever. And ſo for happineſſe,
thoſe that are ſaved, ſhall be infinitely happy every moment,
becauſe they ſhall fetch in all the happineſſe they ſhall have to
eternity to make them every moment happy: this is the work
of reaſon. Now if reaſon can make future, things to be as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
how much more can faith, that is not only reaſon eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but is a principle higher then reaſon? as it is in diſpaire,
a man that diſpaires brings hell to himſelf before he is in hell;
and makes hell that is abſent, as if it were preſent. Hence
ſome in their diſpairing have cryed out, they were in hell: as
<hi>Francis Spira,</hi> he ſaid he was in hell, and hell fire, was upon
him, becauſe by diſpaire that which is future hath a reall kinde
of ſubſiſtance in the heart of a man, as if it were now preſent.
Now as diſpaire brings in the reallity of Gods wrath that is
future, and makes it as preſent, ſo faith brings in the reallity
of Gods love and mercy that is to come, and makes it as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
and it is as genuine a work of faith, to make future
things preſent, as any work of faith. Now I ſhould have
ſhewn you in what reſpects faith makes things preſent, that
are to come, and what is the work of faith in them. But
briefly, it makes all things preſent that are to come:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it ſees all things as certain as if they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
if a man have a bond of one for a hundred pounds,
that he is ſure off, he ſayes here is a hundred pounds, becauſe
of the certainty of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe faith lookes upon the poſſeſſion of things,
that not only they ſhall be, but that now there is a poſſeſſion
of them, and that two wayes; Firſt, Chriſt our head is gone
before to prepare manſions for us, and in our name to take
poſſeſſion of heaven, therefore we have taken poſſeſſion in our
head; and then Secondly, we have the firſt fruits of the ſpirit,
the firſt fruits of the glorious things of heaven; and in that
regard, we our ſelves have taken poſſeſſion, and therefore they
are as preſent to faith. Thirdly, there is ſuch an infiniteneſſe in
eternity, that the time that is to be before we have ful poſſeſſion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40441:43"/>
is not conſiderable: therefore faith lookes upon them as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>And then Fourthly, faith eyes the things of heaven conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
and they are therefore preſent, becauſe they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in the eye of faith.</p>
               <p>And Fifthly, the preſentneſſe of them is ſeen in this, becauſe
the Saints enjoy all in God: for this is the happineſſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to ſee all glory and bleſſedneſſe in God: Now faith doth
ſomething of this here; faith inables us to ſee great things in
God. Now the enjoying communion with God for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and beholding of heaven in God, and ſeeing all things
in him, this muſt needs make a preſent reall ſubſiſtance of them
to the ſoul. Thus I have ſpoken briefly of faiths, being the
ſubſtance of things hoped for.</p>
               <p>For the uſe: If faith be the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and
gives being to things ſo high and glorious as the things of
God are: Firſt, then certainly faith it ſelf muſt needs be a very
ſubſtantiall thing; faith is not a conceit and notion, for it
gives reality and ſubſtantial being to thoſe things the world
counts conceits: faith is the moſt ſubſtantialeſt glorious thing
in the world: It is that, in the working of which, the power
of God appeares more then in any thing in the world: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19, 20. there are ſome ſix or ſeven gradations
of the wonderfull power of God that appeares in the working
of faith: Now that muſt needs be an exceeding ſubſtantial
thing, that hath ſuch a mighty power of God in working of
it: God doth not uſe to put forth extraordinary power for
the doing of ordinary things. Now when he ſpeaks of faith,
he ſets out his power in a glorious manner, and in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
way; and thereby tells us, that faith hath ſome
great matter in it. And indeed faith hath much in it; though
it be a grace that empties us of our ſelves, yet it is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the believer is enabled to doe one of the moſt glorious
workes that ever creature was enabled to doe: as now for a
poor ſoul to ſee its ſelf in its own filth, under ſinne and guilt,
and to ſee the wrath of an infinite deity incenſed againſt it;
to ſee the infinite juſtice of God requiring ſatisfaction, and
the infinite holineſſe of God hating of ſinne; to have the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40441:43"/>
of conſcience, of Satan, of the world, and being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of all this, yet to lay hold upon a mediator between
God and man, and to truſt in a righteouſneſſe beyond it ſelf,
and to tender it up to God the Father for a full attonement
and ſatisfaction, and to venture its ſelf, and eternall eſtate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; and being unholy and filthy in it ſelf, yet to unite it
ſelf to God in as neer a union (for the kinde of it) as poſſibly
a creature can have with the Creator, next the hypoſtaticall
union of the humane nature of Chriſt with the divine: I ſay;
for faith to be able to doe this, it is a high and moſt glorious
work, and there is an abundance of the power of God appeares
in it.</p>
               <p>By this how may we diſcover the vanity of the faith of the
greateſt number of people in the world, who have nothing but
meer emptineſſe in them, their very faith is only a notion,
and no marvell then if all things they believe be but notions,
they can doe nothing with their faith. You ſay you hope and
believe and truſt in Gods mercy, but what can you doe with
your faith? what reall ſubſtantiall work of faith is upon
your hearts? when faith comes, there comes the mighty power
of God and his wonderfull glory into the ſoul, that creats (as
it were) and gives ſubſtantiall being to the moſt high and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
objects in the world: therefore know, that faith is not a
dead ſlight empty thing in the ſoul, but it hath a mighty ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
upon the hearts of men and women: and certainly that
faith that muſt ſave a ſoul muſt have high and glorious opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Againe if faith gives a ſubſtantial being to things hoped
for, then we muſt learne to ſtrengthen and exerciſe our faith
in the things we hope for: which of us doe not hope for great
and glorious things (as I gave you a hint of them?) Now let
faith be exerciſed and ſtrengthened in theſe things; if all thoſe
bleſſed things we ſpak of were preſent to the ſoul, O how
would our hearts be above the creature, how ſhould we look
upon all things here below as dung, filth, droſſe, how would
our thoughts be raiſed in the admiration of ſpirituall and
heavenly things, how would our ſpirits be taken up in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
at the glory of God that appeares in theſe things, how

would our hearts be enflamed with love to God! how would
our converſations be in heaven for the preſent! what heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoughts and heavenly affections would be in us in all our
wayes! and how would we venture to goe through fire and
water for God! to doe any thing, ſuffer any thing, be any
thing for God. And did our faith make ſuch glorious things
as theſe reall and ſubſtantial to us? how ſubſtantial would
our duties and ſervices be. Why is it then that our duties
have ſo much vanity in them, are ſo empty, having nothing
but circumſtance in them; certainly (brethren) if our faith
gives a ſubſiſtance to ſuch bleſſed &amp; glorious things of eternal
life, it will likewiſe give a ſubſiſtance to all our duties and
ſervices, that we ſhall not tender to God empty and dead ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.
Conſider, this you, who though you dare not omit
duties, yet what empty duties doe you tender to God; your
works ſhould be the works of faith, and faith ſhould give
them a ſubſiſtance, as well as it gives your hopes; therefore ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
not your ſelves with that faith that will not give a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
to your duties; and doe not think it will give a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
to ſuch glorious things we ſpeak of. Thus much of
the firſt particular, <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for.</hi> I
would faine ſpeak a little of the ſecond, <hi>It is the evidence of
things not ſeen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two things here.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the things of grace, ſpiritual and heavenly things,
are things not ſeen.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, that faith gives an evidence to thoſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that grace, ſpirituall and heavenly things, are things
not ſeen.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſayes <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19. 22. the works of the fleſh are
<hi>manifeſt;</hi> but when he comes to the workes of the ſpirit, he
ſayes the workes of the ſpirit are <hi>theſe:</hi> he doth not ſay, they
are manifeſt; for indeed they are things that are not ſeen:
though tis true, the operations of them appear, yet there is no
externall work of grace, but an hypocrite may doe it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the workes of the ſpirit cannot be ſaid to be ſeen either
by the eye of ſenſe or reaſon. And then for the things of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
ſayes the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 18. While we look not at the things
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40441:44"/>
which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen, for the things
which are ſeen are temporall, but the things which are not ſeen are
eternall.</hi> I might here diſcover to you how it comes to paſſe, that
ſpirituall and heavenly things are not ſeen unto ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Many arguments I thought to have given to diſcover
this: I muſt but cull out two or three particulars. The riches
of a Chriſtian in ſpirituall and heavenly things are like the
riches of the Sea; it may be outwardly you ſee nothing but
hideous waves, and a great deal of filth, I but the riches are
at the bottome, and the riches of the earth are within, and
hidden, they doe not appear: ſo the riches and treaſures of
a Chriſtian are things not ſeen, they are things that are in the
very boſome of God, in the very heart of God. Now as no
man knowes the things of a man, but the ſpirit of man; ſo
no man knowes the things of God, but the ſpirit of God, and
him to whom God doth reveal them.</p>
               <p>And then they are things that are beyond the principles of
reaſon, they are too high. and ſo too glorious for ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
as reaſon is: if an object be too glorious for ſenſe, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes
the ſenſe: ſo theſe objects are too high for reaſon, and
and therefore cannot be ſeen by reaſon.</p>
               <p>And the blindneſſe of man naturally is ſuch that he cannot
ſee theſe things. And chiefly God ſo orders things in his
providence, that he goeth a quite contrary way (as to ſenſe
and reaſon) to that which he hath promiſed. I ſay it is the
way of God to hide his glorious excellencies by ſeeming to
goe in the wayes of his providence directly croſſe to what he
hath promiſed; we might ſhew how God hath hid from ſenſe
and reaſon his mercy to his own people: that of <hi>Abraham</hi> is
conſiderable; there were two promiſes God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
the one of going out of his own country, and carrying him to
a land flowing with milk and honey; the other, that he would
make his ſeed as the ſtars of heaven for multitude, and that
in his ſeed all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed.
Mark now, if <hi>Abraham</hi> had not had ſomething to evidence
that which was not ſeen, he could never have ſeen the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of God in theſe promiſes: for when he was gone out of
his own country, he comes to <hi>Ganaan</hi> (the country promiſed)
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40441:45"/>
but as ſoon as he was there, he was ready to ſtarve, and was
faine to flye to <hi>Egypt:</hi> and if he had not had faith he would
have fallen off, and have been ready to turne back againe.
And then for the ſecond promiſe, <hi>That in his ſeed all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the earth ſhould be bleſſed: Abraham</hi> goeth on ſeaventy
yeares, and his wife had no childe; and it ceaſed to be with
her after the manner of women; ſhe was old, and <hi>Abrahams</hi>
body dead: and after he had a child, he muſt kill him, and
being ſaved, <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt be forty yeares before he is married;
and when he is married, he muſt have no childe in twenty
yeares: and in the firſt hundred and fifty yeares after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
there was but ſeaventy of all his ſeed: yet this was the
promiſe, that in his ſeed all the Nations of the earth ſhould be
bleſſed: thus God ſeemes to goe croſſe to what he promiſed.
We might inſtance alſo in <hi>Jacob;</hi> God commands <hi>Jacob</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
from <hi>Laban:</hi> and after that, mark how God followes
him. Firſt, his uncle <hi>Laban</hi> followes him with thoughts to
ſlay him. Secondly, In his Journey his wives nurſe dyeth.
Thirdly, his wife dyes. Fourthly, <hi>Dinay</hi> is raviſhed. Fifthly,
his two Sons, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levy</hi> commit that villany, that makes
him ſtink in the noſtrils of the people of the land. Sixtly, <hi>Eſau</hi>
comes to deſtroy him; and all this in that journey that God
commanded <hi>Jacob</hi> to take. Now if <hi>Jacob</hi> had not had faith to
look through theſe to the things that might encourage him in
his way to things not ſeen, it had been impoſſible he ſhould
have gone on. So when God brings <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> you
know what a way they goe about through the wilderneſſe:
when they were come to <hi>Canaan,</hi> a land flowing with milk
and hony, God brought them to the worſt part of it: for the
ſouth part was the hotteſt, and dryeſt, and barrenneſt part of
the countrey: thus God ſeemes to goe on in croſſe wayes, and
this hides the excellency of the things of God: and hence it
comes to paſſe they are not ſeen. If it be ſo, then that the
things of God are not ſeen to a carnall eye, and require more
then reaſon to apprehend them:</p>
               <p>Firſt, it ſhould make us ceaſe wondering, that men of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
parts and reaſon, doe not ſee the things of God, but ſlight
them: be not offended at this, they are things not ſeen: it is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40441:45"/>
a great deceit in many, who think that becauſe ſuch and ſuch
men have larger abilities of reaſon then others to underſtand
naturall things; that therefore it muſt needs follow, they
have deeper apprehenſions of ſpiritual things: and yet men
reaſon thus, what you poor ſimple men and women under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
theſe things, when there are great Schollars and learned
men, that ſee them not: this argues a carnal heart; as if the
ſtrength of reaſon could make men apprehend more then faith
can doe. You know what Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Father I thank thee,
that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt
revealed them to babes, Math.</hi> 11. 25. Notwithſtanding ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of Chriſt, yet we ſee the temper of the men of the
world: alas, they look upon religion as a moſt fooliſh and
ridiculous thing; and ſo for ſtrictneſſe in the wayes of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
when a man ſhall ſee another very earneſt about a thing
that he thinkes is of no conſequence at all, he cannot but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
folly to him: ſo, when the men of the world ſee the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God ſervent, and zealous about thoſe things that they
can ſee no excellency in; and ſee them willing to venture and
ſuffer for them; they count this folly and madneſſe: when
Chriſt (being in danger of his life, <hi>John 18. 37, 38.)</hi> tells <hi>Pilate</hi>
that he came into the world to bear witneſſe unto the truth,
ſayes <hi>Pilate, what is truth?</hi> ſpeaking in a ſlighting way, as if
he had ſaid, you come here to anſwer for your life, and you
had need look to that; and what doe you talk of truth now
your life is in queſtion. So carnall men, when they ſee others
venture their eſtates, and lives, for poor inconſiderable things,
as they eſteem them, they count this folly: and why doe they
doe ſo? becauſe the things of God are not ſeen. Therefore
in ſpirituall and heavenly things we muſt alwayes endeavour
to beat down reaſon, and to advance faith: ſayes <hi>Luther, In the
things of God we muſt not continually be asking the reaſon, for they
are the things that are not ſeen:</hi> Nay (ſayes he) <hi>faith kills the
beaſt reaſon, in ſpiritual things.</hi> Though it is true, being kept
under faith there is good uſe of it, yet it is as a beaſt to be
ſlaine, that ſo we may ſee the more of ſpirituall things. I meet
with a ſtory in a book of a company of Biſhops that were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together, and there was a Philoſopher with them, who
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40441:46"/>
diſputed againſt the Chriſtian faith; and he argued ſo ſubtilly
that he non-pluſt the Biſhops. Now there was a godly man,
a poor weak man there, and he deſired he might have liberty,
to diſpute, for that they were ſo non-pluſt in: and though at
firſt they were afraid he would ſpoyle the cauſe through his
weakneſſe, yet at length they gave him leave to ſpeak; and he
propounds certaine principles of religion to the Philoſopher,
and ſaid to him, doe you believe theſe things? and ſaid no
more, but doe you believe theſe things? and upon this the
Philoſopher yeilds. I have heard (ſayes he) nothing all this
while but words; but now I finde a divine vertue come into
me, that I can no longer reſiſt the Chriſtian faith, and this
meerly upon the propounding of the objects of faith, with
urging upon him, Doe you believe? certainly in the things
of faith we muſt believe before we can underſtand them fully:
our faith muſt ſometimes help us to conceive, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
our conceiving help to us to believe, we finde this in
<hi>Peter, John 6. 69. And we believe and are ſure that thou art the
Chriſt the Son of the living God:</hi> mark, <hi>we believe and are ſure:</hi>
He doth not ſay, we are ſure, and believe: but firſt believe,
and then are ſure; by believing we come to be ſure. There
are many they would faine be ſure that Chriſt died for them,
that their ſins are pardoned, and that they are the children of
God; and they endeavour to make this out by arguments,
from the effects, and would try themſelves by ſuch and ſuch
notes: but we ſhould rather, and in the firſt place goe the way
the Apoſtle doth here, we believe and are ſure: we ſhould caſt
our ſouls upon the truth of the word, and by believing come
to be ſure.</p>
               <p>So much for the Firſt, the things of God are things not ſeen.</p>
               <p>But now faith, that doth evidence and make them cleare,
<hi>We know in whom we have believed, 2. Tim.</hi> 1. 12. and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God in Chriſt are called <hi>The ſure mercies of David, Acts
13.</hi> 34. Faith is not a meer notion, imagination, or conceit,
but tis that which makes all ſure and certaine to the ſoul. I
ſhould have anſwered a caſe here, whether or no there may
not be faith without aſſurance, that is without aſſurance of a
mans own ſalvation by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:40441:46"/>
Certainly it muſt needs be a great miſtake to put that upon
the being of faith, which is the riches of faith; for ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
calls aſſurance: a man may be able to carry on his Trade,
though he be not rich; and a man may be a believer, though he
be not rich in aſſurance: now aſſurance is the creame of faith,
the riches of faith. I ſhould have ſhewn alſo how farre faith
can be an evidence, where there is doubting. Onely thus: the
aſſurance we have by faith building upon the word, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concluſions from divine principles, (for that I ſhould have
ſpoken of, how faith draws things up to an evidence, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and ſpirituall principles; and what theſe principles are:
but we cannot ſtand to open this: but) it is ſo farre an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that the ſoul can venture upon it, as I told you before;
faith is a foundation that the ſoule dare venture upon: as
that Martyr ſaid, though I cannot diſpute for the truth, yet I
can dye for the truth. Where faith comes with a convincing
light, though there may be doubts and fears, and temptations;
yet it can truſt, and depend; and the ſoul reſolves if I periſh,
I will periſh here: let all the world ſay what they will, I finde
this is the way, and whatever comes of it I will not goe back:
and by this meanes over-powers the ſoul, and carries it through
oppoſition; and ſo faith is an evidence.</p>
               <p>Many things ſhould have been ſpoken by way of application.</p>
               <p>As Firſt, If faith be an evidence to other things, and makes,
them ſeen, then it is an evidence to it ſelf. I meane thus: It
is therefore poſſible for a ſoul to know its own good condition
and its intereſt in Chriſt, meerly by the very work of faith it
ſelf; though for the preſent it be not able to argue, <hi>apoſterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi>
from the effects of faith, yet it may argue <hi>apriori;</hi> faith may
evidence it ſelf. Many Chriſtians goe on in a doubting way,
meerly becauſe they think they muſt have evidences of their
faith, by ſome effects that follow their faith; and till then
they can have no comfort; tis true, where true faith is, there
wil be fruits and effects of it: but certainly if you could learne
this myſtery of the Goſpel, to finde an evidence in faith it ſelf,
you would ſooner come to comfort; And it is a ſafer way a
great deal: as thus, if you have doubts about your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and feare your ſinnes are not pardoned; and that you
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40441:47"/>
have no intereſt in Chriſt, the way to be freed from theſe
doubts and feares; is by renewing the act of faith it ſelf, by
preſenting to your ſouls the riches of the grace of God in the
Lord Jeſus; and by viewing the glory of that, ſee if it will not
draw out your ſouls to believe. And if upon this your hearts
ſtirre not for the preſent, ſet theſe things before your ſouls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and turne not from renewing the acts of faith, to pore
upon your corruptions, and then ſay, you can ſee no intereſt
that you have in Chriſt: but look upward againe and againe,
and by the very viewing of them, a vertue will come in, to
draw the heart to believe. As by preſenting the law, there is
an efficacy to terrifie and afright: ſo by preſenting the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things of the Goſpel, there is an efficacy to draw out
faith: And then you are to renew the very primitive work of
faith; that is to cloſe with Chriſt, and to caſt your ſelves upon
the freeneſſe of the grace of God in Chriſt; and though you
finde in your hearts ſuch and ſuch corruptions, and are ready
to ſay, ſhall ſuch a one as I am, ſo polluted and defiled, caſt
my ſelf upon the grace of God in Chriſt? yet lay hold upon
Chriſt, and you have as much reaſon to doe it from thence,
as from any thing; and therefore this muſt be thy courſe to
renew this primitive act of thy faith again and again. I but
yet my doubts and feares remaine: but if thou wouldeſt
have an evidence, to it againe &amp; again a thouſand times over,
and at laſt there will be an evidence of the act of faith it ſelf.
But you will ſay, this may be preſumption to caſt ones ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the free grace of God in Chriſt. I anſwer, this is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
becauſe the very act it ſelf gives thee a right to all
that is in God and Chriſt. Now preſumption is when a man
takes that which he hath no right to: and if a man doe that to
which he hath no right before, yet if that he doth give him a
right, it is no preſumption. But you will ſay, this is a licentious
way, &amp; gives liberty. O do not wrong faith, when thou (though
thou canſt ſee no reaſon for it) in the want of ſight and ſenſe
canſt venture thy ſelfe upon the riches of the grace of God in
Chriſt, it is the moſt glorious work that thou canſt poſſibly doe
in this world: ſhouldſt thou be able to live to overcome all
thy corruptions, and to doe the greateſt ſervice imaginable, it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40441:47"/>
could not be ſo glorious a work as this. And it is the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
thing in the world; and therefore no doctrine of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
that ſoul that can goe through all the difficulties of faith,
that can overcome its infinite guilt, and the terrours of the
law, and notwithſtanding all that comes between God and it,
can venture upon the free grace of God in Chriſt, may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
all the difficulties in the world. Many other things
might have been in urging of this, as now, though we are in
the dark, and ſight and ſenſe, and all is gone; yet exerciſe
faith, and if thou wouldeſt ſtudy to magnifie God as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
this is the onely way. There is a notable inſtance of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
that <hi>Alexander</hi> gave to his Phyſitian, and the example of
the truſt he put in him did mightily honour him before all
his Nobles: <hi>Alexander</hi> being ſick, one ſends to him and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
him to take heed of <hi>Philip</hi> his Phyſitian, for that one had
feed him to poyſon him; his Phyſitian brings him the poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and <hi>Alexander</hi> gives him the letter, and drinkes the poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
preſently, intimating that he would not believe what was
reported of him: and this was a mighty honour done to his
Phyſitian, and ſo when thou haſt no evidence in thy ſelfe, yea
when thou haſt many temptations that ſpeak ill of the free
grace of God in Chriſt, and that tell thee Chriſt hath left thee
and forſaken thee; and that it would never be thus and thus
with thee if Chriſt intended any good to thee; and when
temptations are in their greateſt heat, and ſpeak the worſt of
Chriſt; Now to venture thy ſoul upon Chriſt, Chriſt will
take it as the greateſt honour thou art capable of doing to
him: and it is the readieſt way to advance the riches of his
grace and mercy. And be afraid of unbeliefe, as well as of
preſumption; be afraid leaſt thou ſhouldeſt not magnifie the
riches of the grace of God in Chriſt, which is his great deſigne
amongſt the children of men. I thought to have laid downe
ſomething to ſhew what encouragement we have to believe
in caſe of want of evidence, when we are in the dark, and can
ſee no light; and to have given rules to help our faith:</p>
               <p>But I will conclude with this one uſe.</p>
               <p>By what hath been delivered you may all ſee what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and admirable grace faith is, and of what uſe it is. O
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40441:48"/>
brethren, in theſe times wherein there is ſuch feare, trouble
and diſtraction; now to have faith to give a ſubſiſtance to all,
the things that God hath ſpoken of; a ſubſiſtance to all the
glorious promiſes that God hath made to his people: what a
wonderfull bleſſing is this! now exerciſe faith, and by faith
give a ſubſiſtance to all theſe promiſes; make them a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to reſt upon; be willing to venture all you have, your
Eſtates, names, liberties, lives, for the furthering and fulfilling
the glorious promiſes which God hath made unto his Church:
and if you have faith, that gives foundations to thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
you will doe ſo. And though we ſee nothing but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and miſery upon the world, yet let us exerciſe faith; if
the hour of temptation be yet to come, as who knowes, then
we ſhall have need of faith; and faith onely, in ſuch dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
can helpe us to light. And for preparation for ſuch
times, labour to ſtrengthen faith, and by what you have heard,
you may ſee what ſtead faith will ſtand you in, in any danger.
It is a great comfort to a Chriſtian that though he be in the
dark in many things (as there are many truths now diſputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Churches, and the like) yet to know he hath that in him
that will make the things of eternall life evident to him: It is
a wonderful bleſſing of God to have a principle that gives ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
and evidence to ſuch things as theſe are. How excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
would many poor ſouls rejoyce, if they might have
an evidence but of ſome one truth of religion; as the truth of
a deity, which reaſon gives light in; they are ſo peſtred with
Atheiſme, that they would give a thouſand worlds to be rid
of it. Now if this be ſo great a mercy, to have that which
doth evidence onely one principle of religion; what a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
mercy then is it, to have faith to evidence all the glorious
things of God; and to make them cleare and plaine to you!
you can remember there was a time when you thought them
fancies and conceits, but now you ſee them as cleare as the
light of the Sun, and you would not now for a thouſand
worlds but you ſaw them as you doe. Hereafter (brethren)
when we ſhall ſee them not by faith, but by ſenſe, O how ſhall
we bleſſe God then, that we had before an evidence of theſe
things made to our ſouls. What would have become of us if
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40441:48"/>
we had not had an evidence to cleare thoſe things to us that
lead to this glory, to evidence the righteouſneſſe of God in
Chriſt for eternal life. I ſaw theſe things ſubſiſting and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
before, and now God reveales them fully to me; whereas
on the other ſide, thoſe that want a principle of faith to make
them ſubſtantiall and evident to them, when they ſhall come
to be ſubſtantiall and evident to their ſenſe, O what a horrid
terrour will it be unto them: then you will ſay, O Lord, that
I had ſeen theſe things before, my heart then would never have
been taken ſo with the things of the world: I ran madly upon
the vanities of the world, to get riches, and honours; and I
thought I was the onely happy man, and that thoſe things
were the onely ſubſtantial and reall things, and thoſe things
that I heard the Preacher ſpeak of, I thought them to be but
notions and conceits: but now I ſee they are reall and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall.
O miſerable man that now I am!</p>
               <p>O the work of faith that can make thoſe that are of weak
parts, to ſee the great things of God, <hi>James 2. 5. Hearken my
brethren</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>God hath choſen the poor of this world
to be rich in faith.</hi> To underſtand the great things of faith;
that poor men ſhould underſtand the great, the deep, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
things of God, that were hid from the foundations of
the world, it is a wonderful work; therefore when <hi>John</hi> ſent
to Chriſt, to know if he were the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> Chriſt gives this as
one argument, <hi>The poor receive the Goſpel, Mathew</hi> 11. 5. Why,
was that an argument that Chriſt was the Meſſias, was it not
rather an argument againſt him? that the poor did it: if the
great ones had done it, it had been an argument. No, <hi>The
poor receive the Goſpell.</hi> And that thoſe that are poor and weak
in other things, ſhould have this mighty work wrought in
their ſouls, to be able to receive Chriſt and the Goſpel: this is
an argument of the mighty power of God. Brethren, to have
the uſe of the eye of the body by which we can ſee the great
works of God, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and can take notice
of the glory of God in theſe, this is a great bleſſing: what
man would be willing to looſe the ſight of his eyes, to gaine
a world? becauſe it diſcovers ſo much of the glory of God.
Now if the eye that receives onely theſe naturall things, be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40441:49"/>
ſo preecious O then what is it to have a principle within us,
an eye of faith clearly to evidence the great things and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
councels of God unto us? if a chriſtall that can receive
colours into it from without, be precious; O what is the
chriſtall of faith? it may well be called precious faith, for it
receives into the ſoul the glory of God, and the excellencies of
Chriſt; and the great things of eternall life. And theſe are
brought into the ſoul by faith, in the reallity and power of
them to raiſe the heart, and to fill it with all joy and peace in
believing, and to carry the ſoul through all the troubles of
this world. O the eye of faith is a precious eye! the eye of
ſenſe is precious, becauſe we can ſee viſible objects by that;
but the eye of reaſon is more precious, becauſe that can make
things ſeen which are not ſeen by the eye of ſenſe; reaſon can
diſcourſe up to God himſelf: and it is the wonderfull excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of a reaſonable creature that God hath given him that
ability, that he can diſcourſe ſo from the effect to the cauſe,
and from one cauſe to another, till at laſt he gets up to God,
the firſt being of all. This is an admirable indowment we
ſhould bleſſe God for: but now, if the uſe of reaſon have ſuch
an excellency in it; becauſe by that we have an evidence of
reaſonable things to us, then ſtill goe higher and labour to
have a right eſteem of this precious faith, that gives unto us
ſuch evidence of the glorious things of God, even that
faith that God puts into our hearts on purpoſe that by it we
might be able to receive into our ſouls thoſe glorious and
hidden myſteries of godlineſſe that doe infinitely concerne our
eternall peace.</p>

indeed.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN this Chapter we have Chriſt continuing of his conteſt
with the wrangling peeviſh <hi>Jewes,</hi> in anſwering all that
they ſaid, notwithſtanding they ſnarled at every word al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
that paſt. But however it was with the multitude, yet
there were ſome that were taken with what he ſaid: for in
verſ. 30. it is ſaid, <hi>As he ſpake theſe words many believed on
him,</hi> at leaſt there were ſome beginnings of faith, or ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
to it. And Chriſt tells them verſ. 31. <hi>That if they
continued in his word, then they were his diſciples indeed:</hi> as if he
ſhould ſay, it is not enough that you are ſtirred for the preſent
and profeſſe you believe in me; I will not take you for my
diſciples, unleſſe you continue in my word: how often doe
the flaſhes that are upon the hearts and conſciences of men
vaniſh and come to nothing? they continue not in the word
of Chriſt, and therefore are not his diſciples. Chriſt tells them
further, that they muſt underſtand more concerning their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
then yet they apprehended. <hi>And ye ſhall know the truth,
and the truth ſhall make you free.</hi> v. 32. as if he ſhould ſay, though
you have ſome confuſed apprehenſions of things for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
yet it is but very little you know of your condition: but
if you will goe on in the way that God is beginning with you,
in ſtirring your conſciences; if you will continue, you ſhall
come to know more then yet you know, <hi>Ye ſhall know the truth,
and the truth ſhall make you free;</hi> and then in verſ. 33. ſay they,
<hi>we are Abrahams ſeed, and were never in bondage to any man; how
ſayeſt thou, ye ſhall be made free.</hi> See here, they begin to ſnarle
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40441:50"/>
againe. Maſter <hi>Calvin,</hi> I remember, thinks that theſe are the
words rather of ſome other of the <hi>Jewes</hi> that were preſent,
then of thoſe that are ſaid before to believe: but others think
it may be underſtood even of thoſe that are ſaid to believe;
for though they did begin to aſſent to the doctrine of Chriſt,
and were very much convinced, yet there was ſtill abundance
of frowardneſſe, perverſneſſe and crookedneſſe in their ſpirits:
ſo that they begin againe to wrangle with Chriſt, eſpecially
when he doth but intimate to them any thing of their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.
It is a uſual thing for many people, that have ſome ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of conſcience, and ſome beginnings of the working of
Gods ſpirit in them, and it may be ſaving ones too, yet to
continue a long time in much frowardneſſe, and perverſneſſe of
ſpirit, if they be oppoſed in their way. Therefore, ſay they, doe
you ſpeak to us of bondage, and tells us of freedome? why, <hi>We
were never in bondage to any.</hi> verſ. 33. What never in bondage to
any? were not the <hi>Jewes</hi> in bondage to the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> when
in captivity to them? and were they not at this very time in
bondage to the <hi>Romans?</hi> and yet <hi>we were never in bondage:</hi>
thus carnall hearts, till grace fully ſubdue them, are very loth
to know their wretched condition; they love not to heare of
any thing that diſcovers to them the miſery that they are in:
they were never in bondage, they ſay, but yet Chriſt pittyeth
them: he did not take advantage to fling away preſently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſaw them continue ſtill in their perverſneſſe, and ſnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at what he ſpake, but tells them, what bondage he meant.
As if he ſhould ſay, the truth is, though you think your ſelves
free, yet there is a bondage that you are in, and ſuch a bondage
that none can deliver you, but the Son of God alone. <hi>If the Son
therefore ſhall make you free, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> Thus we
come to the words of the Text.</p>
               <p>Theſe words, you ſee then, hold forth unto us the bleſſed
liberty of the Goſpel; that freedome that believers have by
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I come then preſently to the maine doctrinal concluſion,
which is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is a bleſſed liberty, that Chriſtians enjoy by Chriſt, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by him.</hi> This doctrine of Chriſtian liberty that is enjoyed by
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40441:50"/>
Chriſt, is a Treaſury of abundance of admirable conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and much of the myſtery of the Goſpell is contained
in this doctrine. I ſhould enlarge my diſcourſe too
farre, and ſeek to gripe too much, ſhould I think to give you
but a view of this doctrine in all the points of it. If we ſhould
intend to handle it at large, I ſhould ſhew to you. 1. What
that is that Chriſt doth ſet believers free from. 2. The privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of this freedome they have by Chriſt. 3. The Subject
of it: who it is that hath this freedome. 4. By whom it
comes: how it is by the Son, and onely by him. 5. The
price and purchaſe of this freedome. 6. The intereſt that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
have in this freedome: how they come to be enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed
and to have intereſt in it. And 7. the application of it.
But ſhould <hi>I</hi> goe this way to work, it is but little <hi>I</hi> ſhould be
able to doe: therefore <hi>I</hi> will not graſpe ſo much. <hi>I</hi> intend
therefore to handle but one ſpeciall thing in this our freedome
by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſhew to you, firſt of all what we are freed from;
then there is the freedome from the law, the freedome from the
power of ſinne, the freedome from the bondage of feare, the
freedome from an accuſing conſcience, the freedome from ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſſe
in the performance of holy duties; we are ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in holy duties; the freedome from death, and the evill
of that; the freedome from the ſlavery of the devill, and the
freedome from the ceremonial law; but neither muſt we ſeek
to gripe all theſe particulars: to ſhew you our freedome in
theſe, <hi>I</hi> ſhall onely pitch upon one, and that is our freedome
from the law. <hi>If the Son therefore ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be
free indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The doctrine of freedome from the law, is the ſubject that
we are to handle at this time: and when <hi>I</hi> ſpeak of freedome
from the law, I meane, not freedome from obedience to the
law: tis an erronious conceit, to think we are freed from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the law: and it is a conceit too meane and abſurd
for us to ſpend time about it now, that have ſo little, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to deal in a matter of ſo great conſequence as we have;
for what is the law, but the image of God, the very beame of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40441:51"/>
the wiſdome and holineſſe of God himſelf, if you look at it,
as requiring obedience; and for any to ſay, we ſhould be freed
from obedience to the law, is as much as to ſay, we ſhould be
freed from the image of God, from the beame of the wiſdome
and holineſſe of God himſelf, therefore we will ſpend no time
about that, but when I ſpeak of freedome from the law, I mean
freedome from the rigour of the law, from the condemning
ſentence of the law, in which all the rigour of it appeares.</p>
               <p>Wherefore then it is neceſſary, firſt to give you a view of the
bondage that we are all in, under the law, unleſſe delivered by
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And then Secondly, I ſhall endeavour to open to you,
wherein the liberty of the Goſpell doth conſiſt, that Chriſt
hath purchaſed for us, Theſe two things (brethren) have in
them the chiefe doctrine of divinity, and except you be well
inſtructed and ſetled in theſe two, you cannot know aright
any point of religion.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: I will be but briefe in that, though there be
many particulars in it, for it is the ſecond I chiefly intend.
And for a preparation to this firſt, this I ſhall tell you before
hand, that I ſhall name many things unto you that will ſeem
exceeding hard; but yet take this conſideration along, that
although the things I name to you appeare never ſo hard, yet
they are but in order to that which I ſhall afterward deliver
to you, that ſhall have much comfort and peace in it. If I tell
you any thing of your bondage, it is onely to this end, that
you may know the bleſſedneſſe of your freedome and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>Wherefore then, for the rigour of the law (that you may
know what you are freed from) you muſt know what this is,
and what you are all <hi>under</hi> by nature as conſidered out of
Chriſt, for ſo the holy Ghoſt expreſſeth our ſubjection to the
law, he ſaith, we are <hi>under</hi> it. <hi>Rom. 6. 14. Now ye are not under
the law:</hi> there was a time when they were under the law; firſt,
then the rigour of the law is in this, it requires hard things of
thoſe that are under it. I ſhall ſhew you afterward, how the
things are not ſo to thoſe that are ſet free by Chriſt: but to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40441:51"/>
thoſe that are under the law it is a hard yoke, it requires hard
things, things that are croſſe and contrary to the hearts and
diſpoſitions of all that are under it; things between which and
their hearts there is an enmity and antipathy. Now to require
ſuch things as one hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inde to, but are quite contrary to
ones nature, and that ones nature hath an antipathy againſt;
this is very tedious; and yet ſuch are all the duties of the law,
to thoſe that are in bondage to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the law requires not onely hard, but impoſſible
things, impoſſible to be performed by thoſe that are under it, the
law it is a yoke that neither we nor our fathers were able to bear
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. but that you wil ſay is meant of the ceremoniall law:
I, but there is more in it then ſo, for do but conſider the occaſion
of that ſpeech, it was upon this ground, there were ſome that
came from the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
and they troubled the diſciples there with two doctrines, the
doctrine of the neceſſity of the ceremoniall law, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of being juſtified by the law; now this Church of <hi>Antioch</hi>
ſends to the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to be ſatisfied about both
theſe queſtions, and that which is ſpoken is ſpoken concerning
them both, not onely the ceremonial law was that whereby
they lookt for juſtification, but the morrall law too, and
both were a yoke that neither they nor their fathers were able
to bear; and the rather it muſt be meant of both, becauſe in the
very next words we finde it oppoſed to the grace of Chriſt, in
verſ. 11. <hi>But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, we ſhall be ſaved even as they.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, you
muſt not think to be ſaved by the law, but by the grace of the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now the grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
is oppoſed to our juſtification, by obedience to the morrall
law, as well as to the ceremonial: ſo that the morral law is
a yoke that neither we nor our fathers were able to beare. It
requires of us ſuch things as are impoſſible to be done by thoſe
that are under it. We muſt not diſpute now how this can be,
or the juſtice of it; that will fall in afterward.</p>
               <p>And then thirdly, the law exacts all of us under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of perfection: the law accepts of nothing but that which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40441:52"/>
is compleat and abſolutely perfect every way, both in regard
of the principle from whence, and the manner how, and the
rule by which, and end to which, it requires abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the law accepts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it muſt have it done
in our own perſons: like a ſevere creditor that will be paid
to the utmoſt farthing, and by our ſelves. I ſay the law, in it
ſelf conſidered, lookes for a perfect righteouſneſſe of our own
perſons, or elſe it condemnes us, this is the righteouſneſſe of
the law, <hi>That he that doth the things therein contained, ſhall live
by them. Rom.</hi> 10. 5. He that <hi>doth:</hi> there muſt be doing, and
that by himſelf perſonally, or not at at all.</p>
               <p>But it may be, though there be much required, yet upon
ſome endeavours there may be ſome remiſſion.</p>
               <p>In the fift place therefore, ſuch is the rigour and ſeverity
of the law, that let us endeavour never ſo much to obey it,
yet all our endeavours are rejected, if they come not up to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
obedience: Tis a vaine plea of many people to ſay, they
doe what they can, and deſire well, and endeavour well; It
is true, this is ſomewhat to thoſe that are children, and have
freedome by Chriſt (as you ſhall heare by and by) but to thoſe
that are under the law, endeavours to obey, though never ſo
ſtrong, if the work be not done, are not accepted by God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the law requires conſtancy in all theſe: ſuppoſe we
could obey the law, or goe on very farre in many things, yet
ſuch are the termes between God and us, as we are under the
law, that if we were able to obey the law in every thing as
long as we live, till the very laſt moment, and ſhould offend
but in any one particular at the laſt moment, were it not for
this freedome we have by this Son, we were utterly undone
for ever; you may ſee by the way ſtill as you goe of what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
concernment our freedome by Chriſt is. You muſt look
to your ſelves how you get deliverance by Chriſt, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this is your condition as long as you are under the
law.</p>
               <p>Seaventhly, the law exacts the obedience it requires ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
rigorouſly, in a way of violence upon all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40441:52"/>
it, it comes roughly upon them as <hi>Pharoahs</hi> task-maſters;
it requires the work, and lookes not at ſtrength, ſtrength or no
ſtrength, the work is required, and required with exceeding
rigour, with dreadful threatning if it be not performed: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is, the law was delivered in ſo dreadfull a manner with
thundering, and lightning, and earthquakes, and fire, ſo that it
made even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf to ſhake and tremble at the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of delivering it, and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 2. it is called a <hi>fiery law,</hi>
it came with mighty rigour: that is the ſeaventh.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, there is this rigour in the law too, that upon any
breach of it in the leaſt thing, it doth by the ſeverity of it
break the ſoule, ſo that it doth utterly diſinable it for ever
performing any obedience to it again: there is ſuch hardneſs
in the covenant of the Law, the Law is like an Iron or Brazen
wall, that upon any breach of it, the ſoule is but as an earthen
veſſell, that daſhes againſt it, and is broken in pieces; ſo that
there muſt be a creating power to make it whole again: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
I beſeech you, I ſay, this is the condition of the Covenant
of workes, which was made with us in <hi>Adam,</hi> which is now
the covenant of the Law, that upon any one breach, by the
ſeverity of it, it breaks the ſoule, ſo that it doth utterly difin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
it, for keeping it again: it roots out all the principles
whereby the ſoule ſhould be enabled to obey again: ſinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Goſpel do not do ſo, as you ſhall heare hereafter. And
this is the very ground, why upon the firſt ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi>
we were all gone, and ſo were the Angels upon their ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they had to deale with God onely in a covenant of
works. But if upon the breach of the Law, we come to have
all principles rooted out by which we ſhould keep it, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
it will (we hope) pitty us, and not exact obedience from
us.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the ninth place, notwithſtanding this, the Law
goes on in its curſe, and requires as perfect obedience, and
that upon pain of eternall death, to every thing of it, as if we
had all principles that might enable us to keep it ſtill: this is
the ſeverity of the Law, it doth not remit at all of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or puniſhment, or exactneſſe of obedien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40441:53"/>
we have loſt all power to obey it.</p>
               <p>Yea further in the tenth place, it requires this of us, and
gives us no ſtrength at all to doe what it requires; it findes us
diveſted of thoſe principles that once we had to yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and it affords us no new principles: therefore ſome have
compared the ſeverity of it to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Task-maſters; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the tale of Brick, but gives no ſtrength at all.</p>
               <p>Yet further in the eleventh place. In all it doth, it ſtrikes at
our life; the Law is ſatisfied with no affliction; let it be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſt
in the leaſt degree, all the afflictions that can poſſibly be in
this world, will not ſatisfie it: ſuch is the ſeverity of it (I ſay)
that it ſtrikes at life, and at eternall life, it follows to purſue us
to our blood, to temporall and eternall death: and here I might
open the condemning ſentence of the Law, but that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a ſubject by it ſelfe, therefore I only name what is in this
head, that it ſtrikes at our lives, upon every tranſgreſſion of it.</p>
               <p>Again twelfthly, the ſeverity of it, is in this, that upon any
breach it doth preſently binde over the ſoule (though it doe
not execute it preſently) by the ſtrongeſt bonds that poſſible
can be, to everlaſting death; it ſuſpends execution, but the
bond is immediately ſealed upon the breach of it: ſo that all
men, upon every breach of it, have chains clapt upon their
ſoules, which is the guilt of ſinne, whereby they ſtand bound
to eternall death, by ſuch bonds as all created power in heaven
and earth is not able to looſe.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, In the next place, ſuch is the ſeverity of the law,
that when it is once offended, it will never be made amends
again by any thing we are able to doe. Suppoſe we have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Law in ſome one thing, and that but once; if after
this, we ſhould endeavour what we can for our lives, and ſwelter
our heart bloods to obey the Law, and think to make up the
breach we have made, yet we can never make it amends again.
It is true, ſome, though they be offended, yet by double dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
may be pleaſed again: but we muſt never think to doe
ſo with God; being under the law, when we have once broken
it, we cannot with all our care and diligence be able to
make it am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>s; and that is a great part of the ſeverity of the
Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:40441:53"/>
I, but what have we to doe, but to mourn and cry, and rent
our hearts becauſe of this diſtreſſed condition we are in.</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, Nay the Law accepts of no repentance; it will
not diſcharge the guilt of any one ſinne, for all the ſorrow in
the world. And here lieth a great miſtake of people, when
they have offended, they think they will be carefull to make
amends; and they will mourn and repent, &amp;c. It is true, if you
be under the covenant of grace, this is ſomething; but if you
be in your naturall condition, ſhould you weep your hearts
out, and ſend ſtreames of blood from your eyes, in mourning
but for any one ſinne; ſuppoſe that which thou counteſt a little
matter, a ſinne in thought, ſhouldeſt thou reſolve to cry out
and mourne for that one ſinne all thy life, it will not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
unleſſe thou commeſt under the bleſſed liberty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
by Chriſt: therefore know the difference of being under
the Law and under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Fifteenthly, Yet further, ſuch is the rigour of the Law, that
when it hath opened our wounds and miſeries, it goes no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
it ſhews us no means of deliverance: like a Surgeon, that
opens the wound, but applies no remedy. Certainly were it
not for a Mediator, we ſhould finde the Law onely to open our
wound, and there leave us.</p>
               <p>Sixteenthly, but yet again, ſuch is our bondage to the Law,
that inſtead of mortifying any of our ſinnes, it rather ſtirres
them up, and makes them more: it threatneth indeed grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
things againſt the tranſgreſſors of it, but it doth not
mortifie any ſinne; it doth ſtir up luſt, (though accidentally)
and makes our ſin out of meaſure ſinfull.</p>
               <p>Sevententhly, Yea there is one thing more, after all this: If
we ſhould keepe the Law, yet the promiſes of it are but mean
and low in compariſon of the promiſes of the Goſpel. I doe
not ſay they are but temporall, though before the Goſpell
was revealed, there was but little of Spirituall promiſes, yet
we know what the Apoſtle ſayes, 2 <hi>Timoth. 1. 10. That life and
immortality is brought to light through the Goſpel.</hi> And though I do
not ſay, there are none, yet there are very few Scriptures of the
old Teſtament that ſpeak of eternall life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:40441:54"/>
Thus you ſee your bondage under the Law, and ſurely you
will now think it a bleſſed condition, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o be freed from the
Law. And 'tis one Argument that a ſoule is delivered from
the bondage of the Law, when it can heare all this, and yield to
Gods juſtice in it, and can have the heart raiſed to God in
the hearing of it. But if the ſoule at the hearing of theſe things,
think them ſo hard and unreaſonable, that it is ready to riſe at
them, it is a ſigne that the ſpirit is not acquainted with them;
and although theſe things may ſeem hard unto us, yet if we
conſider but three or foure particulars, they will not appeare
ſo hard.</p>
               <p>Firſt, doe but conſider, you have to deale with a God of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
juſtice and worth; indeed did we look upon God, as we
look upon a creature like our ſelves, we ſhould think it mighty
hard: but now, when we have to deale with a God of infinite
worth, we ſhould not think it hard.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſhall not think it hard, if we conſider that
ſtate of perfection wherein God made man at firſt: however it
is with us now, yet God did at firſt give us a ſtock to trade in
the way of obedience, and to enable us to doe what the law
required.</p>
               <p>And then Thirdly, if you did but underſtand aright what
ſin is, then you would not think it hard, that upon that ſin, we
ſhould be given up to ſuch a woful condition we ſpeak of: if
you look upon ſin as that which ſtrikes at an infinite deity, at
the very being of God himſelf, as much as in us lyeth, then
you will not wonder that one ſin ſhould bring us into ſuch a
hard condition.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if we conſider thoſe things that we all take for
granted that yet are as hard as theſe, and doe but lay them
with them, and they will not ſeem ſo hard. As that God for
one thought, ſhould caſt the Angels into eternal torments; and
not ſo much as parly with them about any termes of peace:
and that God for one ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhould condemne all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
you all grant this in the general; yea further that God
the Father ſhould deal ſo with his own Son, the Son of his
love, as to make him a curſe for man; and ſhould lay the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40441:54"/>
weight of his wrath upon him, ſo as to make him ſweat drops
of bloud, and to cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for ſaken
me?</hi> if you had never heard of ſuch a thing, this would ſeem
as hard as any thing we have ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>Now before we come to ſpeak of the other, let that which
hath been ſaid teach us, that ſurely then, all men in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
condition are in a hard caſe: as the Iſraelites when the
bondage they were in under <hi>Pharoah</hi> encreaſed upon them,
the Text ſayes, they ſaw themſelves in an evil caſe. O that
upon the hearing of theſe things, you would learne to ſee what
you are out of Chriſt: that you would ſee your ſelves in an
evil caſe, in a ſad and dangerous condition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if this be the caſe that every ſoul naturally is
under ſuch a bondage to the law: then the ſaving of a ſoul
is a great and a mighty work; yea ſuch a work, that God
muſt make heaven and earth to move to ſave a ſoul; and to
deliver it from the bondage of ſin: the reaſon why people doe
ſo ſlight this great work of ſalvation and mediation by Chriſt
is, becauſe they know not their bondage. Vnderſtand but this
bondage aright, what it is to be under the law (I have not
told you all this while of the condemnation of the law or the
curſe of the law: I have onely ſet out to you the bondage of
the rigour of the law) and by this you will ſee it is a great
work to ſave a ſoul.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you may ſee by this, how that vaine plea of carnal
hearts comes to nothing; what will you truſt now to your
good meanings, good deſires, and good intentions? and you
will mourne and grieve, becauſe you are no better; and you
will doe what you can for God: tis true, theſe are good things
but are theſe the things you reſt in for ſtanding before God? if
they be, certainly you know not the termes you ſtand in to
God, nor what your bondage is.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if God reveales himſelf to a man only by the law,
it is impoſſible but the ſoul of that man muſt flye off from him
and look upon God and his law as enemies to him, unleſſe it
were revealed together with the Goſpel. Which is that I am
now to tell you of, even that liberty we have by the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:40441:55"/>
Therefore then for the liberty of the Goſpel, it is a precious
liberty, wherein the treaſury of the myſtery of grace is laid up:
it is the onely ground of ſupport to our ſouls; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
that was the great inſtrument of God in opening the doctrine
of the liberty of the Goſpel, ſets it down in all his Epiſtles;
and in many places elegantly: and in one Text wherein is
ſome difficulty, In <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. from verſe 21, and ſo forward, <hi>Tell
me, ye that deſire to be under the law, doe ye not heare the law? for
it is written, that Abraham had two ſons, the one by a bond-maid,
the other by a free woman: but he who was of the bond-woman, was
borne after the fleſh, but be of the free-woman, was by promiſe:
which things are an allegory; for theſe are the two covenants, the one
from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage which is Agar;
for this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and anſwereth to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
which now is, and is in bondage with her children: but Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
which is above, is free, which is the mother of us all: for it is
written, rejoyce thou barren that beareſt not, breake forth and cry
thou that travelleſt not: for the deſolate hath many more children,
then ſhe which hath an husband.</hi> The Text ſeemes at the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of it, to be ſomewhat obſcure; and yet doth moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
ſet out this doctrine I am now upon, of bondage under
the law, and liberty under the Goſpel: the allegory, you ſee,
is from the two ſons; <hi>Abraham</hi> had one Son by a bond-maid,
another by a free woman; <hi>It is an allegory,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle,
and it ſignifies the two covenants; the covenant of workes,
and the covenant of grace: the covenant of workes, that was
from mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> there was the law revealed, which is <hi>Agar,
for this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia.</hi> I remember <hi>Luther</hi> ſayes;
that <hi>Agar</hi> in the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue is as much as mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
they call it ſo in the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue: and ſo the Apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes
to it; therefore the law that is of <hi>Agar,</hi> that tends onely
to bondage. <hi>Agars</hi> poſterity were Gentiles, and in bondage,
and were not to have the priviledge of the Sons of the free wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
therefore all thoſe that have to deal with God in the
covenant of workes, are bond-men; and are not to have the
priviledge of the children of the free woman, of the children
of God. Well, <hi>This Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40441:55"/>
to Jeruſalem, which now is, and is in bondage with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,</hi>
he ſets out the eſtate of the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
that now is, to be an eſtate of bondage, in compariſon
of the Church of the Goſpel; becauſe they had ſo little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Goſpel, but were in bondage unto the law, and
knew little elſe but the law. But <hi>Jeruſalem which is above,</hi>
that is the ſtate of the Church under the new Teſtament,
is above, in regard of the Goſpel, which is free, and is the
mother of us all: the Church of God under the Goſpel is
the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above; <hi>but now it is written, rejoyce thou
barren that beareſt not, break forth and cry thou that travelleſt
not; for the deſolate hath many more children then ſhe which hath
an husband.</hi> That is, thoſe that acknowledge the doctrine
of the liberty of the Goſpel, at firſt are but as deſolate, as the
barren woman, before it be revealed; as <hi>Sarah</hi> was barren for
a while, but afterward ſhe had a childe: ſo the doctrine of the
liberty of the Goſpel, is but as a barren thing for a while, till
people are acquainted with it; and we that are Miniſters of the
Goſpel, it is our worke to beget children to Chriſt, If we
ſhould be legall and preach onely the law, we ſhould beget
children to bondage, to <hi>Agar,</hi> but this is our chiefe work, to
beget children to the free woman; to beget children to the
free grace of God in Chriſt. And O that I could beget one
childe to this free woman! I cannot think, but that there may
be many here that are children of <hi>Agar,</hi> that it may be have
had terrours, and feares in their conſciences; and yet are but
children of the bond-woman ſtill: Now it is the Goſpell that
proclaimes the Trumpet of Jubile to thoſe that are under
bondage; therefore it is obſervable what time the Trumpet of
the Jubile was to be blown, <hi>Levit. 29. 9. Then ſhalt thou cauſe
the Trumpet of the Jubile to ſound, on the tenth day of the ſeventh
moneth, in the your land.</hi> What was this day of atonement? it
was the day of the publike humiliation of all the people for
their ſins: the day of faſting and prayer appointed by God to
afflict their ſouls, is called a day of atonement, and the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
to proclaime the Jubile muſt be blown upon that very
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40441:56"/>
day, wherein the people had been afflicting their ſouls for
their ſins: therefore now, if there be any ſoul that hath been
humbled before the Lord and hath been afflicted for ſin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
this is the work that is now to be done, to blow the
Trumpet of <hi>Jubile</hi> to ſuch a ſoul, and to proclaime liberty in
the name of Chriſt unto you, and as the Pſalmiſt ſayes, <hi>Pſalm.
89. 15. Bleſſed is the people that know the joyfull ſound.</hi> It is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
by ſome, they are bleſſed that know the joyful
ſound of the Jubile. Now this Jubile having reference to our
Jubile by Chriſt, bleſſed are they that heare this joyful ſound
that we have here in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Now the firſt thing of this joyful ſound of the Jubile, and
liberty we have proclaimed by Chriſt from the law, is this,
thou ſhalt not be caſt for thy eternal eſtate by the law; the law
may terrifie thee, but it ſhall not caſt thee; indeed it muſt caſt
the children that are in bondage to it, for their eternal eſtate;
but if thou beeſt a believer in Chriſt, if thou art a childe of the
free woman, this is thy liberty, I ſay, thou ſhalt not be caſt for
thy eternal eſtate by the law, we doe not love to have any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
of great concernment to be caſt by thoſe that are rigid
and ſevere, be of good comfort O believer, thou haſt heard of
much ſeverity in the law: but the great buſineſſe concerning
thy ſoul and eternal eſtate, is above the law; It hath nothing
to doe with thee; thou heareſt many times dreadful threats of
the law, and theſe threats it may be doe often terrifie thee, and
thou art ready to ſay, who can ſtand before this holy God?
but peace be to thee thou believing ſoul, for thou art ſet at
liberty from the law by Chriſt; and this is the firſt joyful
ſound.</p>
               <p>The ſecond joyful ſound of liberty thou haſt by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
is this, thy law-giver is no other then he that is thine hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
thou haſt to deal with no other now, in the matters of
thy ſoul but with him that is thy husband and thy advocate
by whom all is ruled, <hi>John 1. 2. 1. If we ſin, we have an advocate
with the Father: and advocate,</hi> that is, thou haſt to deal now with
Chriſt thy law-giver, who upon every tranſgreſſion, preſently
is thy advocate with the Father, who ſtands up to plead for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40441:56"/>
thee, and to anſwer all accuſations againſt thee; I ſay, he that
undertakes for thee, and engageth all the intereſt he hath in
his Father, for thee, thou haſt to deal with him, for thy
law-giver, about thy ſoul and eternal eſtate; and this is the
ſecond joyful ſound thou haſt of the Trumpet of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile
of the Goſpel, of the liberty thou haſt by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, being delivered from the bondage of the law,
this is now thy liberty, that thou art made a law to thy
ſelf. I meane thus: there is nothing now required of thee
but it is written in thy own heart: God writes his law in
the tables of ſtone: and all that is required of thee in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to it, is written in thy heart: ſo that thou doeſt
not now ſo much yeild obedience to the law; becauſe of the
condemning power of it, and puniſhment due unto it, as
from a principle of love to it: For we muſt know, that
we are not ſet free by Chriſt from obedience to the law, we
are bound to obey the law ſtill; but here is the difference,
we are not ſervile to the law, we keep it freely: thou
keepeſt the law now, by being a law to thy ſelf, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all that God requires of thee in his law written in
thy heart, by the law of ſanctity that he hath given thee;
that is the third joyful ſound.</p>
               <p>The fourth joyful ſound, is this; by the liberty thou
haſt now by Chriſt, this is thy condition, that whatever
thou doeſt, though there be never ſo many imperfections
in it, yet if God can ſpy out but the leaſt good thing in
thee, he will take notice of that, and caſt away all the
evil: if God ſees but any thing of his own ſpirit in thee,
he will be ſure to take notice of that. If there be but one
duſt of Gold, though it be mixt with abundance of droſſe,
God will not looſe it, but will finde it out: God he is
not ſtrict to mark what is done amiſſe by his children, but
he is ſtrict to marke what is done well by them. Indeed
the law tells us, nay a moral man will tell us, that
to make an action good, all circumſtances muſt concurre:
but the liberty of the Goſpel tells us, that where there is
any good, any grace in an action, God obſerves and takes
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40441:57"/>
notice of it. To give but one inſtance for this, and it is
an excellent one for this purpoſe, <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 3. 6. the Apoſtle
propounds <hi>Sarah</hi> as a patterne for good women, <hi>Even as
Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord.</hi> Shee never calls him
Lord; but then when ſhee did it unbelievingly, and yet
God takes notice of that word, and never mentions her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe.
Now <hi>Sarah</hi> was a free woman; and this is the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
dealing of God with the free woman; and if thou beeſt
a child of the free woman, this is thy priviledge, that God wil
take notice of every good action thou doeſt. <hi>Iſai. 42. 3. A bruiſed
reed ſhall he not break, and the ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench,</hi>
The word ſignifies as ſoon as ever the flax begins to be black,
God will not reject it: ſo that if there be but the leaſt degree
of good, it is accepted. And that is the fourth joyful ſound by
the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The fifth joyful ſound, is this, ſuppoſe thou canſt not doe
any thing, yet if there be but a will, a deſire in thee, God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
that will for the deed. Many carnal hearts pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with this, but this is the caſe of thoſe that are ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
by Chriſt: perhaps thou canſt not pray; I but preſent
thy ſelf before God, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, and that ſhall be
accepted of God; and know if ther be any excuſe to be made
for thee, Chriſt will finde it out, and make it before God for
thee; that is the fifth joyful ſound.</p>
               <p>The ſixt thing wherein the liberty we have by Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts,
is, that though the Goſpel call for obedience, yet it doth
it in ſuch a ſweet and loving way that it would make any
heart in the world in love with it, it drawes by the cords of
love. 2. <hi>Cor. 5. 20. Now then we are ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as
though God did beſeech you by us: we pray you in Chriſt ſtead, be ye
reconciled to God;</hi> and <hi>Philip. 2. 1. If there be therefore any conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the ſpirit,
if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, &amp;c.</hi> The Goſpel comes
not as the law upon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with thunder and lightning,
and darkneſſe, but it comes in a milde and gentle way, and
by that allures and draws the ſoul unto it ſelf; and that is the
ſixt joyful ſound.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:40441:57"/>
The ſeventh joyful ſound of the Goſpel is, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
and liberty of it comes, as gently, ſo with abundance of
life and ſtrength, together with it: it comes as the ſpirit is,
and where the ſpirit is, there is power, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes,
I remember <hi>Luther</hi> hath this note upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. ſayes he, the
law is a ſpiritual law, becauſe it is the law of God; but it
is not the law of the ſpirit of life: tis the law of the Goſpel
that brings the ſpirit of power and life along with it; there
goes a vertue together with the commands of the Goſpel to
ſtrengthen the ſould to obedience: And the Goſpel gives
grace and ſtrength beyond what <hi>Adam</hi> had, two wayes:
the grace that <hi>Adam</hi> had was onely a power to doe, but
there was not the will and the deed given: but the grace
of the Goſpel, it gives both the power, and the will, and
the deed.</p>
               <p>The eight joyful ſound of the Goſpel, is that tender
pity and compaſſion that is in God to thoſe that are made
free by it. This is the difference between the ſins of thoſe
that are under the law, and thoſe under the Goſpel: the
ſins of thoſe under the law makes them hated by God:
but the ſins of thoſe that are under the Goſpel, makes
them pityed by God.</p>
               <p>The ninth joyful ſound is this: the Goſpel hath a mighty ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
to melt the heart, and to reſolve it into ſorrow and
mourning, &amp; ſuch mourning, that is one of the moſt acceptable
things to God in the world; the law, I told you, accepts not
of repentance: I, but the Goſpel doth; the teares of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
that come from believers, next to the blood of Jeſus
Chriſt, are the moſt precious things in the world. I ſay, next
to the drops of the blood of Chriſt, the drops of thy teares,
coming from Evangelical repentance, are moſt acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God: That is the ninth joyful ſound.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, another is this; the Goſpel it comes with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
as it hath a melting power, ſo it hath a healing power.
Chriſt is deſcribed to come with healing in his wings: water
makes the lime burne the more, but oyle which provokes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things to burne quenches that: ſo it is with the oyle of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40441:58"/>
the Goſpel, Chriſt was annointed for this purpoſe, to heal
thee, and to quench thy luſt and corruptions, In <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. 18.
we have an excellent promiſe, verſ. 17. <hi>He went on frowardly
in the way of his heart,</hi> marke what followes, <hi>I have ſeen his
wayes, and I will heal him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eleventh joyful ſound is, that now being ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by Chriſt, though thou doeſt ſin not onely againſt the
law, but againſt the Goſpel, thy ſins againſt the Goſpel ſhall
not have power to root out any habits of grace; but ſtill the
grace of the Goſpel will uphold the habits of grace in thy
ſoul. It is otherwiſe with the law, for one offence againſt
the law doth not onely root out the habit that is contrary to
that offence, but all other habits alſo: but the grace of the
Goſpel is ſuch that the habits of grace within us are not
touched.</p>
               <p>The twelfth joyful ſound is this: the Goſpel is ſo full of
grace that it takes advantage of our miſery; this is a good
argument of the tenour of the Goſpel, <hi>Pardon my ſin O Lord,
for it is great;</hi> ſtrange argument of a childe of the bond-woman;
but a good argument of a childe of the free-woman;
and tis Gods argument, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 21. I will not deſtroy the
world againe, for the imagination of mans heart is evil from
his youth.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, Another joyful ſound of the Goſpel is this
the Goſpel proclaimes this liberty to us, that all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us may be done, and accepted, by and from another,
namely Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, Further the grace of the Goſpel ſhewes a
way wherein God ſhall have all the wrong made him up, that
ever thy ſins did him: for ſuppoſe the Goſpel had proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that God were willing to pardon, this were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
as long as God ſtood wronged: but now the
Goſpel doth not onely proclaime to thee, that God is
content to forgive thee all thy ſins, but it tells thee of a
way how God ſhall have all the wrong made up that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thou haſt done him: and this Son that ſets thee at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hath undertaken it, and hath done it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:40441:58"/>
Fifteenthly, And then another joyful ſound of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is this, That there is a moſt abſolute perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
made over to us; the righteouſneſſe of the Son of
God is thine, made over to thee, to be preſented before
the Father for thee.</p>
               <p>Sixteenthly, yet further: there is this joyful ſound of
the Goſpel: It proclaimes admirable promiſes, glorious
and high things; even the infinite Treaſures of Gods
grace: the Son is come from the boſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and hath opened the treaſures of the grace of
God, and hath diſcovered thoſe things that were kept
ſecret from the foundations of the world.</p>
               <p>Seventeenthly, And yet there is one thing more,
that is neceſſary for the full conſolation of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Goſpel, and this bleſſed Jubile, that
it may make a Jubile indeed in thy heart; and that
is this: that ſuch is the covenant of the Goſpel,
and Chriſt hath ſo undertaken for thee, that it ſhall
never be forfeited: this is the full, rich, and glorious
grace of the Goſpel, that now Chriſt hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and engaged himſelf to the Father; and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath promiſed, and hath engaged his own truth,
and mercy, and faithfulneſſe, that this covenant ſhall
never be forfeited: yea the very condition of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
that is required of thee, is that which Chriſt
hath undertaken to the Father to performe in thee.
If perſeverance be a ſpiritual bleſſing, it is part of
the purchaſe of Chriſt, and muſt ſtand: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
peace be to thee, thou art in ſuch a condition
as thou canſt not forfeit and breake the covenant: the
marriage covenant between thee and thy Saviour can
never be diſſolved.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now have ſhewn you a little more the
bleſſedneſſe of this liberty, that all this grace comes
in and by the Son; not from the bounty of God in
general, but in a higher way, by the Son of God we
come to be ſet at liberty, by being made one with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40441:59"/>
him who is God and man, the heire of all things,
and ſo are made co-heires with him. But I muſt here
breake off.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe ſcope of the Holy Ghoſt in this Epiſtle, is to prove
the excellency of Chriſt: that he is the Meſſiah
that was to come into the world; and that all the
types and ſhadowes of the law pointed at him: And a ſpecial
part of the Epiſtle is to ſhew the excellency of the Prieſthood
of Chriſt, by preferring it above the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron:</hi> and
amongſt other regards, in this, that thoſe Prieſts did offer up
ſacrifices often, but Chriſt offered himſelf but once; and this
once offering of himſelf was available for ever, and needed
no further offering. And this the Holy Ghoſt doth illuſtrate,
by comparing the efficacy of Chriſts ſufferings, with the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of what a man doth here in this world: that as the actions
of men here in this world, whatever they are, whether good
or evil, are available for ever; what a man doth in this life,
accordingly, when he dyes he comes to be ſtated eternally: ſo
the death of Chriſt it is available for ever. <hi>It is appointed for
men once to dye, and then comes judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By judgement here I doe not think the Holy Ghoſt intends
eſpecially the judgement of the great day, (though it be true,
that after death the judgement of the great day will follow,
and all men muſt come to judgement; but I ſhall not ſpeak
one word of the judgement of that day.) But there is another
judgement that I conceive is the intent of the Holy Ghoſt here,
and that is the particular judgement that paſſeth upon every
ſoul immediately after death; which is the ſtateing of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40441:60"/>
ſoul in the eternal condition of it, either of happineſſe or
miſery.</p>
               <p>While men live here, their condition is not ſtated by any act
of God (though in regard of his eternal purpoſe it is the ſame
for ever) even the Saints themſelves would be here in much
hazzard and danger about their everlaſting eſtate (in regard of
themſelves, and what they have actually beſtowed upon them)
were it not that the grace of God is above them; the people of
God in this life, are not without many feares and doubts about
their everlaſting condition; and what would many poor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God give to be delivered from their feares, and doubts
which are a grievous burthen to them, that they might never
have feare or doubt more about their eternal eſtates? Well, if
thou beeſt godly, in a little time it will be ſo with thee: this
is the good that death will bring unto thee, that after death
judgement will come to thee; that is, thou ſhalt be ſo actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtated in thy everlaſting condition, as to be beyond all
hazard about it; thou ſhalt be beyond all feares, and doubts
and temptations; thou ſhalt never feare more, never doubt
more, never be tempted more, never more loſe any of the
good that thou art poſſeſſed of: this is the judgement that comes
to the Saints after death.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide, wicked men here in this world are
not without their hopes and confidences that all ſhall be well
with them: but after death comes judgement to them: that
is (as we have it <hi>Proverbs 11, 7.)</hi> when a wicked man dieth,
his hope periſheth, he is ſtated in ſuch a condition as he is
never like to have hope of good more; he is paſt all hope and
poſſibility of ever receiving further mercy from God: and this
is the meaning of the Text on both hands, that <hi>after death
comes Judgement.</hi> Whatſoever mens conditions are here in
this world, though the Saints have many fears &amp; doubts about
their eſtates, yet I ſay immediately after death, they ſhall be ſo
ſtated and actually poſſeſſed of happineſſe, that they ſhall never
doubt more. And howſoever wicked men in this world have
many hopes and confidences, and bleſſe themſelves in their
way, yet immediately after death all ſhall vaniſh, for then
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40441:60"/>
judgement ſhall come. <hi>Job</hi> hath this expreſſion <hi>Job. 8. 14. The
hope of the hypocrite is as the ſpiders web;</hi> he ſpins out of his own
ſpirit a cunning web, but the beſome of death at once daſheth
it all away, for immediately after death he comes to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>This then is the doctrinal concluſion we are to handle
out of theſe words thus opened unto you,</p>
               <p>That the onely time that men have to provide for their eternall
condition, is the time of this life: if it be not done here, there is no
help afterward; for after death comes judgement.</p>
               <p>I ſhall deſire to handle this point ſo farre as it may be a
ground to work upon your hearts, and to ſtirre you up in the
time of your lives to make all ſure between God and your
ſouls; <hi>for after death comes judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This point that I am now to treat about, it is one of the
moſt ſerious points that concerns the children of men: and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
one of the firſt things that the Lord ſettles upon the hearts
and conſciences of thoſe whom he converts to himſelf. For
a man going on in wayes of ſin and death, to bethink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
Lord where am I? what am I doing? what is like to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of me? wherefore was I borne? wherefore came I into
the world? what have I to doe here? Then God anſwers, that
which thou haſt to doe here, and art ſent into the world for,
is to make proviſion for eternity: tis about this great buſineſſe,
to make up all between God and thy ſoul, and look thou
beeſt careful in it: for though thy life be ſhort and uncertaine,
yet this great buſineſſe doth depend upon this ſhort and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
time of thy life; and if it be neglected in this little ſpace
of time I give unto thee, thou art loſt and undone for ever:
for preſently after death comes judgement; and you ſhall be
then ſtated ſo as there can be no alteration. It is the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the School-men, that what did befal to the Angels
that ſinned, that in death befalls unto wicked men; that is, as
the Angels upon the firſt act of ſin, were preſently ſtated in an
irrecoverable condition; ſo wicked men when they dye are
ſtated in an irrecoverable condition. It is true while we live
in this world, though we are ſinful, yet our condition is to be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40441:61"/>
lookt upon as better then the condition of the fallen Angels;
there is not here ſuch an actuall ſtating of us: but when once
death comes, a wicked man is then in the ſame condition with
the devils themſelves: that is, his condition is then ſo ſtated
and made as certaine and ſure, and as irrecoverable as any of
the Angels that ſinned. While we preach to men, though never
ſo wicked, and ungodly, becauſe an actual judgement (ſuch
as the Text ſpeakes of) is not paſt upon them, we are to offer
grace and mercy to them in Chriſt; but if this offer be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
for a while; if the twine thread, the ſingle thread of
thy life be once cut, then thou art gone for ever, <hi>For after death
comes judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the meditation of this point, me thinks I cannot but look
upon God, as beholding all the children of men in their fallen
loſt ſinful and miſerable eſtate with pity and compaſſion,
ſaying, poor creatures they have ſinned againſt me, and have
made themſelves liable to eternal wrath, which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not, which they are not able to beare; well, a little
time I will grant unto them, to ſue out their pardon, and to
come in and make up their peace with me: and I will give
them meanes for that end: but let them look to themſelves;
for according to the improvement of the time that I now give
them, ſo ſhall it be with them to all eternity: if they neglect
it, they are gone for ever; mercy then ſhall doe them no good:
ſo that the tenour upon which we all hold our lives, it is no
other then as a malefactor condemned to dye, who hath
granted to him through the favour of the Prince, a little time
of reprieval, and ſome intimation withal given of a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in that time to ſue out his pardon; and according as he
ſpends that time, ſo it ſhall be with him for life or death.
Thus I ſay we all hold our lives, we are all condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord: onely God hath out of his infinite grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
a way and meanes of ſalvation for the children of men,
and gives us a little time (we know not how long whether
two or three dayes, but as long as we live) to look about
us, to provide for the making of our peace with him; and
if that be neglected, all is gone, and we are undone for ever:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40441:61"/>
great things then doe depend upon this uncertaine ſmall
time of our lives. It is reported of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that when he
went againſt any City, he did uſe to ſet up a lampe burning,
and would make proclamation, that whoſoever came in while
this lampe was burning, ſhould finde favour and have his
life; but whoſoever ſtaid till this lampe was out, he was but
a dead man, and muſt expect no mercy; brethren know
that God hath ſet up a lampe, and our life is this lampe; and
God proclames, Whoſoever comes in while this lampe is
burning, ſhall finde mercy; but if you ſtay till the lampe be
out, there is nothing but eternal miſery to be expected. Now
this lampe of your lives may not onely goe out upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of the oyle, but it may be put out by accidental
meanes; and if this lampe be once out, and your work not
done, you are loſt for ever. We read 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 7. that when
<hi>Solomon</hi> was preparing the Temple, he made all things ſo
ready before hand, that there was no noiſe of axe or hammer
heard there: Whoſoever God intendeth for a living ſtone in
the glorious Temple of Heaven, he ſquares and fits them
here; there is no noyſe of repentance and ſorrow for ſin after
this life; what is to be done, muſt be done here; nothing will
doe it hereafter. <hi>Whatſoever thou haſt to doe, doe it with all thy
might; for there is no work, nor device, nos knowledge, nor wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in the grave whòther thou goeſt. Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 10. and Chapter
11. verſ. 3. <hi>In the place where the tree falleth there it lyeth.</hi>
Which way thou falleſt when thou dyeſt, that way thou ſhalt
lie eternally: if Godward, then God is thine for ever: if
ſinward, then miſery and deſtruction is thine for ever. <hi>Eccleſ.
12, 7. Then ſhall the duſt returne to the earth as it was, and the
ſpirit ſhall returne unto God who gave it.</hi> The ſouls of wicked
men doe returne to God that gave them, as well as the ſouls
of the godly; that is, they doe preſently returne to God to
receive the ſentence of their eternal doome from him, and
to be ſtated in their everlaſting condition; there is a mighty
change in the ſoul, immediately after it is departed from the
body, and is brought to ſtand before the glorious God, to
be ſtated in its eternal condition. <hi>There are twelve houres in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40441:62"/>
the day</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>wherein a man may worke, but the night
comes when no man can work: John</hi> 9. 4. The time of this life is
thy working time: I, but the night is coming, and then no
man can work. <hi>Revel. 6. 8. And I looked, and behold a pale
horſe, and his name that ſat on him was death, and hell followed
him.</hi> Hell immediately followes death, where death ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth
any in their natural condition, that have not finiſhed
the work of making their peace with God. 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 10. We
muſt all appeare before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, to receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what we have done in the fleſh, whether it be good or bad.</hi>
It is not according to what we doe afterwards, but according
to what we have done here in the fleſh, ſo it muſt be with us
for ever. There can be no repenting, no believing after this
life; body and ſoul being parted, the whole man is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a work of God upon it.</p>
               <p>And beſides, immediately after death, God takes all meanes
away: you ſhall never heare Sermon more, never have admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
more, never have good connſel more, never have any
working of Gods ſpirit more, to draw you ſoules to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And not onely ſo, but God then withdrawes himſelf ſo
fully, in regard of all the common workes of his ſpirit, that
there is a kinde of ſtating the ſoul in ſin (which yet cannot ſo
properly in regard of God be ſaid to be ſin as evil,) ſo that it
ſhall be impoſſible for thee to doe any thing but ſin; as the
Saints though while they live here, they have many luſts and
corruptions in them, yet immediately after death their ſouls
are ſo fully poſſeſſed of the ſpirit, that then they cannot ſin:
ſo on the contrary, though wicked men while they live here
have divers common gifts of Gods ſpirit, and many reſtraints
upon them; yet immediately after death, they are ſo fully
ſeparated from God, and God ſo fully withdraws himſelf from
them, that it is impoſſible for them to doe any thing elſe
but ſin and rebell againſt God, and blaſpheme him to his face.
There was in <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency a poſſibility not to have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
there is in us, while we live in this world, an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
but that we ſhould ſin; but in the world to come there
is in the Saints an impoſſibility that ever they ſhould ſin: and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40441:62"/>
look how the impoſſibility is on the one hand with the Saints,
ſo is the impoſſibility directly contrary on the other hand
with the wicked: therefore the wicked muſt needs be ſtated in
an everlaſting evil condition. There is no more poſſibility
for the damned ſouls in hell ever to doe any thing but to
blaſpheme God, then there is a poſſibility for the Saints in
heaven ever to ſin againſt God.</p>
               <p>And yet further, at the great day Chriſt gives up the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to the Father, and then there will be another manner of
adminiſtration then before; Chriſt will not then be exerciſed
in the work of his mediatorſhip, to mediate any further for
thoſe for whom he did not mediate in this life. And preſently
after the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body, the ſpirit of
God wholly departes from the ſoul, and the wrath of God
is let out ſo fully into it, that it breaks the ſoul, and fills up
every faculty of it: ſo that it is impoſſible in regard of the
ſtrong current of divine wrath that carries the ſoul along
with it, that ever it ſhould be exerciſed to all eternity any one
moment in any thing but onely in bearing of torment, and
divine wrath. As the Saints ſhall be filled up with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God, and carried on with ſuch a ſtrong current of
divine mercy, that it ſhall be impoſſible that their ſouls ſhould
ever to all eternity be exerciſed in any other thing but in the
enjoyment of God, and living to his praiſe: ſo on the quite
contrary is it with the wicked: therefore after death there
is a ſtating of both. I will enlarge my ſelf no further in the
opening of this point, but come preſently to apply it, for this
point is applicatory rather then doctrinal, and I ſhall content
my ſelf with three or foure branches of application and ſo
conclude.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, hence we may ſee what cauſe we have to
bleſſe God for the continuance of our lives, eſpecially any
that are here this day, that have not throughly made their
peace with God, that are not upon certaine and infallible
termes in this great buſineſſe of providing for their eternal
eſtates. If there remaines but any doubt in thy heart concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thy eternal condition, and if the feares of eternity have
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40441:63"/>
been upon thy ſpirit, thou Wilt from this point, that hath been
thus briefly ſpoken to, ſee cauſe to bleſſe God with thy face up
on the ground, adoring the riches of his grace that thou art
alive this day? why, becauſe thy life it is the time of making
up thy peace with God; it is the time of providing for thy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
condition: if thy life be at an end, and this work not done,
then all is gone, then judgement comes, and thou wilt be
infallibly and unalterably ſtated in a loſt and undone condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
O therefore its well that thou art alive this day; if a
man have a great buſineſſe to doe that concernes his whole
eſtate, or life, and it muſt be done in a very little time, O
what a favour would he count it, to have his time lengthned
out, though but a little, becauſe his buſineſſe is of great
weight, and he thinkes with himſelf, if I miſcarry in it, I
am loſt and undone for ever: ſo all thoſe that have ever had
ſerious apprehenſions of the infinite conſequence of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon their lives here, they cannot but ſit downe and
bleſſe God for lengthening out their lives; for the time of this
life is a happy time, it is a day of grace, a day of ſalvation.
O how happy would thoſe poor creatures, upon whom this
judgement is paſt, that are ſtated in their eternal condition,
think themſelves if they might have but one day wherein it
might be ſaid, there is a poſſibility for them to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for themſelves concerning their eternal eſtate! As they
were not long ſince, ſo art thou now: and therefore know
how to prize thy life. O the lives of men and women (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſuch as have not yet done that great work) are worth a
thouſand thouſand worlds. I remember I have heard of a
ſpeech of a great Gentleman, who being very ſick, and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
telling him that there was no way for him but death:
O, ſayes he, that I might live, though it were but as a Toad!
and indeed what man or woman is there that hath not got a
thorough and Scripture-aſſurance of this great work that their
peace is made up with God, but may upon very good ground
(if ſickneſſe be upon them) deſire to live though but as a Toad,
becauſe ſuch great things depend upon their lives here in this
world? Brethren, doe but ſay this to your own hearts upon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40441:63"/>
ſerious meditation of this that I am now ſpeaking of. What
if God ſhould come now to this Congregation, and ſay to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of you, Well, now the time that I have given you
to provide for your eternal eſtate, is at an end; if you have
done your work, well and good, you ſhall be ſaved and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
eternal glory; but you muſt be caſt according to that
which is now done. I feare if ſuch a meſſage ſhould come from
heaven to many of us, it would make our hearts to ake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us, and we ſhould cry out, O Lord, give me a little ſpace
before I goe hence and be no more ſeen: O that I might yet
have a little more time. Suppoſe God had taken you away
when he took away ſuch a kinſman or kinſwoman of yours,
ſuch a neighbour or friend, and death had come then, and
judgement had then been paſt upon you; which way doe you
thinke you muſt have been caſt? cannot ſome of you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that if God had taken you away at ſuch a time, or
when ſuch a one dyed, you were then in ſuch a caſe, that you
have cauſe to think you had been certainly ſtated in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of eternal miſery? therefore bleſſe God that you are alive
at this day, to heare of ſuch a doctrine as this is; that ſo
long as you live, God gives you time to provide for your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
eſtate. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 78. 38. the Text ſayes, <hi>God did not ſtirre up
all his anger, but called back his wrath;</hi> when ſickneſſe comes
upon men and women, ſome part of Gods anger is let out;
I, but if God had let out his anger but a little more, what
would have become of you? you had been gone: one ſtroake
more had caſt you for ever. I, but God was pleaſed to call
back his anger, and did not ſtirre up all his wrath. O
bleſſe God for ſparing you at ſuch a time; for certainly
had you died then, your condition had been as irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as the Devells themſelves; now tis a day of grace,
now you have the voyce of the Goſpel, and the glad
tidings of ſalvation ſounding in your eares: but then you
had been paſt the time of grace, paſt praying, and paſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
now that you are not paſt this day, you are to prize
your lives. And brethren know wherein conſiſts the worth
of your lives, and the continuance of them; there is a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40441:64"/>
impudence in ſome men, they would faine have their
lives lengthened, to have their luſts more ſatisfied; did God
give thee thy life for this end? no, the end why thou ſhouldſt
deſire to live is, that thou mayeſt have further time to make
proviſion for that which is of ſuch infinite conſequence, which
if it be not done, it had been better for thee to have been a
Toad or Serpent, or the vileſt creature that ever lived. O
that we had hearts to give God the glory of our lives, and
to prize our lives aright; excellent effects would proceed
from it, were our hearts wrought to theſe things.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, If the onely time that we have to provide
for eternity be the time of this life, how then are thoſe to be
reproved that miſpend and ſquander away this precious time
of their lives about vanities, and neglect the great buſineſſe
that they were ſent into the world for? If ſuch great things
depend upon our lives, then the loſſe of the time of our lives
is a moſt dreadful loſſe; we all ſay time is precious, and it
is ſo, and the through-underſtanding and applying of this
point would make us ſee time precious indeed: If there could
be an extract of the quinteſſence of all the pearles in the world
put into one, it would not be ſuch a precious pearle as this
time of our lives, becauſe there is that depends upon it that
is infinitely more worth then ten thouſand worlds; however
men and women make little of their time, and play and ſport
it away, yet there is no moment of thy time that thou doeſt
miſpend, but for ought thou knoweſt it might be the very
moment upon which thy eternal condition doth depend:
thou goeſt abroad, and art merry, and jocund, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeſt
thy time, and abuſeſt thy ſelf; I ſay for ought thou
knoweſt that inſtant of thy ſinning might be the very moment
upon which the very hinge of all thy eternall condition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends;
and did we underſtand this doctrine aright, we
ſhould ſee it to be an exceeding great evil and folly, to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
our precious time: men ordinarily live in the world as
if they had nothing to doe here, but onely to make proviſion
for the fleſh. If a man ſhould come to the City about a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that concernes his life, and the time he hath to doe it in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40441:64"/>
were very ſhort, how induſtriouſly (doe you think) would he
ſpend that time! every time the clock ſtrikes, would ſtrike to
his heart; or ſuppoſe God ſhould ſend a damned ſoul that is
now in hell into the world againe, and ſhould ſay thus to
him, Soul, you ſhall goe and live againe in the world; and I
will give you a little ſpace, you ſhall live a quarter or half a
yeare; (or if it were but a moneth or week) and I will put
you in ſuch an eſtate that there ſhall be a poſſibility for you to
make your peace with me, and to deliver your ſelf from this
miſery that you are under: I appeal to you, how doe you
think ſuch a one would ſpend his time? now as you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
and convinced in your conſciences, how ſuch a one
would ſpend his time, ſo doe you labour to ſpend your time;
many would have rules to guide them in their way; why
take this rule, if ſuch a thing could be, that a damned ſoul
could be ſent into the world again, and be in a poſſibility of
another eſtate, I ſay, What you think ſuch a one would doe,
that doe you: If one ſhould come and ſay to him, what ſhall I
give for your time that is granted to you? how would he
contemne him? if you offer him Crownes and Kingdomes,
yea all the world for his time, (be it but a week, or a day)
he would ſcorne ſuch an offer, and prize one day more then
a thouſand worlds. Now you have had dayes and weekes,
one after another, and yet for ought you know you are liable
to eternal ruine; and you know not whether you have a
week or a day more before your eternal condition be ſtated
upon you; O what need then have you to improve your
time!</p>
               <p>How few think of the paſſing away of their time, or that
any great matter depends upon the time of their lives here in
this world! you would count it a great folly and madneſſe if
a man had a precious oyle that were worth a thouſand pound
a pinte, and he ſhould ſet up a light with this oyle to talke
or play, or doe trifling things by; what! a lampe that is ſed by
ſuch oyle, that is worth thouſands! ſurely this lampe ſhould
be for ſome weighty buſineſſe, and not for trifles: Know
brethren, that the time of your lives is this lampe, lighted
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40441:65"/>
up, and fed with ſuch precious oyle: O do not ſquander it away
then about trifles and vanities; for there are things of infinite
concernment that you have to doe in this time of your lives;
tis the great charge of Chriſt againſt <hi>Jezebel, Revel. 2. 21.
And I gave her ſpace to repent of her fornication, but ſhe repented
not.</hi> I remember an expreſſion of a woman that was in great
diſtreſſe of conſcience; ſome came to her, and endeavouring
what they could to perſwade her that there was hopes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for her, ſhe lookt with a gaſtly countenance upon them,
and ſaid, <hi>Call time again, call time again:</hi> as if ſhe had ſaid, if
you can call time again, there may be hope for me. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
we doe not conſider what depends upon time; it is a
good ſigne of an enlightned conſcience, to make conſcience
of time: there is nothing puts a more ſerious frame into a
mans ſpirit, then to know the worth of his time; ſayes one
(in diſcovering the loſſe of the opportunity of time) ſuppoſe
there were a company of men ſailing to ſea, and they come
at laſt to a little Iſland that lies in the middeſt of the ſea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thouſand miles from any other Land, and they goe and
refreſh themſelves upon the Iſland, but ſayes the Marriner,
look to your ſelves, be not farre off, be within call, for I
will not ſtay for any of you: the old men it may be are afraid
to be too farre; but the young men truſt to their legs, and
think they can make haſte; but the Mariner is gone, and they
are left behinde and periſh: tis true, while we are here in
this world, we are refreſhing our ſelves; but be ſure, ſayes
God, you be ready when I call; and Gods call is the time of
death: now God he calls, and poor creatures are not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and ſo they periſh eternally. O the loſſe of the time of
your lives will be a dreadful loſſe one day, and it will pierce
your ſouls to think that once you had a day of grace, but
now you have no time; judgement is now paſt upon you,
and there is no remedy. It is reported of a woman who had
her houſe on fire, that ſhe was very buſie and ſpent her time
about ſaying of trifles, and in the meane time had a childe in
the cradle, and forgot that; and when ſhe lookt upon what
ſhe had ſaved, ſhe ſaw a few trifling things, but then it came
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40441:65"/>
into her minde, O what is become of my childe! and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
that her childe had been burnt (though it was ſaved)
ſhe ran mad, to conſider that ſhe ſhould be ſo fooliſh, as to
minde things of no concernment, and to forget her childe.
Take heed it be not your caſe; you heare that time is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and that there are great things that concerne your
ſouls and eternal condition, which you have to doe; and
you ſpend your time to get eſtates, to get a little pleaſure, or
honour in the world; but now, when the concluſion of all
ſhall come, and you ſhall look back to ſee what you have
done, and God ſhall come and call you to an account, and
ſay, Well, now there is an end of your time, what have
you done in this world? It may be you can ſay, Lord, I have
got an eſtate, and I have led a merry and jovial life; but all
this while, what haſt thou done for thy ſoul? what haſt thou
done for eternity? what haſt thou done for the making up of
thy peace? what haſt thou done about thoſe things that
are of ſuch infinite weight and conſequence? thy heart now
will be overwhelmed with this thought, O Lord, I did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
my ſoul, I had no thoughts about my eternal eſtate, I
have ſpent a great deal more time in playing, then in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
at leaſt more time in playing then I have done in praying
to God in private, to make my peace with him: however it
may be you can paſſe away your time merrily here, yet it
will be a dreadful thing to you hereafter, when you ſhall
know what was the buſineſſe of your time, and what you
were borne for. I remember <hi>Bernard</hi> hath a notable expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſpeaking of ſome calling one to another, Come let us
be merry till an houre be paſt; ſayes he (ſpeaking with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
againſt ſuch folly) <hi>What wilt thou doe thus and thus till
an houre be paſt, till time be paſt! what paſſe away that which the
mercy of thy Creator hath ſo farre indulged to thee as to give it thee
for repentance, and to get grace and to obtaine pardon.</hi> What to
paſſe away time in which thou oughteſt to be breathing after
that life and bleſſedneſſe which thou haſt loſt! It becomes men
that have not made up their peace with God, to ſpend their
dayes in bewailing of their ſinful and miſerable condition,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40441:66"/>
and not in merrineſſe and jollity, in chambering and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe;
how wilt thou wiſh one day that thy time had
been ſpent rather in mourning and lamenting? ſayes <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
to <hi>Dives,</hi> Son, remember that thou in thy life time recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedſt
thy pleaſures; this life is not the life of thy ſenſual
pleaſures, but to make all even between God and thy ſoul;
when God is ſo gracious as to give us ſpace for ſuch great ends
as he doth in this world, he expects that all the children of
men ſhould ſpend their dayes in ſeeking his face, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up their peace with him; in prizing his mercy, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
and adoring the riches of his grace and goodneſſe in
his Son: but where doe we finde this? what a different courſe
of life is there in moſt men from what God expects? they
are guilty of deſperate folly that ſquander away their precious
time, ſeeing all depends upon it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If after death comes judgement, certainly then
when death findes any man unprepared in an eſtate of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy,
that hath not made his peace with God, it muſt
needes be exceeding dreadful becauſe it brings judgement,
and ſtates ſuch a one in his eternal condition. <hi>Job.</hi> 18. 14.
Death is called there the King of terrors; and well may it be
ſo; for indeed it is the moſt dreadful thing in the world, to
thoſe that underſtand the meaning of their own ſinful ſtate
and condition: there is enough in this to daunt the heart of
the proudeſt ſtubborneſt wretch that lives upon the earth, to
conſider that now I am launching into the ocean of eternity;
but God knows I have made little proviſion for it; it may
be it is the ocean of the wrath of this infinite God that I am
now launching into, and muſt be in for ever; certainly (except
thou haſt good aſſurance of the work done between God and
thy ſoul) the ſight of the infinite ocean thou art launching
into immediately after death, cannot but make thee give a
dreadful ſhrieke when thou ſeeſt thou art now like to miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eternally; death taking an ungodly man, it is no other
but the cutting aſunder of the thred upon which he hung over
the pit of eternal miſery. It is the pulling up of the flood
gates of Gods eternall wrath. Here when afflictions are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40441:66"/>
upon men and women, Gods wrath is but onely like the
little droppings of water through the flood-gates; as you ſee
in flood-gates, there will be ſome leakings forth of ſome drops
of water onely; but there is a vaſt difference between thoſe
drops, and when the flood-gates are pulled up, then the
ſtreames guſh out abundantly: juſt ſo is it with Gods dealings
here in the world with ungodly men; it may be Gods hand
is upon them in many afflictions, but theſe are but as ſome
few drops of his wrath; but when death comes and findes them
unprepared, then God pulls up the flood-gates, and then
the ſtreames of the wrath of the almighty overflow them;
death to them will be no other then the Sergeant of the Lord
of hoſts to hale them to priſon: It will be a taking up of the
draw-bridge, It will be to them a diſmal and dreadful Sun-ſet,
that brings with it a night of eternal darkneſſe, and that
will be a moſt dreadful Sun-ſet that ſhall never have day more;
why, know that at death the day of grace and ſalvation ſets
to thee, and an eternal night of diſmal blackneſſe and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
will be upon thee; ſo that when thou art going out of
this world, and thy peace not made with God, thou muſt then
bid farewel to all comforts and to whatever thou didſt enjoy.
Now farewel thoſe excellent truths of God, that I have had
revealed to me: I ſhall never heare ſuch gracious truths out of
the mouthes of Gods miniſters more. Now farewel all my
loving friends, that I rejoyced ſo much in, and all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
meetings that ever I have had; I ſhall never have them
more. Farewel now wife, husband, children, <hi>I</hi> ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſee your faces more. Yea farewel houſe and lands, and
all delights; farewel Sun and Moon and Stars, and all the
world; I ſhall never ſee you againe till I ſee you all of a light
fire, at the great and dreadful day of Chriſt. And now I am
leaving the world and all the comforts here, and all the
meanes of grace here; and O Lord, whither am I going? It
was a ſpeech of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> when he was to dye, ſayes he,
<hi>O my ſoul, my ſoul, whither art thou going? thou ſhalt never be
merry more, as thou was wont to he.</hi> It is a doleful thing for a
poor creature, whoſe time is at an end, not to know whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40441:67"/>
he is going; to think of former pleaſures and delights,
and never to have them more. Me thinkes when I conſider
the death of any ungodly man, that place in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 10. 3.
comes to my minde, <hi>And what will you doe in the day of viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
It is true, thou doeſt now ruffle it out in the world,
and takeſt thy fill of pleaſure, and beareſt all before thee,
and wilt have thy minde, and art ſtout, and ſtubborn in thy
way, and ſcorneſt the truthes of God by his Miniſters: but
what wilt thou doe in the day of viſitation, when the time
ſhall come that puts an end unto thy dayes here? O the change
that wil then be in thy ſpirit! God will then look upon thee
with indignation, and ſay, O wretched creature, that haſt
ſpent thy dayes in vanity, thou ſhalt continue no longer in
this world; and now the wrath of the Almighty is let out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee; Thou art upon thy ſick bed in diſtreſſe, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
now is awakened, and tortures that ſoul of thine, and
tells thee, that ſuch and ſuch wickedneſſe at ſuch a time, in
ſuch a company, in ſuch a chamber, thou didſt commit; and
thou beginſt now to curſe thy ſelfe for thy folly, and for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
the day of grace and ſalvation; and now thy time is
almoſt gone; well, thy ſickneſſe encreaſeth, thy paines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
thy friends are all ſent for, and they come about thee
bewailing of thee, and thou beginneſt to look gaſtly, and
draweſt thy breath ſhort, and the devil waits for his prey;
thy mouth falls, thy ſoul departs, and there is an end of
thee; an end of all thy pride, and an end of all thy ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and an end of all thy vanity, and wickedneſſe: and
this is the man that hath not made God his portion: mercy
hath had her time, but thou haſt neglected it, and now thou
art gone for ever, We ſpeak much of the mercy of God, and
is it not rich mercy for God to give to thee, a wretched ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
creature, ſuch a bleſſed time of repentance as thou haſt in
this world? for God to call, and cry to thee, and to tender
thee grace and pardon, and peace; he did not doe ſo to the
Angels that ſinned; when they committed but one ſin againſt
God, he caſt them away, and would not ſo much as treat
with them about any termes of peace: and therefore ſeeing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40441:67"/>
thou haſt had thy time already, let all the Angels in Heaven,
and Saints and creatures, yea and devils themſelves, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that God was merciful to this man, to this wretched
man and woman, that had ſuch a faire time, though now
judgement be upon them. O my brethren, the thoughts of
death under this notion, hath a great deal in it to work upon
your hearts. I remember I have heard of one that uſed to
pray ſix times a day, and being asked why he ſpent ſo much
time in praying, he gave no other anſwer but this, I muſt
dye, I muſt dye; that which was to come after, would put
a period to the time of his life, upon which ſo much did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
O that we had hearts to conſider it; and that we
knew, even now in this our day, the things that belong to
our everlaſting peace, before it be too late. Brethren, theſe
things are of infinite concernment to your immortal ſouls;
the Lord grant they may be prevalent upon every one of
us.</p>
               <p>We may apply this dreadfulneſſe of death (that followes
upon the meditation of this point I have been upon) unto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ſorts of people: as firſt, me thinkes it ſhould be of great
force and efficacy to work upon the hearts of old people; your
time is neer, you had need be ſure that your work is done;
for certainly you have no long time for the accompliſhing
of that great work, of making your peace with God; it is
three or foure a clock (as it were) in your day of grace, the
Sun is ſetting with you. Now if a man be to goe a journey
upon his life, and hath neglected the fore-noon, and much
of the after-noon alſo, and ſees the Sun draw low, he thinkes
with himſelf, I had need make haſte now, for if the Sun be
once ſet, and I not at my journeyes end, I am a loſt man,
my life is gone. They that goe over where the Sea is dry
at one time, and flowes at another, but ſo that if they miſſe
but half an houre, they are dead men, if by their watch they
finde the time is almoſt come for the waters to returne, then
their hearts are daunted, and they ſay one to another, we
had need make haſte, for the time is almoſt at an end. O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
this you old men, that have neglected the time of your
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40441:68"/>
youth, and now your time is almoſt at an end, know in this
your day the things of your peace, double now your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
It is a moſt dreadful thing to ſee an old wicked man,
an old ſinner, an old ſcorner, an old carnal wretch, that
never underſtood the great buſineſſe that he came into the
world for.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this concernes all prophane wretches, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of doing the work of their time, and preparing for their
everlaſting eſtate, goe directly backwards, and make the
breach between God and their ſouls wider. If a man have a
journey to goe for his life, and he muſt goe it before the Sun
be ſet, and he goes a quite contrary way; when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to reflect upon himſelf, he then ſayes, where am I? If
the Sun goe downe before I am at my journeyes end, I am a
dead man: ſo is it with you that goe on in wayes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe,
God hath ſent you here to live; to the praiſe of
his name, and to work out your ſalvation with feare and
trembling, and you have gone directly backward, and the
time of your lives hath been ſpent in nothing elſe, but in
making your ſelves ſeaven-fold more the children of wrath
then before: you had need now look to your ſelves; for if
you dye in your courſe of prophaneſſe you are undone for
ever.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for thoſe that have been heretofore in a good
forwardneſſe in the way of life and ſalvation, that have had
ſome ſtirrings of conſcience in them, but yet through the
violence of their luſts have been turned back againe, and have
fallen off from their former ſtate; certainly this point might
ſtrike thee to the heart. As a man that is to goe over the Sea
for his life by ſuch a time, and he hath a good gale for the
preſent, but when he is come neer the haven, a great guſt
drives him back againe; O what a ſad condition is this man
in? ſo is it with thee; the time was when thou hadſt a good
gale; God came graciouſly to thee, by the work of his ſpirit,
and thou ſeemedſt to be in a good forwardneſſe in the work
thou waſt borne for; but the guſt of fin, and the violence of
luſt, hath carried thee quite back againe, and now thou art
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40441:68"/>
further off then before: how ſhould this awaken thee to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
all thy time and opportunities to the uttermoſt for the
good of thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>Againe, this concernes thoſe that upon every diſcontent
wiſh themſelves dead; as ſome froward people, if any thing
croſſes them; they preſently wiſh themſelves in the grave. O
vaine man and woman, doſt thou know what thou doeſt, to
wiſh the time of thy life at an end? thou mayeſt meet with
another manner of diſcontent then ever thou metſt withall
here; for after death comes judgement. <hi>Amos 5. 18. Wee unto
you that deſire the day of the Lord, to what end is it for you?
the day of the Lord is darkneſse and not light.</hi> So I ſay, woe to
them that in a froward mood deſire the day of the Lord,
which is not a day of light, but like to be a day of darkneſſe
unto them, for ought they can tell. Inſtead of giving God
the praiſe of thy life, upon every ſullen mood doeſt thou wiſh
thy ſelf dead? this is a great diſhonour to the grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God extended towards thee.</p>
               <p>Again, this concernes thoſe that upon every drunken occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
for a word or two, will venture their lives: tis true,
fooles will venture their lives for trifles, becauſe they know
not the worth of them; but thoſe who know the worth of
their lives will not doe ſo. I remember a ſtory of a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
being at Sea and in danger of his life, he was mightily
afraid, and the Marriners were not at all afraid: what (ſay
they) are you a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> afraid, when we rude Marriners
doe not feare? I (ſays he) there is reaſon for it; for if I dye,
a Philoſopher is gone; but for you, your lives are not worth
much: ſo they that are ready to venture their lives in a
drunken quarrel, and will venture nothing for God, and a
good cauſe, know not what their lives are worth, and that
is the reaſon they are ſo willing to throw them away.</p>
               <p>Again, it concernes thoſe that in trouble and anguiſh of
conſcience are ready to lay violent hands upon themſelves
to take away their lives; one would think this point thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
and applyed might for ever keep back ſuch a temptation
for time to come. What an infinite deſperate folly is this,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40441:69"/>
that I that am made ſenſible of Gods wrath, and am afraid
of it, ſhall yet doe that which may put me irrecoverably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and ſtate me eternally in it, as they doe who lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
hands upon themſelves. If any people in the world ſhould
deſire the continuance of their lives, and prize them at a high
rate, thoſe that are troubled in conſcience ſhould doe it; they
ſhould pray <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, <hi>Pſalm. 39. 13. O ſpare me, that I
may recover ſtrength, before I goe hence and be no more.</hi> And uſe
Gods own argument <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 103. 13, 14. where it is ſaid, God
is merciful to his people, becauſe he remembers they are but
duſt. So doe thou plead with God, and ſay, O Lord, ſpare
me, I am but duſt, and as a winde that paſſeth away and
ſhall never returne againe; now is the time wherein thou
haſt ſaid thou wilt be intreated: O let my life be continued,
for if this time be out, I am gone for ever.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this concernes thoſe that have been (as they thought)
upon their death beds, that have apprehended themſelves as
dying, and have had this truth ſomewhat ſetled upon them,
that have ſeen eternity before them, and have been in danger
(as they conceived) of everlaſting ruine, and in their own
hearts have received judgement, but God hath magnified
his mercy towards them, and reſtored them againe: perhaps
in this condition when thou ſaweſt and hadſt the judgement in
thine own heart, that thy time was gone, thou then madeſt
promiſes, and ſaydeſt, O if God would ſpare my life, what a
new man would I be! I would be ſure to make uſe of my
time in another manner then ever heretofore: Well, God
hath raiſed thee up againe, and what then? why now thou
wilt venture upon Gods patience, and his wrath too; O woe
to thee, when thy dayes are ended, and this judgement comes,
it will fall dreadfully upon thee.</p>
               <p>Wherefore my brethren, let me ſpeak to you all (for I am
not come this day onely to ſpend an houre with you, but to
doe your ſouls ſome good) be it known to you, this is your
day, the day of grace and ſalvation: And yet once againe,
in the name of God, I declare unto you, this truth (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
you have heard it many times before) that there is not
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40441:69"/>
the worſt, the vileſt in the congregation, that is come through
the providence of God before God this day, but for ought
we know it is poſſible for thy ſinnes to be pardoned; it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
yet for thy ſoul to be ſaved, for God to be reconciled to
thee, and this day it is once more declared to thee, that thou
art not yet ſtated in eternal miſery, which might have been
thy condition before now: O that when you are gone home,
you would get into your cloſets, and fall down before God,
and bleſſe him for this meſſage, once more preached to you.
Beloved, if I, or any of the ſervants of the Lord, ſhould be
ſent by God to the gates of hell, with this meſſage, O you
damned ſpirits, know from the Lord, that there is a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for you to be ſaved, certainly they would with joyfulneſſe
hearken to ſuch tidings. Now this cannot be preached to
them, but this may be, this is preached to the vileſt and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedeſt
wretch, and enemy to God and goodneſſe that is in
the congregation; and God declares this now to you, but
how long it will be before judgement comes to ſtate thee in
another condition, thou canſt not tell, therefore know in
this thy day the things of thy eternal peace: and who knows
what may depend upon one day? yet prayers and teares may
doe thee good; but ſtay a while, and though ſtreames of
bloud ſhould flow from thee, and thou ſhouldeſt cry and
howle to God to all eternity, it would never doe it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
know your time; it is a happy thing for a man to doe a
buſineſſe in ſuch a time wherein he may have the benefit of it;
amongſt men, though a thing be done, yet if not in the ſeaſon
of it, it loſes of its worth and efficacy: ſo now prayers, and
teares, and mourning, and crying to God for mercy, the
efficacy of theſe things are gone, except they be done in
time; and for ought thou knoweſt unleſſe they be done this
day, or to morrow, or very ſhortly, they may doe thee
no good at all: therefore now take your time; God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes
and ſayes to every one of you this day, Poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as ever you expect to receive mercy in the day of
Chriſt, look to it now; for now the golden ſcepter is ſtretched
forth, now is the acceptable time, and the day of grace and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40441:70"/>
ſalvation, come in and accept of the offers and tenders of
grace and mercy now, or elſe you are gone for ever.</p>
               <p>Wherefore then let this take off all ſlightneſſe of heart, and
thoſe roving diſpoſitions of your ſpirits, that run ſo after
vanities. If a man that were wilde in his thoughts, and that
had his eyes roving up and down, ſhould have one ſay to
him, Sir, conſider what you doe, for it concernes your life,
if you miſcarry you are a dead man, it would make him call
in his thoughts, and compoſe his ſpirit: ſo, if thou haſt a
ſlight and wandring heart, this is ſaid to thee this day,
friend, poor ſoul, know what thou art doing; even this
dayes work concernes thy life, thy eternal eſtate, and take your
ſelves off from all creatures, til you have done ſo great a work;
ſo ſaies the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31, 32. Brethren, the time
is ſhort, it remaineth that both they that have Wives be as if they
had none; and they that weep as though they wept not; and they
that rejoice as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy as though
they poſſeſſed not; the time is ſhort.</hi> The word is, the time
is wrapt up, it is folded up; it is a Metaphor taken from
cloth that is folded even to the very fag end: the time is all
folded up (ſayes the Apoſtle) therefore let your hearts be
taken off from the creature. Truly brethren, whatever you
think of this point, yet thoſe that underſtand themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
would not venture to be in an unconverted eſtate one
half houre for ten thouſand worlds; for they know that
when death comes, then judgement alſo comes.</p>
               <p>And you that are poor people, who live hardly, and in
great extremity in this world, yet ſo long as you live here,
your condition is comfortable; for you have time to doe
that worke that is of ſuch mighty conſequence for the good
of your ſouls: And indeed upon the conſideration of this
point, peoples hearts ſhould be taken off from the creature;
for a man had better live here in order to that great work,
though as a ſtock or log in the fire, then to be taken away
before he hath done that work he was ſent into the world for.
When men are in paine, they would faine dye; I, but did
they know what will be the ſtate and condition of a wicked
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40441:70"/>
man immediately after his death, they would rather live,
though as the miſeableſt creature in the world.</p>
               <p>And conſider all you young ones, now while God gives
you time, of this great work of making your peace with him.
If a man were to goe over Sea about a buſineſſe of great
weight, after he comes upon the ſhore, what ſhould his
firſt thought be? let him firſt make ſure of his great work, and
then be merry afterwards. If thou haſt made ſure of this
great work, that thy peace is made up with God, and that
thy everlaſting eſtate is ſecure, then thou mayeſt be merry
amongſt thy friends, and mayeſt live joyfully, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
all thy dayes. It was the complaint of one, that Art
is long, and life ſhort; but ſurely the art of providing for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
is a long and difficult art, and thy life is ſhort and
uncertaine: O therefore doe not put off this great work, as
<hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeakes of ſome, they are alwayes about to doe, they
will, and they will, and are about to live, but never live.
O that you that are young ones would begin betimes; and
this point ſetled upon the hearts of young ones, would cauſe
them to apply themſelves with all their might to the great
work of their ſouls, And that which you do, be ſure you do
it with all your might; which is the Argument of the Holy
Ghoſt, <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 10. Whatſoever thy hand findeth to doe, doe
it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor wiſdome
in the grave whither thou goeſt.</hi> If ever thou hadſt a work to
put forth thy ſtrength about, O doe it here, doe not onely
have ſome faint wiſhes and deſires, and ſome ſudden good
moods, as perhaps at the hearing of ſuch a truth as this is,
you have ſome ſudden wiſhes and inclinations; no, but work
out your ſalvation with feare and trembling, and be ſure to
take hold of all opportunities, ſeeing ſo much depends upon
the ſhort time of your lives. If a man were to goe over Sea
for his life, and had a faire day and winde, it were deſperate
madneſſe for him to ſay, Well, I have two or three dayes
more to goe over in, and therefore I will not go now, and ſo
neglects his gale; and when thoſe days are paſt, and the laſt
day comes, he thinks to go over, but cannot have a wind, for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40441:71"/>
a world: ſo, many think they will repent when they come
to dye. O but take heed when thou haſt a gale that thou doeſt
not neglect it, for feare it never come again; and know that
if the Lord ſtirres any of your hearts this day, or any other
day, by his word, and you neglect it, and goe to your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and ſhops, and to your ſenſual pleaſures and delights,
you may hereafter deſire to have ſuch a time of the working
of Gods ſpirit againe, and if you would give a thouſand
worlds for it (were it in your power) you cannot have it,
therefore take heed you doe not neglect this great work. And
upon this ground labour to make ſure work; for if a man
had a work to doe, and having done it amiſſe, he might
mend it afterwards, he need not be ſo exact about it: but if
a man be ſet about a work, and he knowes when it is gone
out of his hands, he can never mend it, he will not be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
in it, but will lay his work to the rule, and labour to
make all ſure. Know, it is ſo with you about your eternal
condition: that which you doe in this world, muſt be availa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for ever, you cannot mend it afterwards. If after you
ſee your ſelves caſt, you ſhould ſay, O Lord give me farther
time, and let me come into the world againe, and then I
will mend this and the other fault that I was rebuked for;
God will ſay, no; you cannot returne into the world again;
therefore it neerly concernes you to make all ſure while you
have time. And doe not reſt upon blinde hopes, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
adventures, I hope it will be thus and thus with me;
but entertaine this thought, What if it ſhould prove otherwiſe?
what if I ſhould miſcarry? this will mightily daunt the heart
of a man, eſpecially if he knows that upon his miſcarriage,
he is undone for ever.</p>
               <p>Yet further, (which is another branch of the exhortation)
my brethren never baulk any way of God for feare of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
be willing to ſuffer any hardſhip for Gods way. How
doth that follow? thus: If the time of thy life be that upon
which the ſtating of thy eternal condition depends, then it
concerns thee to goe through ſtitch whatever comes in thy
way; as for inſtance, ſuppoſe a man were going to ſuch a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40441:71"/>
place, and he muſt be there at ſuch a time for his life, and
riding apace through the ſtreets the dogs bark at him (as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the dogs bark moſt at thoſe who ride faſteſt) how little
doth he regard the barking of the dogs: but did a man ride
onely for his recreation, then it would be a little trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to him: And when a man rides for his life, though the
clouds gather, and the raine falls, yet he will not returne;
and if he meet with foule and dirty way, he will through it,
or with a ſlough he will over it, becauſe it is for his life: but
if a man rides for recreation onely, and meets with windes,
and clouds, and ſtormes, he turnes back again. And truly
brethren, the wayes of moſt Chriſtians in religion are (me
thinks) ſuch as if they took them up for recreation, and
nothing elſe; therefore if there be but a cloud ariſe, a little
trouble and affliction appear, they repent their way, and
preſently return back again. O but did God reveal to thee
what eternity is, and what depends upon the courſe of thy
life here? then though there be clouds, and ſtormes, and
tempeſts, and rugged wayes, yet thou wilt be ready to goe
through all. The concluſion therefore is this, whenever
thou art tempted to ſin, labour by what thou haſt heard this
day to repell temptations; and ſay, God hath ſhewed me this
day the great errand and buſineſſe I came into the world for;
of what infinite concernment thoſe things are, that depend
upon the time of my life: ſhall I then ſatisfie the luſts and
corruptions of my own heart, and gratifie the devil, and the
world, and in the meane time neglect that which is of ſo
great importance for the good of my ſoul? Then once again,
O that you all knew in this your day the things that concerne
your eternal peace! Conſider what hath been ſaid, and the
Lord give you underſtanding hearts to make uſe of it.</p>

How it comes to paſse that there can be no good communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated

Chriſt.</item>
               <item>1. Becauſe of the breach of the firſt Covenant that God made with
mankind 37</item>

               <item>How Chriſt is all in all to us in Gods communication of good

               <item>1. From the covenant that God the father made with his ſon from
all eternity 39</item>
               <item>2. Chriſt actually comes to be the way of conveyance of all good to us,
by taking our nature upon him, and ſo making us reconcileable to
God <hi>ibid.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. Chriſt was content to come into the world, to be made the head of
a ſecond covenant between God and mankinde, to perform
whatever God the Father ſhould require for the ſatisfaction of
divine juſtice 40</item>
               <item>4. By this means God in forgiving of ſin, goes in a way of juſtice as
well as in a way of meccy 41</item>
               <item>5. And he is the way of conveying good to us, as by his ſatisfaction,

and the acceptation of us as righteous 42</item>
               <item>It is not all that we have done, nor all that we can poſſibly doe,

a dreadfull breach their ſins had made between God and them
