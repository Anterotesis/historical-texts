         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the ouer-ſeeing of that <hi>ſublime dicendi genus,</hi> which walkes

               <hi>Menaphon,</hi> my diſtreſſed haps are the reſolution of the
deſtinies, and the wrongs of my youth are the fore-runners
of my woes in age, my natiue home is my worſt nurcery, &amp;
my friends deny that which ſtrangers preiudicially grant:
I arriued in <hi>Arcadie</hi> ſhipwrackt, and <hi>Menaphon</hi> fauoring
my ſorrowes, hath affoorded me ſuccours, for which <hi>Samela</hi>
reſts bound, and will prooue thankefull: as for loue, know
that <hi>Venus</hi> ſtandeth on the Tortois, as ſhewing that loue
creepeth on by degrées, that affection is like the ſnaile, that
ſteales to the top of the launce by minutes: the graſſe hath

but the motion is not ſéene: loue like thoſe ſhould enter

being throwne into the fire, burnes ſtrait, but no ſooner out
of the flame but it fréezeth: ſtraw is ſoone kindled, but it is

<hi>Samela</hi> drew <hi>Menaphon</hi> into ſuch an extaſie for ioy, that
hee ſtoode as a man metamorphozed: at laſt, calling his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

off their talke, they went ſo view their paſtures, &amp; ſo paſſing
downe to the place where the ſhéep grazed, they ſearched the

Shepheard, her eyes like the fierie torches tilting againſt
the Moone: This Paragon, this none, ſuch, this Ewe,
this Miſtris of our flockes, was by a wily Fox ſtolne from
our folds, for which theſe ſhepheards aſſemble themſelues to

wonder: ſtepping alongſt the ſhore to come to ſome ſheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote,
where my wearie limmes might haue reſt. Loue that
for my labors thought to lead me to fancies pauillion, was
my conduct to a Caſtle, where a <hi>Theſſalian</hi> Knight lyes in

court of gard kept: thither I went, &amp; for my tongue I was
knowne to be a <hi>Theſſalian,</hi> I was entertained and lodged:
the Knight whoſe yeeres are yong, and valure matchleſſe,
holding in his armes a Lady more beautifull then Loues
Quéene, all blubbred with teares, aſked me many queſtions,
which as I might I replyed vnto: but while he talkt, mine
eye ſurfeiting with ſuch excellence, was detained vpon the
glorious ſhew of ſuch a wonderfull obiect: I demaunded
what ſhe was, of the ſtanders by, and they ſaid ſhe was the
faire Shepheardeſſe, whom the Knight had taken from the
Swains of <hi>Arcadie;</hi> and would carry with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt wind that

that thus your loues ſhould be ouermatcht with Fortune,
and your affections puld backe vp contrarietie or deſtinie.
<hi>Melicertus</hi> hearing this, the fire ſparkling out of his eyes,
began thus, I tell thée, ſhepheard, if Fates with their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
<pb facs="tcp:3566:37"/>
penſils did pen downe, or fortune with the deepe
varietie reſolue, or loue with his greateſt power determine
to depriue <hi>Arcadia</hi> of the beautifull <hi>Samela,</hi> wee would with

our gods ſhould ſummon her to <hi>Elizium,</hi> or ſhe reſt with vs

Well, the third day being come, no ſooner did <hi>Titan</hi>
ariſe from the watery couch of his Lemman, but theſe two
Champions were readie in the liſts, accompanied with the
rout of all the <hi>Arcadian</hi> ſhepheards, and old <hi>Democles</hi> whom
they had appointed for one of the Iudges. <hi>Pleuſidippus</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

as much amazed to ſée &amp; ſtrange <hi>Theſſalian</hi> Knight vaunt

direful reuenge, as they ſcorned to ſalute each other ſo much
as with threats, they fell toughly to blowes. <hi>Samela</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Lady gréeuing, that for her cauſe ſuch a ſtratageme ſhould
ariſe in <hi>Arcadie,</hi> her countenance full of ſorrow, &amp; flouds of
teares falling from her eyes, ſhee began to breathe out her

of the Shepheards fought, began to coniecture diuerſly of

who hauing béene long enamoured of <hi>Carmela,</hi> much good

<pb facs="tcp:3566:42"/>
both of them met hard by the Promontory of <hi>Arcadie,</hi> ſhee
leading forth her ſheepe, and he going to ſée his new yeaned
Lambes. As ſoone as they met, breaking a few quarter

            <p>
               <hi>Carmela,</hi> by my troth good morrow, it is as daintie to ſée
you abroad, as to eate a meſſe of ſwéet milke in <hi>Iuly:</hi> you are
proued ſuch a houſe-doue of late, or rather ſo good a huſwiſe,
that no man may ſée you vnder a couple of Capons: the
Church-yard may ſtand long enough ere you will come to
looke on it, and the Piper may beg for euery penny he gets
out of your purſe: but it is no matter, you are in loue with
ſome ſtout Ruffler, and yet poore folkes, ſuch as I am, muſt
be content with pottage: and with that, turning his backe,
he ſmiled in his ſléeue, to ſée how kindly he had giuen her the

thus.</p>
            <p>Indéed, <hi>Doron,</hi> you ſay will, it is long ſince we met, and
our houſe is a grange houſe with you: but we haue tied vp
the great dog, and when you come, you ſhall haue green ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
you are ſuch a ſtranger: but it is no matter, ſoone hote,
ſoone cold, he that mingles himſelfe with draffe, the hogges
will eate him: and ſhée that layes her loue on an vnkind
man, ſhall find ſorrow enough to eate her ſops withall. And
with that, <hi>Carmela</hi> was ſo ful ſtomackt that ſhe wept.</p>
            <p>
