            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

UPON AN

Brought against him
For Printing and Vending a late Seditious Book called
<hi>An Appeal from the Country</hi>

For the Preservation of His Majesties Person, Liberty, Property,

            <argument>
               <p>On Thursdry, the fifth of this Instant February, at the Guildhall in
the City of London, There was an Information exhibited by the
King's Council before my Lord Chief Justice Scroggs, against Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin
Harris Bookseller to this purpose, viz, That He the said
Benjamin Harris, did maliciously and designedly to scandalize the
King and Government, cause to be printed, and sold, a late sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Book called, An Appeal frem the Country to the City, for
the preservation of His Majesties Person, Liberty, Property, and
the Protestant Religion; and after it was read, Mr. Recorder made
a speech to the Jury, and the whole Court, to this effect.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Hope, This being a matter to be tryed in the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
coming here in great Multitudes, come to blush rather than to
give incouragement to it; and if we can give Your Lordship, and this
Iury satisfaction that this Person is guilty of the offence, according as
it is laid in the Information, I hope that both you, and all others that
shall hear it, (for I perceive there is a great expectation this day
from this cause,) I hope, I say, You will all abominate any man that shall
offer at any such like thing. Indeed we live in an age where all sort of
Faction and Rebellion is countenanced, Magistrates reviled, and scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by some persons, who think they have Authority so to do. It is
just like such another kind of Religion, which some have now of late
taken up, that rather than they will be thought to turn Phanaticks, they
will turn plain Atheists, and others, who scorn to be either down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Rebels. This Book is as base a piece as ever was contrived in
Hell, either by Papists, or the blackest Rebel that ever was: It seems
to carry with it a fine Character, and has a figure of all plausible obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Crown, to wit, <hi>an Appeal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For the preservation of
His Majestie's Person, Liberty, Property, and the Protestant Religion.</hi>
But if any of you have seen it, I hope you will be so far from giving any
countenance to it, as that you will, with me, think, 'tis so far from tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well to the Government, that it is only designed to rake up all Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Rebellion, and the very worst of all Rebellion. I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
I would rather have believed that it was only the sake of lucre
made him do what he did, for that would have somewhat extenuated
his Crime, if he had not read it first; but then to go, and have it Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and exposed to sale, &amp;c. this it a great aggravation,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52987:2"/>
If the same sort of Insinuation had been used towards any private
Tradesman, as hath been offered to the KING and Magistrates, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there is no man but would say, That e're this time he might have
hid his head.</p>
            <p>But Dissemblances of Pretences for the sake of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
now adays in his Shop will pass well enough, and Persons can tell
you there how far you may go from hence to <hi>Rome</hi> with safety; and
after they have blackened their mouths with Tobacco and Smoke, and
do not rail against the Church and the Government, they are looked upon
strait as no Protestants.</p>
            <p>But still as to this Person, the farther to urge it, by way of aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
upon him, he could vauntingly make his Boasts, when it was put
home to him, Why he would venture to do such things, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> That he had
above a Thousand Persons who would stand by him in whatsoever he
did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord Chief Iustice.</hi> There was hardly ever any Book more pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to set us together by the Ears than this, nor any thing a greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary;
One can hardly write a worse—</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Says he,</hi> We in the Country have done our parts, in Choosing; for
the generality, good Members to serve in Parliament; but if (as
our Two last Parliaments were) they must be Dissolved, or Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued,
whenever they come to redress the Grievances of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
we may be pitied, but not blamed. If the Plot takes effect,
(as in all probability it will) our Parliaments are not then to be
Condemned, for that their not being suffered to Sit occasioned
it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that here is a sly way of casting it upon the KING Himself.
And if it be not down-right Treason, I am sure, it is just upon the heels
of it. 'Tis a most abominable Piece.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>Then were called the Witnesses, to prove that the Books were Sold in his
Shop, and after they were all Sworn, first of all Mrs. <hi>Grover,</hi> a
Printer's Wife, stood up, who confessed she had half a dozen of them,
but not of him; for he was either gone out, or not in the way, but she
had them of his Man.</p>
               <p>Then stood up one <hi>Mary Darby,</hi> and she said, She had four of them.</p>
               <p>After her, Mr. <hi>Benjamin Tooke,</hi> at the <hi>Ship</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Churchyard</hi>
Bookseller, was Examined, who said he saw several Quires of them
in the Shop. And being asked by Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> How he knew they were
all those Books? He answered, That he turned over a great many of
them, and found them all the same.</p>

and the Government by it, we must acquiesce, but that, my Lord, he
absolutely denies; but seeing it running up and down the Town, he gets
some of them, and suffers them to lie up and down in his Shop, and this
only as a common thing to get money, so that we suppose it may not lie
within the Information, because it does not intentionally scandalize the
KING and the Government.</p>

                  <p>There is scarce any but <hi>Smith,</hi> that is so Factious
a Seller of Books, as <hi>Harris:</hi> All your <hi>Domestick-Intelligences</hi> are

                  <p>My Lord, I have known him about a Twelve-Month;

Quiet, Peaceable Man: He is, and has been so Reputed among his
Neighbours. And I have never seen any thing from him, but
what was very Quiet and Peaceable.</p>

                  <p>(another Neighbour of Mr. <hi>Harris</hi>'s) said, upon his

                  <p>I presume, that none of these do stand by him, in
any such thing: But he, being advertised of it, and being asked,
<hi>Why he would offer to Expose to Sale such a Book at this?</hi> He answered
and said, <hi>That he had a Thousand Persons, that would Stand by him.</hi>

                  <p>My Lord, I have seen this Book several times in
his Shop, and others too: And I have asked him, <hi>VVhy he would
so publickly Vend them?</hi> (I did not indeed Buy one of them my
self, but I caused a Man to Buy one for me) and he said, <hi>He had
several Thousands to Stand by him:</hi> and he is accounted an <hi>Anabaptist.</hi>
He said so before the <hi>Masters</hi> and <hi>Wardens</hi> of the <hi>Company;</hi> who
questioned him, why he sold such Scandalous Things? and he
said, <hi>He had several Thousands to Stand by him.</hi>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Then spake the <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> to this Purpose.</head>
               <p>BEcause my <hi>Brother</hi> shall be satisfyed with the Opinion of all
the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> what this Offence is, which they would
insinuate, as if the meer Selling of such a Book, was no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
'Tis not long since, that all the Judges met, by the <hi>King</hi>'s
Command; as they did sometime before too: and they both
Times declared unanimously, That all Persons, that do Write,
or Print, or Sell any Pamphlet, that is either Scandalous to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
or Private Persons; such Books may be seized, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
punished by Law: That all Books, which are Scandalous to
the Government, may be seized; and all Persons of Exposing
them, may be Punished. And further; That all Writers of News,
though not Scandalous, Seditious, nor Reflective upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
or the State; yet if they are Writers (as there are
few others) of False-News, they are Indictable, and Punishable
upon that Account.</p>
               <p>So that, your Hopes of any thing of that kind, will be vain;
for all the Judges have declared this Offence, at the Common-Law,
to be Punishable in the Seller, though in the way of his
Trade: The Books may be seized, and the Person punished.</p>
               <p>As for this Book, in particular; You can hardly read a more
base, and pernitious Book, to put us all into a Flame: It gives
you such Incitements, and such base Incouragements, with such
Reflections upon all sorts of Persons, (for I have Read it upon this
Account) that I think, there can scarce be a worse made. He
would set up another Man, that has no Title, to the Crown:
For (sayes he) <hi>the Greatest Danger accruing to your Persons, as well as
to the whole Kingdom, upon the KING</hi>'s <hi>untimely Death, will proceed
from a Confusion, and want of some Eminent and Interested Person, whom
you may trust, to Lead you up against a</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Popish <hi>Army: For
which purpose, no Person is fitter, than his Grace, the Duke of</hi> Monmouth;
<hi>as well for Quality, Courage, and Conduct, as for that his Life and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
depends upon the same Bottom with Yours. He will stand by You; and
therefore, You ought to stand by him. And remember the Old Rule is,</hi> He
who hath the worst Title, ever makes the best KING; <hi>as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Constrained by a Gracious Government, to supply what he wants in
Title: That instead of,</hi> GOD and my Right; <hi>his Motto may be,</hi> GOD
and my People. He sayes, <hi>Such a one would make a better KING;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52987:4"/>
for, as you see, the Worse the Title, the Better the KING. A KING,
with a Bad Title, makes a Better KING, than he that hath a Good
One; for, he shall be obliged to Comply with, and will humour the People,
for want of a Title.</hi> A Thing, which is of the basest Nature, that
can be: And yet this Man must give Money, to hasten the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of such a Book; and he had several Quires of them in his
Shop. Except the Writer of it, there cannot be a worse Man in the
World; who, for Trival Profit, will neglect the Peace and Quiet of
his Country, and set us all together by the Ears, for a Groat.
And, Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> if you expect any thing in this World, of this
kind of Favour, you must find out the Author; for he must
be a Rebellious, and a Villainous Traytor: For, though he
seems to inveigh against <hi>Popery,</hi> it is only to be a Rebel. And
certainly, he has rejected all the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> and all Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that Man requires; and prophaned all Holy Writ. He
is some Body, whose Fortune does not suit with his Condition;
and who, because he is not at ease and quiet himself, will let
no Body else be so neither.</p>
               <p>You have nothing more to do,
but to give your Verdict:
<hi>Speaking to the</hi> Jury, <hi>who
presently with-drew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be any thing in Law, let me know it; because you
go out.</p>
               <p>Then one of the Jury asked my Lord, if they might not have
the Book with them, which was there in the Court, and it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in the Negative.</p>
               <p>Before the Jury went out, Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> would fain have spoke
to them for himself, but it was not permitted him.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Then, after a little while tarrying, they returned to the Bar.</head>
               <p>And being, as is usual, asked if they were agreed on their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
and who should speak for them; they answered yes, and
appointed their Foreman, who said He was guilty of selling
the Book.</p>
               <p>At which there was a very great and Clamorous Shout.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Justice said, that was not their business, they
were only to determine whither barely Guilty, or not Guilty.</p>
               <p>The Recorder would have had them given their Verdict by
the Poll, but they all unanimously Cryed out, they were all
Agreed, and then the Foreman gave the Verdict again, Guilty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52987:5"/>
Mr. Recorder then prayed, that he being for the King, Mr.
<hi>Harris</hi> might stand Committed; who was thereupon presently
delivered to a Tippstaff to be carryed to the Kings Bench.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> earnestly beseeched his Lordship, that he might
be sent to any other Prison, and named <hi>Newgate</hi> three or four
times, but it was not granted him: Thereupon he said, I hope
God will give me Patience to go through it.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Then my Lord Chief Justice spake to the Jury to this
Effect.</head>
               <p>I am sorry you gave Countenance to this Cause so much, as
to stir from the Bar, when the Evidence was so full, and when
I told you plainly, not only my Opinion, but likewise that of
all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> that selling this Book was an Offence
at the Common Law, for which they ought to be punished:
and yet with your Scruples, you give the Party (with their Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and Shoutings) to take Advantage; though you did mean
upon the matter, the same thing then, you do now: Yet you
see, upon every little occasion, when a thing shall seem to thwart
the Government, how ready they are to send up their loud
Hollowings. It was not so prudently done as might have been
done.</p>
               <p>We had need look about us, for if at such a time, and for such
a base Book, such Clamorous Noises shall be made, what shall
become of us? Our Lives and Fortunes are at stake. Would I
knew some of those Shouters, I would make them know, I would
punish them: I am Incensed in the behalf of the Government,
and of all our Lives and Fortunes, that such shall go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished.</p>
