         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

both theſe are given to the man not to the ſoule; The body is copartner in the ſin, it muſt therefore ſhare in the torment; it muſt therefore be rayſed that it may be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Eternity of joy or paine, is awarded to the juſt, or to the ſinner; how can the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be capable of either if it ſhould finally periſh in the duſt?

                     <p>It is true, my unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is great, but I have to do with an infinite mercy; ſo as my wretched unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe doth but heighten the glory of his moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pardon and acceptation.

there cannot be but danger in the delay of it; in the ſpeed there can be nothing but a comfortable hope of acceptation: It is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to repent too ſoone; too late I may: To repent for my ſin, when I can ſinne no more, what would it be other then to be ſory that I can no more ſin? And what thank is it to me, that I would, and am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to offend?

And ſhall I with the fooliſh Virgins, delay the buying of my oyle, till the doores be ſhut? But, let me live; Have I repentance in a ſtring, that I may pull it to me when I liſt? Is it not the great gift of that good Spirit, which breatheth when, and where it pleaſeth? It is now offered to me in this time of Grace; if I now refuſe it, perhaps I may ſeek it, with teares, in vaine: I know the gates of hell ſtand alwaies wide open to receive all commers, not ſo the gates of heaven; they are ſhut upon the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and never opened but in the ſeaſons of mercy; The porches of <hi>Betheſda</hi> were full of cripples expecting cure; thoſe waters were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

                     <p>Since then it cannot bee out of defect of knowledge, that God ſees not the ſinnes of his elect; is it out of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable connivence that he is willing not to ſee, what he ſees? ſurely, if the meaning be, that God ſees not the ſinnes of the penitent with a revengefull eye; that out of a mercifull indulgence, he will not proſecute the ſins where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have repented, with due vengeance, but paſſes them by, as if they had not been; we do ſo gladly yeeld to this truth, that we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bleſſe God enough for this wonderfull mercy to poore ſinners; it is his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                     <p>Am I more inlightned then others? the more do I diſcerne my owne darkneſſe; and the more do I find cauſe

perhaps he that knows leſſe may love more; and if he had been bleſſed with my means, would have known more; Neither is it the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the Talents that argues favour, but the grace to imploy them to the benefit of the giver: if he that received the one Talent had gained another, he had received more thanks then he that upon the receit of five Talents had gained one.</p>
