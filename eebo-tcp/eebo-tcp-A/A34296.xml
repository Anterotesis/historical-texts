            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I </hi>Humbly entreat your<hi> LORDSHIP </hi>to throw an eye upon theſe few Papers I have written about the Congreſs at the<hi> Hague, </hi>upon the eager ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of ſome worthy perſons of my acquaintance, who being curious to
<pb facs="tcp:61502:3"/>
know what had paſt there, were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps left at liberty to conſider how unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable I was either to refuſe, or to ſatisfy them, eſpecially in ſo nice a Language, as the<hi> Engliſh; </hi>for I am afraid that by ſome uneaſie Words, and by ſome ſtruggling Expreſſions, it will be eaſily diſcovered that I am a Stranger to that Language, and conſequently I run the hazard to be thought a Stranger to the Subject too. In fine, I am between fear and hopes; and I humbly beſeech your<hi> LORDSHIP </hi>to redeem me from that pain. If your<hi> LORDSHIP </hi>can perſuade your ſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to read this little Book, and if you do not throw it away before you have finiſht it, that will be an infallible ſign of my ſucceſs; and your bare indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency will do me more Honour, than the applauding-Praiſes of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of others. And in this caſe, I
<pb facs="tcp:61502:3"/>
humbly deſire your<hi> LORDSHIP </hi>to preſent it to Her Majeſty; to tell Her that the Author does humbly dedicate it to Her, and that if he has not done it in the uſual manner, it is only becauſe he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured well to manage the profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Veneration he has for Her Majeſty's Sacred Name. I do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but Her Majeſty will peruſe it, ſeeing it is recommended by ſo Great a hand; and I ſhall think my ſelf extream happy to have once in my Life, for one half hour, entertained the moſt Pious, moſt Vertuous, and moſt Beautiful Queen in the World. It is, I confeſs, a very great preſumption in a Foreigner to deſire ſo ſignal a Favour from the chief Miniſter of State; but that very Name of Foreigner ſeems to ſoften the boldneſs, and carries with it an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo much received by all Civilized
<pb facs="tcp:61502:4"/>
Nations, that pleads for your generous Patronage. The mighty weight of the publick Affairs, lies indeed very heavy upon you; yet, by reaſon of your<hi> LORD-SHIP</hi>'s vaſt Capacity and Courage, you ſeem ſtill to be able to bear a greater one; you have ſtill ſome Moments to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute amongſt your Friends and Clients; and I humbly beſeech your<hi> LORDSHIP </hi>to be pleaſed to receive me amongſt the Number of the laſt. I ſhall be very careful not to render my ſelf unworthy of that Name; and I intend to make it mybuſineſs, to convince your<hi> LORDSHIP, </hi>by all my Thoughts and Actions, That there is no body in the world with more reſpect and ſubmiſſion, than,</p>

            <head>THE CONGRESS AT THE HAGUE.</head>
            <p>BEing deſirous to ſee the famous Congreſs at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where the King, to the immortal Glory of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, was to be met by moſt Princes of the <hi>German</hi> Empire, and amongſt them, by thoſe that make the greateſt figure in it; where the ableſt and moſt refin'd Miniſters of <hi>Europe,</hi> in the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſight of ſo many Potentates, were to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize their Eloquence, Experience, Counſels, Skill in Politicks, Faith, Zeal, and what elſe could make them recommendable to the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and Moſt Diſcerning of Princes in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe: Being, I ſay, impatient to ſee this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Aſſembly, I parted from <hi>London, January</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61502:5"/>
the <hi>30th.</hi> 1690/1. and arriv'd at <hi>Harwich</hi> the <hi>31ſt</hi> at Night. It was certainly in the worſt Seaſon for Travellers, and in the worſt Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that Seaſon. The Rain that had laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral days, and did ſtill continue, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by a very high North-eaſt Wind, gave us but a very melancholy proſpect of our Voyage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> the <hi>1ſt,</hi> Wind and Weather were ſtill the ſame; and at a time we entertain'd our ſelves with the little ſucceſs we were like to meet with in our little Voyage, the Captain of the Pacquet-Boat, call'd the <hi>Vine,</hi> came to tell us, that he would ſet Sail in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; and that whoever had a mind to go along with him, muſt be ready at that time. He told us, That a Meſſenger was arriv'd from Her Majeſty, with the Particulars of my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s and his Complices Trial; and I fancy, with ſomewhat of greater conſequence, and that required a greater expedition; That he had expreſs Orders to depart immediately; and though it was a hazardous enterprize to put to Sea at a time, when thoſe that were upon it would certainly wiſh themſelves, tho with the loſs of all that was leſs dear to them than their Lives, to be a Shore; yet he could not but be obedient.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61502:5"/>
Prince <hi>Charles Rudolphe</hi> of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to that brave General that Commands the Auxiliary Troops of <hi>Denmark</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was then at <hi>Harwich,</hi> waiting for the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to go over into <hi>Holland.</hi> This Prince, tho in the prime of his Age, being but Twenty three years old, had already given great proofs of his Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, during three Campaigns in <hi>Morea,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Collonel of one of the Regiments the Prince Regent of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> his Couſin, had ſent to the aſſiſtance of the Republick of <hi>Venice;</hi> but being informed (as the News of great and Noble Enterpriſes is ſoon ſpread over the World,) That the King was going himſelf to Head his Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſolv'd to leave thoſe ungrateful Fields, dyed with the Blood of ſo many brave <hi>Germans,</hi> that have loſt, and ſtill loſe their Lives, worth a better fate, in the ignoble Service, and for the advancement of the Empire of ſome few grave and eaſie Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and to ſignalize his early and better beſtowed Valour, in the ſight of the braveſt of Generals, and beſt of Monarchs. Much time was required to paſs over the wide <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean;</hi> and though there was but too little given to the tender embraces of the Princeſs his Mother; yet <hi>Germany, Holland,</hi> the <hi>Channel, England,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61502:6"/>
not ſo ſoon croſs'd, but the impatient Prince hearing, that two obſcure names, the <hi>Boyne</hi> and <hi>Limmerick</hi> were Nobilitated, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepedity, Skill, Travels, and Conduct of their Royal Sire, he applauded the King's, and grieved at his own deſtiny. The Seaſon was ſpent, and no hopes left for an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to exerciſe his Courage this year, when upon a ſudden, the Earl of <hi>Marlborough</hi> was Commanded by the King to Embarque, with a conſiderable Body of Men. Every body knows the ſucceſs of this enterpriſe, and how ſoon this fortunate General rendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Kingſale,</hi> and all this in ſo critical a time, that in the Hiſtory of the King's Campaign in <hi>Ireland</hi> that year, the Expedition of my Lord <hi>Malborough</hi> will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſerve for a glorious Poſtſcript. There were many illuſtrious Voluntiers that ſerved in this Expedition; brave <hi>Grafton</hi> fell, and if the Prince, who in the ſame quality ſerved in the Troops Commanded by his Brother, did eſcape the danger, he may thank his kinder Deſtiny for it. He did all that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from one, that neglecting the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he enjoys by an Honour derived from his Anceſtors, deſires to render himſelf Illuſtrious by his own Merits. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the Trenches; no Aſſault given, but he was amongſt the moſt advanc'd; and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61502:6"/>
He made Priſoner with his own Hands the late Governor of <hi>Kingſale</hi>'s Brother, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a conſiderable Sum for his Ranſom, he gave him to one of the Commanding Officers, reſerving only for himſelf the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Conſciouſnes of that Action. He was now come from <hi>Ireland,</hi> to wait on His Majeſty at the <hi>Hague;</hi> and I having had the Honour to be known by him ſome years ago at <hi>Paris,</hi> I waited on him, to hear if he was reſolved to part; he with a ſmiling Countenance, deſpiſing the Danger, told me, That he would make uſe of the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to be as ſoon in <hi>Holland</hi> as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; That he had already ſent his Baggage on Board the Pacquet-boat; and that he would immediately follow: I, thinking by my ſelf, <hi>Caeſarem Vehet,</hi> without any more ado reſolved to follow him.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the Paſſengers, ſtay'd behind, and wiſe they were; for having ſcarce made four Miles in five hours time, and ſuffered all the torments an exceſſive Cold, a terrible Storm, and an enraged Sea, can cauſe men to ſuffer, we were forced to return into the Harbour, where we lay till <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> the third.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61502:7"/>
We had that day Full Moon; and by its influence Mariners commonly expect ſome change of Weather. The Sun roſe indeed very bright, the Sea was leſs rough; but the Wind was ſtill contrary: We ſet Sail however, in hopes to get over with the Tide; which we did in three days time. We had no ſooner loſt the ſight of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Coaſt, but we eſpied a <hi>French</hi> Privateer, that was making up towards us; I could not find that any body in our Boat was in the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at it: The Cannons were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately charged with Bullets, Arms diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, and all things made ready for a Fight; but the Monſieur being come near enough to diſtinguiſh the Pacquet-boat, away he went, without leaving us the leaſt ſign of his good breeding.</p>
            <p>There are but Three Pacquet-Boats that are employed to entertain a correſpondency with the Continent; they are all extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinory Sailers, and their Equipage, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their bigneſs, is very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Ours was mounted by Sixteen pieces of Cannon, and Fourty Mariners; and though Their Majeſties pay for Fifty, yet ſome invincible accident or other will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that excuſes ſome from doing their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61502:7"/>
Duty; and the want of half-a-ſcore does not break the ſquare.</p>
            <p>The Captain of our <hi>Vine</hi> had indeed no outward appearance of that current name, that by a meaner Courteſy of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for want of better acquaintance, is thrown away upon every Red-Coat, though never ſo ſcandalous; his look (with reverence to his Sword be it ſaid) was not much big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than that of a luſty Countrey Farmer; but in times of Danger, that's to ſay of Blows, he had, and did ſtill diſcover ſo jolly an ignorance of the Peril, and ſo hearty a negligence of his Eaſe, that we could not but admire the ſimplicity of his Courage. The <hi>French</hi> King was ſome months ago at a great loſs to get intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of our deſigns. <hi>William</hi> the third, according to his own opinion, was, <hi>le meilleur homme de Cabinet,</hi> That's to ſay, a Prince that knows how to chuſe ſuch Miniſters, that beſides their unqueſtioned experience in State Affairs, have the <hi>Piſtole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof</hi> Talent of Keeping Counſel. Some little remains of the late-coyned Plate of his Kingdom, were promis'd to ſuch Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers as would attempt to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of one of our Pacquet-Boats, and conſequently of one of our Mails.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61502:8"/>
Three of the boldeſt of them, allured by the gain, offered their Service: They had the good luck to attack our Captain, who conſidering the odds, immediately threw the Mail overboard, and defended himſelf afterwards with ſo much Vigour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that with the loſs of one Man only, and one Wounded on his ſide, he Killed numbers of the Enemy; who valuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon having eſcap'd ſo unciviliz'd an Antagoniſt, brought the <hi>French</hi> King no other News, but what was writ in Bloody Characters, upon their own haraſs'd Carcaſſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>5th,</hi> We came within the ſight of the Coaſts of <hi>Zealand,</hi> and towards Night to an Anchor. The <hi>6th.</hi> we Weighed Anchor about Two a Clock in the morning, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing by favour of the Moon and the Tide: Being awakened by the Noiſe of our Crew, I went upon the Deck, and looking round about me, I fancied we were near the Coaſts of <hi>Greenland</hi> or <hi>Nova-Zembla.</hi> I did not ſee but ſwimming Mountains of Ice, ſtriking by intervals, with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt our Boat, that ſome weaker Brothers of our Company were not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle apprehenſive of a far greater Night than that which equally divides the year in thoſe unfortunate Climates. The Captain
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61502:8"/>
ordered ſeveral Guns to be diſcharged, to inform the Inhabitants of <hi>Helvetſluys</hi> of our Danger; and a little time after we ſpy'd a Sail, that coming to our aſſiſtance, took us on her Board, and brought us ſafely into the Habour.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> my Lord <hi>John Hamilton,</hi> the Young Marqueſs <hi>de la Barre,</hi> and I, with ſome other Gentlemen, went to the next Inn, where we found ſome little Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Countrey could afford; and how little ſoever the reputation of a Turf-Fire in <hi>England</hi> be, yet I am ſure we found it very comfortable. From <hi>Helverſluys</hi> we went to the <hi>Brill,</hi> from thence to <hi>Maſdandſlays,</hi> being about three hours a croſſing the <hi>Maeſe,</hi> by reaſon of the Ice that was floating upon it, and through which we were forc'd to make our way; and towards Night we arrived at <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Walking through one of the fineſt Streets of that City, I ſaw ſome little Remains of a Houſe belonging to the <hi>Heer Nifelt,</hi> the chief Magiſtrate of that Place, that was ſome time ago raz'd to the Ground by the Multitude upon this occaſion. One being made Enſign of the Militia of the City, was accompanied by ſome of his Friends, carrying ſome Galons of Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh to the Guard-Houſe, in order to treat the reſt of the Officers according to the Cuſtom
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61502:9"/>
of that Place. Some Officers of the Cuſtom-Houſe meeting them in the Street, offered to ſeize the Wine, under pretence that they had not paid the Exciſe; and tho they were told that it was upon an occaſion that excus'd them from paying it, yet a quarrel aroſe, in which one of the Officers of the Cuſtoms loſt his Life: They did not fail to ſecure one of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and though the Crime could not be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively faſten'd on him, yet the <hi>Scout</hi> (which is the Name of the Chief Magiſtrate) ſentenc'd him to have his Head cut off, which was done accordingly. The man had a good Reputation amongſt all his Neighbours, and died with a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Conſtancy, temper'd by a Chriſtian Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: He told the People, that tho no man could poſitively ſay he had committed the Crime for which he ſuffer'd, yet he himſelf could not ſay neither, that he had not done it: He prayed fervently, and then ſubmitted to the Stroke, that depriving him of his Life, gave birth to the moſt dangerous Monſter in a Body Politick. It was reported, That the <hi>Scout</hi> had a pique a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this man, for having once hindered the advancement of ſome Affairs, that he thought might have turn'd to his advantage: Some pretended to have heard him ſay, That if ever he had the good luck to fall into his clutches, he would remember him for his Kindneſs; which being ſpread all the Town over, made
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61502:9"/>
ſome ſad impreſſions upon the Spirits of the People; preparing the moſt forward of them for an Inſurrection: Numbers of them were ſeen walking together in the Streets, carrying ſome miſchievous marks of indignation in their countenances; all of them ſpeaking, and none hearing; when upon a ſudden one of the Soldiers of the Militia (a conſciencious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel) came to tell them, That he himſelf had had the miſfortune to kill the Officer of the Cuſtoms, ſhewing the bloody Sword with which he had perpetrated the Crime, and that the other was fallen an innocent Victim to the revengeful <hi>Scout;</hi> That he was ſorry—but they would hear no more; they got Arms, and away they marched to the <hi>Scout</hi>'s Houſe, and by going, their ſtrength did increaſe. It was obſerv'd that the Women were the moſt forward, beating ſome ruſty Kettles for want of Drums, and by that homely Noiſe encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the weaker Men to do Miſchief: In ſhort, the Houſe was pulled down in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Scout and his Son did narrowly eſcape the fury of the Mobb, by changing their Clothes with two Soldiers of Baron <hi>Frickſem</hi>'s Regiment, that by the order of the States was advanced to appeaſe the Tumult. To do the Scout juſtice, he has the Reputation amongſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Men, of being a Perſon of ſound Principles, a Zealous Patriot, and conſequently a cheerful
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61502:10"/>
Promoter of his Majeſty's Intereſt, and they look upon this Accident as an unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his too ſtrict adherency in this Point to the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Rotterdam</hi> I went to <hi>Delpht,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Hague,</hi> where I arrived <hi>February</hi> the 7th at Night.</p>
            <p>The King had made his publick Entrance here <hi>February the</hi> 5th. that's to ſay, two days before our arrival. I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to copy out of the <hi>Gazette</hi> a relation of that Ceremony, that had nothing very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in it, but the joyful acclamations of the People. All the World knows how natural an averſion his Majeſty has for that vain Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is ſo much affected elſewhere; how much he has declined it upon all occaſions; and that with <hi>Cato,</hi> that noble <hi>Stoick,</hi> he had rather future Ages ſhould ask, Why he had none? than, Why others had ſome Statues e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them? In doing great Actions, and expoſing his Royal Perſon again and again for the Safety of his Subjects, He calmly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the genuine Dictates of that generous Mind, that deſires no other Reward, but what is ſtampt upon each glorious Enterprize; nor any other Monuments, than thoſe are daily rais'd Him in the hearts of His People;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61502:10"/>
too ſincere, and too natural, to be imitated by an <hi>Italian</hi> Architect. And it was to ſatisfie thoſe that flock'd to the <hi>Hague</hi> from all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces to ſee Him, that His Majeſty after a ſudden arrival at the <hi>Hague,</hi> the ſame day he was come aſhore, was at laſt prevailed with to go to dine at a Houſe call'd <hi>Sorgflie,</hi> a Mile from the <hi>Hague,</hi> belonging to My Lord <hi>Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and at his return to his Palace, to paſs through the Triumphal Arches the States had erected Him in ſeveral places.</p>
            <p>The Structure of them is indeed noble and magnificent, and ſeveral of the Inſcriptions anſwerable to the Dignity of the Subject; but whereas they are very numerous, I had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leiſure nor humour enough to copy them: I ſhall only give you a ſhort deſcription of one of the Arches that ſtands neareſt to the Court, by which you may gueſs at the reſt.</p>
            <p>This Arch is builded according to the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Architecture, in a Dorick Order. It has three Portals, the middle of which is higher than the Body of the Structure it ſelf: It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned on both ſides with ſixteen Columns, ſtanding upon large Baſements, that are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the main Building, each Baſement ſupporting two of the ſaid Columns. The middle Portal has a very large Cupulo, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61502:11"/>
upon it ſtands a Pedeſtal, upon which the King is repreſented on Horſeback to the life, Man and Horſe very richly gilded. At each ſide of the Pedeſtal there are couching two Slaves in a Braſs Collar, turning their Backs towards it; and the main Body is ſo artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly painted, that it appears to be made out of Stone: In each Field between the Columns there are in Black and White repreſented moſt of His Majeſty's Glorious Actions: Over the Corniſh is raiſed a Balluſter of the ſame Order, with ſixteen Pedeſtals directly above the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, ſupporting Statues that repreſent to the life promiſcuouſly Men and Women, and round the Cupulo are writ theſe following Words.</p>

His Majeſty had before, and did after his publick Entrance conſtantly aſſiſt the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive Aſſemblies of the States-General; the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Councel of the State, employing all his Minutes to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch of ſuch Affairs, as were moſt conducing to the Safety and Proſperity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth in particular, and in general to the advancement of the Common Cauſe.</p>
            <p>In a Speech the King made at his firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at the Aſſembly of the States-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, he told them, That <q>when he ſaw them laſt, he had inform'd them, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to croſs the Seas to reſcue three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms from Popery and Slavery; That God Almighty had bleſt his righteous Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in ſo ſignal a manner, that his Succeſs had been beyond his Expectations, nay, and beyond his Wiſhes too. That <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> had offered Him their Imperial Crowns, which he had accepted, not, as he call'd God to witneſs, to ſatisfie his Ambition, but to be in a better capacity to maintain the Proteſtant Religion, and a laſting Peace and Tranquility in theſe Kingdoms, and to aſſiſt his Confederates, and eſpecially this State, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the powerful incroachments of <hi>France.</hi> That he was now come accordingly into theſe Provinces, not only to Concert with his Allies,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61502:12"/>
the Meaſures that were to be taken the next Campaign, but to exerciſe alſo with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable application the Charge of Captain-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the United Provinces. That he was in hopes God Almighty would make uſe of him as an Inſtrument to confound the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dangerous Deſigns of the Enemy, to turn off the Danger from their Heads, and to reeſtabliſh an Univerſal and laſting Peace in <hi>Europe.</hi> That He ſhould die with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſatisfaction in the World, if he could compaſs theſe Deſigns. He concluded his Speech with ſome tender Aſſurances of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Love to the State, and it was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red accordingly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing the King did, was the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the <hi>Dutch-Fleet,</hi> declaring, that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was, it ſhould be commanded by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Tromp.</hi> It is not eaſily expreſt how much his Royal Pleaſure was applauded by the States, and what univerſal Rejoicings it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt all ſorts of people.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Admiral-General <hi>Tromp,</hi> Son to that famous Hero, that from a ſimple Mariner rais'd himſelf to the next to the chiefeſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the State, is a Man of a full Stature; an ordinary look, and that wearing an old faſhion'd Black Coat, an ill ty'd Cravat, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61502:12"/>
his own weather-beaten Hair, makes at the beſt no better Figure, than that of an ordinary Burgher of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> but by his great and numerous Exploits, he has diſcovered that which is hidden in his Phiſiognomy, that's to ſay, a greatneſs of Soul, a boldneſs of Spirit, and ſo wiſe a Conduct in his moſt perillous Enterpriſes, that conſidering his long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, he is now look'd upon as one of the greateſt Sea-men in the World. To reſtore a brave, but unfortunate Prince to his loſt Kingdom, or to ſave it when he ſtands upon the fatal Brink of looſing it, are Bleſſings, few of the greateſt Generals of all Ages can boaſt of; and if Heaven ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imploy'd the hand of a particular Man about ſo great a Work, it was after it had anxiouſly inſtructed his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, variouſly expos'd his Life, and narrowly inquired into his Succeſs in a thouſand leſſer Actions, and then it was the immortal Reward of an equally Great, Succeſsful and Aged General; but bold <hi>Tromp</hi> reapt that Glorious Title of a Royal Reſtorer from one of his firſt Warlike Eſſays, and in the Flower of his Age. <hi>Frederick</hi> the Third, King of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61502:13"/>
               <hi>Denmark,</hi> had in ſpight of his Virtue and Valour, loſt all the ſtrong Places of his Kingdom; <hi>Coppenhaguen</hi> the Capital City, and ſole Remainder of that unfortunate Countrey, was beſieged by Sea and Land by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and though the Citizens behav'd themſelves to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, animated by the preſence of their Royal Sire, and the whole Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, yet they muſt have given way at laſt to a valorous and ſucceſsful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. 'Tis ſaid, That the <hi>Swedes,</hi> ſure of the prize, had already divided amongſt them the Quarters of that City, and that ſome ungenerous Counſellors of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my did deſign the Royal Progeny for a Victim to ſecure the Conqueſt; when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſudden a numerous Fleet of the States, Commanded by <hi>Tromp,</hi> appeared in the <hi>Sound.</hi> It was not known upon what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign he came, for the States were then in Alliance with neither of the Parties, and both equally fear'd and hop'd for his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but <hi>Tromp</hi> quickly decided the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for ſince it is the Intereſt of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and in particular of the States-General, to Ballance an equal Power between the two <hi>Northern</hi> Crowns, he fell upon the Superior Party, deſtroy'd their Fleet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61502:13"/>
the City, and by that Strenuous Action cauſed that ſudden and wonderful Revolution, that did not only render the King once again Maſter of his Kingdom, but Abſolute Maſter too. The King to ſhow his Royal Gratitude, made him a Count of his Kingdom, and beſides honoured him with the Noble Order of the <hi>Elephant.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second made him Knight and Baronet of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> but theſe are Titles that ſignifie but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Seamen; they know him to be Juſt and Brave, they Love him as their Father, and cannot forget, nor abide to call him by any other Name, than by that plain familiar and <hi>Dutch</hi> one, of <hi>Cornelis van Tromp.</hi> He has ſince that time ſignalized himſelf in ſeveral Sea-fights with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They are too well known, and their Conſequences have been too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to both Parties, to need to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have experienced his Valour, and he has theirs, and this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſciouſneſs of each others Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (how different ſoever their manners are) together with the urgent neceſſity of their Affairs, as it cannot but by join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Fleets, make a Glorious Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy of their Hearts, ſo we have all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61502:14"/>
reaſon to expect ſuch Effects from it, as will be anſwerable to the greatneſs of the Deſign.</p>
            <p>Some few days after His Majeſty had nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Admiral <hi>Tromp</hi> to Command the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, it was confidently reported at the <hi>Hague</hi> that <hi>Tromp</hi> was poyſon'd; I think it was the effect of Fear of ſome that did not love to ſee certain Perſons there. He fell ſuddenly Sick indeed, but whatever the cauſe of it was, he did as ſoon recover; and at a time the Report did ſtill continue, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied as 'tis uſual by ſome particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I ſaw the Admiral in good Health in the King's Anti-Chamber, where he ſtaid above an hour; he is not much above Two and fifty years old, and is ſaid to be very Vigorous, principally when he is in his own Element; yet he looks very decrepit. It ſeems great and conſtant Fatigues at Sea, as they take away that brisk and jolly Appearance of Youth in the Face, ſo they ſtrengthen the Body, and inure it to a long Life. And I am told, That the Famous <hi>French</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Admiral <hi>Du Queſne</hi> look'd as old Thirty years before, as he did when he died.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:61502:14"/>
Whilſt His Majeſty with an unſatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Care advanced the Intereſt of the States, and their Confederates, there paſt ſcarce one day, but ſome Prince or other came to the <hi>Higue.</hi> Many of them keep Great and Splendid Courts in <hi>Germany;</hi> and the Two Electors of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg,</hi> make a Figure in the Empire not inferior to that of Great Monarchs. They all ſtand very much upon their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, and to ſpeak the truth, there is in no Country more time ſpent in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſuperfluous Nicety of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, than in <hi>Germany;</hi> but it ſeems <hi>William</hi> the Third had ſet them a Pattern. They came to Conſult, to Act, and not to ſhow their Grandeur. No publick Entrances were made, they all arrived <hi>incognito,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that ceremonious Reſpect that muſt needs have been paid to their Illuſtrious Characters; the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> (as it was ſaid) did aſſume the Name of Count of <hi>Thungen;</hi> the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> that of Count of <hi>Ravensberg,</hi> and they were imitated by the reſt of the Princes. And ſince very few, that were at the <hi>Hague,</hi> had either that Leiſure or Advantage; that I had of being well inform'd of the exact

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61502:16"/>
and the ſame day his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs waited on His Majeſty. Certainly there can no ſtricter Alliance be made in the World then that has always been, and is now more ſolemnly renewed between theſe two Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates; for inſtead of being of the nature of thoſe, that alas! till now, have moſt commonly been made in <hi>Europe,</hi> by the Intervention of ſome hardy <hi>French</hi> Miniſter, who to make out the Name of <hi>Plenipotentiary,</hi> thought to have a full Power to Cheat with a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, to Lye with an Emphaſy, nay, to ſwear falſe for his Maſter's Intereſt; it is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Illuſtrious Principals themſelves, without an authorized Spy, and grounded upon the ſame Intereſt, Religion, Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, Perſonal Affection, and what elſe is moſt ſacred amongſt Men; and as on one hand, the Confederacy of ſo great a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch cannot but be very Glorious to His Electoral Highneſs, ſo His Majeſty on the other may reap great and conſiderable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits from it, for he is a powerful Prince, his Dominions are of a vaſt extent, His Nobility numerous, His Subjects warlike, and he entertains an Army near Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thouſand Men, well Arm'd and better diſciplined; moſt of them are the Veteran Remains of thoſe Victorious Troops that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61502:17"/>
ſerved under the Banners of <hi>Frederic William,</hi> his Father, deſervedly called the <hi>Achilles</hi> of <hi>Germany.</hi> As the Memory of that Great Prince will be Sacred for ever amongſt all, that either have a Soul capable of being touched by the benign Influences of a juſt and ſolid Reign, that laſted near half an Age, or that are competent Judges of the true Character of a compleatly experienc'd and vigorous Warrior, which he maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the very laſt minute of his Glorious Life; ſo there is yet another Reaſon we are more particularly concern'd in, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Bleſs his Name: I ſay, That great Reſpect, and that paſſionate Love this old Great Man always entertained for his Nephew, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> His Preſent Majeſty, in ſo eminent a manner, that to croſs the Empire by tedious Journeys from one end to another, in order to have a frequent enterview with the Prince, to joyn the Electoral with the <hi>Orange-Banner,</hi> and to plant their Princely Tents on the ſame Meadow, he reckon'd amongſt the greateſt Bleſſings of his Life. His now Electoral Highneſs his Son follows exactly as in this, ſo in every other Reſpect the Glorious Footſteps of his Father. He was Born <hi>July</hi> 1. 1657. he is a wiſe and politick
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61502:17"/>
Prince, and tho he be but of a little Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not altogether anſwerable to the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Soul, yet he has a brisk Look, and a martial Vivacity in his Face, that does become extreamly well the Conqueror of <hi>Bonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 8. Arrived <hi>Friderick Charles,</hi> Duke Adminiſtrator of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> Uncle to <hi>Eber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard Lewis,</hi> Prince Regent of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> who being Born <hi>September</hi> the 18th. 1676. and is conſequently ſtill under Age; he and his Dominions are govern'd by his Uncle, according to the Tenor of the Imperial Laws during his Minority. <hi>Stutgard</hi> is the Reſidence of the Prince, and the Capital City of a plentiful Country. It is famous through all <hi>Germany,</hi> by reaſon of the well-provided Univerſity at <hi>Tubingen,</hi> and the Illuſtrious School there, which none but Princes and Noblemen are admitted to, renders it yet more conſpicuous. 'Tis true, it has very much ſuffered in that fatal War that laſted Thirty years in <hi>Germany,</hi> and it has yet ſome freſher marks of Deſolation, ſtamp'd upon its very Bowels by that Cruel and Common Enemy, who to this day Uſurpes of the Houſe of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> the whole County of <hi>Mompelgard</hi> with all its Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61502:18"/>
yet by the wiſe and gentle Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of its Illuſtrious Adminiſtrator, the Prince Regent makes ſtill a Figure ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the grandeur of his Name; his Subjects are taught to live happy, and whilſt ſome of his Troops are diſperſed in the Service of thoſe that carry the War into the very heart of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, he has ſtill a reſerve of a good Body of Men, either to increaſe the Confederate Army, or to be increas'd by his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. There is no Countrey of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of Ground, can be in ſo good a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, except it be govern'd by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Prince; and ſuch is He we have ſeeen and admired at the <hi>Hague.</hi> He was Born <hi>January</hi> the <hi>24th.</hi> 1652. He is a Prince of an admirable Preſence, a well-ſet Body, a graceful Gate, a majeſtick Deportment, and a maſculine Face, that would be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd by being called Beautiful; and as theſe are qualities that ſtrike the hearts of his beholders with a Sacred Horror, ſo 'tis ſaid, That by reaſon of his vaſt Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, his clear and ſound Judgment, together with a Noble eagerneſs to advance the Common Cauſe, he was one of the Princes, that had the greateſt part in His Majeſty's Favour and Eſteem.</p>

               <hi>February</hi> the <hi>16th,</hi> about Ten a Clock at Night, arriv'd <hi>Maximilian Emanuel,</hi> Duke of the Upper and Lower <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the Upper <hi>Palatinate;</hi> Count <hi>Palatin</hi> on the <hi>Rhine;</hi> Arch-Sewer and Elector of the Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; Landgrave of <hi>Leuchtenberg,</hi> I need not ſay upon what occaſion the Electoral Dignity, that was torn from <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> V. Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> and King of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> was beſtowed upon the Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> ſince that unfortunate Prince did himſelf inform the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; neither do I intend to enlarge upon the great Wealth and Power of that Ancient Family, ſince 'tis notorious, That the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> alone, of all the Princes of the Empire, (I mean of thoſe that are of a Religion required in an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, by the fundamental Laws of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire) is in a condition to ſupport, and conſequently to diſpute the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Imperial Crown; which is ſo well known by the <hi>French</hi> King, that ſome years ago he left no ſtone unturned (I had almoſt ſaid no Plate unmelted) to gain his Electoral Highneſs over to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. A Match was made between the <hi>Dauphin</hi> and his eldeſt Siſter; and ſeeing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61502:19"/>
that he was then very young, and that conſequently, the Charms of the firſt Crown in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and the Name of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror might poſſibly make a great impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on ſo tender an Age; He promiſed him to get him, by his Intrigues, to be choſen King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in caſe he would eſpouſe his Intereſt; That's in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to help himſelf or his <hi>Dauphin</hi> to the thing he did promiſe Him as a reward of his aſſiſtance. Great numbers of <hi>French</hi> Miniſters reſorted dayly to <hi>Munichen,</hi> to obſerve, nay, to obſede the Prince. They entertained him with nothing but the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of their Maſter; They made a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable figure themſelves, and care was taken to intermingle their premeditated Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with ſome immoderate Praiſes of the ſurpriſing Beauty of the Princeſs of <hi>Conty;</hi> and I am credibly told, that ſome had, at laſt, the Front, to offer the Marriage of one of the King's Baſtards to him that was deſign'd for a Daughter of an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: But his Electoral Highneſs ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated their unreaſonable hopes, and at a time the whole Empire was preparing to mourn the loſs of ſo powerful a Prince; He upon a ſudden turning the Scale, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a ſtrict Alliance with the Emperor,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61502:19"/>
Married the Arch-Dutcheſs of <hi>Auſtria</hi> his Daughter; and ſending his numerous Troops to his aſſiſtance in <hi>Hungary,</hi> entred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thoſe memorable Fields, that have Crowned his Head with everlaſting Lawrels. And it was this young <hi>Hero,</hi> that by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Belgrade</hi> by Storm, one of the moſt important Fortreſſes in the World, gave us the faireſt and ſolideſt proſpect of the intire downfall of that monſtrous Empire, that till then had been the terror of all <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was born in the year 1662. <hi>June</hi> the <hi>11th,</hi> and though I am no Aſtrologer, yet I dare ſay it was under a very happy Conſtellation. Thoſe that have had the Fortune to ſee him at the <hi>Hague, Engliſh, Germans, French, Spaniards, Italians, Dutch, Swedes, Danes,</hi> all did agree in the praiſe of this Prince, each of them ſeeming to obſerve in him what makes an accompliſh'd man, to the particular notions and nicety of their own Countrey; in ſo much that he may be ſaid to have been the <hi>Titus Veſpaſian,</hi> that's to ſay, the Darling of the <hi>Hague.</hi> To make a true Picture of this admirable Prince, and to expreſs his Character in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, eſpecially after what I have ſaid,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61502:20"/>
is too hard a task for ſuch a Scribler as I am; for though we are all apt to Copy, yet we cannot Copy from the Life. 'Tis true, it is eaſily ſaid, That this Prince is of a Middle-ſize, and ſuch as may be call'd modeſtly, Tall; That his Limbs are ſtrait, his Body ſlender and well-ſhap'd, his Shoulders large, his Face Oval, and every part and lineament of it happy; That his Looks are refined; and though he be of a ſmiling Countenance, yet that it is hard to diſtinguiſh, whether it be to applaud the exact comportment of ſome, or to deſpiſe the want of it in others; That he is Obliging to all the World; That his Converſation is Charming; in fine, that in all reſpects he is a very accompliſh'd Prince; yet theſe are but general Notions, that will not ſatisfie thoſe, that in this lovely Prince have obſerv'd ſomewhat peculiar to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that by ſome ſecret Charms gains him the hearts of all that approach him; and this I ingeniouſly confeſs is beyond my abilities to expreſs. And it is this Prince, that though he be of a contrary Perſuaſion to that of His Majeſty, yet has been one of the moſt forward to pay His Majeſty his reſpects in ſo obliging and extraordinary a manner, as could hardly be expected ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61502:20"/>
from a Prince of his Rank, or be paid to any other than to the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the liberty of <hi>Europe;</hi> and on the other hand, His Majeſty has given him ſuch unuſual marks of his Eſteem, Love and Friendſhip, given and received with ſo mutual a ſatisfaction, that never two Princes did either more ſympathiſe, or had more reaſon to be ſatisfied with each other's enterview.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> the <hi>21ſt.</hi> arrived <hi>Charles</hi> Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> attended by the Count of <hi>Lippe,</hi> General of his Army, and Baron <hi>Gortz</hi> his Chief Miniſter, and ſeveral other Great Perſons. He was Born in the year 1654. <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> He is a Prince of a fine Appearance, a mild Temper, his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is gentle and eaſie, and he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that great Rank, and defends that Religion in the Empire, he has derived from his glorious Anceſtors, with great ſucceſs and Honour. His Great Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Philip</hi> the firſt, and <hi>John Frederick</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> were the two firſt and chief ſupporters of the Proteſtant Religion, when it was in its infancy. They Rais'd and Headed themſelves an Army againſt that Great and Victorious Emperor <hi>Charles</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:61502:21"/>
the <hi>5th,</hi> who ſeeing that all the Projects of <hi>Rome,</hi> to hinder the progreſs of a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that was Preach'd by <hi>Luther,</hi> with a ſucceſs anſwerable to the Holy eagerneſs, and Apoſtolical boldneſs of that Great Man, were defeated, was going to imploy ſome ſtronger and ſurer Arguments; and a bloody Battel was fought at <hi>Mulberg</hi> near the <hi>Elbe.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles, <hi>Roman</hi> then indeed, accuſtom'd to look their Enemies out of Countenance, were then firſt taught to Tremble, and their Wings were clipt by theſe undaunted Warriers, that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, either by overturning the Enemy, to acquire the great Name of <hi>Conquerors;</hi> or by ſigning the Truth of the Goſpel with their Illuſtrious Blood, to deſerve the more Glorious one of <hi>Confeſſors.</hi> And though the Battel was loſt at laſt, and the Brave Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> made Priſoner; yet the Emperor fearing that he ſhould be overcome if he gain'd ſuch another Victory; and on the other hand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that neither he himſelf nor his Religion would be ſafe, as long as <hi>Landgrave Philip</hi> was unconquer'd, he made uſe at laſt of thoſe inglorious Arts, that in one moment deprived the Prince of his Liberty, and the Emperor of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61502:21"/>
that Honour, that till then had been ſacred.</p>
            <p>The Two Princes had been kept Five years in Priſon; and the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was as many years nearer to its ruine, when brave <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> having ſecretly rais'd an Army, ſurpriz'd the Emperor ſo ſuddenly at <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> that though he himſelf did eſcape, yet the Captive Princes were ſet at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperor's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> made a Priſoner.</p>
            <p>It was, indeed, a ſudden Change, and that may well be rank'd amongſt the brighteſt bleſſings of that Miraculous Providence, that till now, with ſo much ſollicitude and care, has preſerved and advanced the Proteſtant Religion. For from this time it began to riſe apace, ſecured from the inſults of its Captive Perſecutor, who to gain his Liberty, readily Sign'd the famous Contract of <hi>Paſſaw,</hi> in which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants had thoſe mighty advantages granted them, they to this day enjoy in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, being protected by ſo many great and powerful Princes, and amongſt them
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61502:22"/>
by his Highneſs <hi>Landgrave Charles,</hi> upon whoſe occaſion I have made this little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion, not only to give you a hint of the Power of his Houſe; but to ſhew alſo what great obligations all Proteſtants have to his Illuſtrious Family.</p>
            <p>The laſt of all the Princes that arriv'd at the <hi>Hague,</hi> were their Highneſſes the Dukes of <hi>Lunenbourg-Zell,</hi> and <hi>Brunſwig-Wollfem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buttel.</hi> The fiſt being hindred by ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, did not arrive till <hi>March</hi> the firſt, and the ſecond few days after it. <hi>George William,</hi> Duke of <hi>Brunſwig</hi> and <hi>Lunenbourg-Zell</hi> was born in the Year 1624, <hi>February</hi> the 16th. and conſequently has paſt the 67th Year of his Age. Thoſe that are acquainted with the Hiſtory of his glorious Life, that know, that he has ſeveral times baffled the Hectoring Monarch, routed his Armies, and that one of the greateſt and moſt experienced Mareſchals of <hi>France</hi> was forc'd to follow his Triumphal Chariot, could not but infinitely be pleaſed with the ſight of this venerable Old man; for it ſeems, that being inured to Fatigues, and uſed to conquer, he can now be overcome by nothing; nay, not by Age it ſelf. His Body is ſtill vigorous, his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61502:22"/>
Judgment clear and ſound, his Thoughts ſtrong and unconfined; he apprehends ſtill as quick as he ſpeaks, and far from that ſowerneſs of Temper, that moſt commonly attends the Infirmities of Ancient Perſons; he awakens and rejoices the hearts of all thoſe that approach him, by a ſmiling Countenance, ſo unuſual, yet ſo well becoming to a Great Age. His Court is certainly one of the moſt refined in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> His Miniſters have acquir'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that ſolid Reputation, but few in <hi>Europe</hi> can pretend to; and as they are capable to form and to concert, ſo he has a General, that at the head of a well diſciplin'd Army, can as bravely execute a great Deſign.</p>
            <p>I cannot forbear to ſay, That of all the Reſpects paid to His Majeſty, during his ſtay at the <hi>Hague,</hi> by ſo great and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princes, that of his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Zell,</hi> muſt needs make the deepeſt and ſtrongeſt Impreſſions on ſober and thinking men. It will be ſaid perhaps, That moſt of the reſt being young, valiant, and ambitious of that Glory his Majeſty has gain'd by ſo many great and hazardous Enterprizes; they were come to adorn the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61502:23"/>
Triumphs of the Hero of our Age, out of meer Galantry; but to ſee ſo Wiſe and Old a Prince that has outlived ſo many various Changes and Revolutions in <hi>Europe,</hi> and that conſequently has got ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that far from being taken up by outward ſplendid Appearances, he is able to look into the very bottom of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and to weigh each particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of it; I ſay, to ſee ſuch a Prince to undertake a tedious Journey in ſo rough a Seaſon, in order to wait on, and to conſult with his Majeſty, and to pay him all imaginable reſpect in ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a manner, is a thing that will convince the moſt obſtinate, that <hi>William</hi> the Third is univerſally look'd upon as the great and bleſſed Inſtrument in the hand of God to reſcue <hi>Europe</hi> out of the inſatiable hands of its cruel Oppreſſor; to maintain in, or to reſtore oppreſs'd Princes to their Rights, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh once more a Solid and Univerſal Peace.</p>
            <p>And theſe were the chiefeſt Princes that did in Perſon concert with his Majeſty the meaſures of the approaching Campaign. It was indeed a glorious Sight; and that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61502:23"/>
could not but pierce the Souls of all thoſe that have a true love and veneration for His Majeſty, to ſee ſo many great Princes daily come to Court, to paſs through the crouded Antichambers,, and to go into that ſacred Cloſet, where the Fate of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> was to be decided. To write the Hiſtory of what has paſt there, would be worthy of the moſt Eloquent and Refin'd Pens of our Age, and it would be a Piece that would without doubt ſurpaſs all that has been to this time writ in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; but it is as yet a Myſtery, and I dare ſay, a Myſtery to the very Miniſters and Plenipotenciaries themſelves, and that nothing but Time, and I hope the next Campaign, will unravel.</p>
            <p>The moſt uſual time to go to Court, was between Twelve and One a Clock in the Afternoon; and between Eight and Ten a Clock at Night; and they that walk't to Court a foot, at this time, as they were deafned by the continual Noiſe of an endleſs number of Coaches; ſo they were forced to be in a continual motion, and to turn from one ſide to another to give way to their numerous and clamorous Attendan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The moſt conſiderable Princes were
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61502:24"/>
ſoon known, or elſe eaſily diſtinguiſhed by their Livery and Attendance; and when they were going or coming, notice was given to the <hi>Suiſs-Guards,</hi> who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ranged thgmſelves in the Form of a Half-moon, having one of their Officers at their Head, and both Wings of the Door that gave entrance to the Anti-chamber were open'd, though this laſt Honour was alſo granted to Foreign Miniſters, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons of Quality, eſpecially if the <hi>Suiſſers</hi> had been well remembred. The Princes paſſing through the Anti-chambers, were attended by their Miniſters, ſome walking before, and ſome behind them; and at Night one of his Majeſty's Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen Uſhers carried the Candle before them. In His Majeſty's Apartment the King and the Princes were all ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bare-headed. They called the King, <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> and the King call'd Them by that Name that is uſually gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Kings to Sovereign Princes; but His Highneſs, the Duke of <hi>Zell,</hi> had the Honour to be called Father by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
            <p>

There was none of the Princes, but that did immediately upon his Arrival at the <hi>Hague,</hi> wait on the King; the moſt conſiderable of them, had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to have their Viſits paid by His Majeſty, and they received Him in the Street at, and conducted Him again to his Coach. At Court the King dined always alone; and when he treated ſome of the Princes, it was in one of his Palaces that are out of the <hi>Hague,</hi> and the moſt conſiderable of them had the honour to treat him alſo at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Palaces, where they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. At His Majeſty's entrance into the Dining-Room, there was at firſt found but one Cover laid upon the Table for the King; a little while after it, there was another laid for the Prince, that did, or that was treated; and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both ſet down, his Majeſty gave a Wink to ſuch Perſons of Quality as were to have the honour to dine with Him.</p>
            <p>When His Majeſty drunk a Health, He named it ſoftly to the Prince, who did the ſame to his Neighbours, and ſo it went
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61502:25"/>
ound, and the Trumpets did only ſound when the King and the Prince were ra drinking. One Sunday the King treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt Conſiderable Princes at <hi>Sorgfliet</hi> (a Houſe His Majeſty has given to my Lord <hi>Portland)</hi> from thence they went to <hi>Shevelinguen;</hi> And being about Five a Clock in the Afternoon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the <hi>Hague,</hi> they went to the <hi>Tour a la Mode.</hi> The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was placed at His Majeſty's left ſide; the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> at the right, and the Landgrave of <hi>Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> at the left-ſide in the foremoſt part of the Coach, being followed by the Duke, Adminiſtrator of <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> in another. There was an infinite number of Coaches there, but they all ſtopp'd while His Majeſty was making the Round. The <hi>Tour à la Mode</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> is very near the Court, and certainly one of the beſt contrived in <hi>Europe.</hi> It goes firſt in a very long and ſtreight Line, and at the end cuts to the right, into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that the Round makes a good <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile. There are Rales made, and great Trees planted at an equal diſtance on both ſides, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61502:25"/>
being for perſons that walk on Foot, and the Coaches go round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
            <p>There were ſeveral Princes of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Branches of the Great and Ancient Houſe of <hi>Naſſau</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> who as they have diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their own Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Merits, ſo they made a Figure ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that Great Name. Time is too ſhort, and the deſign'd Compaſs of this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too narrow to ſpeak of each of them in particular; yet I cannot forbear to ſay ſomething of Prince <hi>Henry Caſimir</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Hereditary Stadtholder of <hi>Friſeland</hi> and <hi>Groninguen.</hi> He was Born in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> 1667. He is a Prince of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary little and ſlender Stature, but he has a vigorous Look; and he is ſo Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and ſo Brave, that in all Reſpect he deſerves to be called the <hi>Alexander</hi> of our Age. But ſince the Dignity of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Friſeland</hi> and <hi>Groninguen,</hi> in which he did ſucceed his Father when he was but Seven years old, has been made Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary to him, and that it was brought about by ſome very remarkable means; I think it will not be amiſs to make a ſhort Relation of it. <hi>Henrica Emilia,</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61502:26"/>
Dowager his Mother, was ſtill ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her Authority and Counſels, the tender Age of her Illuſtrious Infant, when one <hi>Vander Vayen,</hi> a Miniſter of great Learning, and a ſubtile Spirit, who had been exiled out of <hi>Zeland,</hi> his Native Country, for ſome Opinions of his, the Divines did not approve of, did arrive in <hi>Friſeland;</hi> after he had for ſome years led a private and obſcure Life at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and having obtained the Liberty to Preach at <hi>Lewvarden</hi> before the Court, his frequent and elaborate Sermons, which he pronounced with an audible Voice, and an humble Meen, accommodated to the genius of that Nation, had ſuch ſecret Charms, and made ſo unaccountable Impreſſions upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Auditors, that they were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally applauded by thoſe that did, and that did not underſtand them. He imploy'd his private Hours in teaching weak and ignorant Perſons the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion; and to thoſe that were of a greater Capacity he explained the Myſteries of Philoſophy and Divinity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways refuſing to take Money for his pains, the moſt charming of Affronts in that Country. He had a peculiar Art to convince, to perſwade, and to conquer the Hearts of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61502:26"/>
thoſe he converſed with, by ſome familiar Arguments; and as his Converſation was charming and eaſy, ſo it was too nice, and too refined for one that pretended to know nothing but the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Form of Government in <hi>Friſeland,</hi> is much like to what the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> did obſerve in their conquered Provinces. The People is divided in Tribes, to each Tribe belongs a certain diſtrict of the Land, and they have each for their chief, one of the Nobles, that has the biggeſt Eſtate, and the greateſt Intereſt in the Country. Upon ſome Emergency in the State, theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles have the Priviledge to collect the Votes of the People, and they know how to diſpoſe them according to their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Intereſt. They have no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Prince for their Charges, and conſequently may without any hazard croſs his Deſign, in caſe they are not well affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The only way to ſecure the Princes Intereſt from ſuch troubleſome Attempts, was to make the Stadtholderſhip Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; but ſince that could not be done without leſſening the Authority of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, it was look'd upon as impracticable.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61502:27"/>
               <hi>Vander Vayen</hi> was the firſt Man that dared to form the Deſign of it. He perſwaded the Princeſs Dowager to Inveſt him with the Title of Honorary Counſellor of the Prince; and being authorized by that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to advance his Maſter's Intereſt, he very eaſily gain'd the Divines, who making it their Buſineſs in their Sermons to make the People mindful of the Great and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Services the late Prince their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had rendred them, and that they lay under the ſtrongeſt Obligation in the World to ſhew their Gratitude to the Prince his Son, worthy of ſo Great a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and worthy of their Love, by ſecuring the Title of their Governour, to him and his Heirs for ever; they did firſt attentively hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, and in a little time as readily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it.</p>
            <p>From the Governour of <hi>Friſeland,</hi> I come to the Governour of the <hi>Spaniſh Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> and with him I intend to conclude the Article of the Princes. The Marqueſs of <hi>Gaſtanaga,</hi> Governour and Captain-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> appeared at the <hi>Hague</hi> with a numerous Court, and in a very ſplendid Equipage. He is ſaid to be a Man of Fortune, that has rais'd himſelf
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61502:27"/>
to that high Station by his great Merits; and the latter part of this common Report is abundantly juſtified by the great Eſteem His Majeſty had for his Perſon. To govern a Country that is at ſo great a diſtance from its Monarch, and ſo near to its Enemy, where moſt of the Inhabitants are ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by their Prieſts, that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be deſtroyed by a Catholick Enemy, than to be ſaved by a Proteſtant Friend, is indeed a very hard task, and they that blame the Marqueſs's Conduct, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt incapable to imitate it. As to his Perſonal Preſence, he exceeds in that very thing <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14th; and the eſteem a great many have for the latter upon that Score, will infinitely be leſſened by the ſight of the Marqueſs of <hi>Gaſtanaga.</hi> He is indeed a graceful <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and if by the Governour's Appearance one might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably judge of the Conſtitution of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try he Governs, it would be thought to be one of the fineſt and beſt proportioned in the World. He was very frequently at Court, and had ſeveral private Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with His Majeſty, and his Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Highneſs of <hi>Brandenbourg;</hi> but by reaſon of the movements of the <hi>French</hi> Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> he parted from the <hi>Hague</hi> before
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61502:28"/>
his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Zell</hi> was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Being upon his departure, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in His Majeſty's Name preſented him with a Couple of Horſes, which he received with great Joy and Reſpect, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Gentleman with a Ring of great Value, he had drawn from his own Finger.</p>
            <p>They that have not been at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and that know it to go under the Name of a Village, will hardly imagine how it could furniſh Palaces enough for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of ſo many Great Princes; but when they will be informed, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe Princes, there was a conſiderable number of Foreign Miniſters, Envoys Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and Plenipotentiaries, never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeen at one ſingle Monarch's Court, who being the Repreſentatives of their Princes, muſt needs make a Figure anſwerable to the Grandeur of that Name; They will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fancy, that under the humble Name of a Village, <hi>Hague</hi> muſt needs have an Air of a Capital, nay of the once Capital City of the World.</p>

            <p>There were beſides ſeveral Deputies ſent to His Majeſty by ſome of the Imperial Cities.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak of each of them in particular, to enlarge upon their Characters, to relate the manner of their Reception, and to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py their Speeches, numerous enough to form a Book of true State-Eloquence; altho it would be inſtructive to young Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and beſides be very acceptable to thoſe that cannot hear enough of things relating ſo much to the King's Honour, and where their own tender Sentiments of all His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Deſigns, Reaſon and Duty inſpires them with, are unanimouſly approv'd and confirm'd by the Mouths of ſo many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and able Miniſters, yet it would be a Theme both of greater skill than I can pretend to, and of more time than I have allowed me.</p>
            <p>The uſual time of Audience for Foreign Miniſters was between Nine and Ten a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61502:30"/>
Clock in the Morning, being conducted by Sir <hi>Charles Cotterel,</hi> Maſter of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; and they were received with more or leſs, according to the Quality of their Principals. The reſpective Envoys of the Emperor, of the Kings, Electors of the Empire, and of the Princes that have the Honour to be Related to his Majeſty, were conducted to the publick Audience in Coaches with ſix, and the others in Coaches only with two Horſes. I ſhall only give you one inſtance, by which you may judge of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Windiſhgratz,</hi> Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary from his Imperial Majeſty, had his Audience <hi>February</hi> the <hi>14th.</hi> He is one of the greateſt and ableſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Emperor's Court; for having been imployed all his life-time in Foreign Embaſſies, he has acquired himſelf that prodigious knowledge of the Affairs and Intrigues in <hi>Europe;</hi> that as it is anſwerable to his great Age, ſo there are none in the World that can pretend to ſurpaſs, and but few that can reaſonably be compared with him.</p>
            <p>It was obſerved by thoſe that are nice in remarking each particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of great Actions, that this venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61502:30"/>
Politician, for all his being uſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly to entertain Kings and Emperors, when he came within the ſight of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, diſcovered ſo noble a Concern, and ſo opportune an Awfulneſs in his Face, that as it was far from that ſignal Fear, that puts others out of Countenance, ſo it did infinitely expreſs his Reſpect and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for ſo Good and ſo great a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as His Majeſty had notice gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, him that the Imperial Envoy was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Court, he came into the Anti-Chamber, and being Seated on His Royal Throne, his Grace the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> conducted the Envoy to, and my Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> received him at the Door of the Anti-Chamber. Being entred, he made three deep Bows; the firſt, at his entrance; the ſecond, after he was a little advanced; and the third, when he was come near to His Majeſty; Who as often put His Hand to His Hat: and having humbly inclined his Body towards His Majeſty, he, to the beſt of my remembrance, told him:</p>
            <p>That he was ſent by the Emperor his Maſter to Congratulate His Majeſty on His happy Arrival in <hi>Holland;</hi> that he wanted words to expreſs the great Eſteem
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61502:31"/>
his Imperial Majeſty had for his Heroical Vertues; that they were a Subject that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained his Thoughts at his deareſt hours; and that in his Opinion, as well as of all thoſe that had a true ſenſe of Honour, he paſt for an incomparable Prince. That he was infinitely obliged to him for the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable Cares His Majeſty had and did ſtill take to advance that Juſt and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cauſe, in which he himſelf and all <hi>Europe</hi> was engaged: and though it was matter of great trouble to his Imperial Majeſty to ſee him expoſe his ſacred Life to ſo many Hazards and Dangers; yet ſince it was evident that His Majeſty was lookt upon by all the Conſederates as the Sacred Anchor of their Cauſe, and the chief Supporter of their Intereſt, and that without His generous Influence, their beſt endeavours might poſſibly be rendered fruitleſs, he could not but intreat His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to continue in His Noble Fervency to animate the Confederates, to ſecond their Deſigns, and to teach them to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by His Glorious Victories.</p>
            <p>The King having anſwered him in ſhort, but ſolid terms, ſo much becoming Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and ſo natural to Himſelf, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy retired with the ſame reſpect, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61502:31"/>
obſerving the ſame Ceremonies as he did at his Entrance, not turning his Back till he came out of His Majeſty's ſight.</p>
            <p>To give you a Liſt of the Perſons of Quality, Counts, Barons, Generals and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, remarkable by ſome ſingular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that were at the <hi>Hague,</hi> is more than I, and I think any body elſe can do. It ſeem'd His Majeſty's Anti-Chambers at the <hi>Hague</hi> were made the general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of all Illuſtrious Perſons in <hi>Europe.</hi> There was every Day ſeen ſome great Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner or other, who by a brisk and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Look, by ſhort and frequent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of ſome well-met Friends, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that he was but lately arrived; and though to ask his Neighbours who he was, ſeemed to be an eſtabliſht importunity, yet ſome great Prince or other paſſing through the Anti-Chamber, and the courteous Multitude ſtriving to give way, he that was to give the Anſwer was loſt in the Croud, and with him the hopes of ever making an exact Catalogue.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the Generals, there were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markt two of the Imperial Army, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Count <hi>Palfy,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy.</hi> The latter is a Prince of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61502:32"/>
Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and Nephew to that great Man that was once, alas, the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> the Glory of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and the Hopes and Delight of all the Confederates. I think I have ſaid enough to raiſe in your fancy a high Idea of his Character; and indeed it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be beyond his merits. He is in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects worthy of that great Name, Young and Gallant, Generous and Brave, and his Soul inhabits a Body anſwerable to its greatneſs: He is very tall and yet well ſhap'd, he wears his own Hair, which as they are large enough to cover his Back and Shoulders, ſo they leave a full view of his graceful Face; His Steps are firm, and ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Pompey</hi> when he made the World tremble; His Look is ſtrong, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, and, indeed, ſomewhat like that of an Eagle; inſomuch that they that have the fortune to fight under this brisk General, may in their Leader's Face diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſigns of the Imperial Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>As there were Great and Renowned Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals at the <hi>Hague,</hi> ſo there was a ſimple Soldier, a Soldier of Fortune amongſt them, that was too remarkable to be paſt over in ſilence. I went once to dine at a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61502:32"/>
               <hi>French</hi> Ordinary, where I found a great Company, and amongſt them a little Man in a Blue Coat, with a large Golden Lace, who at the Table was the only Man that entertained the Company; He ſpoke of great Feats and Actions, of many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands defeated by ſome few Hundreds, of firing and killing, of advancing, and never retreating; and one asking him ſome news of a certain Collonel of the <hi>French</hi> Army, <hi>Him,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I have kill'd with my own Hands;</hi> and another, naming a <hi>French</hi> Lieutenant Colonel, <hi>To him,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I gave Quarters.</hi> I had ſtrange Thoughts of this Man, and ſome of them, I confeſs, were not to his advantage: When the Company riſing, and the little Stranger going out of the Room, I ask'd my Neighbour, who that Terrible Gentleman was, that had ſo little dined, and ſo much ſpoken; and I was ſurprized to hear him ſay, that it was Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Miniſter of the <hi>Vaudois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was enough to correct the ill Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I had of his Diſcourſe, and to change it into a great eagerneſs to get into his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; and ſeeing him return into the Room, I inſenſibly engaged him to tell me ſome Particulars of the ſurpriſing Actions

of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> under his Conduct, which he did then, as I thought, with great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs and Modeſty, I being now, perhaps, as much pre-poſſeſs'd in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as I was before againſt him. After all, he telling his Stories without a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, and without modeſtly paſſing over his own Exploits, did confirm the Truth of the Character that was given me of the Sincerity and Plainneſs of the <hi>Vaudois,</hi> Courteous Breeding, and a Nice Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, being their leaſt quality. Indeed fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages will hardly believe, that a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Miniſter, at the head of a handful of oppreſt and ſtarved Wretches, was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly capable dutifully to oppoſe the forced Cruelties of their own unwilling and dear Tyrant, but to check the Power of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, to defeat great numbers of his beſt Troops, and to maintain his Soldiers, his Countrymen, his Friends, his Brethren, his Children, his All, in the grateful poſſeſſion of their dear beloved Valleys.</p>
            <p>He was now come to the <hi>Hague,</hi> as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy from this wonderful People, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate himſelf at his Majeſty's Royal Feet, and to implore the continuance of his powerful Protection and aſſiſtance, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61502:33"/>
to make them more capable to fight for, and to defend their good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maſter: And 'tis ſaid, that His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, in conſideration of his great Service, was pleas'd to make him a Colonel of one of the Regiments he deſign'd to ſend to his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>And thus much of thoſe Great and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Foreigners that were at the <hi>Hague.</hi> I ſhould now ſay ſomething of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Court, and thoſe great Perſons that did compoſe it, if I were to write to any other Nation but the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They know them too well, by reaſon of their great Birth, Wealth and Merits, to need to be told, that they made a great Figure at the <hi>Hague;</hi> and to name <hi>Norfolk, Ormond, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire, Dorſet, Nottingham, Monmouth,</hi> &amp;c. is to write an Elogy of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility.

            <p>Some of them are Perſons of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Preſence; and ſome eſpecially being diſtinguiſh'd by the Garter, they were as much reverenced by all Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when they paſt through the Anti-chambers, as the greateſt Princes and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors were by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Right Reverend Father in God, <hi>Henry,</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> was one of thoſe that was moſt taken notice of. His Great and Noble Extraction, his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, his obliging Behaviour towards all Perſons, and eſpecially his untainted Zeal for their Majeſties Intereſt and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, have rendered his Name dear to all that have the happineſs to be Proteſtants, Foreigners as well as <hi>Engliſh:</hi> And they that have ſeen him in His Majeſties Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61502:35"/>
in his Velvet Gown, as they could not feed enough their Eyes on ſo Reverend an Object, ſo they all agreed, that he was the trueſt and livelieſt Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of that great Church that has ſo vaſt a Reputation amongſt, and that is certainly one of the beſt ordered of all Proteſtant Churches in the World. In his Habit, they diſcovered that Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Decency, that is ſo ſucceſsfully obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and in the mild and benign Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Face, they read in Legible Characters that ſaving and peaceable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that according to the Rules of the Goſpel is ſo much preacht up by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> In fine, they all concluded him to be one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt deſerving Sons of ſo bleſſed a Mother.</p>
            <p>As to Matters of Ceremony that were obſerv'd amongſt the <hi>German</hi> Princes, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Noblemen, there was no body put to the trouble to remove Difficulties. They freely paid and received, they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and paid their Viſits with a mutual ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and theſe Two generous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtriving to overcome each other in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, made a grateful Confuſion of their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61502:35"/>
different Characters. The Right Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> gave very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Viſits to the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and his Electoral Highneſs did pay him every one of them.</p>
            <p>It ſeems, that as there is amongſt ſome Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>Poles</hi> and the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> the <hi>Swedes</hi> and the <hi>Danes,</hi> either a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or Eſtabliſht Antipathy, ſo there are no Nations in the World that ſympathize more than the <hi>Germans</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do. The ſame Freedom of Humour, the ſame Largeneſs of Soul, the ſame Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, the ſame Complexion, the ſame Vertues, and (I beg leave to ſay) the ſame Vices too, as they naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and prompt them to a mutual Love and Friendſhip; ſo thoſe that are verſed in Hiſtory, and know that the one did deſcend from the other, ſeeing them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, will hardly diſtinguiſh the Copy from the Original.</p>
            <p>I conclude this Paper with the Pleaſures and Diverſions of the <hi>Hague:</hi> There were every Day Two Plays acted in Two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Play-houſes, one of <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the other of <hi>French</hi> Comedians. The latter
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61502:36"/>
are in his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Zell</hi>'s Service, by whoſe Order they were come to the <hi>Hague</hi> to divert that Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Company. The Princeſs of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-Eyſenach,</hi> who was come to the <hi>Hague</hi> with the Prince her Brother, kept a <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> every Night; and ſhe being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly one of the moſt beautiful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht Princeſſes in the World, all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the higheſt Quality came fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to pay her Homage, and the time was ſpent in pleaſant Diſcourſes. Thoſe that had a mind to play at Cards, found that Diverſion every Night at the Counteſs of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> her Lodgings. This Lady has been a very great Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; ſhe has been in <hi>Paris, Madrid, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Bruſſels,</hi> the <hi>Hague,</hi> and is conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo well known, that I need not write her Hiſtory. She is one of Cardinal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>'s Nieces, who married her to the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> a Prince of the Royal Blood in <hi>France,</hi> by whom ſhe had Three Children, the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> the Heir of his Father's Eſtate, Prince <hi>Philip,</hi> who enjoys great Benefices in <hi>France,</hi> to the value of Two Hundred Thouſand <hi>French</hi> Livres a year, and the brave Prince <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who has ſo much ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61502:36"/>
himſelf in the Imperial Army, and who now is one of the Generals of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Forces. The Currant Money at Play were <hi>Engliſh</hi> Guinea's, the <hi>German</hi> Ducats being too weak, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Piſtols too crooked to dare to appear within ſight of them.</p>
            <p>Hunting was alſo one of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of that Illuſtrious Aſſembly. His Majeſty gave that Diverſion ſeveral times to the Princes; and I remember, that when they were once at <hi>Honſlardike,</hi> there was a Partridge ſhot, which being taken up by the King, made a ſudden eſcape out of his Hands, and was loſt in the Air. There were not wanting ſome that took it for a very bad Omen; but other, leſs ſuperſtitious, and more wiſe, ſaid, That if it was an Omen at all, it was certainly a very good one, and a lively Inſtance of the Happineſs of thoſe that fell into His Majeſty's Hands.</p>
            <p>In fine, the Sixth Day of <hi>March</hi> did arrive, that ſet a period to one of the greateſt Aſſemblies the World ever ſaw. His Majeſty, accompanied by their High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the Dukes of <hi>Zell,</hi> and <hi>Wolfembuttel,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:61502:37"/>
parted from the <hi>Hague</hi> that Day, about Eight a Clock in the Morning, in order to go to <hi>Loo;</hi> and his Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who was ſome few Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gone to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> was to meet them on their way. The King was no ſooner gone, but every body did prepare for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. There was every moment ſeen ſome parting Coach, or other, with Six Horſes, thundering through the Streets; and the mournful <hi>Hague</hi> ſeemed to be threatned to be turned into a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid, His Majeſty did intend to ſtay but Four or Five Days at <hi>Loo,</hi> and then ſtrait to return into <hi>England.</hi> I could eaſily imagine, that by reaſon of His Majeſty's great and numerous Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it would be very difficult for me to get a paſſage in the Fleet that was to conduct him over; and being inform'd, that the <hi>Katherine</hi> and <hi>Soudike</hi> Yacht lay at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> waiting for my Lord <hi>Dorſet</hi> and my Lord <hi>Monmouth,</hi> I parted from the <hi>Hague, March</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> at Night.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:61502:37"/>
               <hi>March</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> hearing that their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips were arrived, I went to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Soudike</hi> Yacht, belonging to my Lord <hi>Monmouth,</hi> deſiring him to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with his Lordſhip for my paſſage, which, upon the firſt word, was freely and generouſly granted. My Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come on Board about Two a Clock in the Afternoon, we fell down the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and paſſing by the <hi>Katherine</hi> Yacht, ſhe ſaluted his Lordſhip with all her Guns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> the <hi>9th,</hi> we had the unwelcome News, that the <hi>Gorcum,</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man of War, that was deſign'd for our Convoy, could not be ready in leſs than Six or Seven Days time. We had a very clear Sky, the Wind was fair, and fairer, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, than ſome of our Waiters wiſhes; for whatever they were, ſome of the Seamen of the Dutch Man of War were hang'd the next Day, for having revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt their Captain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brill</hi> is not a Town that can pretend to divert impatient Travellers: Every body was thinking of means to get out of that ſolitary Place; and my Lord <hi>Monmouth,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:61502:38"/>
whom all the World knows to be very Active, and of a Temper to deſpiſe all Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, had a good mind to venture over without a Convoy: At laſt he found a way to oblige two <hi>French</hi> Privateers (the only name we ought to have been afraid of) to ſecure our Paſſage. To ſpeak plain, there were two <hi>French</hi> Privateers, of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Guns each, riding in the <hi>Maeſe,</hi> that had been taken by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and being turned into Merchant men, and man'd with <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, they were ready to ſet ſail for <hi>Port-a-port;</hi> by the help of a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Guinea's they were prevailed with to accompany us to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt: And my Lord <hi>Dorſet</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at the <hi>Brill</hi> in the <hi>Katherine-Yacht,</hi> and approv'd of our Deſign, we ſet ſail about four a Clock in the Afternoon. We were in all ſix Sail, two Yachts, two Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers, and two Merchant-men, and the <hi>Katherine</hi>-Yacth being the ſtout Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of our little Fleet, we had theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Orders ſent us from on Board of her.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we weigh Anchor in the Day-time, then we will hoiſt up our Top-ſail and fire a Gun; if in the Night, we will
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61502:38"/>
hang out a Light in the Shrowds and fire a Gun.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He that ſpies any Sail at Sea more than his own Company or Squadron, ſhall hoiſt and lower his Enſign as often as he ſhall ſee Ships; if in the Night, then to make falſe Fires until he be anſwer'd with the like.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In caſe of thick and foggy Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we will every quarter of an Hour tinckle our Bell, or fire a Gun now and then; which muſt be anſwer'd with the like, by every Veſſel, with a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If any loſe Company, and meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the Day-time, he that is to the Windward ſhall hall up his Main-Sail, and keep it in the Brayls, until ſuch time as he that is to Leeward ſhall come up with him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If any make Land in the Day-time, he muſt hoiſt up his Enſign, and keep it out until he be anſwered.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61502:39"/>
6. If any ſpy Land or any Danger in the Night, he is to hang out two Lights more than he had before, and fire one Gun, and bear away, or tack from it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If we make Sail in the Night, we will hang out a Light at the Enſign-Staff; if ſhorten Sail in the Night, then we will fire one Gun without altering our Lights.</p>
            <p>We cou'd not get that Night out of the River, the Wind being very low, and the Tide ſpent, and we were forced to come to an Anchor about ſeven a Clock at Night, five or ſix Miles beyond the <hi>Brill,</hi> where we continued for two Days and two Nights together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> We weigh'd Anchors early in the Morning, making uſe of a freſh Gale that blew North-eaſt, inſomuch that having advanced that Day and the following Night, we came the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within two Leagues of <hi>Marget.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> The Sea was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calm, yet the <hi>Katherine-Yacht</hi> making uſe of her Oars, and we ſtriving to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61502:39"/>
her, we came at laſt ſo neat the Shoar, that my Lord <hi>Dorſet</hi> and <hi>Monmouth,</hi> with their Company, thought fit to land in their Barges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> the <hi>14th.</hi> A thick Fog hindred us to gain the River; but towards Night we weigh'd Anchor; and having weigh'd and caſt them out again for ſeveral times, acording as the Tides ſerv'd, it being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means by which we advanc'd, we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd <hi>March</hi> the <hi>16th.</hi> at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and from thence we went to <hi>London.</hi>
