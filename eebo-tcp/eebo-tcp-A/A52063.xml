            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Booke which we here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to answer, is so full fraught
with bitter invectives, false asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
hyperbolicall confidence,
selfe contradictions, and such like
extravagancies, as that we have
thought fit to lay them all before thee in one full
view by way of preface, rather then to interrupt
our following discourse by observing them as they
lie scattered in the booke it selfe. Suffer us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to give thee notice of these few particulars.</p>
            <p>First, wee are deepely charged and accused not
onely to the ordinarie Reader but even to the Kings
Majestie himself, of <hi>misallegations, misinterpretations,
mistranslations, and false quotations,</hi> and that in such
an high nature as that the Authour <hi>calles God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
before whom he is shortly to give an account that
hee never saw any Author that would dare to professe



<pb facs="tcp:33475:4"/>
Christian sincerity so fowle to overlash.</hi> And this is not
once or twice but often repeated with great asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
&amp; exclamations. Which when we first reade
(being conscious of our innocency and fidelity) we
could not but stand amazed and wonder to see our
selves so unexpectedly and wee hope undeservedly
transformed into men (or rather monsters of men)
so transcedently perfidious, and so supersuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
unfaithfull and wicked. And indeede, if to be
accused to a fault bee a sufficient argument to make
us guilty, wee must needes bee for ever branded
with such an high measure of ignominy, as that it
is not a whole sea of water that will serve to wash
off the filth of such accusations. But wee doubt
not but that the ingenuous peruser of this booke
will finde that as it was the glory of one of the
<hi>Cato's</hi> that hee was thirty times accused and yet
never sound guiltie: so it will be our honour and
credit when hee shall see that all this clamour and
noyse is but a bearing of false witnesse against his
brethren. <hi>Si accusasse sat est quis erit innocens.</hi> It
was the the wicked counsell of <hi>Matchiavell Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniare
fortiter &amp; aliquid adhoerebit.</hi> This counsell
the Papists have made use of in answering of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
writers, and the Bishops themselves in
their answers to some of the unconforming Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
bookes. And we have good reason to thinke
that the Authour of this <hi>Defence</hi> hath trod in the
same steps. For after all his generall exclamations
and accusations, there are but foure places in which
hee undertakes to prove us false. The first is for
halfe citing of <hi>Hieroms testimonie.</hi> The second



<pb facs="tcp:33475:4"/>
is for <hi>abusing Nazianzene.</hi> The third is for <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreting
Origen about Lay Elders.</hi> The fourth
is for <hi>foysting in Cyprian.</hi> True it is, hee tells
us of <hi>want of fidelity in citing the Counsell of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi>
and <hi>Ancyra,</hi> of misalledging of <hi>Whitakers,</hi> of
misenglishing <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and of guilty trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
of <hi>Iustin Martyr.</hi> But hee doth not so
much as endeavour to make good what he tells
us, and therefore we cannot but beleeve that hee
used more <hi>Machiavelisme</hi> then honestly in such
aspersions. As for Authors which hee himselfe
hath both misalledged and misinterpreted, wee
doe not onely say it, but the Reader shall finde
it demonstratively proved in the ensuring trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if to be railed upon, reviled, slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and scorned bee sufficient to bring men into
discredit, then certainely, we must be esteemed
as <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>men that make no conscience by what
meanes wee uphold a side and winne a Proselyte.</hi>
These are the flowers with which his defence is
garnished, and the titles with which he honours
those whom hee calles his Brethren. Wee
will make no other Apologie for our selves,
but what <hi>Austin</hi> did in the same kind, who
when hee was told that his railing adversarie
was to hard for him, hee said it was and easie
thing that way to conquer <hi>Austin,</hi> but the
Reader should perceive it was <hi>Clamore</hi> not
<hi>veritate,</hi> by loud crying not by truth: And
what <hi>Hierom</hi> saith against <hi>Helvidius, Arbitror
te veritate convictum a maledicta converti.</hi>
It is a signe of a man not able to stand before
the truth, when hee betakes himselfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull
language.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if multitude of <hi>daring protestations</hi>
and bold <hi>asseverations</hi> be sufficient proofes of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments



<pb facs="tcp:33475:5"/>
propounded, and if <hi>confident slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
and <hi>scornefull denyalls</hi> bee sufficient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to us, and our arguments, never any man
hath better defended Episcopacie or more
strongly confuted those that oppose it. In
his very first page hee begges the question,
and affirmes his cause to bee <hi>Gods cause, Gods
truth,</hi> and <hi>if his opposers were as many Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as men, hee would meet them undismayed,
and say with holy David; Though an host should
encampe against mee, my heart should not feare,
but with just confidence I gladly fly to the barre
of this high and Honorable Court,</hi> (And yet by
his leave hee thought it his best wisdome to
fly from this barre, and to dedicate his book
to the Kings Majestie alone, and not to the
two houses:) And in another place hee saith,
<hi>the Apostles practise is so irrefragable for them, that
if wee doe but adde the unquestionable practise
of their immediate successors: hee knowes not
what more light can bee desired for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of the truth of his opinion.</hi> In his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to the King hee saith, <hi>That if hee doth
not make it appeare that wee have abused our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with false shewes of misalleadged antiquities,
and meerely colourable pretences of proofes, let the
blemish of his reputation leade way to the shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
censure upon his person.</hi> (Iust like the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of <hi>Episcopacie by Divine right,</hi> who is
so confident against Lay Elders; That hee
offers to forfeit his life to justice, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to shame, if any man living can shew



<pb facs="tcp:33475:6"/>
that ever there was a Ruling Elder in the world
till <hi>Farel</hi> and <hi>Viret</hi> first created them: (And
yet hee could not but know that Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Whitgift</hi> (as well seene in Antiquitie as
himselfe) confesseth that there were Ruling
Elders in the Primitive Church. Thus also
doth Bishop <hi>King; Saravia</hi> himselfe thinkes
the governement of Ruling Elders to be good
and profitable.) In his answer to our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
sometimes hee tells us that <hi>wee prove
nothing but our bold ignorance and absurd incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences:</hi>
Otherwhile hee saith, <hi>Poore ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
scarce worthy of a passe. These are tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
cavills not worth the answer. Verball ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
which will sinke like light froath. Meere
declamations worthie of no answer but contempt and
scorne. forbeare Reader, if you can to smile at
this curious subtilty: What Cabalisme have wee
here? Our quaeries are made up of nothing but
spight and slander.</hi> His ordinarie answer toour
Testimonies out of Antiquity is: <hi>This Authour
is misalledged. That Father abused. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
shuffled up with little fidelitie. Away with your
unproving illustrations and unregardable testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi>
And this is all the answer hee gives.
Throughout the whole booke he endeavours
to render us to the Reader as destitute of all
learning, as if our reading had never gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
a <hi>Polyanthea.</hi> Hee calles us <hi>boldly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi>
And <hi>that wee would make the Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that wee had seene a Father.</hi> And <hi>that we
would seeme to have seene the Canon Law.</hi> And



<pb facs="tcp:33475:6"/>
               <hi>that it is enough wee can shew a little reading to
no purpose.</hi> But in all these and many more
such like Sarcasmes and vaine Rhetoricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
hee doth but act the part of his Hierarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
predecessors whose chiefe answers have
beene scoffes and scornes; and therefore
what learned <hi>Rivetus</hi> saith of Bishop <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi>
may with as much truth bee averred of
this namelesse Author. <hi>Montacutius vir certe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctus,

But what strength and weight there is
in such kinde of arguments and answers, let
the wise Reader judge.</p>
            <p>And yet not withstanding all this confidence &amp;
Thrasonicall boasting we desire thee to observe:</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That if the whole booke
were divided into foure parts, there is one
quarter of which he makes no mention, but
passeth it over either with scorne or silence.
And where our arguments are strongest there
hee slides away without answering, which
cannot but make the judicious Reader beleeve
that <hi>hee thought the yron to hot for him, and
therefore would not touch it least it should burne
his owne fingers;</hi> as himselfe saith <hi>pag.</hi> 21.
And even in those things wherein hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to answere us we cannot but give notice
that wee have <hi>confitentem reum,</hi> and in effect
the cause granted in those things which are



<pb facs="tcp:33475:7"/>
most materiall. For when wee prove from
Scripture the Identity of Bishops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
both in name and office, he tells us with
a little varying of our words; <hi>Wee idly
loose our labour. It neede bee no scruple to us:
It is in expresse termes granted,</hi> when we prove
that there are not three degrees of Ministery
in the Scripture (to wit, Bishops, Presbyters,
and Deacous) hee answers, <hi>it is granted; you
speake of the Apostles writings, but I of their
successors.</hi> Hee granteth also <hi>that the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Bishops were elected by the Clergie, and
people. That Bishops ought not to have sole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in Ordination, and Iurisdiction. That they
ought not to delegate their power to others. That
the ordinary managing of secular imployments is
improper for them.</hi> And hee doth almost grant
that there were Lay-Elders in antiquity. For
whereas the Author of Episcopacy by Divine
right affirmeth, that the name of Elders of
the Church in all antiquity comprehendeth
none but Preachers, and that therefore they
onely may bee called <hi>Seniores Ecclesiae,</hi> though
some others may have the title of <hi>Seniores
populi,</hi> because of their civill authority. This
Author acknowledgeth that besides Pastors,
and besides the Magistrates and Elders of the
City there are to bee found in antiquity <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niores
Ecclesiastici.</hi> Indeede hee saith, that these
were but as our <hi>Churchwardens,</hi> or <hi>Vestry men.</hi>
But how true this is, the Reader shall see in
due place: Lastly, hee grants that <hi>all that wee



<pb facs="tcp:33475:7"/>
say in the Postscripts about the Popish Prelates is true,
Celari non potuit negari non debuit.</hi> And for what we
say of the Protestant Bishops he denies not the
truth of it only he chides for taxing all for the fault
of some.</p>
            <p>And in these things wherein hee doth diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
oppose us, hee doth frequently contradict
himselfe and his best friends. In his Epistle dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
hee professeth that he <hi>taxeth not our ability,</hi> yet
in the same Epistle hee calles us <hi>impotent assailants,</hi>
and afterwards. <hi>Men of weake judgements and strong
malice.</hi> And <hi>Men that would seeme to have seene a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
And that <hi>all that we say is nothing but bold ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.
Pag.</hi> 94. he saith, <hi>That to acknowledge an
Ordinary Evangelist is a phancy and a dreame.</hi> And
yet elsewhere <hi>he makes every Preacher of the Gospell
to be an Evangelist.</hi> In his Remonstrant and in his
defence he saith, that <hi>Bishops had beene every where
throughout all the Regions of the Christian world. And
that all Churches throughout the whole Christian world
have uniformely and constantly maintained Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
And yet elsewhere he denies that ever hee said,
<hi>That Bishops were every where,</hi> and confesseth <hi>that
there are lesse noble Churches that doe not conferre to
Episcopall Governement. Pag.</hi> 161. hee tells us, that
<hi>for 1600 yeares the name of Bishops hath bin appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
(in a plain contradistinction) to the governors of
the Church:</hi> But in other places he often grants that
the <hi>Name</hi> was confounded, and ascribed to <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
are well as <hi>Bishops.</hi> In his 36. <hi>pag.</hi> he saith, <hi>That
in his Remonstrance hee made no mention of Diocesan
Bishops,</hi> whereas all know that he undertooke the
defence of such Bishops which were petitioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst



<pb facs="tcp:33475:8"/>
in Parliament, whom none will deny to bee
Diocesan Bishops. In his 5. <hi>pag.</hi> (speaking of the
changing of Civill governement mentioned in the
Remonstrance) <hi>he professeth that he did not aime at our
Civill Governement.</hi> Let but the Reader survey the
words of the Remonstance <hi>pag.</hi> 8. and it will appeare
plainely <hi>ac si solaribus radijs descriptum esset.</hi> That
the comparison was purposely made betwixt the
attempts of them that would have altered our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
governement, and those that indeavored the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of our Church governement. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he bids as <hi>pag. 135. to take our soleordination and
sole jurisdiction to sole our next paire of shoes withall,</hi>
yet notwitstanding hee makes it his great worke to
answer all our arguments against the sole power of
Bishops, and when all is done, allowes the Presbyter
onely <hi>an assistance,</hi> but <hi>no power</hi> in Ordination nor
jurisdiction. Lastly, in the stating of the question
he distinguisheth <hi>betweene divine and Apostolicall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
and denyeth that Bishops are of Divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
as ordained immediately by Christ. And yet
he saith, <hi>That Christ himselfe hath laid the ground of
this imparitie in his first agents. And that by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Timothy and Titus, and the Asian Angels (to
whom Christ himselfe wrote) he hath made good that
just claime of the sacred Hierarchy.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>We hope our Remonstrant hath now recovered his
<hi>stumble,</hi> and next we find him leaping, being as good
at leaping over blocks, as hee is at stumbling at
straws: it is his practice through his whole booke,
what ever objection made by us, he finds too heavy
to remove, he over-leaps it.</p>
               <p>This course hee begins here, for wee having char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him with some words sounding to contempt in
his <hi>Preface,</hi> he falls a quarrellling with our <hi>Logick,</hi> for
calling that a <hi>Preface, which hee intended as one of the

if <hi>Captatio Benevolentiae</hi> be the work of a Preface,
he that reads the <hi>Remonstrance</hi> to the ninth page, will

leap over. Counting all to the fourth page, <hi>as light

the alteration of <hi>Monarchicall</hi> Government, they had

Government, which he calls sacred, naturally tends
not onely not to depend upon, but to subdue the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
authority to it selfe; His answer is, first, That
<hi>William Rufus</hi> was a Prince noted for <hi>grosly irreligious.
That those were tyrannicall Popish Bishops.</hi> That the <hi>Pope
was Antichrist.</hi> That he <hi>answered so because hee was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
they should shew as good cards for their standing as hee
pretended for his own.</hi> And lastly, <hi>all this makes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our Bishops, who professe, notwithstanding the divine
right of their calling, to hold their places, and the exercise of
their jurisdiction wholly from the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then here is no Falsification: all that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
is granted true, onely exception taken against
the persons produced. King <hi>William</hi> hee was <hi>irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.
Daniel</hi> observes that former times being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
in their compilers of History (the Scepter
which rules over the fames of Princes) who for the
most part were Monks, had all their Princes perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
either Religious or irreligious as they humou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or offended the <hi>Bishops Rochet,</hi> and the <hi>Monks

               <p>But then those Bishops were Popish, Tyrannous
Bishops. But it was not their Popery, but their Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
dignity that made them tyrannize; and it was
their Tyranny and not their Popery that made them
odious to their King, who was Popish as well as
they. And it hath beene ever usuall to both former
and latter Bishops to tyrannize over such as feare
them, and to flatter such as they feare.</p>

The Pope hee is <hi>Antichrist;</hi> wee are glad to heare
you call him so; some thought a yeere agoe you
would scarce have given him such a nickname, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
you meant to have falne out with the rest of
your brethren: and what if the Pope be Antichrist?
may wee not bring the testimony of Antichrist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Antichristian Bishops? As <hi>Paul</hi> brought the
witnesse of a <hi>Cretian Poet,</hi> against <hi>Cretian</hi> Liers. May
not we alleage <hi>Beelzebub</hi> against <hi>Beliall</hi> without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
him?</p>
               <p>But the Pope so answered because <hi>he was unwilling
they should shew as good cards for their standing as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
for his own;</hi> grant it so, what will follow upon
that but this? That Bishops clayming the same
grounds for their standing that the Pope doth, aspire
to be as independant from Princes as the Pope is,
and that they have no more Divine Right, then the
Pope: <hi>But whats this to our Bishops who professe,
notwithstanding their Divine Right, to hold their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and exercise of Iurisdiction wholly from the
King?</hi> Surely ours have begun to affect the same
Exemption from Secular power, to make large
and haughty strides towards an independant <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie.</hi>
So that it is no <hi>envious upbraid</hi> to paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell
ours with the former <hi>Bishops.</hi> For it hath well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
that the <hi>Hierarchicall Episcopacie</hi> is full of such
high and large principles of Pride, Ambition, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
as can be circumscribed in no moderate
bounds: But is always swelling to the affectation of
an Absolute Ecclesiasticall Monarchie. And it is
worth the enquiring, whether the three last books of
<hi>Hookers Ecclesiasticall Politie</hi> be not suppressed by him



<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33475:13"/>
that hath them, because they give the Prince too
much power in Ecclesiasticall matters, and are not
for the Divine Right of Bishops.</p>
               <p>But we shall be chid anon, and accused of <hi>spight</hi>
for this, as wee are for the observation formerly
made upon his comparison between the attempts of
Alteration in our Neighbour Church by the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
faction, and that which is now justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
by the humble Petitioners to this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
House. This saith the Remonstrant, <hi>is a foule
slander to charge the name of Episcopacie</hi> with a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
For a fact imputed to some few.</hi> Were they but
a few that did attempt and <hi>prosecute</hi> that <hi>alteration?</hi>
the more is our misery, that a few Bishops can put
both Kingdomes into so dangerous a combustion,
what stirre would they all make if they should unite
their powers? And were they but a few that were
the Factors for that Attempt? how then was it that
one of the Episcopall Tribe in publike Court called
the <hi>Scotch</hi> designe <hi>Bellum Episcopale?</hi> and where were
the rest of the peaceable Orthodox Bishops the
while? that might in love to peace &amp; truth have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
those bold attempts, &amp; not have suffered a <hi>few,</hi>
upon whom you now leave the guilt of faction, to

               <p>WEE are in this and the following Sections
not to contend for words, but things, things
precious to the Remonstrant, <hi>Liturgie,</hi> and <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The subject of this Section is the Liturgie, where
first he fals upon us for the <hi>Alterations,</hi> and <hi>Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
mentioned by us, which hee calls such an <hi>envious
and groundlesse suggestion as must needs cover our faces
with a blush.</hi> Truly, Sir, If we were able to produce
no fuller evidence of this then you have done of
your <hi>Iewish</hi> Liturgie ever since <hi>Mosestime,</hi> we should
blush indeed; but if wee can bring forth instances of
such Alterations as shall prove this present Liturgie
to be none of that, which hath beene confirmed by
<hi>Parliamentary Acts;</hi> keep your <hi>blushes</hi> to make Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for yourself and friends.</p>
               <p>The Liturgie confirmed by our Parliamentary
Acts is the same which was made and confirmed in
the fifth and sixth of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, with <hi>one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
and additions of certaine Lessons to be used upon
every Sunday; and the forme of the Letany altered and



<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33475:14"/>
amended, and two sentences onely added</hi> in the delivery of
the Sacrament: <hi>And none other or otherwise.</hi> But this
booke is so altered from that, that in it is left out,</p>
               <p>First a clause in the Letany, <hi>From the tyranny of the
Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and all his detestable enormities, good
Lord deliver us, &amp;c.</hi> 32. Chapters of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
a Prayer against death, a Rubrick, or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the manner of the presence of Christs
body and bloud in the Sacrament. Besides some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things of lesse moment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, added 26 Apocryphall Chapters, more
to be read 47 Proper Lessons, The Prayers for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Curats, many Collects after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
A Rubrick in the examination of private
Baptisme. In the Calendar Fish dayes are now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Fasting days. A Catalogue of Holidays.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, many things changed; in the title of
Confirmation, the words for imposition of hands
are added. In the Epistle for Palm-sunday, in the
Name of Jesus, turned into, at the Name of Jesus,
besides such <hi>smaller alterations,</hi> which himselfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges.
These are sufficient to evince that the
Liturgie now in use is not that Liturgie that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
by Act of Parliament, and therefore that
Act binds not to the use of this Liturgie, as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
Now if to these we should adde the late al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
in the use of the Liturgie, Bringing in loud
Musique, uncouth and unedifying Anthems, a
pompous, superstitious Altar-service, wee thinke
any indifferent eye will say this is not the Liturgie
established by Parliament: wee hope that these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
are so visible, as any, that will not fully



<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33475:14"/>
shut their eys, will say it is with this misaltered Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
as with the disguised Dames mentioned of
old by Doctor <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we hope, nay we know wee have some Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of our minde in this, as well as you have some
of yours; &amp; how ever you slight the words of one of
them, not inferiour to any of them that wee know,
with an <hi>effut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it labiis:</hi> yet it is a subtile shift you have
to pervert the Bishops words. For whereas hee said
that the <hi>Service of the Church of</hi> England <hi>was now so
drest, that if the Pope should come and see it, he would claim
it as his own, but that it is in English,</hi> The Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant
would seeme to understand by this onely such
<hi>an inoffensivenesse, in the devotion of it, as the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
could find no fault in it:</hi> whereas the Bishop meant
such a symmetry and correspondency of our present
devotion and service with the Popish, as was in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
just matter of Humiliation to al the Bishops in
the Kingdom, in a day of solemn &amp; national Fasting.</p>
               <p>Instead of bringing out those great applauses, that
forreigne Divines and Churches have given to our
Liturgie, hee falls (though more gently then hee is
wont) upon Master <hi>Calvin</hi> for his <hi>Tolerabiles ineptiae,</hi>
as if that hee did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It seemes the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant
did not either consider the occasion of
that Censure, or else his <hi>not Omniscient eyes</hi> never saw
the Epistle that the Learned <hi>Calvin</hi> wrote to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> which would tell him that the
occasion of this Censure was the troubles raised up
among the English Exiles then at <hi>Frankford,</hi> about
the booke of Liturgie (which was then as since a
spring of unhappy contentions in the Church) here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon



<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33475:15"/>
he writes a Letter to them, wherein hee useth
that phrase of <hi>tolerable fooleries:</hi> and in a Christian
way perswades both disagreeing sides to accord:
which he puts not upon them by way of authority,
but Christian advise: nay, he says more, that these
fooleries were tolerable then, yet he doubted not if
Religion flourished in <hi>England,</hi> many of these would
be removed, and other things amended: and though
they might begin with such weak rudiments, yet it
was behovefull for the grave and pious Ministers of
Christ to rise to a higher pitch, &amp;c. So that here
Master <hi>Calvin</hi> did not unwarrantably intrude <hi>in alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam
rempublicam:</hi> Nor did any other then would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
any of our grave and learned Divines, in the
case of the <hi>Wafers, or Lords Day Markets</hi> of his
Charge, if called unto that service, as Master <hi>Calvin</hi>
was to this.</p>
               <p>The Remonstrant leads us from the <hi>English Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi>
to a Discourse of Liturgies in generall: which
wee call <hi>unparalleld,</hi> because no man that ever wee
have seene drew the line of Liturgie so high as hee
hath done, even as high as <hi>Moses</hi> time; to which his
answer is, <hi>Perhaps there are some things our not omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient
eyes have not seene, and perhaps this may be one of
them:</hi> and perhaps there are some things which hee
hath confidently avouched that his <hi>Lincean eys</hi> have
not seen, and perhaps this is one of them; or else we
should see it too. But that needs not saith the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant
for <hi>wee almost yield the question before
wee argue it:</hi> the happier man hee to obain that
by concession that hee never could by argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but how doe wee <hi>yield the question?</hi> in

                  <hi>granting an order of divine administrations observed in
Church Assemblies, but denying an imposition of set forms.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iust. Mart. Apolog 2.</note>
We find in antiquity, that when the Church met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
upon the Lords day, first the Scriptures were
read of the old and new Testament, after the reading
followed an Exhortation to the practice and imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of what was read, then they all rose and joyned
in Prayer: Prayer being ended, they went to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
in the beginning whereof the President of
the Assembly powred out Prayers and Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
according to his ability, and the people said
<hi>Amen;</hi> then followed the distribution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:
After that the collection of Almes, &amp;c.
this was <hi>Iustine Martyrs</hi> Liturgie. Will you now see
<hi>Tertullians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, the Congregation meets,<note place="margin">Tertull. Apol. cap. 39.</note> and doe as it were
besiege God with their prayers, wherein they pray
for the Emperors, for their serva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, officers, &amp;c? then
they went to repeating the Scriptures according to
the time and occasion, then they edified themselves
in faith and hope by holy exhortations. There they
had also the exercise of Discipline, there they had
their Love-feasts which began and ended with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and were celebrated with singing of Psalmes.
This was <hi>Tertullians</hi> Liturgie. From these two Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the purest times, it is evident that it was the
custome or order of the Church in their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
to pray, read, and expound the Scriptures, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
the Sacraments; but that there were set
formes of Prayer prescribed and imposed upon
the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that they were tyed to read such and such
Scriptures, that the <gap reason="foreign">

put into his mouth, that hee must use without
adding, or altering, or diminishing, all which are in
a stinted Liturgy, this doth not appear, but rather the
contrary, <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>Coimus ad sacrarum litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
commemorationem si quid praesentium temporum qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas
aut praemonere cogit aut recognoscere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now we hope our Remonstrant wil see how
we will avoid our own contradiction. To say there
was an order of administrations although there were
no set and prescribed formes is no contradiction:
You see it in the Churches practice. To say
there was an order of prophecying given to the
Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> by the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note> and yet no
stinted forms of prophecying imposed upon them,
wee hope the Remonstrant himselfe will say is not
contradictory.</p>
               <p>But these quotations are blasted already; <hi>it is but
a silly ostentation of antiquity, that these men bring against
the Liturgie;</hi> so is all wee bring if the Remonstrant
may be judge: but wee appeale to the learned Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And what can our Remonstrant accuse us of:
First in our quotation of <hi>Tertullian, Wee mis-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33475:18"/>
invade the Church, by the testimony of a Councell that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Arrianisme.</hi> Hee that is so quicke to take others in
their self co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futations, doth as Clerklike confute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
in granting that the <hi>Laodicean Councell</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Neocesarian,</hi> and the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and yet so long
before <hi>Arrtanisme,</hi> as it seemes ridiculous to referre
from the one to the other: Now the <hi>Neocesarian
Councell</hi> was as <hi>Binius</hi> from <hi>Baronius</hi> computes in the
yeer 314, and the <hi>Nicene</hi> was 325, or according to
<hi>Eusebius,</hi> 320. And was the <hi>Arrian heresie</hi> just born at
the period of the <hi>Nicene Councell?</hi> if not, why may not
the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie invade the Church before the
time of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Councell, especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that the heresie of <hi>Arrius</hi> did trouble the Church
sometime before it borrowed <hi>Arrius</hi> his name; and
under his name, some yeers doubtles, before the <hi>Nicen</hi>
Councell. Yet our meaning was not, to affix the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
of set formes into the Church upon that
Councell; the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> if that he had pleased might
have conceived, that speaking of the bringing in such
formes, wee shew how it was done by degrees. And
first as a step, the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Councell did forbid mens
varying their prayers as they listed, and did enjoyn all
men to use the same prayers: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
This
<hi>Remonstrant</hi> saith, we said, <hi>was a forme of mans owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing.</hi>
No, we said of a mans own composing; and
how wil the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> disprove it from the words of
the Canon? To prove our assertion we brought the
words of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which our <hi>Remonstrant</hi>
derides as a grosse absurdity to explicate the Councel
of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> by that of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which is yet no more

was made for poore ignorant Priests that knew not

that when this Canon was made, there was

the liberty in prayer was such as did not tie him

               <p>Thirdly, that the occasion of this restriction was

               <p>Next to these Testimonies, as a strong inducement

this consideration, <hi>that the great admirers of, and

thought that if the Sun did this day behold them, the
<hi>Remonstrant</hi> whose eys are acquainted with those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
and rarities that wee cannot bee blest with the
sight of, would have brought them to publique view

the Publican and Pharise to make good what we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
because we know he cannot answere it.</p>
               <p>Three things hee speaks of, <hi>The Lords Prayer,</hi> the
<hi>Iewish Liturgies,</hi> and <hi>Christian Liturgies,</hi> for the <hi>Lords
Prayer</hi> hee saith <hi>nothing can bee more plain then that our
Saviour prescribed to his Disciples, besides the Rules, a direct
forme of Prayer,</hi> we grant indeed nothing can be more
plaine then that both our blessed Saviour and <hi>Iohn</hi>
taught their new Converts to pray, yet the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant
will have a hard task to prove from Scripture
that either <hi>Iohn</hi> or our Saviour gave to their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
publique <hi>Liturgies</hi> or that the Disciples were tied
to the use of this forme.</p>
               <p>But though his proofe fall short in the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi>
yet it is sure he saith, <hi>that Christ was pleased to make use
in the Celebration of his last and heavenly Banquet, both of the
fashions and words, which were usually in the Iewish Feasts,
as</hi> Cassander <hi>hath shewed in his Liturgica.</hi> Yet <hi>Cassander</hi>
who is his sure proof saith but this, <hi>observasse videtur</hi>
seemes to have observed. Secondly, the evidence
of all this comes from no better authour then <hi>Maymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>
who wrote not till above a 1000 yeers after
Christ. Thirdly, though it were granted that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
did <hi>pro arbitrio</hi> or <hi>ex occasione,</hi> use the fashion or
words usually in the Jewish feast, it doth not at all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that he did assume these words and fashions out

of <hi>Iewish Liturgies;</hi> an Arbitrary custome is one thing
a prescribed Liturgie is an other.</p>
               <p>Yet to prove such a Liturgie, that he might (as far
as he can) stand to his assertion, he brings something
out of <hi>Capellus,</hi> the <hi>Samaritan Chronicle,</hi> and <hi>Buxtorfius</hi>
his <hi>Synagoga Iudaica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We begin with what he brings out of a <hi>Samaritan</hi>
Chronicle, sometimes in the hands of the famously
learned <hi>Ioseph Scaliger,</hi> out of which hee tels us of an
imbezel'd book, wherein were contained the Songs
&amp; Prayers used before the Sacrifices: which although
we might let passe without danger to our cause, and
answer, that they were onely divine Hymnes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there was alwayes some thing of prayer; because
the Remonstrant himselfe in his second mentioning
of them names onely Songs: and were there any
thing for set prayers, it is like hee would have put
down some thing of them in the Authors own words,
as well as hee hath burthened his margent with some
thing which is nothing to the purpose.</p>
               <p>But we shall make bold (under correction) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine

Church, but every man prayed according to his ability.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that in <hi>Ezra</hi> his time eighteene short
forms of Prayers were composed for the scattered
<hi>Iews,</hi> which had lost the use of the holy language; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they thought it best to continue their Prayers
and Worship of God in that sacred tongue. Thirdly,
but not a word of any set forms which the Priests or
Levits were to use, but only to helpe the ignorant
<hi>Iews,</hi> to expresse themselves in prayer to God in
the holy language; at the time or houres of prayer,
<hi>Which the men of the great Synagogue had appointed: Peter</hi>
and <hi>Iohn</hi> went up together to the Temple at the houre
of prayer, being the ninth houre.</p>
               <p>Though we alleage not this of <hi>Maymonides,</hi> as a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to command beliefe, yet wee conceive it farre
more to be regarded then any <hi>Samaritan</hi> Chronicle.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee hath some scraps of <hi>Iewish</hi> Liturgies
out of <hi>Capellus,</hi> concerning which a short answer may
serve; first there is not one of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Liturgies now
extant, which was made before the <hi>Iews</hi> ceased to be
the Church of God: for besides the eighteene short
formes before mentioned, there were no other made
till <hi>Rabbi Gamaliel</hi> his time, who according to the
judgment of learned Criticks is that <hi>Gamaliel</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the <hi>Acts,</hi> (from whom <hi>Paul</hi> got such bitter
principles against Christian Religion.) But whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver



<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33475:21"/>
they began, <hi>Capellus</hi> would laugh, should he heare
what a strange conceit this Remonstrant had gotten
from him, that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Liturgies were as ancient as
the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> merely, because he parallels some
<hi>Iewish</hi> phrases which hee found in them with certaine
phrases in the Gospell, which the <hi>Iews</hi> retained by
Tradition from their Fathers, and put into their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies.<note place="margin">Synag. Iudaiea, lib. 1.</note>
But <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> would fal out with him, that he
should so much abuse him, as to say he had affirmed
that <hi>Maymonides</hi> took his Creed out of the Liturgie;
for the man is not guilty of any such grosse mistake:
he saith indeed, that the Articles of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Creed
are printed in the Liturgies, but withall hee tels the
Remonstrant, that <hi>Maymonides</hi> was the first compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
of them, whence therefore the <hi>Iews</hi> put them into
their Liturgie. Thus wee leave his <hi>Iewish</hi> Liturgie,
which the Reader will easily see to be more <hi>Iewish,</hi>
then hee could justly suppose our instance of <hi>William
Rufus</hi> was, and that it affords him as little furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>For Christian Liturgies, which the Remonstrant
had affirmed <hi>to have been the best improvement of the peace
and happinesse of the Evangelicall Church ever since the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
times,</hi> we challenged the Remonstrant, setting
aside those that are confessedly spurious, to produce
any Liturgie that was the issue of the first 300 yeers;
in answer to which, he brings us forth the Liturgies
which we have under the names of <hi>Iames, Basil,</hi> and
<hi>Chrysostome:</hi> to which our Reply may be the briefer,
because hee himselfe dares not vouch them for the
genuine writings of those holy men. <hi>Onely,</hi> saith hee,
<hi>we have them under their names:</hi> Secondly, he confesseth



<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33475:22"/>

We will not make digressive excursions into new

<hi>Suffrages of unquestionable Divines</hi> are not <hi>so unanimous,</hi>
but that from some of them wee could fetch sparks
to fling in the face of him that desired their suffrages,
without burning our-own fingers. Compare what the

<hi>as a charitahle and not too indulgent a profession,</hi> viz. <hi>That

King <hi>Edwards</hi> Proclamation, to which he answers
nothing, onely ownes that, and scornes us: thinking
to wipe off all exceptions with the glorious names of
Martyrs and Confessors that composed it. For whom
(though wee dare not glory in man) yet wee blesse
God as well as he. But with all if we should say there
were some holy Martyrs and Confessors of the same
reformed Religion that were Opposers of it, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, when the Parliament having

all which the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> brings under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity

so much with the Popish Masse, as that the Pope
would have approved it: which hee denyes not,
if he had, we could have proved it from a man above

saith, <hi>If the Devill confesse Christ to be the Son of God, shal

us it hath not prevailed to that end to which it was at

Elizabeth <hi>all came to Church, those times knew no recusant.</hi>
Pardon us Sir, If we tell you that it was not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
power of the Liturgie, but the constraining
power of the Law that brought them thither; which
afterwards not being pressed with that life and vigour
that it had bin, gave incourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the <hi>Popish</hi> fact o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
to take heart: adde also, that at the same time the Pope
negotiated to have her Liturgie to be allowed by his
authority, so as the Queene would acknowledge his
Supremacie, which when it grew hopelesse, then
the Jesuitish Casuists begun to draw on the Papists to



<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33475:25"/>
a Recusancie. But might the complying of our
Papists be attributed soly to the inoffensivenesse of
our <hi>Liturgie;</hi> Yet what credit is this to our Church to
have such a forme of publike worship, as Papists may
without offence joyne with us in, and yet their Popish
principles live in their hearts still? How shall that
reclayme an erring soule, that brings their bodies to
Church, &amp; leaves their hearts stil in error? And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> would impute the <hi>not winning of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
rather to the want or weaknesse in preaching;</hi> Be it so, in
the mean time, let the <hi>Bishops</hi> see how they will cleere
their souls of this sinne, who having the sole power of
admitting Ministers into the Church, have admitted
so many weak ones, and have rejected so many faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
able Preachers, for not conforming to their beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
rudiments. And when we said that this our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
hath lost us many rather then wonne any, Wee
meant not onely of such as are lost to the Popish part.
But let the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> take it so, it is neither paradox
nor slander. For let an acute Jesuite have but this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to weild against a Protestant not well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in our Religion (as too many such there are in
<hi>England</hi>) It is evident that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the

those blocks we mentioned) whose book, among all
that have travelled in that way, we think that any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lligent
Reader will judge most unable to give solid
satisfaction to a scrupling conscience. Tell us wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you, is it enough for a conscience that scruples
the Surplice, to say, <hi>That it is as lawfull for you to enjoyn
the Surplice, and punish the omitting of it, as it was for</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
<hi>to enjoin</hi> Shimei, <hi>not to goe out of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and
to punish him for the breach of that injunction?</hi> or, <hi>That
the Surplice is a significative of divine alacritie and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and the expectation of glory? Is it possible that a man that
reads this should stu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble at the Surplice</hi> after? <hi>The Cross is not
onely lawfull in the use of it, but the removall of it would be
scandalous and perillous to the State; Baptisme is necessary

judge whether this be to remove stumbling

But if this <hi>Remonstrant</hi> think Master <hi>Fisher</hi> so able and
happy a remover of those occasions of offence, wee
wonder how his quick sight could see cause of any
alteration, so much as in the manner of the expression,
knowing Master <hi>Fisher</hi> undertakes the defence not
onely of the <hi>Substance,</hi> but of the very <hi>Circumstances</hi>
and <hi>Syllables</hi> in the whole Book. But his last put off
is this, that if there be ought in it that may danger

                  <hi>Lord</hi> be praysed it is so: it is under carefull hands and

               <p>The fift Argument was from the great distaste it
meets with in many. This hee imputes to nothing but
their ill teaching, and betakes himselfe to his old
shifts of diversion, and saith, <hi>By the same reason, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of people distasting the truth of wholsome doctrine, shall
we to humour them abandon both?</hi>
               </p>

as tends to a separation; and it is as strange to us that
this <hi>Remonstrant</hi> should have a heart so void of pity as
that the yielding to the altering or removing of a
thing indifferent (which stands as a wall of separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt us and our brethren) should be presented
to publike view under no better notion then the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring
of a company of ill taught men,</hi> or as the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant</hi>
elsewhere calls them <hi>brainsick men,</hi> or as another
Booke, <hi>men that have need of dark roomes and Ellebore.</hi>
For that ill teaching to which hee imputes this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
distast, if there be any such, wee for our parts are
innocent; our care for our part hath beene to informe
our people, that such stumbling blocks as these are
not sufficient causes of Separation. But wee thinke,
nay, we know, that some few <hi>Prelats</hi> by their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigorous
pressing of the <hi>Service-book</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
have made more Separatists, than all the Preachers
disaffected to the Ceremonies in <hi>England.</hi> Our last rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was from the difference betweene this and all
other Churches. To which he answers, <hi>that difference
in Liturgies will breed no dis-union between Churches.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
if it be requisite to seeke conformity, <hi>our is
the more ancient Liturgie, and our the more noble Church:
Therefore fit for them to conforme to us rather then we to them.</hi>
It is true, every difference in <hi>Liturgies</hi> doth not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate
a dis-union of Churches: but here the difference
is too large to be covered with a few fig-leaves. It is
too well known, our Ceremonies and other things in
our Liturgies will not downe with other reformed
Churches: to the second, it is not the precedencie in
times that gains the Glory, but the exactnesse of the
work.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:33475:27"/>
Our first Reformation was onely in doctrine, theirs
in doctrine and discipline too. For the third, that <hi>ours
is the more noble Church.</hi> We desire not to ecclipse the
glory of this Church, but rather to intreat the Lord
to increase it a thousand fold, how great soever it be,
and to ennoble it in this particular, in removing what
ever is a stumbling block out of the way of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
But why saith the Remonstrant should we rather
conforme to the Liturgies of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
then those of all other <hi>Christians, Grecians, Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
Copths,</hi> &amp;c. should we set down what wee have
read in the Liturgies of those Churches, wee believe
the Remonstrant would blush for intimating, there is
as much reason to conform to their Liturgies as those
of the Reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>Our second quaere is not so weak as this Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant
supposeth; it is this, whether the first Reformers
of Religion did ever intend the use of a Liturgie, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to be a help in the want, and to the weaknes
of the Ministers? In way of Answer he asketh, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we can think that our Reformers had any other intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
then all other the founders of Liturgies.</hi> No, indeed,
wee thinke no other, and howsoever the <hi>Remonstrant</hi>
according to his confidence tels us that the least part
of their eare was the helpe of the Ministers weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
yet their words tell us it was the main drift of
those that first brought prescribed forms of prayer
into the Church (and therefore wee conceived
it might possibly be the intention of our Reformers
also) witnesse the 23 Canon of the fourth Councell
of <hi>Carthage, ut nemo patrem nominet profilio, &amp;c.</hi> So the

<hi>were to helpe the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it will be hard f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thousands who desire with devout hearts to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God, that the being constantly bound to the
same formes, though in themselves neither for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
nor composure subject to just exception, will prove
such a great help to their devotion. But this wee are
sure, that if <hi>the knowing before hand the matter and the
words wherewith it should be clothed make people the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon devotion,</hi> if this be an infallible argument, it
pleads against the use of present conception, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

either publike or private: and how contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
this is to what the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> hath professed of
his reverent and pious esteem of conceived prayer, let
himselfe see.</p>
               <p>It is neither <hi>boldly</hi> nor <hi>untruly</hi> said, that all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, though they use Liturgies, do not
bind Ministers to the use of them: If we may trust the

of <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Minister is to exhort the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to pray, <hi>quibus ei visum fuerit verbis,</hi> in what words
he shall think fit; and though that Liturgie containe
formes of prayer for publike use, yet we doe not finde
in all that Liturgie where they are tyed to the use of
those forms, and no other; we finde, where they are
left free, as in one place, <hi>in Dominico die mane haec ut plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimum
adhibetur formula,</hi> Upon the Lords Day in the
morning, for the most part this prayer is used; for the
most part, then not alwayes. So in another, after the
Lords Super,<note place="margin">Peracta coena haec gratiarum aut aliqua ei si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milis adhibetur.</note> this thanksgiving or some other like it is
used; then they are not absolutely tied to the use of
that: and by this wee have learned how to construe
what he hath quoted out of Master <hi>Calvine.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
any man that reads that Epistle may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue
what was Master <hi>Calvines</hi> judgement about
Liturgies, not that men should be so tied to words
and forms, as to have no liberty to recede from them.
For in the same Epistle hee doth advise to have a
summary collection of doctrine which all should
follow, and to the observing of which all, both Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Ministers should be bound by Oath; Yet
we hope the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> will not say that <hi>Calvine</hi> did
advise that Bishops and Ministers should be bound by
oath not to vary from that forme of doctrine? <hi>Calvine</hi>
advises a set form of Catechisme, will the <hi>Remonstrant</hi>
say that <hi>Calvine</hi> meant the Ministers should never va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
from the syllables of that forme, provided they
did dictate <hi>pro captu populi, in quibus situs sit verus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianismus?</hi>
The very words by himself quoted shew
what <hi>Calvins</hi> end was in advising a set <hi>Liturgie,</hi> viz. to
helpe the simplicity and unskilfulnesse of some, to



<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33475:29"/>
prevent the innovation of others, &amp; that the consort
of all Churches among themselves might more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
appeare, all which ends may be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
limiting all Ministers to the words and syllables
of a set forme, provided they pray to that effect.
Which is all that is required in the <hi>Liturgies</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Churches.</p>
               <p>Wee could name you many other <hi>Liturgies,</hi>
wherein there are not further bounds laid upon
the Minister then thus, <hi>Hae sunt formulae, quas tamen se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur
Minister pro suo arbitrio,</hi> These are forms which
the Minister follows according to his liking. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>Spiritus sanctus non est alligandus formulis,</hi> The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost is not to be tyed to forms. <hi>Minister concludit
Orationem, quam pro suo arbitrio dicit. Haec esto formula
nisi quid ille suâ sponie possit melius.</hi> The Minister con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the prayer, which hee sayes according to his

own accord hee can doe better. In another, <hi>Minister
ad precandum hisce aut similibus verbis invitat ad hunc mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
orat,</hi> in these or the like words.</p>
               <p>And by this, (we hope) the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> seeth that
what wee have said, was more truly then boldly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
As for the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, though we blesse
God for that truth, that is among them, for that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
instrument of their Reformation, yet we think
the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> will not say, that the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
came out so perfectly in the first Edition, but
that <hi>desiderantur nonnulla;</hi> nor can he be ignorant, that
in the ordinary phrase of writing, they are called the
Protestant Churches, the other the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
and what if the Reformed Churches be as the



<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33475:29"/>
Remonstrant calls them, out of his respect hee beares
them, but a poore handfull? yet is this handfull in
respect of purity, of truth, and worship among them, to
be preferred before all the Christian World besides.</p>
               <p>The Rubrick in the Liturgie of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth,
saith he, is misconstrued, <hi>Because it intends onely the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
ease and more willing addiction to hearing.</hi> Two of the
very ends for which wee desire a liberty; which if
some Ordinaries (upon his certain knowledge) have
often yielded, many now upon our certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
have denied it, and ordered Sermons should
rather be constantly cut short then any part of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
omitted, why should it be a fault in us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that as a favour from this Honourable House,
which the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> grants an ordinary may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence yield at his own discretion?</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Homilies we say are left free, reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Liturgie should: which argument he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
might hold force, did they utterly abridge all
Ministers of the publike use of any conceived prayers.
We know some men have endevoured sacrilegiously,
to rob all Ministers of the exercise of the gift of
prayer, on what occasion soever: And our argument
is as strong against limiting in prayer, as it is against li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
in preaching, either in whole or in part, and
he saith nothing against it, onely determines <hi>tanquam
è Cathedrâ, that it is no lesse sacrilege to rob the people of a

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssion, Then it is to rob
them of the Ministers gift of preaching or praying.</hi> But the
Remonstrant must prove that set forms and Liturgies
stinted and enjoyned, are not onely lawfull, but Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God, and not only warranted but comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

as well as preaching or praying, before he doe so
peremptorily conclude the taking of set formes away
by the liberty of a free expression to be sacrilege; and
his bold closure of this Answer, how true it is let him
look in what we have said before of the Liturgies of
other Churches.</p>
               <p n="4">4 His fourth Answer, <hi>That it is a false ground, that
the imposing of the book tyes godly men from exercising their
gift in prayer,</hi> would have been condemned for heresie
in some Consistories in <hi>England,</hi> within these few
yeeres, by such as did, from the imposition of the one,
forbid the other. Whether the liberty of prayer be
infringed wholly, by a set Liturgie, wee dispute
not. But it is beyond dispute, that the not binding to
a Liturgie would endanger the liberty of prayer lesse.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Our fift Reason was, because many deny their
presence at our Church-meeting, in regard of those
imposed prayers, and we finde no better way to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them from that distance in which they stand, then
by leaving the Liturgie free. The <hi>Remonstrant</hi> saith,
<hi>There is no reason of such alienation from our assemblies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such grounds.</hi> The reasonablenesse or unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of this we determine not; in the mean time wee
are sure thus it is. For our parts we professe, that wee
are not against a <hi>free use of a Liturgie,</hi> nor doe we count
a Liturgie a sufficient ground of separation from the
Church, we say with <hi>Augustine, Non putamus scinden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das

neque indigniores, coram Deo facere possunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet wee feare it is not the Remonstrants Dilemma
that will reduce such as upon this ground are upon

                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:33475:30"/>
(saith hee) <hi>is either good or evill, if evill it is
not lawfull to be used, if good it is not unlawfull to be

both, and tell him the Liturgie is neither good,
nor yet may lawfully be imposed if it were good, it
may be the Remonstram might have work enough to
perswade some men of either: and whether it be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
to satisfie the consciences of many thousands in
<hi>England,</hi> that are troubled about this, by argument
and disputing, or by loosing the bond of imposition,
and taking away the cause of dispute and trouble, or
to behold the confusion that will follow, if the Lord
do not in mercy direct to some means of prevention,
is not hard to determine.</p>

and to professe in the hearing of some of us,
that they would willingly part with that which was
indifferent to themselves, if they were but truly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
it was offensive to others. According to that of

Hierom, Ambrose, Augustine, Theod. Primasius, Sedulius,

that it is unlikely that <hi>Anselme</hi> should have beene Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized

long time by so many Popes for the golden fountain
of the Canon law, if they had taught that for sound
doctrine, which by the whole Church in her most
flourishing time was condemned for heresie, and
concludes that they who have laboured about the
Reformation of the Church, these five hundred
yeeres (of whom he names abundance) have taught
that all Pastors be they intitulated Bishops or Priests

his judgment concerning Episcopacie.</p>
               <p>There is one thing more belongs to this Section, as
to the proper seat, and that is the establishment which
he seeks to Episcopacie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the laws of the Kingdom,
to which we having answered, that Laws are repeala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the Parliament having a Nomotheticall power,
He answers <hi>though laws are repealable,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>yet fundamentall

that <hi>he speaks not against an impossibility, but an

               </p>
               <p>But consider, we beseech you, how fitly is Episcopal
Government made a piece of the fundamentall Laws
of the Kingdome? How did the Kingdome then
once stand without Bishops, as in the very page, you
had now to answer, you might have seen once it did?
For doth not the Marginall tell you from Sir <hi>Edward
Coke,</hi> or rather from an Act reported by him <hi>in the 23
yeere of</hi> Edward <hi>the first, that the holy Church was founded in
the state of Prelacie, within the Realme of</hi> England, <hi>by the



<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33475:38"/>
King and his progenitors,</hi> which <hi>your guiltinesse will needs
overlooke,</hi> for feare you should see that there was a
King of this Realme of <hi>England,</hi> before there was a
<hi>Prelacie.</hi> And how then is Episcopacie one of the
fundamentals of the Kingdome? And whereas you
say you spake onely against an easinesse of change,
read your words in the eighteenth page of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance,
<hi>A man would thinke it were plea enough to
challenge a reverend respect, and an immunitie from all
thoughts of alteration:</hi> is this to speake against an easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or rather against a possibility of change? For
your conclusion, <hi>that things indifferent or good, having by
continuance and generall approbation beene well rooted in
Church and State, may not upon light grounds be pulled up,</hi>
Good Sir, never trouble your selfe about such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
thing, as <hi>Episcopacie</hi> is. Never feare, but if
<hi>Episcopacie</hi> be rooted up, it will be done by such hands
as will not doe it upon light grounds.</p>

is derived from the Apostles, were no others then

               <p>Before wee come to the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> answer, wee
will minde the Reader of what the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> saith,
<hi>That we have a better faculty at gathering then at strewing:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 128.</note>
which if we have, we shall here make good use of our
faculty, in gathering the choice flowers which himself
hath scattered; yielding unto us the mayn Scripture
grounds whereby the Patrons of Episcopacie have
endevoured to uphold their cause. For himselfe
confesseth the Bishops cause to be bad, if it stand
not by divine Right, and compares the leaving
of divine right,<note place="margin">Pag. 125.</note> and <hi>supporting themselves by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
and munificence of religious Princes,</hi>

hath withdrawn himselfe, make flesh their arme.</hi> And
whether himselfe hath not surrendred up this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
right, judge by that which followeth. Our main
argument was, That Bishops and Presbyters in the
originall authority of Scripture were the same. Hee
answers in the name of himselfe and his Party,<note place="margin">Pag. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>This is
in expresse terms granted by us.</hi> We argue it further, That
we never find in Scripture any other orders of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
but Bishops and Deacons. He answers, <hi>Brethren,
you might have spared to tell mee that which I have told you
before,</hi> And adds, That when wee alleage <hi>the Apostles
writings,</hi> for the identity of Bishops and Presbyt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs,
<hi>we oppose not his assertion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag 47. 48.</note> because he speaks of <hi>the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of immediate succession to the Apostolike times, but



<pb n="62" facs="tcp:33475:39"/>
we of the writing of the Apostles.</hi> And for the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
arguments drawn from the identitie of the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of Bishops and Presbyters for their Office,
and Ordination to their office, hee answers <hi>Ne</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>quidem.</hi> And yet notwithstanding, that the Reader
may not perceive how the Remonstrant betrayes his
own cause, he deals like the fish <hi>Sepia,</hi> and casteth out
a great deal of black inke before the eyes of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that so hee may escape without observation.
But wee will trace him and finde him out, where hee
thinks himselfe most secure. For first, he falsly quotes
our answer. Whereas wee say, That in originall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
Bishops &amp; Presbyters are the same, he tels us,
we say, That <hi>Bishops and Presbyters went originally for the
same,</hi> That is, saith he, <hi>There was at first a plain indentity
in their denomination.</hi> Which two answers differ, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
quantum!</hi> And yet howsoever this very identity
of denomination in Scripture is of no small conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
what ever the Remonstrant makes of it.</p>
               <p>For the proper ends of Names being to distinguish
things, according to the difference of their natures,
and the supream wisdome of God being the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
of these names, who could neither be ignorant
of the nature of these offices, nor mistake the
proper end of the imposition of names, nor want
variety to expresse himselfe, the argument taken
from the constant identity of denomination, is not
so contemptible as the Remonstrant pretends. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
considering that all the texts brought to prove
the identity of names prove as intrinsecally, the
identity of Offices, which we did cleerly manifest, by
that text, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7. Where the Apostle requiring



<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33475:39"/>
Presbyters to be thus and thus qualified, renders the
reason, because Bishops must be so. Which argument
would no ways evince what the Apostle intended, if
there were onely an idenditie of names, and not also
of offices and qualifications When the names are the
same, and the Offices distinct, who but one that cares
not what hee affirmes, would infer the same offices
as a consequent from the identity of their names?
Who would say that the properties of the <hi>Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
called <hi>Canis</hi> ought to be the same with the bruit
creature so called, because they have both one name?
And this we desire the Reader to take the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, because the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> passeth it over in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Remonstrant seemes to recant that
which he had before granted, &amp;<note place="margin">Pag. 48.</note> 
                  <hi>tels us that though in the
Apostolike Epistles there be no nominal distinction of the titles,
yet here is a reall distinction and specification of the duties,
as we shall see in due place.</hi> But this place is in <hi>Vtopia,</hi> and
wee shall finde it <hi>paulò post finem,</hi> for wee finde it no
where in this book; but we hope in due place faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to performe the contrary to what hee hath delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
promised, and also to shew how these words of
his doe contradict what himselfe saith in other places
of his book.</p>
               <p>The testimonies brought out of antiquities, to shew
that the names of Bishops and Presbyters were used
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, hee calls <hi>trifling,</hi> and challengeth us to <hi>name
any one of his Writers that hath stood up in the cause of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy
that hath not granted and proclaimed this which we
contend for.</hi> Wee answer first, the better is our cause,
when our adversaries are forced to grant us thus
much.</p>

               <p>It is yet to be proved they were so: yet how ever,

the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. to this he answers nothing of

too from <hi>Calvine,</hi> who takes <hi>Presbyterium</hi> of
the office, not of the persons.<note place="margin">Pag. 51.</note> Wherein saith the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant
he follows the judgment of</hi> Hierome, Primasius,
Anselme, Haymo, Lyranus, Erasmus, and others, as
Bishop <hi>Downham</hi> hath shewed. Wee doe believe that
this is borrowed of Bishop <hi>Downham,</hi> for had he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
with those Authours, hee might easily have
seen how little they favour that exposition. For what
saith <hi>Hierome,</hi> whom <hi>Primasius</hi> follows in his very
words? <hi>Prophetiae gratiam habebat cum ordinatione Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copatus.</hi>
Doth this prove that <hi>Presbyterium</hi> is there the
name of the office? If so? You must grant <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi>
and <hi>Presbyterie</hi> to be the same office, which is the
verie question. But wee would faine know, why <hi>cum

rather of the office, then of the person: when,
(in proprietie of phrase) if they had meant it of the
office they would rather have said <hi>ordinatio ad Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patum,</hi>
then <hi>Episcopatus.</hi> For <hi>Anselme,</hi> what saith hee?
<hi>Impositionem manuum eam dicit, quae in ordinatione ejus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta

And that this Text must needs be understood of
the persons ordaining, and not of the office <hi>Timothy</hi>

               <p>For first, it cannot stand with the signification

               <p>We thought we had sufficiently proved this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
in our answer, by producing all the Texts

it is sufficient to prove that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies not the
office of <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> but the persons in that office. And
this also may answer that objection, which he makes
from the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. For though we grant indeed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Calvin</hi> was more skilled in the harmony <hi>then our

yet wee must crave leave herein to dissent from
Master <hi>Calvin,</hi> as well as <hi>Beza, Cameron, Chameir,</hi> and
others since him have done before us.</p>
               <p>And let not the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> call it <hi>boldnes</hi> in us, to say

in putting that upon us which we spake not: wee
say indeed, <hi>pag.</hi> 24. of our answer, it was in the hands
of Presbyters. The Remonstrant would have us say
Communicated to Presbyters, that wee might seeme
to acknowledge the power of Ordination to be origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in Bishops, and in Presbyters onely by derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from them, which we never meant; and if we ever
did use the word Communicated, it was onely to note
a Community in that power, not a derivation of it: as
for his authors which he alleages for sole Ordination,
let the Reader please to view our answer, <hi>pag.</hi> 37. 38.
wherein hee may receive full satisfaction, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because the Remonstrant passeth over it. The

               <p>Here the Remonstrant grants a processe of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the planting of the Church by the Apostles,
and the setling of Episcopacy in the Churches Shall
we say now this is the Remonstrants either errour or
fraud, not to set downe how long it was before Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy

for affirming that which himselfe cannot but give his
Suffrage to.</p>
               <p>The third thing agreed upon was, that this was not
<hi>nomen inane,</hi> an idle title, but attended upon with some
kind of imparity: the question was digested into these
tearmes. <hi>Whether the impropriation of the name, and the
imparity of the place and power of a Bishop be of divine
right?</hi> The Remonstrant for feare of mistaking, desires
to explicate the tearmes of the question, and therefore
tels, how fetching the pedegree of <hi>Episcopacy from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall
(and therefore in that right divine institution,)</hi>
he interprets himselfe to understand <hi>by divine right,
not any expresse Law of God,</hi>

Retorico definiente:</hi> the Remonstrant if he would
avoyd mistaking, or at least would not say that he was

punctually in the stateing of the Question.</p>
               <p>For first he tels us, that it is an <hi>institution of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
inspired by the Holy ghost:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Def. p. 56.</note> if the Remonstrant be not

grant us, that in <hi>originall authority of Scripture, Bishops

words, not as the Remonstrant reports them, <hi>went for
the same:</hi> and why againe, when we tell him we never
finde in Scripture these three orders, <hi>Bishops, Presbyters

he grant that in the same page, and flie from the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Apostles to the monuments of their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
successers? can we imagine that the Apostles did



<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33475:45"/>
by inspiration from the holy Ghost, ordaine any thing
in the Church of God as of perpetuall use; the record
where of is not found in sacred Scripture, which was
given by the same inspiration to the same men; if we
may imagine it, sure we cannot beleeve it. And if it be
an institution of the Apostles inspired by the holy
Ghost, why must it be distinguished from the expresse
law of God? doth he make it but an evangelicall
counsell; <hi>not requiring it as necessary to the being of a
Church;</hi> sure this is some opinion of a newer cut; for
the last defendant of Episcopacy before this Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant

                  <hi>The power of Ordination hath beene ever

So that in his judgement, where there is no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
there can be no lawfull ordination, let it be in
the case of extreamest necessity; and where no ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <p>And if <hi>not requiring it to the being of a Church,</hi> how
then? <hi>requiring it onely where it may be had:</hi> what a
strange limitation is this? where is it that Episcopacy
may not, must not be had, if it be an ordinance of
Christ? where is it that the Churches of Christ may
not have Word, Sacraments, Pastors and Bishops too,
if they be his ordinance? It is true indeed, some there
are that cannot have Lord Bishops, pompous Bishops,
and once a Canon provides that they should not be in

is the meaning of this, <hi>where it may be had?</hi> what doth
he meane, where it may be had with the favour of
the Prince? then the Primitive Church had never had
any. Or where it may be had with the willing subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

if the people will have it so. <hi>Where it may be
had;</hi> what? with quiet and conveniency? then you
make that which you call an ordinance of God sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to mans convenience. Or what? with possibility?
requiring that where Episcopacy may be had possibly,
it should? what's this lesse than a command? yet saith
the Remonstrant, here is no expresse law of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
it. Now we pray you review your worke, and
see how well you have stated the question.</p>
               <p>To prove that Episcopacy was not a divine, but a
humane institution; we produced out of antiquity
some places, that mention the occasion and authors of
Episcopall imparity, which are not (as the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant
absurdly) <hi>the onely countenance of our cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our first was, that knowne text of <hi>Hiereme</hi> in the 1.
<hi>Titus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 56.</note> out of which we collected five things, which the
Remonstrant summes up thus: <hi>First, that a Bishop and
a Presbyter are originally one. Secondly, that the imparity
was grounded upon Ecclesiasticall custome. That before this
priority, the Church was governed by the common Councell
of Presbyters, and that Bishops ought still so to governe. And
lastly, that the occasion of this imparity was the division,
which through the divels instinct fell among Christians:
this the Remonstrant cals the summe of our collection.</hi> But
if his Arithmeticke be no honester then thus, he shall



<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33475:46"/>
summe no summes for us; for he leaves out one Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
which is indeed principally considerable, <hi>That
this was not Hieromes owne opinion, but the opinion of the
scriptures.</hi> This would have stopt the mouth of his <hi>satis
imperitè.</hi> Wel what saies the Remonstrant?<note place="margin">Beliar. de Script. Eccles.</note> 
                  <hi>You look now
that I should tell you the booke is of uncertaine credit.</hi> No
indeed sir, we looked for no such matter; because we
know that booke is approved by men both of as great
learning and of as little affection to <hi>Hieromes</hi> opinion
as the Remonstrant is, though his lesser commentaries
on the epistles be questioned. <hi>Or else you look, that I should
tell you Hierome was a Presbyter, and not without some
touch of envy to that higher dignity which he missed.</hi> True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sir, this we looked for, and the rather because Doct.
<hi>Hall</hi> in his <hi>Episcopacy by Divine right, part 2. page</hi> 122.
saith, that as <hi>he was naturally a waspish, &amp; a hot good man,
so being now vexed with some crosse proceedings, as he
thought, with Iohn of Ierusalem, he flew out, &amp;c.</hi> but what
a slender answer is this; <hi>Hierome</hi> was a Presbyter, what
then? <hi>Hierome</hi> saith nothing here, but what he saith
from Scripture; and is Scripture the lesse Scripture
because produced by a Presbyter? <hi>Hierome</hi> was a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
and pleads for his owne order; doth that make
his argument the lesse creditable? the author of <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
by Divine right</hi> was a Bishop; is it sufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of that booke to say hee was a Bishop that
made it, he must plead for his own honour and order?
<hi>Or you looke, say you, that I should tell you that wiser men
then your selves have censured him in this point of Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme.</hi>
No indeed, for feare you should thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
us against the same censure past so often upon
our selves. If <hi>Hierome</hi> suffer under the name of



<pb n="78" facs="tcp:33475:47"/>
Aerian, no wonder we doe: but if wisermen than we
have condemned him for Aerianisme, wiser men then
the Remonstant have quitted him of that crime.</p>
               <p>But the Remonstrant thinkes to decline these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
waies, and set <hi>Hierome</hi> to answer <hi>Hierome;</hi> which
yet is no more then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did before him; and
and puts us in mind that the same father passes a <hi>satis
imperitè</hi> upon the same opinion in the Bishop of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem;
but <hi>a satis imperitè</hi> doth not condemne the
opinion, but the man; for it may be truth which a
man speakes, though he speakes it <hi>imperitè:</hi> yet to
make sure worke the <hi>Remonstrant will set Hierome to
answer himselfe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 57.</note> 
                  <hi>what saith Hierome? at first saith he, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Presbyters had but one title:</hi> No, <hi>Hierome</hi> said
not so, nor did we. <hi>Idem est ergo Presbyter qui Episcopus:</hi>
How doth the Remonstrant construe this? Is this in
English, a Bishop and a Presbyter is the same: or is
it, <hi>at first Bishops and Presbyters had but one title?</hi> with
what face can the Remonstrant charge us with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
in quotation and mis-englishing, who useth no
more fidelity himselfe? that which <hi>Hierome</hi> speakes
of the office, he would restraine to the title; that which
<hi>Hierome</hi> speakes in the present tense, as true in all the
moments and fluxes of time, he would remit to the
time past; <hi>They had but one title;</hi> This the Remonstrant
passeth from, and slips from their Identity to their
imparity; inquiring the time and occasion of that, and
will needs force <hi>Hierome</hi> here to confesse <hi>Bishops in the
Apostles daies: because then they began to say, I am of Paul,
&amp;c.</hi> but will take no notice at all of what our answer
spake for the removing of this inference, unlesse it be
to slight it, <hi>as a poore shift:</hi> nor will take notice of that



<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33475:47"/>
which <hi>Hierome</hi> himselfe speakes. <hi>Haec propterea ut often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deremus

Episcopos: paulatim verò ut dissentionum plantaria evelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur,
ad unum omnem solicitudinem esse delatam:</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
that Episcopacy was not presently invented
as a cure of schisme, but <hi>paulatim:</hi> so that should it be
granted, that the schismes spoken of here were those
in the Apostles daies, yet it doth not follow, that Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
should be coaetaneous to these schismes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Hierome</hi> saith, <hi>Paulatim ad unum omnem solicitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
esse delatam.</hi> Let the Remonstrant now aske <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
not us; why the remedy should be so late after
the disease? and here we desire the reader to observe
that the Remonstrant doth meerely abuse him in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him that <hi>Clemens in his Epistle to the Corinthians
taxeth the continuance of the distractions raised in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
daies:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Def. 58.</note> when it is apparent that Clement speakes
of a new schisme different from that <hi>Paul</hi> speakes of,
raised against ther Presbyters, and the former schisme
mentioned in the Scripture was onely among the
people. As for those Bishops whom <hi>Hierome</hi> names as
made by the Apostles, at present we say no more, but
this: <hi>Hierome,</hi> as a Divine saith, <hi>Bishops and Presbyters are
the same;</hi> and to prove this produceth Scripture: but
<hi>Hierome</hi> speaking as an Historian, mentions Bishops
made by the Apostles, and brings no Scripture for the
proofe of that, but onely the testimony of <hi>Eusebius</hi> his
history, who alone had writ before him of that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
Now let the Christian Reader judge whether
more credit be to be given to <hi>Hierome</hi> as an Historian
quoting humane History,<note place="margin">Ierom de Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toribus Eccles.</note> or to <hi>Hierome</hi> as a Divine
quoting Scriptures. And yet what can be brought to



<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33475:48"/>
prove that those Bishops were not the same with
Presbyters?</p>
               <p>For the diabolicall occasion of bringing in Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
into the Church: if there be any fault in the
phrase, it is <hi>Hieromes,</hi> not ours: therefore the <hi>weaknes
and absurdity is slung in the face of that waspish, hot good
man Hierome,</hi> not in ours.</p>
               <p>The institution of Episcopacy, Hierome saith, was
rather <hi>by the custome of the Church then by the truth of the
Lords disposition;</hi> to avoyd the stroke of which, the
Remonstrant would faine perswade <hi>Hierome</hi> to owne
that, which in the judgement of <hi>Belarm. Spalato,</hi> and
almost as many as have writ before the Remonstrant,
never entered into his thoughts; nor can be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
meaning of his words; <hi>That by the custome of the
Church, the father meanes the Church Apostolique, and by
the Lords disposition, Christs immediate institution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This were to make <hi>Hierome</hi> of their mind. How
well this may be done, let their sworne friend <hi>Spalato</hi>
give his verdict. <hi>Sunt qui Hieronymum in rect am senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam
vel invitum velint trahere;</hi> one of these must this
<hi>Remonstrant</hi> be.</p>
               <p>As for that passage of <hi>Hierome ad Euagrium,</hi> where
he saies,<note place="margin">Page 59.</note> 
                  <hi>this superiority of Bishops above Presbyters is by
Apostolicall tradition, Hierome</hi> in that Epistle sharpens
his reproofe against some Deacons, that would equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
themselves to Presbyters; an opinion which the
Remonstrant thinks more reasonable, then that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
should be equall to Bishops:<note place="margin">In his defence, p. 125.</note> to make this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
the stronger he saith, <hi>Presbyteris ad est, Episcopis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi>
and a little after, he doth out of the Scripture most
manifestly prove <hi>eundem esse Presbyterum at que Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum:</hi>



                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:33475:48"/>
and carries this proofe by <hi>Paul,</hi> by <hi>Peter,</hi> and by
<hi>Iohn</hi> the longest surviver of the <hi>Apostles:</hi> then adde,
<hi>quod autem postea unus electus qui caeteris praeponeretur, in
schismatis remedium factum. The reason why afterwards
one was elected, and set over the rest was the cure of
schisme.</hi> It is hard to conceive how this imparity can
be properly called an Apostolicall tradition when
<hi>Hierome</hi> having mentioned <hi>Iohn</hi> the last of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
saith it was <hi>postea afterwards</hi> that one was set over
the rest, yet should we grant it an Apostolicall tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Hieromes</hi> sense, it would be no prejudice to our
cause, seeing with him <hi>Apostolicall tradition</hi> and <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
custome</hi> are the same; witnesse that instance
of the observation of <hi>Lent,</hi> which he writing <hi>ad Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>
saith, is <hi>Apostolica traditio;</hi> yet writing <hi>adversus
Luciferianos,</hi> faith it is <hi>Ecclesiae consuetudo;</hi> whereby it
fully appeares that <hi>Hierome</hi> by Apostolicall tradition
meant not an Apostlicall institution, but an ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
custome, and so much we granted <hi>Episcopacie</hi>
to have.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hierome</hi> saith <hi>toto orbe decretum est, and it was decreed
all the world over (say you) in the time of the first divisions.
Hierome</hi> said not so (say we) but after these divisions,
not in the time of these first divisions. Is this faithfull
translating? <hi>By what power, say you, besides Apostolicall
could it be decreed so soone and so universally?</hi> But how
if it were decreed neither soone nor universally? If
we may believe <hi>Hierome,</hi> it was neither soone nor at
once; but <hi>paulatim</hi> by little and little, not by Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
decree, but by the custome of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, <hi>the Presbyters governed the Church by
their Canon Councell.</hi> So they did, saith the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant,

altogether till Episcopacy was setled, who dare deny
it?</hi> sure hee dares deny it, who in the 55. page of his

that <hi>though at first the name and office of a Bishop and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter

the Remonstrant) <hi>say we also,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 59.</note> 
                  <hi>and so in some cases they do.</hi>
Good sir, and why not in all cases? <hi>Church government,
you say, is Aristocraticall.</hi> True, when it is in the hands
of the best men, then it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, or Kakistocraticall.
But our present Church government is not <hi>Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</hi>
but <hi>Monarchicall:</hi> because not onely one Bishop
Lords it over his Diocesse, but also one Primate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points

<hi>Aristocraticall,</hi> then ought every Minister to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of that Aristocracy; for certainely no man will
account the Minister <hi>de plebe:</hi> in the judgement not

none can be accounted <hi>plebs</hi> but the Laicks; seing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

                  <note place="margin">Iob 33. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>and is as one of a

not to be subject to the judgement of a Synod.</hi> It is much
he should not, when all the fixed members of our Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod

Thus all the art the Remonstrant hath cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade

                  <hi>The Presbyters of Alexandria did call him
their Bishop, whom they had chosen from among themselves,
and placed in a higher degree.</hi> This you call a <hi>faithlesse and
a halved citation:</hi> Good sir, be not so harty, its neither
false, nor halved: not false, because it fully proves the
thing for which wee brought it, which was, that the
advancing of one to an eminency and superiority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the rest was not a divine, but a humane act; it
was not God, but man that was the authour of this
imparity; and doth not the place fully prove this?
<hi>Presbyteri unum ex se electum in excelsiori gradu colloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
Episcopum nominabant,</hi> and say we any more? Nor
is it halved, though hee saith this was done <hi>a Marco
Evangelista, usque ad Heraclam:</hi> yet this concerned
not the purpose for which the text was quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and therefore might warrantably be omitted,
especially having proved before that, which
the Remonstrant would perswade his reader we are
shie of here, that Bishops were not in the Apostles
times: and if the leaving out a few words in a quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not pertinent to the question, be the halving of
it, how will the Remonstrant cleare himselfe of this
sinne, who citing the Councell of Laodicea p. 15.
makes bold to leave out a great deale more then we
did here: where a most materiall passage was omitted,
as before we have observed. Neither did we leave out
<hi>a Marco Evangelista,</hi> for feare it should prove that there
were Bishops as earlie as the Corinthian schisme. Nor
did <hi>our hearts tell us that Marke died many yeeres within

that hee writ his Gospell after <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> death.
That which wee quoted proves abundantly that the



<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33475:50"/>
Presbyters both chose and placed one of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersin
a higher degree, by their own authority, giving
him both the degree and the name. Doe you (who

remove the contradictions of Historians concerning
the order of succession of the Romane Bishops, <hi>Linus,
Clemens, Anacletus &amp;c.</hi> And he saith, That these or
some of these were Presbyters or Bishops of Rome at
the same time, ruling the Church in common. But the
following writers, fancying to themselves such Bishops
as then had obtained in the Church, fell into these
snares of tradition, because they supposed, according
to the custome of their owne times, that there could
be but one Bishop in one Church at the same time:
which is quite crosse to the Apostolicall times.</p>
               <p>To that of <hi>Ambrose</hi> calling <hi>Iames</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>

of a councell as false as himselfe.</hi> Why? because the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene
was the first generall Synod: but yet there were
provinciall Councels before. And the Commentaries
mentioned before doe not say it was done by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Councell, but onely by a Councell; though you
by subtle coupling this Councell and <hi>Hieromes toto or be



<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33475:51"/>

which <hi>toto orbe decretum est</hi> implies no Apostolicall
act, nor act of a generall Councell neither, as we have
shewed before. And yet this we tell you, the Nicene
was the first Councell, in which <hi>toto orbe decretum erat</hi>
that there should be but one Bishop in a City.</p>
               <p>As for Saint <hi>Austin</hi> his phrase,<note place="margin">Page 64.</note> that the originall of
Episcopacy above Presbytery was onely <hi>secundum
usum Ecclesiae, you say it was but a modest word, and it is
a just wonder that we dare cite him.</hi> Well, let us put it to
the triall; <hi>Hierome</hi> having taken distate at <hi>Augustine,</hi>
writes two sharpe Epistles to him,<note place="margin">Epist. 11. 13.</note> in both which Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
be doth extoll <hi>Augustine</hi> ironically as a great man,
because hee was in <hi>pontificali culmine Constitutus</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to Episcopall dignity, and speakes of himselfe
as a poore, contemptible underling: to which <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
answering among other things saith thus: <hi>Rogo ut
me fidenter corrigas, ubi mihi hoc opus esse perspexeris:
quanquam enim secundum honorum vocabula quae Ecclesiae
usus obtinuit, Episcopatus Presbyterio major est: tamen in
multis Augustinus Hieronymo minor. This was Augustines
modesty say you.</hi> Well, and had not <hi>Augustine</hi> beene as
modest, if he had left out that phrase <hi>quae Ecclesiae usus
obtinuit?</hi> his modesty appeares in these words, <hi>tamen in
multis Augustinus Hieronymo minor;</hi> not in the former. In
the diminution of his person, not of his calling. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
knew how to speake humbly of himselfe, yet highly
of his office,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 13.</note> and so might <hi>Austin;</hi> and if he had known
that the majority of <hi>Bishops</hi> above <hi>Presbyters</hi> had beene
of Divine, or Apostolicall institution, he might have
said so much; and not have beene the lesse modest, but
the more; nay hee would have said so much. <hi>Quis

but let the learned reader vouchsafe to view it at larg,
and if it doe not appeare that wee have alledged the
place according to the genuine sence of the Authour,
let us in his thoughts lie under all the reproaches,
which our virulent Remonstrant labours to cast upon
us in his whole book. However the Remonstrant hath
little cause to reproach <hi>Nazianzen</hi> with that scoffe

he that peruseth his life shall finde, it would be an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier

Bishopricke to another till hee come to Canturbury,
then it was to remove <hi>Nazianzen</hi> from one place to
another. And as little reason with open mouth to fall
upon us, and bid us eate our words, for saying that if
<hi>our Bishops will deduce their pedegree from the Apostles
time in an uninterrupted line unto this day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 66.</note> they must
draw the line of their pedigree through the loynes of
Antichrist: we tell him againe, let him take it never
so angerly: What ever Bishops have beene in other
places besides Rome, if our Bishops will draw their
pedegree from the Apostles, they must draw it through
Antichrists loynes.</p>

                  <hi>that the Apostles Bishops,

they are we grant, and so did we distinguish them,

the Remonstrant might have taken notice of and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
this scorne. Yet not so <hi>contradistinguished,</hi> but
that <hi>the power of ordination</hi> may be reckoned as a <hi>part
of Episcopall jurisdiction;</hi> taking that word <hi>jurisdiction</hi>
(which was unknowne to first antiquity) for the <hi>whole

takes it.</p>
               <p>The first of these, <hi>the sole power of ordination; and the
sole exercise of that power, which was a stranger, and a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

and herein differ <hi>from the former Bishops.</hi> The latter of
these he grants, <hi>That Bishops of former times did not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to themselves the sole exercise of ordination. Onely he</hi>
cannot let us passe; <hi>without his usuall curtesie.</hi> But the
former he denies,<note place="margin">Page 70.</note> 
                  <hi>the ordination is (he saith) the Bishops,
but the sole in that sence we use it, is ours. Bishops did never
challenge it nor practice it,</hi> we will wash off all this; and
shew first that our English Bishops have challenged to
themselves this sole power, and have practised this
power, and then make good our quotation: and
when this is done, let it be tryed not <hi>who can blush,</hi>
but who <hi>hath more reason to blush; the Remonstrant, or

               </p>
               <p>For the first: <hi>that Bishops challenge to themselves sole
power of ordination.</hi> We did never thinke that in these



<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33475:54"/>
knowing times we should have beene put to prove the
Snow is white, or the Crow blacke. But seeing the
Remonstrant will have it so, we will shew first out of
<hi>Episcopacy by Divine right,</hi> part 2. Sect. 15. the title of
which Section is this, <hi>power of ordination is ONELY
in Bishops:</hi> and in the beginning of the Section he saith,
<hi>This was one of the Acts that was APPROPRIATED
to Bishops ALONE:</hi> and is not this to challenge <hi>sole
power of ordination?</hi> afterwards in the same Section,
he saith, <hi>Ordination is one of the things so Intrinsecall to
Episcopacy,</hi> that in the judgement of the Church, no
extremity of Necessity was sufficient warrant to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
it into other hands. The same power of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doe Bishop <hi>Bilson, Andrewes, Davenant, Mountague,
&amp;c.</hi> challenge to Episcopacy. Now Reader judge, is
the <hi>sole</hi> theirs by challenge or no?</p>
               <p>And what <hi>they challenge, that they practise:</hi> we doubt
not but the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> conscience can tell him,
there are many instances in England to be produced
of men ordained in England without the hands of any
Presbyter. The <hi>Remonstrant</hi> is as <hi>unhappy</hi> as <hi>peremptory</hi>
in his challenge he makes. <hi>I challenge them to shew any
one instance in the Church of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, the instances are without number. Some of us
are ocular witnesses of many scores at severall ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
ordained by a Bishop in his private Chappell
without the presence of any Presbyter, but his owne
domesticke Chaplaine, and without any assistance
from him save onely in reading prayers. But alasse
what should we fall to instances! Put case an Irish or
Welsh Bishop ordaines one at London in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
or some Chappell, and admits him which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends



<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33475:54"/>
the person to him to joyne for fashion sake in
the gesture of imposition of hands, be hee of what
place or Diocesse he will: how little doth this differ
from sole ordination, and how much from that <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and ordinate ordination</hi> of former times? Sir, these
are poore toyes to mocke the Church withall, if not
God himselfe too. Could such a Bishop say, as well as

part there is <hi>but one,</hi> sometimes <hi>not one</hi> Presbyter there
besides the Bishop.</p>
               <p>But why doe you take notice here of one Canon of
the Councell of Carthage,<note place="margin">Page 71.</note> and not of the other? <hi>ut E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopus
sine,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>a Bishop should ordaine none of the
Clergie without the Counsell of his Clergie,</hi> unlesse it be,
because here is such a manifest deflexion in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of ours from former times, as all the wit and
Rhetoricke the Remonstrant hath cannot cover.</p>
               <p>Your next evasion is a plaine leaving the question;
we are to prove that Bishops in ancient times did not
ordaine without Presbyters. You challenge us <hi>to prove
a Presbyters Regular ordaining without a Bishop;</hi> which is
not the point in question. Who doth here most <hi>abuse
the Reader,</hi> let himselfe judge: but wee are accused
not onely of <hi>abusing our Readers,</hi> but our Authours too.
And the Remonstrant hopes he hath us here at such
a vantage, as shall try what modesty is in us. <hi>Three
foule scapes are laid to our charge.</hi> First, <hi>we abuse Firmilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
in casting upon him an opinion of Presbyters ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which he never held;</hi> let us once againe view the
place. <hi>Firmilianus</hi> speaking of the true Church, saith,



<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33475:55"/>
                  <hi>ubi Praesident Majores natu, qui &amp; Baptizandi &amp; manum
imponendi &amp; ordinandi possident potestatem:</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
is, who these <hi>Majores natu</hi> be? <hi>Bishops saith
he. Bishops and Elders</hi> say we. To prove it, we expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<hi>Firmilian</hi> by <hi>Firmilian,</hi> calling a little before those
whom here he cals <hi>Majores natu, Seniores &amp; praepositi.</hi>
Which are not so farre from that clause but that they
may be brought without <hi>wire drawing or foysting;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 72.</note> and
are not so remote from that place, as those words
which himselfe produceth, which we desire the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Reader to consider, because we are charged by
him, for <hi>foysting in and wyre drawing</hi> the words of the
Authour: and also because the very words there cited
by the Remonstrant speake of a power of <hi>remitting
sinnes,</hi> which we hope he will not ingrosse to Bishops,
excluding Presbyters. <hi>Pamelius</hi> himselfe is with us:
who understands by <hi>Seniores &amp; prepositi,</hi> the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Bishops.</p>
               <p>Our next scape, <hi>is but grosse ignorance,</hi> in translating
<hi>Ambroses Presbyteri consignant</hi> by <hi>Presbyters ordaining.</hi>
Every <hi>Novice knowes consigning signifies confirmation,
and not ordaining.</hi> Sir, we appeale from your Novices
to judicious Readers, and intreat them to peruse the
text: and wee doubt not but upon due consideration
they will conclude for our sence: let us then plead the
case, and tell you first,<note place="margin">In Arnob. li. 3.</note> That your <hi>Desiderius Heraldus</hi>
shewes both the word <hi>signare</hi> or <hi>consignare</hi> in the
phrase of antiquity to be as much as <hi>consecrare,</hi> and
so doth <hi>Cyprian</hi> Epist. 2. and therefore it is not incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of such a sence as we have put upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Reader please to view the place in <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
he shall finde that <hi>Ambrose</hi> there is speaking of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining



<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33475:56"/>
men to publique offices in the Church; and
not of confirmation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though it should be taken for confirmation, yet
you gaine nothing; for the same Canon, that put
power of ordination into the hands of Bishops, places
the power of confirmation also in their hands. And
they among us that challenge the sole power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,<note place="margin">Episc. Di. Right, part. 2. p. 91.</note>
challenge also sole power of confirmation. If
any man object that confirmation is not so appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Bishops as ordination is, because (as some
of you say) confirmation is onely reserved to them
<hi>honoris gratiâ</hi> ordination they have <hi>necessitatis
gratiâ</hi> this objection we have satisfied in our answer
page 38. wherein we have shewed not onely from <hi>Loo,</hi>
that the power of ordination was reserved to them
onely <hi>authoritate canonum:</hi> but also that it was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to them for their credit and authority. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
speakes almost in the same words:<note place="margin">Quaest. de utro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que mixtim. 101.</note> 
                  <hi>Nam &amp; in
Alexandria, &amp; per totum Aegyptum, si desit Episcopus,
consecrat Presbyter:</hi> that which in <hi>Ambrose</hi> is called
<hi>consignat,</hi> is here called <hi>consecrat;</hi> and albeit the authors
of both these bookes be questioned, yet both of them
are acknowledged ancient, yea Doctor <hi>Raynolds</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
the last of them from the 44. question was
written above 300. yeeres after Christ: this is enough
to us, that in antiquity <hi>consignat</hi> is expounded by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrat;</hi>
which cleares us of that imagined <hi>guilt of a solae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme,</hi>
that hee would fasten upon us: and this may
satisfie (if this man be satisfiable) that bold challenge
of the former page: <hi>shew us but one instance of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
regular and practized ordaining without a Bishop, and
carry the cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:33475:56"/>
Our third charge is double, <hi>first of skill not too much:
secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 72.</note> 
                  <hi>of lesse fidelity.</hi> Our want of skill is, in not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
of <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we brought as instances
of Presbyters ordaining without a Bishop) <hi>some of
whom</hi> (saith the Remonstrant) <hi>had the nature and power
of Episcopacy to all purposes: and therefore might well, by
the Bishops licence in his owne charge impose hands.</hi> Now,
we may returne it to the Remonstrant, that <hi>he discovers
not too much skill</hi> in saying that <hi>some Chorepiscopi had
both the nature and power of Episcopacy to all purposes,</hi> and
yet might not ordaine in <hi>his own charge without the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
license.</hi> For what needs a Bishops licence to inable
a <hi>Chorepiscopus</hi> in his owne charge to doe that, for the
doing of which hee <hi>had before the nature and power of
Episcopacy to all purposes.</hi> This is just as our Bishops are
wont to do, who give a full power to a Presbyter at his
ordination to preach the Gospell, with a charge also
to do it, and yet will not suffer him to preach, no not in
his own Cure, without a licence. But how doth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant
make good his distinction of his two sorts
of <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> from antiquity? Here we have <hi>ipse dixit</hi>
and no more. The peremptorinesse of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the
master in affirming, &amp; the silence of his schollars when
he comes to prove. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeed tels us that some
<hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> were <hi>ordained by more Bishops then one,</hi> and
these had <hi>power to ordaine.</hi> Others were <hi>ordained by one
Bishop,</hi> and those were <hi>meere Presbyters and might not
ordaine.</hi> But with how much fidelity <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and
after him the Remonstrant doth thus distinguish,<note place="margin">De Clericis, l. 1. c. 17.</note> let
the Councell of <hi>Antioch</hi> determine: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Let the Chorepiscopus
be ordained by the Bishop of the City, to whom hee



<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33475:57"/>
is subject. From which Councell wee gather that the
Chorepiscopi were meere Presbyters, and that there
were but one sort of them. First, because the Chore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopus
was to be ordained by one Bishop, <hi>ab Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copo,</hi>
not <hi>ab Episcopis:</hi> whereas by the Canons a Bishop
was to be ordained by many, or two at least. As for
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> his Chorepiscopus ordained by more Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
then one; wee leave it to him to make good:
indeed we finde in the same Canon, the Chorepiscopi
in the plurall number had the imposition of the hands
of Bishops, but when Chorepiscopus in the singular
number is mentioned, then onely one Bishop is said to
ordaine him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because the Chorepiscopus was to be subject to
the Bishop of the City, <hi>ab Episcopo civitatis cui subjici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi>
now we read no where of the subjection of one
Bishop and his charge to another: <hi>Cyprian</hi> pleads the
freedome of Bishops: telling us that each of them
hath a portion of Christs flocke assigned to him, for
which he is to give account to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because he could not, nay he durst not exercise
the power of Ordination without the leave of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop:
the Councell of Antioch sayes, <hi>non audeat absque
urbis Episcopo:</hi> Conc. Ancyr. sayes, <hi>non licere nisi cum
literis ab Episcopo permissum fuerit.</hi> None of this would
have beene said, if he had beene a Bishop, as we have
in part shewed in our answer, page 36.</p>
               <p>We deny not, but that this power of ordaining was
afterward taken away from the Chorepiscopi by the
same authority of the Canons, and Ecclesiasticall rules,
by which it was first appropriated to Bishops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as <hi>Leo. ep.</hi> 88. witnesses, which to us is a 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment



<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33475:57"/>
to prove that they once had it, and that they had
it as Presbyters: for if they had it as Bishops, the taking
of it away would have beene a degradation of them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We might bring an argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> to
prove the Chorepiscopi to be but Presbyters, because
they are sayd <hi>Conc. Naeocaesar. Can.</hi> 14. to be after the
manner, or in imitation of the seventy: now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the opinion of Hierarchicall men Bishops suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the Apostles, not the seventy.</p>
               <p>To all that we have said in this point, we might ad
that not onely <hi>Damasus</hi> in that Epistle which goes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his name, <hi>ep.</hi> 4. but also <hi>Leo ep.</hi> 88. proves them to
be but meere Presbyters, to whose sentence <hi>conc. 2.
Hispal. can.</hi> 7. subscribes.</p>
               <p>Now leaving the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> we will give the reader
a hint to prove, that not onely the Presbyters of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
and the Chorepiscopi, but further, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the City with the Bishops leave might ordaine,
which we prove from <hi>cenc. Ancyr. can.</hi> 13. named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
where it is said, <hi>It is not lawfull for Chorepiscopi to
ordaine Presbyters or Deacons: nor for the Presbyters of
the City without the Bishop his letters in an other parish:</hi>
from which it appeares, that Presbyters of the City
had the same power to ordaine which the rurall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
had. Because the restraint is layed equally upon
both: this is not onely our construction of the Canon,
Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> Doctor <hi>Downam. def. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 8. say the
same,<note place="margin">Perpet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gon. c. 14.</note> and Doctor <hi>Downam</hi> gathers from thence, that

Presbyters.<note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

time we hope we have cleared our fidelity in quoting
of the Councels of Antioch and Ancyra: both which
the Remonstrant thought his bare word enough to
blast. Now we appeale to equall judgements whether
<hi>the labour of this section were meerely cast away or no.</hi> The
Remonstrant <hi>grants sole ordination was in regard of the
exercise not challenged by Bishops in the Primitive times,</hi>
Though he would perswade the reader <hi>we cannot but
confesse it out of Hierome and Chrysostome.</hi> Yet let the
reader consult the 37. page of our answer which the
Remonstrant leaves unanswered, and judge betweene
us, how farre we are from such confession: his <hi>onely
shift now is to say our Bishops neither challenge nor exercise
any such power.</hi> We have evidently proved they doe
both, <hi>manet ergo inconcussum,</hi> our Bishops and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of former times are two.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Page 74.</note>
and it is granted <hi>that Presbyters have and ought to
have and exercise a jurisdiction within their owne charge.</hi>
But here the Remonstrant will distinguish againe, it



<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33475:58"/>
is in <hi>foro conscientiae.</hi> But consider Reader, whether
this be the jurisdiction here under dispute. Whether
<hi>that store of antiquity</hi> which he confesseth to <hi>cry downe
sole jurisdiction,</hi> speake of a jurisdiction <hi>in foro consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae,</hi>
as his false Margent saith, <hi>Clem Alexan.</hi> (whom
we cited) <hi>doth.</hi> But indeed this distinction of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant
of a jurisdiction in <hi>foro interno</hi> and <hi>in foro
externo,</hi> is like that distinction of <hi>Reflexivè</hi> and <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podialiter.</hi>
For all humane jurisdiction is <hi>in foro externo.</hi>
If preaching the word (which is especially aim'd at by
the Remonstrant, be an exercise of jurisdiction, Then
he that hath the Bishops licence to preach in the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
hath power to exercise jurisdiction through the
Diocesse, and an University preacher throughout the
whole Kingdome. Away with these toyes. He grants
againe, <hi>that Presbyters ought to be consulted with in the

no more? <hi>Bishops had their Ecclesiasticall Councell of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,

and was it onely in the <hi>greatest</hi> matters? Is this all that

of their jurisdiction, would cast a mist before his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
eyes, and perswade him he grants the whole se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
when indeed hee grants nothing, onely seekes to
slide away in the darke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But our Bishops have their Deanes and Chapters</hi> (say you)
<hi>and the lawes of our Church frequently make that use of
them.</hi> Yes you have Deanes and Chapters, but who
knowes not that they have a jurisdiction distinct from
the Bishops, in which the Bishop hath nothing to doe
with theirs, nor they with his. And <hi>the Bishops also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
the exercise of jurisdiction to others</hi> (we know it too
well) to Chancellours, Commissaries, Officials, and
other of their underlings, even to the commanding of
Christs Ministers to denounce their censures without
any discerning what equity is in the cause. And what
advise or assistance of Ministers is required, appeares
by the very stile of your excommunications. <hi>G. R.

               <p>
                  <hi>Presbyters</hi> he grants <hi>had their votes in Provinciall sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods:
we from good authority</hi> say more, they had their
votes in all ordinary Iudicatures.</p>
               <p>But after all these grants,<note place="margin">Page 74.</note> which are as good as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
now he comes to plead his owne. <hi>We justly say
that the superiority of jurisdiction is so in the Bishop, as
that Presbyters neither may, nor did exercise it without
him?</hi> to what purpose is this? if the Remonstrant



<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33475:59"/>
speake of <hi>Scripture times:</hi> We have proved there <hi>was
no superiority</hi> in them: if of <hi>latter times,</hi> it is not to the
question: wee are proving Bishops never exercised
jurisdiction without their Presbyters, as ours doe. He
puts us to prove Presbyters exercised jurisdiction
without Bishops, <hi>quam iniquè?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the exercise of externall jurisdiction is derived from,
by, and under the Bishop:</hi> No, neither from, by, nor under
the Bishop, but from God, who hath made them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers
and rulers, and by the same Ecclesiasticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that hath made you Bishops: and <hi>under</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
not in respect of divine <hi>power,</hi> but (if at all) in
respect of Ecclesiasticall <hi>Canons</hi> onely. Your <hi>Timothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> we shall meet in due place. Your <hi>Ignatius
and the rest of your testimonies you could produce</hi> would
(as you say truely) but surfeit the readers eyes,<note place="margin">Page 75.</note> unlesse
you could bring them to prove, <hi>that Bishops did and
might exercise sole jurisdiction.</hi> Onely because you so
<hi>triumph in our supposed scapes;</hi> let us intreat you, or the
reader for you to looke upon your cited Councell of
Antioch 24, 25, Canon; where you say the Bishop hath
power <hi>of those things that belong to the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 75.</note> and see
whether that speakes one word of jurisdiction: or be
not wholy to be understood, of the distribution of the
goods of the Church, as both the instance given in the
Canon, and <hi>Zonaras</hi> on that place manifest.</p>
               <p>One shift yet the Remonstrant hath more: and that
is to tell us, that <hi>this joynt government was but occasionall
and temporary in times of persecution.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 76.</note> But when a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:33475:60"/>
they supposed to finde lesse need of it.</hi> Doctor <hi>Downham</hi> to
whom hee referres in the page before, assignes other
reasons. Namely Presbyters <hi>desiring their ease and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasticall
quietnesse</hi> (which he saith and proves not) and
also the <hi>Bishops desiring to rule alone:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Down. Defen. 1. lib. c. 8.</note> which we finde to
be the true cause by experience. For if the Bishops be
of the Remonstrants mind, <hi>perswaded that the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
communicating of all the important businesse of the
Church, whether censures or determinations with those
grave assistants, which in the eye of the Law are designed to
this purpose, were a thing not onely unprejudiciall to the
honour of Episcopacy, but behovefull to the Church.</hi> Why
should not the Bishops doe it? save onely, that their
ambitious desires of ruling alone swayes them against
their owne judgement, and the determinations of the
law. But indeed if this communicating of all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
businesse of the Church with those grave as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants
you speake of or with the Presbyters of the
whole Diocesse, if you will, be onely an assuming
them into the fellowship of consulting and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
without any decisive suffrage, leaving the Bishop
to follow or not to follow their advise; this is but a
meere cosenage of the reader, and doth not hinder
the sole power of Episcopall jurisdiction. And this is
all that <hi>Downam</hi> grants <hi>lib. 1. c. 7. p.</hi> 161. where he saith
that Bishops doe assume Presbyters for advise and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
as a Prince doth his Counsellors, not as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull
doth his Senators who are cojudges with the
Consul. And this we perceive the Remonstrant well
likes of, as that which makes much for the honour of
their function.</p>
               <p>And now sir,<note place="margin">Page 76.</note> you see <hi>that we have not fished all night,



<pb n="105" facs="tcp:33475:60"/>
and caught nothing:</hi> wee have caught your <hi>sole jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi>
and might have caught your selfe, were you
not such a <hi>Proteus,</hi> such a <hi>Polypus</hi> to shift your selfe into
all formes and Colours. Having proved that Bishops
in all times, succeeding the Apostles, had Presbyters

                  <note place="margin">Page 77.</note> it is then because we prosecute a practice

that is the delegation of the power of their jurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<hi>an accidentall errour of some particular man, not to be fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

in all England who hath not given power to <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,

absolve, execute all censures, <hi>but one:</hi> and doth the
Remonstrant thinke now to stoppe our mouthes with
saying, <hi>it is a particular error of some men?</hi> whereas it
is evident enough that our English Episcopacy cannot
possibly be exercised without delegating of their
power to a multitude of inferiour instruments. Can
one Bishop having 500. or a 1000. Parishes under him,

it is but an accidentall error, and though granted, concludes
not, that our Bishops challenge to themselves any other spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

we abhorre it, as an unworthy thing, to <hi>compare our

our Bishops and Bishops of former times.</p>
               <p>But to please you this once, we will admit the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison

count so <hi>monstrous,</hi> our Bishops challenge a power
<hi>never delegated to Timothy nor Titus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 78.</note> And we prove it
thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timothy and Titus</hi> never had a power delegated to
them to devolve that power of governing the Church,
which God had intrusted into their hands upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
incapable of it by Gods ordinance. But our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
doe so. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Remonstrant thinkes by impleading other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, as guilty of the same crime; to force
us either to condemne them, or to acquit him. But the
reformed Churches, if they doe practise any such
thing, are of age to answer for themselves. Our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is with the Remonstrant and the persons and
practices which he hath taken the tuition of. Whom
we <hi>charging as in a generality with wholy intrusting the

                  <note place="margin">Page 78.</note> their good friend tels us <hi>we foulely

but they neither <hi>negligently</hi> or <hi>wilfully devest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of that, and wholy put it into Laicke hands. This is a
meere slander:</hi> that Bishops devest themselves of their
<hi>power</hi> we never said. That they doe either <hi>negligently</hi>
or <hi>wilfully</hi> decline <hi>that office</hi> which they call theirs, we
need not say, it is so apparent. And as apparent it is,
that they <hi>doe intrust the power of jurisdiction wholly into
Laicke hands:</hi> for their Chancellors; and Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
having power of <hi>jurisdiction</hi> by <hi>patent setled</hi> upon
them, and exercising that <hi>jurisdiction</hi> in all the parts

               <p>In our former answer we fully cleared from <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 79.</note>
how farre hee was from delegating his power to a

yet it is sufficient to condemne a practice that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had being in the thoughts of primitive times. And
we beleeve it satisfies all others, because the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant
saith <hi>it is very like it was so:</hi> Though according
to his old way of diversion he tels us,<note place="margin">Page 79.</note> as <hi>Cyprian did not
referre to a Chancellor, so neither to the bench of a</hi> Laicke
<hi>Presbytery:</hi> yet he that is but meanly versed in <hi>Cyprian,</hi>

               <p>But the Remonstrant thinkes to patronize the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice

of Troas. And what did <hi>Silvanus</hi> to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing

who grants that till <hi>about 400 yeeres after

                  <note place="margin">Page 79.</note> But till he can produce
such instances, our challenge will stand strong enough

notwithstanding his great words. But his put off is

                  <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 63.</note> Which how tyrannous an

speakes to this purpose: A man commits goods to his
neighbour, they miscarry under his hand; it is
knowne he had them, how they miscarried it is not
knowne; in this case the man is to cleare his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
upon his oath: what is this to the compelling of a
man in cases criminall to betray himselfe by an oath?
The other text <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 19. availes you lesse, for if
such an oath were now lawfull,<note place="margin">Your Bishop of the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> might have given his wife <hi>lezabel</hi> (as you call her) this oath.</note> then <hi>oathes Ex officio</hi>

Adultery was death by <hi>Moses</hi> his law; and it is as well
knowne that this Law of the water of jelousie was not
morall, but judiciall, peculiar to the policie of the

Jewes, and that upon particular causes, to wit, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
jealousie of that Nation which could no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be appeased. As for your instance out of Master
<hi>Calvins</hi> Epistle, wherein you would make your reader
beleeve that the Consistory of <hi>Geneva</hi> did give such an

tied <hi>to discover their purposes and intentions;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Calv. ad Farel.</note> No such
thing appeares in the Epistle. We finde indeed that
two of that company having confes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
wherewith they were charged, and the rest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
denying it, <hi>Calvin</hi> thought it fit to make
them confesse the truth upon oath. <hi>Corneus,</hi> who had
confessed all before, pressing them not to forsweare
themselves, prevailed so, as that they confessed all;
and the dancing also above what was charged upon
them. All that we can collect is, that an oath was
thought meet to be given, to make them confesse to
Gods glory, what was proved by two witnesses, but
that they were bound to confesse their intentions here
is no syllable of it in the epistle. And therefore to what
purpose you bring in this to warrant your oath <hi>Ex
officio,</hi> unlesse it be for want of better instances, we
know not.</p>

it with some texts of Scripture, that they might plead
a <hi>Ius divinum</hi> for it: that the consciences of all might
be tyed up from attempting to pull down their proud
Fabricke; but none of them is more confident in this
plea then this Remonstrant, who is content that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
should for ever be hooted out of the Church,
and be disclaimed as usurpers, if they claime any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
power then what the Scripture gives them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
bearing his cause upon <hi>Timothy, and Titus, and
the Angels of the 7. Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now because one grain of Scripture is of more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
&amp; esteeme to faith, then whole volumes of humane
testimonies; we indeavoured to shew the impertinency
of his allegations especially in those two instances.</p>
               <p>And concerning <hi>Timothy and Titus,</hi> we undertooke
two things: First, that they were not Bishops (in his
sence) but Evangelists, the companions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
in founding of Churches, or sent by them from
place to place, but never setled in any fixed pastorall
charge, and this wee shewed out of the story of the
Acts, and the Epistles. The other was, that granting
<hi>ex abundanti</hi> they had beene Bishops, yet they never
exercised any such jurisdiction as ours doe.</p>
               <p>But because the great hinge of the controversie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the instances of <hi>Timothy and Titus,</hi> before
we come to answer our Remonstrant, we will promise
these few propositions granted by most of the patrons
of Episcopacy.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Evangelists</hi> properly so called, were men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
imployed in preaching the Gospell
without a setled residence upon any one charge.<note place="margin">Def. p. 94.</note> They
were <hi>Comites, &amp; Vicarii Apostolorum, Vice-Apostles,</hi> who

had <hi>Curam principalem.</hi> And did (as <hi>Ambrose</hi> speakes)
<hi>Evangelizare sine Cathedra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Page 100.</note> It is granted by our Remonstrant, and
his appendant <hi>Scultetus,</hi> and many others. That <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
was properly an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> while he travelled up
and downe with the Apostles.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is expressely granted, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and
<hi>Titus</hi> were no Bishops till after <hi>Pauls</hi> first being at
<hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 97.</note> That is after the end of the Histories of the <hi>Acts

are fetcht,<note place="margin">Vide Lud. Capell. hist. Eccles. p. 66. 74.</note> were written by <hi>Paul</hi> before his first
going to <hi>Rome.</hi> And this is acknowledged by all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
and Chronologers, that we have consulted
with upon this point, <hi>Baronius</hi> himselfe affirming it.
And the Remonstrants owne grounds will force him
to acknowledge that the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi>
was also written at <hi>Pauls</hi> first being at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 60.</note> For that
second Epistle orders him to bring <hi>Marke</hi> alone with
him, who by the Remonstrants account died five or
six yeeres before <hi>Paul.</hi> Which could not have beene,<note place="margin">Estius in Arg. in secundam ep ad Tim.</note>
if this Epistle were written at <hi>Pauls</hi> second comming
to Rome. <hi>Estius</hi> also following <hi>Baronius</hi> gives good
reason that the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was written
at <hi>Pauls</hi> first being at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, If <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were not Bishops when
these Epistles were written unto them, then the maine
grounds of <hi>Episcopacy by divine right</hi> sinke by their
owne confession. Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> in his <hi>Episcopacy by divine
right,</hi> part 2. sect. 4. concludes thus peremptorily. <hi>That



<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33475:66"/>
that if the especiall power of ordination and power of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and censuring Presbyters be not cleare in the Apostles
charge to these two Bishops, the one of Creete,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">So <hi>Bilson.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the other of
Ephesus, I shall yeeld the cause, and confesse to want my
sences.</hi> And it must needs be so; for if <hi>Timothy</hi> were
not then a Bishop, the Bishops power of charging
Presbyters, of proving and examining Deacons, of
rebuking Elders, and ruling over them, and his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of hands to ordaine Presbyters, &amp;c. doe all
faile. And Bishops in these can plead no succession
to <hi>Timothy and Titus</hi> by these Scriptures more then
other Presbyters may. For if they were not Bishops,
then all these were done by them as extraordinary
Officers, to which there were no successors.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, By the confession of the patrons of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.
It is not onely incongruous,<note place="margin">Vide Episc. by Di. Right, p. 2.</note> but sacrilegious for
a Minister to descend from a superiour order to
an inferiour, according to the great Counsell of
Chalcedon.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In all that space of time from the end of
the Acts of the Apostles untill the middle of <hi>Trajans</hi>
raigne there is nothing certaine to be drawne out of
Ecclesiasticall Authours about the affaires of the
Church, thus writeth <hi>Iosephus Scaliger.</hi> Thus <hi>Tilenus</hi>
when he was most Episcopall,<note place="margin">Prolegum. in Chron. Euseb.</note> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them both saith, It cannot be easily shewed who
were the true followers of the Apostles, no further then
it can be gathered out of the Epistles of <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the intelligent Reader weigh and consider these
granted propositions,<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 3. c. 4.</note> he may with ease see how the
life-blood of Episcopacy from <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> is
drayn'd out: for if they were not Bishops till after



<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33475:66"/>
                  <hi>Pauls</hi> first being at <hi>Rome,</hi> then not when the Epistles
were written to them according to the fourth propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
and then their cause failes: if any shall say they
were Bishops before <hi>Pauls</hi> first being at <hi>Rome,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the third proposition, then they make them
Bishops, while by the story its apparent they were E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists,
and did <hi>Evangelizare sine cathedra,</hi> and so
clash against the second.</p>
               <p>In a word, the office of an Evangelist being a higher
degree of Ministery then that of Bishops,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 11.</note> make them
Bishops when you please, you degrade them contrary
to our sixt proposition: whiles the Remonstrant tryes
to reconcile these things, we shall make further use of
them in our scanning his allegations in this section,
to which we now proceed.</p>
               <p>Where first the Reader may please to observe that
the Remonstrant slideth by our marginall wherein we
shewed the delineation that <hi>Eusebius</hi> makes of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist,
and desired the Reader to judge thereby
whether <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were not Evangelists.<note place="margin">Page 92.</note> One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he chargeth us with boldnesse for calling them so,
though himselfe afterward confesseth it, page 98:
p. 100. But why must this be boldnesse? Forsooth,
because though <hi>Timothy</hi> be expressely called an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist,
yet <hi>there is no text, no not the least intimation, no
not so much as the least ground of a conjecture, that Titus
was an Evangelist.</hi> And if so, why doe you afterwards
grant it? But whether you doe or no, that it was so
we have proved sufficiently in our answer. But let
any indifferent man here consider the iniquity of the
Remonstrant that challengeth us for calling <hi>Titus</hi> an
Evangelist without a text for his name; and yet thinks



<pb n="118" facs="tcp:33475:67"/>
himselfe much wronged if wee grant him not, that
<hi>Timothy and Titus</hi> and the Angels of the Church were
Bishops, though he hath no text for the name, nor for
the office? Secondly, To our text, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>rather intimates he was no Evangelist, then that he was:</hi> as
if it were no more, then for the Remonstrant <hi>to desire
his friend to doe the worke of a Secretary or Sollicitor for
him, this implies he is neither.</hi> A very cleare glosse. <hi>Paul</hi>
doth not here intreat, as we conceive, but charge. He
speakes <hi>Imperative,</hi> not <hi>Impetrative.</hi> Compare this, not
with the phrases of the Remonstrant, but with the
phrases of the sam Apostle: and then judge. In the
same Epistle 2 Chapt. 3. The same Apostle saith to
the same person, <hi>endure hardnesse as a good souldier of
Christ:</hi> doth that imply <hi>Timothy</hi> was no souldier of
Christ, but onely so imployed for the time? So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
in the 15. verse of the same Chapter, when the
Apostle saith, <hi>study to approve thy selfe a workman that
needs not to be ashamed:</hi> doth this prove that <hi>Timothy</hi>
was not a workeman but onely for the time? When
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 13. quite your selves like men,</hi> doth
that shew they were not men? but onely so imployed
for the time. How would the Remonstrant have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
over such a high peece of ridiculous learning
in our answer? had we turned off all these texts which
use to be produced as proofes of Episcopall authority
in <hi>Timothy and Titus</hi> with such a shift as this? this doth
not shew it was their worke, but onely they were so
imployed for the time.</p>
               <p>Wee adde further, That when you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<hi>Timothy</hi> was to doe the office of an Evangelist



<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33475:67"/>
(for so your comparison of <hi>your friends doings the
office of a Secretary</hi> warrants us to interpret you) you
must necessarily meane the extraordinary Evangelist
(for you scoffe page 94. at an ordinary Evangelist, as
a <hi>new fiction</hi>) which if so, then consider how absurd
a thing it is to bid the inferior doe the worke of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior.
Superiours may be intreated to doe the worke
of inferiours, because they come within the spheare of
their activity, and comprehend either virtually or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
what the inferiours are to doe. As Apostles have
power to doe all that Evangelists, Presbyters and
Deacons can doe; and Evangelists all that Presbyters,
&amp;c. but not <hi>è converso.</hi> Would it not be absurd to bid
a Curate doe the office of a Bishop? Or a Presbyter the
office of an Apostle? From all this we conclude, That
when <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy, Doe the worke of an Evangelist:</hi>
he bids him goe on with speed to execute his Vice-Apostolicall
office in watering the severall Churches
in <hi>Asia, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But saith he, if he were an Evangelist,<note place="margin">Part 2. p. 2. An Evangelist in the naturall sence of the words is he that preacheth the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Gospell.</note> he may be
that, and a Bishop too. For <hi>wee doe but dreame when we
distinguish of Evangelists.</hi> Truely sir, this dreame was
the fruit of our reading, the fancy of the Authour of
Episcopacies divine right, and there we finde our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
guifted Evangelist, under which name indeed
we comprise all preachers.</p>
               <p>The other branch of that distinction; Evangelists
of extraordinary guifts and employments we finde in
Scripture: and in this defence too, <hi>Truth is, their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Evangelists are a new fiction.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 94.</note> True, if we speake of
the office of the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> but to give the title of
<hi>Evangelist,</hi> according to the naturall signification of



<pb n="120" facs="tcp:33475:68"/>
the word to ordinary preachers of the Gospell, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>new</hi> nor <hi>fiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, <hi>our argument we raise upon this ground is slight.
Paul besought Timothy to abide still at Ephesus, 1. Tim. 1. 3.
which had beene a needlesse importunity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 95.</note> 
                  <hi>if he had had the
Episcopal charge of Ephesus, for then necessarily he must have
resided there.</hi> But what's his answer to this argument?
Nothing, onely saith it is <hi>slight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that other argument brought from <hi>Timothies</hi>
perpetuall moving from place to place, to prove that
he was never fixed in an Episcopall station, is of as
<hi>little force</hi> with him. <hi>The necessities of those times were
such, as made even the most fixed Starres planetary, calling
them frequently, from the places of their abode to those
Services that were of most use for the successe of that great
worke: yet so that after their err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nds fully dome they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to their owne charge.</hi> Let us once professe as
much confidence in our cause as the Remonstrant
doth in his: We challenge him to shew in all the new
Testament, any one that was appointed overseer of a
particular Church, whose motion was as <hi>planetary</hi> as
wee have shewed that of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to have
beene. Or if that faile, let him but shew that after
<hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> went abroad upon the Service of the
Churches, they did constantly or ordinarily returne
either to <hi>Ephesus</hi> or <hi>Creet,</hi> and not to the places either
of the Apostles present abode or appointment. And
let them take <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> as theirs, the patrons
and presidents of Episcopacy. But till they can shew
this, we must beleeve and affirme <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>
are Evangelists and no Bishops.</p>
               <p>Our next argument, from <hi>Act. 20. is but a Reed.</hi>



                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:33475:68"/>
Happy Remonstrant that deales with such impotent
adversaries; our first argument is slight,<note place="margin">You cannot shake it out so easily.</note> our second is
of no force, our third is but a reed. Yet let us tell you,
<hi>Haeret Lateri Lethalis Arundo.</hi> We affirmed, &amp; upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
grounds, <hi>Acts 20. 4:</hi> (though the Remonstrant
know it not) that <hi>Timothy</hi> was with <hi>Paul</hi> at the meeting
at <hi>Miletum,</hi> and from thence argued that had <hi>Timothy</hi>
been B. of <hi>Ephesus, Paul</hi> would have given him a charge
of feeding the flocke, and not the Elders, but would
have given them direction for their carriage, at least,
would not so have forgot himselfe as to call the Elders
Bishops, before their Bishops face.</p>
               <p>In all which the Remonstrant saith,<note place="margin">Page 96.</note> 
                  <hi>we goe upon a
wrong ground:</hi> But sure sir, you are not so ignorant of
our meaning, as by your questions you would seeme
to be. We grant that these assembled persons, were
Presbyters or Bishops in a parity, but neither in impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
neither under <hi>Timothy</hi> nor any other Bishop. And
to this purpose is our argument, from the want of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
to them as inferiour: yet notwithstanding the
Remonstrant would be glad to picke what holes he
can in our argument; yet in part he grants what wee
conclude: <hi>That they were all Bishops,</hi> onely with this
addition, <hi>they were not meere Presbyters:</hi> but upon what
ground? The word it selfe imports they were Bishops
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And doth not the other word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
as strongly they were Presbyters? And the truth
is they were Presbyters, whom the holy Ghost had
made Bishops. Foreseeing how his owne words
would snarle him, if he should grant them all Bishops,
he must grant there were more Bishops then one in
<hi>Ephesus;</hi> he puts by that blow telling us that <hi>though they



<pb n="126" facs="tcp:33475:69"/>
were sent for from Ephesus, yet they were not said to be all
of Ephesus Thither they were called from divers parts, which
seems to be implyed in these words ye all amongst whom, &amp;c.</hi>
This is but a poore evasion: For first the holy Ghost
tels us, that <hi>Paul</hi> did now study expedition, and did
decline <hi>Ephesus</hi> of purpose because he would not
spend time in <hi>Assia:</hi> Now if <hi>Paul</hi> comming to <hi>Miletum</hi>
had sent from thence to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> for the Elders of that
Church, and they had sent for the rest of the <hi>Asian</hi>
Churches, &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> had stayed at <hi>Miletum</hi> till they could
assemble to him, this would have beene such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of time, as <hi>Pauls</hi> haste to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
Secondly, these Elders were all of one Church
made by God, Bishops over one flocke; and therefore
may with most probability be affirmed to be the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Church of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> For the Apostles were
alwaies exact in distinguishing Churches; that of a
<hi>City,</hi> they alwaies called a <hi>Church;</hi> those of a <hi>Province,
Churches;</hi> Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> Churches of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
Churches of <hi>Iudea,</hi> &amp;c. And that evasion which
you use, page 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they might be all called one
Church because <hi>united under one government,</hi> makes
your cause farre worse. Because notwithstanding this
union you speake of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> joyning them all together
in one Epistle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 1. calls them the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi>
and now here the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Besides this, the Syriack
translation (thought by some to be almost as ancient
as the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi>) reads it, <hi>the Elders of the
Church of Ephesus,</hi> not onely the Elders of the Church.
Thirdly, you say they were Bishops or Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of other Churches as well as <hi>Ephesus.</hi> But your
selfe grants in this very page, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was not



<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33475:69"/>
yet Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and yet you all say that he was
the first Bishop that ever <hi>Ephesus</hi> had. And that <hi>Ephesus</hi>
was the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of all <hi>Asia.</hi> How then came the
<hi>Daughter Churches</hi> to have Bishops before their mother
as you call it. Lastly, that we may cut asunder the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
(as your phrase is) of your far-fetched answer,
borrowed from Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi> and <hi>Andrewes.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
you lay the weight of it upon those words, <hi>Ye all
among whom I have gone preaching the Kingdome of God.</hi>
Collecting from thence, that there must be some <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents</hi>
present from all those places, where he
had travelled preaching; Your selfe would quickly
see the weakenesse of it, were you not pleading your
owne cause. Should any man speaking with three or
foure of the members of the late convocation, say,
you all who had your hand in the late oath and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
are in danger, &amp;c. would it imply a presence of
all the members of the Convocation because the
speech concerned them all? you know it would not.
But if this doe not suffice, then tell us, Why must his
(<hi>All</hi>) be meant as such superintendents as you plead
for, except because they were called Bishops, and so
you would raise an argument from the <hi>name</hi> to the
<hi>thing;</hi> which kind of argument if it may prevaile, you
know your cause is lost.</p>
               <p>But the Acumen of this answer by which he makes
account <hi>to cut asunder the sinewes</hi> of all our proofes, is
this; That <hi>it is more then probable, that Timothy and Titus
were made Bishops after, Pauls first being at Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 97, 98.</note> Truely
sir, here you desert your old friend, <hi>Episc. by Div. right,</hi>
(out of whom you have hitherto borrowed a great

to ordaine Elders or Bishops in every City, and not to

Churches when they are framed to keepe them in the
Apostolicall truth, not to lay foundations, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aessifie

did in <hi>Creet,</hi> (the same worke which the Apostle did
when he visited the Churches of <hi>Asia, Acts</hi> 14. 23.)
which being finished, the same Apostolicall power
which sent him thither, removed him thence againe
for the service of other Churches, as we have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the truth of his Episcopacy; We must crave
leave to tell him, that though it may be one journey

consist with such a fixed station as Episcopacy is. Yet
an ordinary frequent course of jornying, such as <hi>Titus</hi>
his was cannot; unlesse he will grant that <hi>Timothy</hi>
might be a Bishop and an Evangelist at the same time.
But this is contrary to the Remonstrants one defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of an Evangelist, page 94. And therefore he

                  <note place="margin">Page 100.</note> This is more absurd then the former.
For if ever <hi>Titus</hi> were a Bishop; it was then when
<hi>Paul</hi> left him in <hi>Creet</hi> to ordaine Elders in every City:

say that afterwards he did descend from the degree of
an Evangelist to the station of Episcopacy. We hope
the Remonstrant will not deny but an Evangelist was

not give us leave to doe, but without his leave we shall
make it good. We say therefore further: That when
the Apostles or Evangelists (perhaps <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
Timothy</hi> at <hi>Ephesus, Titus</hi> at <hi>Creet)</hi> did stay longer
at one Church, and exercised such a power, as the
Bishops in succeeding ages did aspire unto: when the
Fathers would set forth this power of an Apostle or
Evangelists long residing in one Church, they (labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to doe it in a famil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar way) did similitudinarily
call them Bishops, and sometimes Archbishops or
Patriarcks, which all confesse were offices not heard
of in the Apostles times; not meaning they were so
formally, but eminently: neither could they call them
so properly, for the power they exercised was in them
formally Apostolicall or Evangelicall, reaching not
only to the Church where then they resided, but to all
neighbouring and bordering Churches, as farre as was
possible for them to oversee, or the occasions of the
Church did require; they having no bounded Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
but had the care of all the Churches. In this
sence they might call them so, but for either an



<pb n="129" facs="tcp:33475:72"/>
Apostle or Evangelist to be ordained a Bishop or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
had beene both unnecessary and absurd: unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
because the higher degree includes the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
eminently, though not formally; and absurd to
descend lower, that after they had been Apostolically
or Evangelically employed in taking care of all the
Churches, they should be ordained to a worke which
should so limit them, as to make them lesse usefull to
the Church of God.</p>
               <p>But, saith he, <hi>all this discourse is needlesse, whether
Timothy or Titus were Evangelists or no; sure we are, here
they stand for persons charged with those offices and cares
which are delivered to the ordinary Church-governours in
all succeeding generations:</hi> Here first you give us no
ground of your surenesse, nor can give us any other
then what may be said of the Apostles, <hi>for they also
stand as persons charged, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, it is true the
substance of those cares and offices, which belong to
Apostles and Evangelists is transmitted to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Church-governours, as farre as is necessary for
the edification of the Church, else the Lord had not
sufficiently provided for his Church: all the question
is, whether these Church-governours are by way of
Aristocracy the common Councell of Presbyters, or by
way of Monarchy Diocesan Bishops? Now unlesse
you prove that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were ordinary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
(or as Doctor <hi>Hall</hi> cals them, Diocesan Bishops) to
whom as to individuall persons such care and offices
were individually intrusted, you will never out of
<hi>Timothy and Titus</hi> defend Diocesan Bishops. Thirdly,
though the substance of these cares and offices were
to be transmitted to ordinary Church-governours,



<pb n="130" facs="tcp:33475:73"/>
yet they are not transmitted in that eminency or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
height, in which they were in the Apostles and
Evangelists: an Apostle where ever he lived might
governe and command all Evangelists, all Presbyters
&amp;c. an Evangelist might governe all Presbyters, &amp;c.
but no Presbyter or Bishop might command others,
onely the common Councel of Presbyters may charge
any or many Presbyters, as occasion shall require. In
a word, these ordinary Church-governours succeed
the extraordinary officers, not in the same line and
degree, as one brother dying, another succeeds him
in the inheritance; but as men of an other order, and
in a different line. Let the Remonstrant therefore
<hi>take Timothy and Titus as he findes them,</hi> that is, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
men of extraordinary dignity and authority in
the Church of Christ: Let him <hi>with his first confidence
maintaine that our Bishops challenge no other spirituall
power then was delegated to them.</hi> We shall upon better
grounds maintaine with better confidence, that if
they chalenge the same, they ought to be disclaimed
for usurpers.</p>
               <p>But much more challenging such a power as was
never exercised by <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> as we demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
in our former answer in severall instances;
which are so commonly knowne as our Remonstrant
is ashamed to deny them: onely plaies them off, partly
with his old shift, <hi>the abuse of the person, not of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
But we beseech you sir, tell us whether these
persons doe not perpetrate these abuses (though by
their owne vice, yet) by vertue of their place and
Callings. Partly by retorting questions upon us; <hi>when,
or where did our Bishops challenge to ordaine alone; or to



<pb n="131" facs="tcp:33475:73"/>
governe alone?</hi> we have shewed you when and where
already, <hi>when or where did our Bishops challenge power to
passe a rough and unbeseeming rebuke upon an Elder?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 102.</note> Sure
your owne conscience can tell that hath taught you
to apply that to an Elder in office which we onely
spake (in Scripture phrase) of an Elder in generall. It
was your guilt, not our ignorance that turned it to an
Elder in office. <hi>Where did,</hi> say you, <hi>our Bishops give Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to Chancellors, Commissaries, &amp;c. to rayle upon
Presbyters; to accuse them without just ground, &amp;c.</hi> where
have not Chancellors done so? and what power have
they but by Bishops Commission to meddle with any
thing in Church affaires? And where is the Bishop
that hath forbid it them? <hi>Qui non prohibet facit.</hi> Onely
there is one practice of our Bishops he is something
more laborious to justifie: That is, their casting out
unconforming brethren, commonly knowne in their
Court language by the name of schismatickes and
heretickes, which <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> never did, nor
had any such power delegated to them; heretickes
indeed the Apostles gave them power to reject: but
wee had hoped the refusall of the use of a ceremony
should never have beene equalized in the punishment
either to heresie or schisme. But the Remonstrant
hath found Scripture for it. <hi>Loth not the Apostle wish
that they were cut off that trouble you?</hi> but sure it is one
thing to wish men cut off by God, and another thing
to cut them off by the censure of the Church. Besides
this was written to the Galatians; and they that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
them, were such as maintained doctrines against
the foundation, <hi>i.</hi> Justification by workes of the Law,
&amp;c. which we thinke are very neere of kinne to here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes.



<pb n="132" facs="tcp:33475:74"/>
I am sure farre above the crime of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants
<hi>unconforming brethren,</hi> who are unsetled in
points of a meane difference, (which their usuall
language knowes by no better termes then of schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes
and factious) yet even such have fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the heaviest censures of suspension, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
deprivation, &amp;c. which the Remonstrant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to deny would justifie, which when he shall be
able to doe, he may do something towards the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing
of Bishops. But in the meane time let him not
say they are our owne ill raised suggestions, but their
owne ill assumed and worse mannaged authority,
that makes them feare to be disclaimed as usurpers.</p>
               <p>The second Scripture ground which the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant
is ambitious to draw in for the support of his
Episcopall cause, is the instance of the Angels of the
seven Churches, which because it is <hi>locus</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and cried up as <hi>argumentum verè Achilleum,</hi> we did
on purpose inlarge our selves about it. And for our
paines the Remonstrant, as if all learning and acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
were lockt up in his breast (<hi>Narcissus</hi> like in love
with his owne shadow) professeth <hi>that this peece of the
taske fell unhappily upon some dull and tedious hand, &amp;c.</hi>
Which if it be so,<note place="margin">Page 103.</note> it will redound the more to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants
discredit, when it shall appeare that he is
so shamefully foiled and wounded by so dull an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary.
He objects <hi>Colemorts oft sod,</hi> when he cannot
but know that the whole substance of his owne booke
is borrowed from Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> and Doctor <hi>Downham.</hi>
And that there is nothing in this discourse about the
Angels, but either it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of if <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
But before we come to answer our Remonstrants par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,



<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33475:74"/>
we will premise something in generall about
these <hi>Asian</hi> Angels.</p>
               <p>It may seeme strange that the defenders of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
lay so much weight of argument upon the word
or appellation of <hi>Angell;</hi> which themselves know to
be a title not impropriated to the chiefe Ministers of
the Church, but common to all that bring the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the Gospell; yea to all the messengers of the
Lord of Hosts. We conceive there are 2. maine reasons
that induce them to insist so much on this: First they
finde it the most easie way of avoyding the dint of all
the Arguments brought against them out of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the Acts and Epistles, by placing one above
the rest of the Presbyters in the period of the Apostles
times. And so finding in the Revelation (which was
written the last of all the parts of the Scripture, except
peradventure the Gospell written by the same penne)
an expression which may seeme to favour their cause,
they improve it to the utmost. Partly because here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they evade all our arguments which we bring out
of the Scripture. Doe we prove out of the 20. of <hi>Acts,</hi>
Presbyters and Bishops to be all one? Doe we prove
the Bishops described in <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to be one
and the same in name and office with a Presbyter?
Doe we prove that their Churches were all governed
<hi>Communi Consilio Presbyterorum?</hi> All shall be granted
us, and yet the Divine right of Episcopacy be still
held up by this sleight, by telling us, that before the
Apostles left the earth they made over their authority
to some prime men. Demand where this is extant?
The Angels of the seven Churches are pleaded pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.
And partly because we have no other Scripture



<pb n="134" facs="tcp:33475:75"/>
of latter inspiration and edition, whereby to prove
the contrary.</p>
               <p>Another inducement is, because the writers neere
the Apostles times make frequent mention of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and as they would have us beleeve, some waies
distinguished from a Presbyter. Some of them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
the very men that were the Angels of these
Churches; as <hi>Polycarpus</hi> of <hi>Smyrna</hi> &amp; <hi>Ignatius</hi> (who is
said to have beene martyred within twelve yeeres
after the Revelation was written,) wrote letters to
the severall Churches, wherein he mentioneth their
Bishops distinct from their Presbyters.<note place="margin">Episc. by Di. Right, 1 pt. 35.</note> Now (saith
the author of <hi>Episcopacy by divine right</hi>) the Apostles
immediate <hi>successors could best tell what they next before
them did. Who can better tell a mans pace then he that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
him close at heeles?</hi> And this hath so plausib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e a
shew, that all are condemned as blind, or wilfull, who
will either doubt that Episcopacy was of Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
institution, or thinke that the Church of Christ,
should in so short a time deviate from the institution
of the Apostles. But now how insufficient a ground
this is for the raising up of so mighty a Fabricke as
Episcopacy by Divine right, or Apostolicall institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wee desire the Reader to judge by that that
followes.</p>
               <p>First, the thing they lay as their foundation is a
meere metaphoricall word, and such as is ordinarily
applied to Presbyters in common.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Penman of those seven Epistles did
never in them nor in any of his other writings so much
as use the name of Bishop, he names Presbyters fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently;
especially in this booke, yea where he would



<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33475:75"/>
set out the office of those that are neerest to the throne
of Christ in his Church, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. And whereas in Saint
<hi>Iohns</hi> daies some new expressions were used in the
Christian Church, which were not in Scripture: As
the Christian Sabbath began to be called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and Christ himselfe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now both these are
found in the writings of S. <hi>Iohn;</hi> and it is strange to us
that the Apostle should mention a new phrase, and
not mention a new office erected in the Church, as you
would make us beleeve.</p>
               <p>Neither thirdly, in any of his writings the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
of superiority of one Presbyter over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
save onely where he names <hi>Diotrephes</hi> as one am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiously
affecting such a Primacy. Nor is there any
one word in these Epistles whence an Episcopall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
may be collected. So that did not the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
that lived soone after make the argument
plausible, it would appeare ridiculous. But alas the
suffrage of all the writers in the world is infinitely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to command an Act of Divine faith without
which divine right cannot be apprehended.</p>
               <p>Suppose we were as verily perswaded that <hi>Ignatius</hi>
wrote the Epistles which goe under his name (which
yet we have just cause to doubt of, as knowing that
many learned men reject a great part of them, and
some all) as we can be perswaded that <hi>Tully</hi> wrote his:
All this can perswade no further that the Apostles
ordained and appointed Bishops as their successors,
but onely by a humane faith: but neither is that so.
The most immediate and unquestionable successors
of the Apostles give cleare evidence to the contrary.

And in that Epistle Bishops and Presbyters are all one,
as appeares by what followes: The occasion of that
Epistle seemes to be a new sedition raysed by the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>
against their Presbyters, page 57. 58. (not as
Bishop <hi>Hall</hi> saies, <hi>the continuation of the schismes amongst
them in the Apostles daies:) Clemens</hi> to remove their
present sedition tels them how God hath alwaies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
severall orders in his Church, which must
not be confounded; first, telling them how it was in
the Jewish Church; then for the times of the Gospell,
tels them, that Christ sent his Apostles through Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and Cities, <hi>in which they constituted the first fruits</hi>
(or the chiefe of them) <hi>unto Bishops and Deacons, for
them who should beleeve afterward, p.</hi> 54. 55.</p>
               <p>Those whom hee calls there Bishops afterwards
throughout the Epistle he cals Presbyters, pa. 58, 62,
69. All which places doe evidently convince that in
<hi>Clement</hi> his judgement, the Apostle appointed but
two officers (that is Bishops and Deacons) to bring
men to beleeve: Because when he had reckoned up
three orders appointed by God among the Jewes,
High-priests, Priests, and Levites, comming to recite
orders appointed by the Apostles under the Gospell,
hee doth mention onely Bishops and Deacons: and
those Bishops which at first he opposeth to Deacons,
ever after he cals Presbyters. And here we cannot but
wonder at the strange boldnesse of the author of <hi>Epis.
by divine right,</hi> who hath endevoured <hi>to wire-draw</hi>
this Author (so much magnified by him) to maintaine



<pb n="137" facs="tcp:33475:76"/>
his Prelaticall Episcopacy: and that both by <hi>foysting</hi>
in the word <hi>withall</hi> into this translation which is not
in the Text, that the Reader might be seduced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that the offices of Episcopacy and Presbytery
were two different offices. And also by willingly
misunderstanding <hi>Clement</hi> his phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) he would have us
understand Episcopacy as distinct from Presbyterie:
whereas the whole series of the Epistle evidently
proves that the word <hi>Episcopus &amp; Presbyter</hi> are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
And so also by the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) hee would
have us to understand that the contention then in
<hi>Corinth</hi> was only about the name: whereas it appeares
by the Epistle it selfe, that the controversie was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the name, but dignity of <hi>Episcopacy:</hi> for it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the deposition of their godly Presbyters, p. 57, 58.
And the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is thus interpreted by <hi>Beza Eph. 1.

this we see that the most genuine and neerest successor
of the Apostles knew no such difference.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it is worth our observation, that the same wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
who (as they say) testifie that these 7. Angels were
in a superiour degree to Presbyters, do likewise affirm
that the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> sate many yeeres B. of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
and was the Metropolitan of all <hi>Asia,</hi> in which we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Remonstrant will allow his readers a liberty
of beleeving him, and allow us a liberty to tell him
that D <hi>Whitakers</hi> saith, <hi>Patres cum Iacobum Episcopum

               </p>
               <p>Now we returne to our Remonstrant. Our answer
to his objection from the Angels was: That the word
<hi>Angell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> is to be taken <hi>collectively,</hi> not <hi>individually,</hi>
which he cals, <hi>pro more suo, a shift and a conceit which
no wise man can ever beleeve.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 104.</note> And yet he could not but
take notice that we alleaged <hi>Austin, Gregory, Fulke, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,
Fox, Brightman, Mede,</hi> and divers others for this
interpretation: which will make the world to accuse
him for want of wisdome, for calling the wisedome of
such men into question. Before he addresseth himself
to answer our reasons, he propounds two queres.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If the interest be common and equally appertaining to
all, why should one be singled out above the rest?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 104.</note> A very
<hi>dull</hi> question, which is indeed a very begging of the
cause. For the question in agitation is, whether when
Christ writes to the 7. Angels, he meant to single out
7. <hi>individuall</hi> persons above the rest, or else writes to
the 7. Angels <hi>collectively</hi> meaning all the <hi>Angels</hi> that
were in all the Churches.</p>
               <p>The second question is as <hi>dull</hi> as the first. <hi>If you will
yeeld the person to be such as had more then others, a right
in the administration of all, it is that weseeke for.</hi> But he
knew we would not yield it. And therefore we may
justly use his owne words, <hi>that those questions are tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and might well have beene spared.</hi> And so also
the instances <hi>of a letter indorsed from the Lords of



<pb n="139" facs="tcp:33475:77"/>
the Councell to the Bishop of Durham, concerning some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of the whole Clergy of his Diocesse:</hi> No man will
deny but that the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> is an individuall
Bishop. This example supposeth the Angell about
whom we dispute to be meant individually, which
you know is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> betweene you and us. <hi>Quid
haec ad Rhombum?</hi> We will give you instances more
suitable to the purpose. Suppose one in Christs time,
or his Apostles had indorsed a letter to the Chiefe-priest
concerning the affaires of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and
another letter to the chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue
concerning the affaires of the Synagogue, and another
letter to the Captaine of the Temple, concerning the
businesse of the Temple; could any man imagine but
that these indorsments must necessarily be understood
<hi>collectively?</hi> considering there were more Chiefe-priests
then one in <hi>Ierusalem, Luke</hi> 22. 4. and more
chiefe Rulers of the Synagogue then one, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 18.
compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 8. 17. And more Captaines of
the Temple then one, <hi>Acts</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. compared with <hi>Luke</hi>

                  </gap>2. 4. and so also semblably more Angels and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
in the seven Churches then seven. But stay sir,
we hope you are not of opinion, that any of your <hi>Asian
Bishops</hi> had as much spirituall and temporall power
as the Lord Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and the Lord Bishop
and Palatine of <hi>Durham, Cave dixeris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At last you come to our proofes, which you scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingly
call <hi>invincible.</hi> You should have done better to
have called them <hi>irrefragable,</hi> like your good friends
<hi>irrefragable propositions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our first argument is drawne from the Epistle to

in Thyatira.</hi> Here is a plaine distinction betweene the
<hi>Governours,</hi> and the <hi>governed.</hi> And the <hi>Governours</hi> in
the plurall number; which apparently proves that
the Angell is <hi>collective.</hi> The Remonstrant hath no
way to put this off,<note place="margin">Page 105.</note> but by a <hi>pittifull shift</hi> to use his
owne words. He tels us he hath found <hi>a better coppy;</hi>
which is a very unhappy and unbecoming expression,
apt to make ignorant people doubt of the originall
text, and so in time rather to deny the Divinity of the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> then <hi>of Episcopacy.</hi> But this better coppy is
but lately searcht into, for we finde that Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi>
in his <hi>Episcopacy by Divine right,</hi> reads it as we doe. But
<hi>I say unto you, and the rest in Thyatira.</hi> But what is this
better Coppy? <hi>It is a Manuscript written by the hand of
Teela;</hi> which if it be no truer then <hi>Itinerarium Pauli &amp;
Teclae,</hi> it will have little credit among the Learned.
But that which makes you to magnifie it the more, is
that doughty argument which it helped you to against

any protestant writer had the wit to bring this
text against the papists to prove the lawfulnesse of
Priests marriages; no not Doctor <hi>Hall</hi> himselfe in his
defence of the married Clergy. Give us leave here to
use your owne words, page 108. <hi>Forbeare Reader if
you can, to smile at this curious subtilty, what Cabalisme
have we here? judge Reader what to expect of so deepe
speculations.</hi> And also to repeate what you say, page
110. <hi>If you please your selfe with this new subtilty it is well
from us you have no cause to expect an answer: it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
draw our assent, nor merit our confutation.</hi> We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it to be as true that <hi>Iezebel</hi> was the wife of the
Bishop of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> as that <hi>Tecla</hi> was the wife of <hi>Paul.</hi>
But to returne to the former text: Let any judicious
reader survey the latter part of the 23. verse (which is
the verse before that out of which we bring our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
there he shall finde Christ speaking to the Church
of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> saith: <hi>And I will give to every one of you</hi> (in
the plurall number.) And then followes, <hi>But I say unto
you and the rest in Thyatira.</hi> And he will not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esse
that though the 24. verse should faile, yet the
23. would prove the same thing, as effectually as the
24. but also will grant that from the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>erence it is
evident that the old copies are better then that which
this Remonstrant cals the better coppy of <hi>Tecla.</hi> But
besides this text, let the Reader cast his eye upon what
Christ saith to the Angell of the Church of <hi>Smyrna,
Revel. 2. 10. feare none of those things which thou shalt
suffer, behold the divell shall cast some of you into prison,</hi>
(of you in the plurall number:) <hi>that yee may be tryed</hi>
(yee in the plurall number) <hi>and you</hi> (in the plurall
againe) <hi>shall have tribulation ten daies; be thou faithfull

unto the death, and I will give thee a Crowne of life.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
here how our Saviour Christ changeth the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
<hi>Be thou faithfull. And the divell shall cast some of you,
&amp;c.</hi> to shew unto us, that the <hi>Angell</hi> is not meant of
one singular person, but of all the whole company of
Presbyters that were in <hi>Smyrna.</hi> So also Christ wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the Angell of the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> saith,
verse 13. in the beginning of the verse, <hi>I know thy
workes,</hi> in the singular number; but in the latter end,
<hi>who was slaine among you,</hi> in the plurall number. We
expect that the Remonstrant will when best at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
bring tidings of <hi>another better coppy,</hi> to avoyd the
dint of these texts that doe as we thinke demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
prove the thing in question.</p>
               <p>Our second argument is drawne from the like phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
even in this very booke of the Revelation, where
it is usuall to expresse a company under one singular
person; as the civill state of <hi>Rome,</hi> as opposite to
Christ, is called a beast with ten hornes: and the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
state Antichristian, is called, the whore of
Babylon.<note place="margin">Page 106.</note> To which you answer. 1. <hi>That if it be thus
in visions and Emblematicall representations, must it needs
be so in plaine narrations?</hi> But good sir consider, this
very thing we are about was seene by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>a
vision:</hi> and you your selfe confesse in the next page,
that the word <hi>Angell</hi> is <hi>metaphoricall. How then is it a
plaine narration?</hi> Secondly, you say <hi>because it is so in one
phrase of speech, must it be so in all?</hi> We answer,<note place="margin">Page 106.</note> that this
argument was not brought to prove that the word
<hi>Angell</hi> must needs be taken <hi>collectively,</hi> but onely that it
might be so taken, and that it was the likeliest inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
especially considering what was added out



<pb n="143" facs="tcp:33475:79"/>
of Master <hi>Mede</hi> (who was better skilled in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Revelation then your selfe) that the
word <hi>Angell</hi> is commonly (if not alwaies) in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
taken <hi>collectively.</hi> Thus the seven Angels that
blew the seven trumpets, and the seven Angels that
poured out the seven vials, are not literally to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but Synecdochically, you reply. <hi>Perhaps so, but
then the Synecdoche lies in the seven, not in the Angels,</hi> and
so you grant <hi>the word Angell to be metaphoricall, but we
are never a whit the neerer to our imagined Synecdoche.</hi>
But this is but a meere fallacy. Let but the reader ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
till we make good our fourth reason, and then
we shall see our imagined Synecdoche made reall.
For the present it is sufficient, that it is the ordinary
custome of the holy Ghost in the Revelation, by
Angell to meane Angels; by seven Angels, not seven
individually, but collectively. But whether the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche
be in the word seven, or in the word Angel,
that is nothing to the purpose in hand.</p>
               <p>Our third argument, is drawne from the word <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,</hi>
which is a common name to all the Ministers and
messengers, &amp;c. And surely had Christ intended to
point out some one individuall person by the <hi>Angell,</hi>
he would have used some distinguishing name to set
him out by: he would have called him <hi>Rector,</hi> or <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,</hi>
or <hi>Superintendent;</hi> but calling him by a name
common to all Ministers, why should we thinke that
there should be any thing spoken to him that doth not
asmuch concerne all the rest who are Angels as well
as he? All <hi>that</hi> you answer is, <hi>that Christ knew this well
enough, and if he had meant it, had it not beene as easie to
have mentioned many as one?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 107.</note> But here wee humbly



<pb n="144" facs="tcp:33475:80"/>
desire the Reader to consider two things. 1. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonablenesse
of this answer: we brought three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why Christ when he meant divers Angels, spake
in the singular number <hi>Angell,</hi> not <hi>Angels.</hi> These rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
the Remonstrant passeth over with a scorne, (the
commonest, safest, surest way of answering, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant
hath:) and yet he demands page 104. <hi>why
should one be singled ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> above all, if the interest be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?</hi>
And here, <hi>why doth not Christ say to the Angels?</hi>
But let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im first answer our <hi>Therefores,</hi> and wee will
quickly answer his <hi>Wherefores.</hi> Secondly, how justly
we may retort this answer upon the Remonstrant and
say, If Christ had meant by the seven <hi>Angels</hi> seven <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>
how easie had it beene for him to have written
to the <hi>Bishop of Ephesus</hi> (as he was lately called at the
Spittle by a Bishop) to the <hi>Bish. of Smyrna,</hi> instead of the
Angell of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and the Angell of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> But this
Christ doth not doe, and not onely so, but Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>
also in all his bookes makes not any mention of the
name Bishop. And therefore it seemeth strange to us
that Episcopacy by divine right should be fetched out
of his writings. I but saith the Remonstrant,<note place="margin">Page 107.</note> it is

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>And therefore the denoted person must
needs be singular. For surely you cannot say that all the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters

they were all one Angell <hi>collectively,</hi> though not <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually</hi>
And we can shew you where Christ speaketh
in the singular number, and joyneth the Article with
it also, and yet meaneth Synecdochically more, for
one, as <hi>Iohn 4. 37. Iohn</hi> 10. 11. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which must be all meant indefinitely,
not individually. You suppose againe, that if that



<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33475:80"/>
Christ had said, <hi>To the Starre of Ephesus, no body would
have construed it but of one eminent person.</hi> But herein
also you are much mistaken, for the word <hi>Starre</hi> is as
common a name to all Ministers as the word <hi>Angell,</hi>
as we have shewed in our answer.</p>
               <p>The fourth argument you account <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and
in a proud scorne <hi>passe it over with a jeere.</hi> But you will
see in the conclusion you your selfe to be the <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
caput,</hi> not we. Our argument stands thus: Our
Saviour saith, <hi>The seven Candlestickes which thou sawest
are the seven Churches:</hi> but he doth not say, <hi>the seven
starres are the seven Angels of the same Churches.</hi> But the
<hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>seven Churches</hi> omitting not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mystery the number of the Angels, least wee
should understand by Angell one Minister a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and not a company.<note place="margin">Page 108.</note> To omit your scoffes,
you answer it is plaine that <hi>every Church hath his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
mentioned, and there being seven Chruches, how
many Angels (I beseech you) are there?</hi> This answer
is as easily blowne away, as the wind blowes away
chaffe. It is true, every Church hath his Angell men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
but whether Angell individually or Angell
collectively, that is still the question, and therefore for
ought you say, though there were but seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
there might be seven, and seven times seven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in those Churches. But you intimate that Christ
saith, <hi>the 7. starres,</hi> though he doth not say the seven
Angels. Now here give us leave to put our Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant
in mind of the <hi>imagined Syneedoche.</hi> For we just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceive that these words, <hi>The seven Starres are the
Angels,</hi> are figurative, and that there are two figures
in them, a metaphor in the word Starre and Angell,



<pb n="146" facs="tcp:33475:81"/>
and a Synecdoche in the word seven. For we doe not
thinke that the seven Starres signifie seven individuall
Angels, for then indeed the reader might have justly
smiled at our curious speculation, but we thinke them
to be taken collectively. Thus <hi>Revil. 8. 2. Iohn saw se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Angels which stood before God,</hi> by which seven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> doth not understand seven indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall
Angels, but by a Synecdoche all the Angels.
For there are no seven particular Angels that doe
stand before God, but all doe so, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. The words
of Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> are these,<note place="margin">Censura lib. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oryph. prael. 64.</note> 
                  <hi>Quare cum commune sit

And now let the Reader judge whether this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be so ridiculous as the mocking Remonstrant
would make it.</p>
               <p>But that you may see how dull the answerer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
is whilst he accuseth others of <hi>dulnesse</hi> let us a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
consider what <hi>pittifull shifts</hi> he useth in his answer
to our last reason.</p>
               <p>Our last argument is; Though but one <hi>Angell</hi> be
mentioned in the forefront, yet it is evident the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
themselves are dedicated to all the Angels and
Ministers in every Church, and to the Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
and if unto the whole Church, much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Presbyters of that Church. To this you answer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By granting the argument which is to grant the



<pb n="147" facs="tcp:33475:81"/>
cause, as will appeare to any judicious Reader: For
the reason doth not onely say that the whole Church
is concerned in the Epistles, and spoken unto in them,
but that they are dedicated to all the Ministers as well
as one, &amp; to all the Churches as well as to the Angels,
as appeares <hi>Reuel. 1. 11. send it to the seven Churches:</hi>
and also by the Epiphonema of every Epistle, <hi>he that
hath an eare to heare, let him heare what the Spirit saith
to the Churches,</hi> not onely <hi>concerning</hi> the Churches, but
<hi>to the</hi> Churches. But then you argue secondly,<note place="margin">Page 109.</note> 
                  <hi>if every
Epistle be written to all the Churches, then we must say that
every of these seven Angels must be the whole company of all
the seven Churches, which were a foule nonsence.</hi> But you
must understand that though every Epistle be written
to all the Churches, yet not <hi>eodem modo.</hi> As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
the Epistle to <hi>Ephesus</hi> was written <hi>primariò, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie
&amp; formaliter</hi> to the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but to the
other Churches onely, <hi>reflèxive &amp; per modum exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli.</hi>
And therefore we returne your nonsence upon
your selfe. For we doe not confound the <hi>Angels and
the Churches</hi> (we know there is a distinction betweene
the Starres and the Candlestickes) but we affirme that
the Epistles are written to the <hi>Churches</hi> as well as to
the <hi>Angels,</hi> and to all the Angels as well as to any one.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Page 109.</note> you say <hi>we might have saved the labour both
of Ausbertus and the rest of our Authours, and our owne.</hi>
But surely unlesse you meant to yeeld the cause, you
would never say so. For we proved out of <hi>Ausbertus,</hi>
that according to his judgement, by <hi>Angell</hi> is meant
the <hi>whole Church.</hi> And out of <hi>Perkins, Brightman, Fulke,
Fox, Austin, Gregory, Primasius, Hamo, Beda, Richard,
Thomas,</hi> &amp;c. That the word <hi>Angell</hi> is to be taken not



<pb n="148" facs="tcp:33475:82"/>
                  <hi>individually,</hi> but <hi>collectively.</hi> And further we shewed
that in these seven Epistles where one person is singled
out and spoken unto in particular, either by way of
praise or dispraise; that such places are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of one individuall person, but of the whole
company of the Ministers in all things equall with
that our Angell: which are proved by such reasons,
which because you knew not how to answer, you say
<hi>we might have saved our labour;</hi> and in that indeed we
should have saved your credit, but have done the
cause much prejudice.</p>
               <p>Lastly, you say <hi>satis Magisterialiter</hi> (for you prove it
not) <hi>That there are such particularities both of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
and exceptions in the body of the severall Epistles
as cannot but have relation to those severall overseers to
whom they were indorsed, as you have elsewhere specified.</hi>
But whom <hi>you</hi> are, and where this is specified you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to tell us.<note place="margin">Page 110.</note> Onely you put us to answer: <hi>Had all
the Presbyters of Ephesus lost their first love? Had each of
them tried the false Apostles? Had all those of Sardis a
name to live and were dead? Were all the Laodicean Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of one temper?</hi> You say, <hi>no doubt</hi> it was otherwise.
But this is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. We say, No doubt that not onely
the Presbyters of <hi>Ephesus, Sardis, Laodicea,</hi> but that the
whole Church had lost their first love, and were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
lukewarme, and had a name to live and were
dead, (wee say all that is <hi>genera singulorum,</hi> not
<hi>singula generum</hi>) and this wee prove. Because the
punishment threatned by Christ is threatned
not onely against that one <hi>Angell,</hi> but against all
the Church, <hi>Reuel. 2. 5. I will remove thy Candlesticke.
Revel.</hi> 2. 16. 24. Now we have no warrant in the word



<pb n="149" facs="tcp:33475:82"/>
of God to thinke that God would remove his Gospell
from a Church, because one Angell in that Church
hath lost his first love, when all the other, and the
whole Church also are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervent and zealous in their
love to Christ. Or that God would spue out a whole
Church out of his mouth, for the lukewarmenesse of
one man, when the Church it selfe and all the other
Ministers are zealous. This is the reason that makes
us beleeve that though one <hi>Angell</hi> be sometimes spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
unto in particular, yet it must necessarily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in a collective sence, not in an individuall
sence, which we hinted in our answer. But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant
comes with his <hi>Index expurgatorius,</hi> and
answereth us onely with a <hi>Deleatur.</hi> And thus he serves
us also in the following reasons, why Christ did not
write <hi>To the Angels</hi> in the plurall number; but <hi>To the
Angell</hi> in the singular. And this he doth throughout
the whole booke, passing by unanswered those things
which are most materiall. <hi>Vas vitreum lambens, pultem
non attingens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for that tedious discourse that followeth in
foure leaves (about our overliberall concession, that,
suppose the word <hi>Angell</hi> be meant <hi>Individually,</hi> yet it
made nothing for the upholding of a Dioce san Bishop
with sole power of ordination, and jurisdiction, as a
distinct order superiour to Presbyters) we will be
very briefe in our answer to it, to prevent surfet, and
because it is more then we need have yeelded, and
also because so little is said of it to the purpose by
this Remonstrant. And here let the Reader observe:
1. That of the foure Authors cited in the upholding
of the <hi>individuall</hi> Angel, Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> is falsely alleged,



<pb n="150" facs="tcp:33475:83"/>
and the other three, Master <hi>Beza,</hi> Doctor <hi>Raynolds</hi> and
<hi>Pareus,</hi> though they interpret the word <hi>Angell</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
for one singular person, yet we are sure none of them
held Episcopacy by divine right. For D. <hi>Raynolds</hi> his
letters to S. <hi>Francis Knowles</hi> now in print will witnesse:
and for <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Pareus,</hi> it is well knowne that they
were <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> We expected many of the ancient
Fathers to make good this interpretation; but we see
he is beholding to those for it who are none of the lest
enemies to the <hi>Hierarchall preeminency,</hi> and therefore
we may be the more secure that no great prejudice
can come to our cause by this interpretation, if taken
in the sence of these Authors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the great question is: what makes this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
for a <hi>Diocesan Bishop,</hi> with sole power of
<hi>ordination</hi> and <hi>jurisdiction,</hi> as a distinct <hi>order</hi> above
<hi>Presbyters?</hi> But the Remonstrant cunningly conceales
halfe the question, and answers, <hi>much every way.</hi> And
why so? <hi>Because if there were many Angels in each Church,
and yet but one singled out and called The Angel of that
Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 111.</note> 
                  <hi>it must needs follow that there was a superiority, and
inequality.</hi> But what is this to the question in hand?
The thing to be proved is, not onely that this Angell
had a <hi>superiority,</hi> but a <hi>superiority of jurisdiction</hi> over
his fellow Angels; but of this <hi>altum silentium.</hi> Doctor
<hi>Reynolds</hi> will tell you that this was onely a superiority
of order; and that all jurisdiction was exercised in
common. <hi>Beza</hi> will tell you, that this Angell was
onely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and that he was <hi>Angelus Praeses,</hi> not <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus
Princeps.</hi> And that he was <hi>Praeses mutabilis,</hi> and
<hi>ambulatorius,</hi> just as a <hi>Moderator</hi> in an <hi>assembly,</hi> or as the
<hi>Speaker</hi> in the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> which is onely during



<pb n="151" facs="tcp:33475:83"/>
the Parliament. Both which interpretations may
well stand with the <hi>superiority</hi> and <hi>inequality</hi> you
speake of.</p>
               <p>Our first argument to prove that though the word
<hi>Angel</hi> be taken <hi>individually,</hi> that yet nothing will hence
follow to uphold a Diocesan Bishop with sole power
of jurisdiction as a distinct order Superior to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
was, because it was never yet, nor never will be
proved that these Angels were Diocesan Bishops;
considering that parishes were not so numerous as to
be divided into Diocesses in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> daies. And
the seven Starres are sayd to be fixed in their seven
Candlestickes, not one Star over divers Candlesticks.
And <hi>Tindall</hi> together with the old translation calls
them seven congregations. And because we read that
at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that was one of those Candlestickes, there
was but one flock, for the answer of all which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
a learned discourse to prove that the seven
Churches were Diocesan, and so consequently the
Angels Diocesan Angels. But the Remonstrant
baulkes his worke as too great for his shoulders, and
instead of solid Divinity turnes criticke, and playes
upon words and syllables <hi>Domitian</hi> like, catching at
flies, when he should have beene busied about greater
matters.</p>
               <p>First, he tels, us, <hi>That if Parishes were not united into
Diocesses</hi> (or were not so many as to be divided into
Diocesses which we thinke all one notwithstanding
your parenthesis) <hi>in Saint Iohns daies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 111, 112.</note> 
                  <hi>and therefore no
Diocesan Bishop; by the same reason we may as well argue,
that there were no parochiall Bishops neither, since that
then no parishes were as yet distinguished.</hi> Which we



<pb n="152" facs="tcp:33475:84"/>
grant to be very true. But if there were no Parochiall
Bishops in the Apostles daies, much lesse Diocesan. The
Apostolicall Bishops were Bishops of one Church, and
not of one parish (as we meane by parish) till many
yeeres after. But not to quarrell at the word parish, or
diocesse; let but the Remonstrant shewe us that these
Angels were Bishops over divers setled Churches, or
divers fixed congregations, <hi>&amp; nobis erit alter Apollo.</hi>
For our parts we are sure that at first the number of
beleevers, even in the greatest Cities, were so few, as
that they might well meete <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in one and the
same place; and these were called the Church of the
City, and therefore to ordaine Elders <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are all one in Scripture. And it cannot be
demonstratively proved that they became so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in the Apostles daies in any great City, so as that
they could not meet in one and the same place. But
yet we confesse that it is very probable that it was so
in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> if you compare <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. 4. 4. 5. 14. And
whether it was so also in these severall <hi>Asian Churches</hi>
we know not; but however, this is agreed upon on
all parts. That beleevers in great Cities were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into set and fixed congregations or parishes till
long after the Apostles daies. And that therefore if
when they multiplied, they had divers meeting pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that yet notwithstanding these meeting places
were frequented promiscuously, and indistinctly, and
were taught and governed by all the Presbyters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously
and in common, and were all called but
one Church, as is evident in <hi>Hierusalem, Act. 8. 1. Act.</hi> 15.
6. 22. 16. 4. 21. 18.</p>
               <p>So also in these seven Churches, where the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers



<pb n="153" facs="tcp:33475:84"/>
of every City are called but one Church, and
were governed in common by divers Angels, or
Presbyters; as we see plainely proved in the
Church of <hi>Ephesus, Acts</hi> 20. 28. Hen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that there were no sole-ruling Bishops, nor
one Bishop over divers Churches, or set Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> daies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, according to his wonted language,<note place="margin">Page 112.</note> he
tels us of <hi>making Bulls and Solecismes,</hi> because wee
say <hi>that the seven Starres are said to be fixed in their
seven Candlestickes, whereas these Starres are said to
be in the right hand of Christ,</hi> as if these two were
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Know sir, That in regard of their <hi>protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
they are said to be in Christs right hand, but in
regard of their <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>unction</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> they may be
truely said to be fixed in their seven Candlestickes.
But instead of picking quarrels at words, you
should have done well (if you could) to prove
that these Candlestickes were diocesan Churches.
We say each Starre had its Candlesticke, not one
Starre over divers. And wee thinke that this
Candlesticke was but one particular Church,
or one set Congregation (though happily when
they multiplyed, they might meete indistinctly in
divers, under divers Angels equally governing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
For this we alledged <hi>Obiter Tindals</hi> translating the
seven Churches seven Congregations. All you
answer is,<note place="margin">Page 113</note> onely to shew that in <hi>other places of the
Scripture by Congregation in Tindals sence cannot be
meant a parishionall meeting.</hi> But what if it be not
so in other places, how doe you make it appeare



<pb n="154" facs="tcp:33475:85"/>
that it is not so in this place? We are sure it is so
taken in twenty other places of <hi>Tindals</hi> translation,
and may very properly be taken here also. We
alledge also, that in <hi>Ephesus</hi> which was one of these
Candlestickes, there was but one flocke. You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<hi>whether this flocke were Nationall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 114.</note> 
                  <hi>Provinciall,
or Diocesan?</hi> And why doe you not demand whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were not <hi>Oecumenicall</hi> also? that so the
Pope may in time come to challenge his flocke
<hi>universall.</hi> But you are sure, you say, that <hi>this
flocke was not a parochiall flocke,</hi> because it cannot
be proved, that <hi>all the Elders to whom Paul spake, were
onely belonging to Ephesus.</hi> But can this Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
prove that there were more Elders or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
then those of <hi>Ephesus?</hi> This is to answer
<hi>Socratically,</hi> and in answering not to answer. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it is not so much materiall. You your selfe
confesse that the Elders or Bishops of <hi>Ephesus</hi> had
but one flocke. And if divers Bishops were over
one flocke in the Apostles daies, where is your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall
Bishops over divers flockes in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
daies?</p>
               <p>Our second argument is also drawne from the
Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which was one of the seven
Candlestickes, in which we are sure in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
daies there were many Angels, and those called
Bishops, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. And to one of those in all
likelyhood was the Epistle to <hi>Ephesus</hi> directed, if
the direction be meant individually. But yet wee
read not a word of any superiority, or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency
of one Bishop over another. To them



<pb n="155" facs="tcp:33475:85"/>
the Church in generall is committed, without any
respect to <hi>Timothy</hi> who stood at his elbow. But
to all this <hi>ne</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>quideu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> onely he tels us <hi>it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in answering the first.</hi> But how true this is,
let any Reader judge.<note place="margin">Page 114.</note> At the end of this reason,
wee produce <hi>Epiphanlus</hi> affirming that in ancient
time it was peculiar to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that it had but
one Bishop, whereas other Cities had two. Here
our Remonstrant takes a great deale of paines not
to confute us, but to confute <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> All that
we will reply is this; to desire the Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that this <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was the first that (out of
his owne private opinion) accused <hi>Aerius</hi> of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and (as this Authour saith) of heresie, for
denying the superiority of Bishops over Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
And if this Remonstrant thinke it no dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to himselfe to be a confuter of <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
why should we be cryed downe so heavily
for not agreeing with <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his judgement
concerning <hi>Aerius?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third argument the Remonstrant cuts off
in the midst. For whereas wee say, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
sayd in the seven Epistles that implyeth any
superiority, or majority of rule, or power that
those Angels had over the other Angels that were

makes it runne thus,<note place="margin">Page 116.</note> 
                  <hi>That there is nothing said in
the seven Epistles that implies a superiority;</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is to spoile the argument. For wee grant
there is something said to imply a superiority of
the Ministers over the people, but the question is



<pb n="156" facs="tcp:33475:86"/>
of a superiority of power of one Angell over the
other Angels which were joyned with him in his
Church. But this he conceales, because hee knew
it was unanswerable. Onely he tels us; First, that
the <hi>Epistles are superscribed to the Angell, not Angels.</hi>
This is <hi>crambe millies cocta.</hi> But what is this to a
majority of rule or power? Secondly, he tels us it
will appeare from the <hi>matter of the severall Epistles.</hi>
For hee askes;<note place="margin">Page 117.</note> 
                  <hi>Why should an ordinary Presbyter be

them. Or the Angell of the Church of Thyatira for suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the woman Iezebel</hi> (if it must be so read) <hi>to
teach and seduce when he had no power of publique cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to restraine her?</hi> This discourse is very loose
and wild, <hi>Vt nihil pejus dicamus.</hi> Doth not the
Remonstrant plead here for sole power of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
(which hee doth so much disclaime in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places of his booke) when hee would have
the singular Angel of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> to
have power to proceed against offendors, either
he doth this or nothing. For our parts we answer
without lisping; That it was in the power not of
one Angell, but of all the Angels of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and
<hi>Thyatira,</hi> to proceed against those that <hi>held the
doctrine of Balaam and the Nicolaitans.</hi> To restraine
that woman <hi>Iezebel,</hi> or the Bishop of <hi>Thyatira</hi> his
wife (if it must needs be so read) wee doe not
thinke that one <hi>ordinary Presbyter</hi> (as you call



<pb n="157" facs="tcp:33475:86"/>
him) was to exercise censures alone, nor one <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Bishop</hi> neither. We find the contrary
<hi>Matth. 8. 1 Corinth.</hi> 5. And therefore we referre
it to the Minister or Ministers of each Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the advice, and consent of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
adjoyning which we are sure, is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to the word then to leave it to the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchicall
Bishop, and his Chancellor, Commissary,
or Officiall.</p>
               <p>In the next paragraph, wee challenge you to
shew us what kind of superiority this Angell
had, if he had any at all? We require you to
prove that he had any more then a superiority in
parts and abilities, or of order. Where is it said
that the Angell was a superiour degree or order
of Ministery above Presbyters? Or that he had
solepower of ordination and jurisdiction? But
you flie from those questions as farre as from a
Snake that would sting you, and disdaining all

                  <note place="margin">Page 117.</note>
                  <hi>were directed, and to evince the high degree of their
superiority. Parturiunt montes, nascetur ridiculus

<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. You say,<note place="margin">Page 118.</note> 
                  <hi>That Ignatius and Tertullian
tell us that Onesimus was now the Angell or Bishop of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,
and Polycarpus of Smyrna.</hi> But marke what we
answer.</p>
               <p>First, we doubt of the truth of the story. For



<pb n="158" facs="tcp:33475:87"/>
others tell us that <hi>Timothy</hi> was Bishop (as they call
him of <hi>Ephesus</hi> when Christ wrote this Epistle:
and this opinion <hi>Ribera, Lyra,</hi> and <hi>Pererius</hi> follow.
Others leave it in <hi>medio,</hi> and say it is uncertaine.
But suppose the story were true, we answer</p>
               <p>Secondly, it doth not follow because <hi>Onesimus</hi>
was Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> daies, that
therefore he was the onely party to whom Christ
wrote his Epistle. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels us that there
were many Bishops at <hi>Ephesus</hi> besides <hi>Onesimus,</hi>
and he may very well write to him, and to all the
rest as well as him. That Christ wrote not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>Polycarpus</hi> (if hee were Angell of <hi>Smyrna</hi>)
but to all the other Angels that were at <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
appeares by what we said before out of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
2. 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you know sir, that by your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<hi>Bishops and Presbyters</hi> had all one name in
the Apostles daies, and long after, even in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
his time. And therfore what though <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus</hi>
be called the Bishop of <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesimus</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Ephesus:</hi> still the question re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,
whether they were Bishops <hi>phrasi Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolica?</hi>
(that is Presbyters) or <hi>phrasi Pontificiâ?</hi>
Whether Bishops <hi>Antonomasticè</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> so
called, or whether Bishops in a generall sence,
as all Presbyters are called Bishops. And sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they were Bishops properly so called (which
we beleeve not) yet still it lies upon you to prove
that these were <hi>Hierarchicall Bishops.</hi> That they
had such power as our Bishops assume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.



<pb n="159" facs="tcp:33475:87"/>
That they were a distinct order superior
to Presbyters. And that they had sole power of
ordination and jurisdiction. We are confident
that you are so farre from being able to prove
that they had a sole power, as that you cannot
prove they had any superiority of power over
their fellow Angels. For ought of any thing
said by you in this large discourse, <hi>This indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall
Angell</hi> may be nothing else then a <hi>Moderator
of a company of Presbyters,</hi> having onely a superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of order, and this also mutable and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
according as <hi>Paraeus</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> hold, whom
you follow in this interpretation.</p>
               <p>In the shutting up of this discourse concerning
the <hi>Angels,</hi> the Remonstrant as if he were very
angry, spits out nothing but scorne and contempt
against his adversaries. We bring one example
and two testimonies to prove that the Angels of
the seven Churches were not superior one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and he cries out as one much displeased,
<hi>Away then with these your unproving illustrations
and unregardable testimonies which you as desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 118.</note>
                  <hi>of all antiquity shut up the Scene withall.</hi> But
though you fling them away in your anger and
fury, yet we trust the ingenious Reader will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
them up, and consider also that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant
(that like another <hi>Champion</hi> against
Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> bragges that all the Fathers,
and all the Councels are of his side and yet he)
brings neither Fathers nor Councels for to
prove that these Angels are to be understood



<pb n="160" facs="tcp:33475:88"/>
vidually: and so wee take our leave of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>In the next place we come to the <hi>two postscripts</hi>
(which indeed were <hi>post-scripta</hi> after the booke
was made, and inserted to avoyd an <hi>hiatus</hi>)
which all the defenders of Hierarchy cite for the
averring of Episcopacy by divine right. To this
you reply:</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That you are no waies ingaged to defend these
postscripts:</hi> It is true, not as you are a Remonstrant,
but as you are <hi>juratus in verba Magistri,</hi> sworne to
maintaine any thing that may uphold Hierarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Episcopacy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you confesse ingeniously <hi>they are not
canonicall;</hi> yet you say <hi>they are of great antiquity;</hi>
but you durst not set downe how ancient. For
wee have good reason and authority to thinke
that they are not ancienter then <hi>Theodoret</hi> who
lived 435. yeeres after Christ. We brought many
arguments to prove not onely the <hi>Apocryphalnes,</hi>
but the <hi>falsenesse</hi> of these <hi>subscriptions.</hi> To all
which you subscribe by your silence. Onely you
would faine (if you could) justifie that clause in
the <hi>subscription to Titus written from Nicopolis;</hi> and
the rather because you finde it so in that <hi>famous
ancient Manuscript of Tecla sent by the late Patriarch
of Constantinople.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 121.</note> It seemes then you have seene
that Manuscript. And if so, why doe you not
deale faithfully with your Reader, and discover
what you finde in it; for we are credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in that copy there is no mention of <hi>Titus</hi> his



<pb n="161" facs="tcp:33475:88"/>
being <hi>Bishop of Creet,</hi> or of <hi>Timothy</hi> his being <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Ephesus.</hi> But this is your constant course,
to conceale whatsoever makes against you, and to
magnifie whatsoever hath but a shadow of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
for you, that all men may perceive you
seeke victory rather then truth.</p>
               <p>But before we leave the <hi>Postscripts</hi> we will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to your two questions. First,<note place="margin">Page 119.</note> 
                  <hi>you would
faine see any pretence of so much age against the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of these subscriptions, the averred Episcopacy of
Timothy and Titus.</hi> For reply, we referre you
to what is said before at large in answer to this
demand. Onely we will put you in minde of a
speech of Bishop <hi>Barlows: We are not unwilling
to be judged by antiquity, so it be such an antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to which Ignatius appeales.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>Nothing more acceptable to us then Histories, if
such as are written by him who stiles himselfe, The
ancient of daies. And for the Fathers, none more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to us then him whom Iustin Martyr cals Pater
Patriae, and that is Saint Paul.</hi> Now Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
when he wrote his first Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and
purposely undertooke in his third Chapter to
set out the Office of a Bishop, mentioneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in that Office which is not competent to a
Presbyter; and therefore omits the Office of a
Presbyter, including it in the Office of a Bishop;
which hee would never have done, if hee had at
the same time made <hi>Timothy</hi> an Hierarchicall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
with a power to doe that formally which
was unlawfull for a Presbyter to doe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides



<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33475:89"/>
we have proved that this Epistle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
before <hi>Pauls</hi> first being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time that you say <hi>Paul</hi> made him <hi>Bishop.</hi>
As for his Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> he directly confounds
the Offices of Presbyters and Bishops, and makes
them one and the same, Chapter 1. Verses 5, 6, 7.
Which he certainely would not have done if he
had made them at that time distinct Orders with
distinct Offices. The ancient Fathers indeed
some of them call <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> Bishops in
an improper sense, because they staid longer
in <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Creet</hi> then Evangelists ordinarily
did. And did preach, and ordaine, and doe
those things which Bishops in their time used to
doe, which notwithstanding they did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
doe as Bishops, but virtually and eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as Officers of an higher degree. Hence <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron</hi>
himselfe saith in his first disputation upon
<hi>Timothy, Videtur ergo quod fuerit plusquam Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus,
eti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>si ad tempus in ea civitate ut pastor
praedicaverit, &amp; sacros ordines promoverit. Vnde
quidam vocant eum Episcopum. Ambrose</hi> saith one
while he was a <hi>Deacon,</hi> another while a <hi>Prethy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
Others a <hi>Primate,</hi> and others a <hi>Bishop. Lyra</hi>
proveth him to have beene an <hi>Archbishop,</hi> and
<hi>Titus</hi> a <hi>Priest. Beda</hi> calleth him an <hi>Apostle. Aquinas</hi>
thinkes that <hi>Titus</hi> was <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
when <hi>Paul,</hi> wrote his second Epistle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
hee was at <hi>Dalmatia, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 10. Thus
you see the Fathers agree not amongst themselves,
and therefore helpe you little in this point.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:33475:89"/>
Your second question is:<note place="margin">Page 122.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether ever we have
beene urged to subscribe to any other cerem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nies then
have beene established by the Lawes of this Realme
and Church? And why these Ceremonies are the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
more then Ours?</hi> We answer: First, That
to our knowledge some have beene urged to
subscribe to other ceremonies then have beene
established by the Lawes of this Realme, and
Church, and to promise obedience <hi>editis &amp;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dendis.</hi> Secondly, that this very urging of us to
subscribe to the ceremonies established, is more
then the Lawes require; For the Lawes require
to subscription onely to the thirty nine Articles.
Thirdly, We cannot but justly dislike your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of, <hi>The Lawes of this Realme and Church.</hi>
For we know no Lawes of the Church obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
but such as are established by the Lawes
of the Realme, as both Houses of Parliament
have lately determined. And whereas you aske,
<hi>Why these Ceremonies are the Bishops, more then
ours?</hi> We answer: First, because it is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
said, <hi>No Ceremony, no Bishop,</hi> But it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
said, <hi>No Ceremony, no Presbyter.</hi> Secondly,
because in the Convocation (which you here
terme the Church) the Bishops, or rather the
Archbishop swayes all. And there are five or
six which are there, <hi>Ex m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ero Officio,</hi> and for the
most part are the Bishops creatures, and hang
their suffrages upon his lippes: and but two
Clerkes for the Presbyters, which also for the
most part are forced upon them by the Bishop,



<pb n="164" facs="tcp:33475:90"/>
and his Officers. Thirdly, because they are ours,
if ours as a burden. But theirs, as their crowne,
and glory, for which they fight as for a second Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
to uphold their Courts and Kitchins.</p>
               <p>In the next place we propounded an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
framed by Bishop <hi>Andrewes</hi> and divers others
from the inequality in the Ministery appointed
by Christ himselfe, betweene the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and the seventy Disciples. To which wee
answered: First, that it cannot be proved that
the Apostles had any superiority over the seventy,
either of ordination, or jurisdiction. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>condly,
suppose it could; yet, That superiority and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority
betweene Officers of different kindes,
will not prove that there should be a superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and inferiority betweene Officers of the same
kinde. To which you reply; first, <hi>That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
ordained the Deacons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 123.</note> 
                  <hi>that Paul laid hands on
Timothy.</hi> But this is no solution of the objection,
unlesse you can prove the Deacons and <hi>Timothy</hi>
to have beene amongst the number of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Disciples, or <hi>Paul</hi> to have beene one of the
twelve Apostles. Secondly, you answer, That
Bishops and Presbyters differ <hi>toto genere,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 124.</note> and are
<hi>Offieers of different kind, as much as the Apostles and
the seventy Disciples.</hi> Which is an assertion not
onely contrary to the Fathers (who accounted the
Bishop to be but <hi>Primus Presbyter;</hi> and as <hi>Hierome</hi>
saith,<note place="margin">Aquin. Aureol. Capreol. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Vnum ex se electum celsiori gradu colloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>)
But also more unsound then most of the
Papists who freely acknowledge that <hi>Presbyteratus</hi>



                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:33475:90"/>
is the highest order in the ministry, and that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy</hi>
is but a different degree of the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and not a superior order from Presbyters.
An order may be reputed higher, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath intrinsecally an higher vertue, or
because it hath an higher degree of honour and
dignity. Now we deny not but the latter anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
did by their Canons make Episcopacy an
higher Order in regard of dignity and honour,
<gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as a Councell speakes)
but did never account it an higher power by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
right. This last branch the Remonstrant
would faine prove (if he could) by an argument
drawne from succession; because (saith he) <hi>the
Bishops succeed the Apostles, and the Presbyters the
seventy Disciples.</hi> And we are challenged, page
158. to shew <hi>whether ever any Father or Doctor of
the Church till this present age held that Presbyters
were the successors to the Apostles, and not to the
seventy Disciples rather.</hi> But here is nothing in
which the Remonstrant shewes more wilfull ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
then in this. For the ancient Fathers doe
make the Presbyters successors of the Apostles
as well as Bishops. Thus <hi>Irenaeus</hi> liber 4. cap. 43,
44. <hi>Quapropter &amp; eis, qui in Ecclesiâ sunt Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris

Thus also our <hi>Ierome</hi> (as you call him) in his

Shew us your three degrees in Scripture.
You confesse page 47. that these three orders are
not there to be found. We read in Scripture, the
<hi>Deacon</hi> to be a step to a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> but not a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
to a Bishop. And wee deny that ever it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
in antiquity, that a Bishop did ever differ
from a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as a <hi>Presbyter</hi> from a <hi>Deacon.</hi>
For these differ <hi>Genere proximo (No <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>erint Diaconi

a Bishop differs from a Presbyter as from one who

and therefore the difference betweene
these Priests be <hi>circumstantiall,</hi> and not so <hi>essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
as betwixt the other. Thus Bishops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops
are divers orders of Bishops according to

               <p>In your transition to your next Paragraph, that
you might disparage the opposets of the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall
Episcopacy by divine right, you endeavour
to make them the Disciples of none but <hi>Ierome.</hi>
But here in you cannot but know how injuriously
you deale with them, considering the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
number of Authors, both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne,
that assert that, which you would fasten
upon him alone. In the Paragraph it selfe, you
confesse what we undertooke to prove; That the
ancient Bishops and others differ in regard of their
<hi>Accessories,</hi> dignities, titles, and maintenance. But
onely whereas among other instances we told you
of golden Chalices and wooden Priests; You tell
us, <hi>That if in time we should see wooden Chalicer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 127.</note> 
                  <hi>and
wooden Priests, we may thanke our selves;</hi> Truely sir,
we may thanke you, and not our selves; for the
Lordlinesse and in solent carriages of some Bishops
under the great revenues and the multitude of
<hi>wooden Priests</hi> which they have made, who have
beene intoxicated with the <hi>Golden Chalice</hi> of the
whore of <hi>Babylons</hi> abominations, hath so aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the affections of people from them; as that
what doome so ever they are sentenced unto, it is
no other then what they have brought upon
themselves. As for our part, we are still of the same
mind, that honourable maintenance ought to be
given to the Ministers of the Gospell, not onely
to live, but to be hospitable. Indeed we instanced



<pb n="168" facs="tcp:33475:92"/>
in many that did abuse their large revenues. But
you are pleased to say, <hi>That in this Ablative age the
fault is rare and hardly instanceable.</hi> We thinke the
contrary is more hardly instanceable. And as for
your <hi>Ablative age,</hi> if you meane it of poore <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi>
who have beene deprived of all their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
by the unmercifulnesse of Bishops, whom
they with teares have besought to pitty their
wives and children, we yeeld it to be too true. Or
if you meane, in regard of the purity of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
the frequency of preaching, the freedome
of conceived prayer; We denie not but in this
sence also it may be called the <hi>Ablative age.</hi> But if
you relate it to Episcopacy and their Cathedrals
(with whom it is now the <hi>Accusative age</hi>) We hope
that the yeere of recompense is come, and that
in due time for all their <hi>Ablations</hi> they may be
made a gratefull <hi>ablation.</hi> We have done with

formerly given to some objections by him
propounded,<note place="margin">Remonst. p. 26.</note> and by us further urged: The first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
was from that <hi>prejudice which Episcopacy challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
a divine originall doth to Soveraignty,</hi> which was
wont to be acknowledged, not onely as the <hi>conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
but as <hi>the creating cause</hi> of it in former times. The
Remonstrant thinks this objection is sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
by telling us, there <hi>is a compatiblenesse in this
case of Gods act and the Kings.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 129.</note> 
                  <hi>And what can wee say to
this?</hi> Sir, you know what we have said already, and
not onely said but proved it, and yet will confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell us you have <hi>made good by undeniable proofes,
that (besides the ground which our Saviour layd of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity)
the blessed Apostles by inspiration from God made this
difference,</hi> &amp;c. Made good? when? where? by
what proofs? Something you have told us about
the Apostles, but not a word in all the defence of any
ground laid by our Saviour of this imparitie; yet the
man dreams of undeniable proofs of that whereof he
never spake word.</p>
               <p>Wee must therefore tell you againe, take it as you
please, that if the Bishops disclaime the influence of
Soveraignty into their creation, and say that the King



<pb n="174" facs="tcp:33475:93"/>
doth not make them Bishops; they must have no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at all. Nor can your questions stop our mouthes:
<hi>Where or when did the King ever create a Bishop?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 130.</note> 
                  <hi>Name
the man and take the cause.</hi> Wee grant you Sir, that so
much as there is of a Presbyter in a Bishop, so much
is Divine: <hi>But that imparity and jurisdiction exercised out
of his own demandated authority,</hi> which are the very
formalities of Episcopacie, these had their first
derivation from the <hi>Consent, Customes, Councell, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
of the Church, which did first deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
this Episcopall authority to one particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
afterwards the Pope having obtained a <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi>
over <hi>the Church,</hi> did from <hi>himself</hi> demandate that
authority that formerly <hi>the Church</hi> did, and since the
happy ejection of the Popes tyrannicall usurpations
out of these Dominions, <hi>our Princes</hi> being invested
with all that <hi>Ecclesiasticall power</hi> which that Tyrant had
usurped, that same imparity and authority, which
was originally demandated from the Church, succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
from the Pope, is now from the King. Looke
what influence the Church ever had into the creation
of Bishops, the same the Pope had after; and looke
what influence the Pope had heretofore, the same our
Laws have placed in the King which is so cleere that
the Remonstrant dares not touch, or answer.</p>
               <p>There was a Statute made the first of <hi>Edward</hi> the
sixth, inabling the King to make Bishops by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
patents <hi>Onely:</hi> Hence all the Bishops in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
the sixt time were created Bishops by the Kings
Letters patents ONELY; in which all parts of
Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction are granted them in precise
words, <hi>praeter &amp; ultra jus divinum,</hi> Besides and beyond



<pb n="175" facs="tcp:33475:93"/>
divine right, to be executed onely, <hi>nomine, vice, &amp; Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate
nostri Regis,</hi> in the Kings royall stead, name,
and Authority, as the patents of severall Bishops in
the Rolls declare.</p>
               <p>But besides <hi>the Kings Letters, the Bishop is solemnly
ordained by the imposition of the hands of the Metropolitan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 130.</note>
                  <hi>and other of his brethren, &amp; these as from God invest him in
his holy calling. As from God?</hi> Good sir prove that; prove
that the Metropolitan and Bishops in such imposition
of hands are the instruments of God, &amp; not the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the King: prove they doe it by Commission
received from God, and not by command of the King
onely. Produce one warrant from Scripture, one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
of a Bishop so ordained by a Metropolitan and
fellow Bishops, and without more dispute take all.
Shortly, resolve us but this one thing; what is it
that takes a man out of the ordinary ranke of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and advanceth him to an imparity and power of
jurisdiction? is it humane authority testified in the
Letters of the King, or is it divine authority testified
by the significative action of imposition of hands by
the Metropolitan and fellow Bishops? if the former,
you grant the cause, if the latter, consider with what
good warrant you can make a form of Ordination (by
the hands of a Metropolitan and fellow Bishops)
which is a meer humane invention, to be not onely a
signe, but a mean of conveying a peculiar and supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
power from Divine Authority, and of making
a Presbyter a Bishop <hi>Iuredivino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, Sir, make as much as you can of your <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
by a Metropolitan,</hi> slight as much as you please
your unworthy comparison between the King and our



<pb n="176" facs="tcp:33475:94"/>
Patrons, yet did the Kings <hi>Conge d'eslire</hi> give you no
more humane right to Episcopacie, then the hands of
the Metropolitan and fellow Bishops give you of
right Divine, you would be Bishops by neither. It is
not your confident re-inforcing of your comparison
that shal call carry it, till you have first proved it from
Scripture, that God never instituted an order of
Presbyters or Ministers in his Church, as wee have
proved, God never instituted an order of Bishops.
Secondly, that by the Laws of the land as much of
the Ministeriall power over a particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is in the patron, as there is of Episcopall power in
the King. Till then (wee beseech you) let it rest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined
whether your self, or we may best be sent
to <hi>Simons Cell.</hi> We say no more, lest you should think
<hi>we flout your modesty with an unbeseeming frumpe,</hi> which
whither our answer be guilty of, as you here charge
us, let the Reader compare the 28 and 29 pages of
your Remonstrance, and our Answer to those pages,
and determine.</p>
               <p>The second objection was from that imputation
which this truth casts upon all Reformed Churches
which want this government; this the <hi>Remonstrant</hi>
must needs endevour to satisfie, <hi>that hee may decline the
envie that attends this opinion.</hi> But what needs the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant
feare this envy? Alasse, the <hi>Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are but a poore handfull! Rumpantur ilia,</hi> need the
Remonstrant care? Yet is it neither his large prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of his honourable esteeme of those Sister
Churches, nor his solicitous cleering himselfe from
the scandalous censures and disgracefull termes cast
upon them by others (under whose colours he now
militares) that will divert this envie, unlesse he either



<pb n="177" facs="tcp:33475:94"/>
desert his opinion, or make a more just defence then
he hath yet done.<note place="margin">Pag. 132.</note> The Defence is, <hi>That from the opinion
of the Di. right of Episc. no such consequence can be drawn, as
that those Churches that want Bishops are no Churches. Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
though reckoned among matters essential to the Church,
yet is not of the essence of a Church, and this is no contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
neither.</hi> If you would have avoided the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
you should have expressed your selfe more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly;
knowing that things essentiall are of two
sorts; either such as are essentiall <hi>constitutivè;,</hi> or such as
are essentiall <hi>consecutivè,</hi> You had done well here, had
you declared whether you count Episcopacie essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to a Church <hi>constitutive,</hi> or <hi>consecutivé;</hi> if <hi>consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutivè,</hi>
then it is necessary to the being of a Church,
and it must follow, where there is no Bishop, there can
be no Church: If essentiall onely <hi>consecutivè,</hi> wee
would be glad to learne how those officers which by
Divine institution have demandated to them pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<hi>a power of ordaining all other officers in the Church
(without which the Church it selfe cannot be constituted)</hi> and
such a power as that those officers cannot be ordained
without their hands, should not bee essentiall to the
Constitution of a Church, or tend <hi>onely to the well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not to the being of it?</hi> Either you must disclaim your
own propositions, or owne this inference, and not
think to put it off with telling your Reader. <hi>It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for our friends to hold discipline of the being of a
Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 133.</note> 
                  <hi>you dare not be so zealous.</hi> If heat in an Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
cause may be called <hi>zeale,</hi> you dare be as <hi>zealous</hi>
as any man we know. Your friends wee are sure are
as zealous in the cause of their <hi>Episcopacie</hi> as any of
ours have been in the defence of <hi>discipline.</hi> Did ever



<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33475:95"/>
any of our friends in their zeale rise higher then to
frame an oath, whereby to bind all men to maintaine
their discipline? You know some of yours have
done as much: but them wee know you will leave to
their owne defence, as you doe your <hi>learned Bishop of</hi>
Norwich,<note place="margin">Pag. 134.</note> now he is dead. It is work enough for you
to defend your selfe, and give satisfaction to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
propounded.</p>
               <p>First, we demanded the reason why Popish Priests
converted to our Religion are admitted without new
ordination, when some of our brethren flying in Queen
<hi>Maries</hi> time, and having received Ordination in the
Reformed Churches were urged at their return to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it again from our Bishops? This shamelesse and
partiall practice of our Prelats hee could not deny,
but frames two such answers of which the second
confutes the first, and neither second nor first justifies
their practice. In the first he denies a capability of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
by our laws, and yet in his second, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
many to be admitted without any legall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
which how well they consist, let the Reader
judge.</p>
               <p>The second question was, <hi>whether that office which by
divine Right hath sole power of Ordination, and ruling of all
other officers in the Church, belong not to the being, but onely
to the glory and perfection of a Church?</hi> The Remonstrant
is so angry at this question, that before hee can finde
leisure to answer it, he must needs give a little vent to
his choller: <hi>Can we tell what these men would have?</hi> (saith
he) <hi>have they a mind to go beyond us in asserting that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
and essentiall use of Episcopacie, which we dare not avow?</hi>
What is that which you dare not avow? is it that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy



<pb n="179" facs="tcp:33475:95"/>
hath <hi>sole power of ordaining and ruling all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Officers in the Church?</hi> But this wee are sure you
will avow, That imposition of hands <hi>in ordination
and confirmation have ever been held so intrinsecall to Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie,
that I would faine see where it can be shewed that</hi>
ANY EXTREMITY OF NECESSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY
<hi>was by the Catholike Church of Christ ever yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
for a warrant sufficient to diffuse them into other
hands.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Episc. div. Right part. 2. p. 91.</note> Is not this to say that the sole power of ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Officers is in the hands of the Bishop? <hi>And dare
not</hi> WE <hi>avow this now?</hi> Blessed be they that have
taken downe your confidence. And where you are
witty by the way,<note place="margin">Pag. 135.</note> 
                  <hi>you tell us we still talke of sole Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and sole Iurisdiction, we may if we please keep that paire
of soles for our next shooes.</hi> Good Sir, wee thanke you
for your liberality, but wee doubt you either part
with them out of fear you shall no longer keep them,
or they will prove no longer worth the keeping. But
consider one thing, we beseech you, if you make this
donation not onely in your own name, but in the
name of the whole Episcopall order, you and they
may turn <hi>Fratres Mendicantes,</hi> and go bare foot, if you
part with these paire of soles, and what will become
of your <hi>Quid facit Episcopus, quod non facit Presbyter
exceptâ ordinatione? You doe not contend</hi> (say you) <hi>for
such a height of propriety,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>in what case soever of
extremity and irresistable necessity, this should be done onely
by Episcopall hands.</hi> You do not? It is well you doe not,
but did you never meane to affirme it none of you?
Consider (we beseech) that forecited place <hi>Episcopacie
Divine Right, part. 2. pag.</hi> 91. weigh the words and
then speake, and tell the Authour your judgement.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:33475:96"/>
Our third question was, <hi>There being in this</hi> mans
thoughts the same <hi>jus divinum</hi> for Bishops that there
is for Pastors and Elders, whether if those reformed
Churches wanted Pastors &amp; Elders too, they should
want nothing of the essence of a Church, but onely
of the glory and perfection of it? <hi>The answer</hi> (saith
he) <hi>is ready,</hi> which is indeed no answer, it is in sum but
this, that it <hi>would be better with them if they had Bishops
too.</hi> But how it would be if they wanted Bishops and
Pastors and Elders too, of that he saith nothing.</p>
               <p>The Remonstrant had presumed to know so much
of the mind of the Reformed Churches as to averre,
that if they might have their option, they would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imbrace Episcopall government;<note place="margin">Pag. 136.</note> 
                  <hi>a foule imputation
saith the</hi> Remonstrant: we say so too; a foul imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to charge the Reformed Churches of a secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to Apostatize from their owne confessions,
which doe not onely <hi>maintain a justifiablenesse of their
present government, but a necessity of it as the only go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
appointed by GOD in his Church,</hi> as wee
shewed in five Corollaries drawn out of those confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
which the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> slides over, wherein they
doe not onely defend the condition they are in, but
tell us by consequence they would not change it for
any other forme in the World: Because they tell us
<hi>Theirs is the form God hath set down in his Word,</hi> the forme
<hi>Christ hath appointed in his Church,</hi> the forme by <hi>which
the Church ought to be governed.</hi> Can we think the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
that thus professe and believe, can ever look for
a better form? Or would accept another though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to them as better, when they professe this is
that form by which they ought to be governed?</p>
               <p>The testimonies of particular Divines must not be
put in the ballance against the confessions of whole



<pb n="181" facs="tcp:33475:96"/>
Churches. God forbid, that all that hath flowed from
the pens of Divines of great Learning and place in
<hi>England</hi> should passe for the Doctrine of the English
Church abroad. Wee will beleeve you it is possible
<hi>many eminent Divines of the Churches abroad have wished
themselves in your condition,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 137.</note> 
                  <hi>that is in Episcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
not in our condition under Episcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And as easily we believe, <hi>they have magnified our
Church as the most famous exemplary glorious Church in the
whole Christian World.</hi> It better a great deale becomes
them then <hi>Laodicean</hi> like to say (as you say, <hi>pag.</hi> 26.)
their <hi>own is the most glorious and exemplary Church, the rest
are but a poore handfull,</hi> and reason they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to it, not it to them. But whether it be the
beautie, perfection, and glory of Episcopall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or the powerfull and lively preaching of the
World, the powerfull and lively practice of piety,
which through the speciall grace of God are found
in this Church (then which there hath been nothing
more hated or persecuted under Episco. government)
that hath made them magnifie the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
there is the question, which is not hard to determine.</p>
               <p>To induce the Reader to believe the Reformed
Churches would change theirs for our government,
the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> hath told us that there is little
difference betweene their government and ours,
save in perpetuitie of moderatorship and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Lay-elders. This saith the <hi>Remonstrant, You
say is a passage of admirable absurdity.</hi> Sir, wee said ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable;
the absurdity is your own. To mend it, <hi>you
would perswade your selfe to feare, wee know not what you
speak of: You speake not onely of the next Churches of</hi>
France <hi>and the</hi> Netherlands. Sir, you spake if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member



<pb n="182" facs="tcp:33475:97"/>
of the Neighbour Churches, and wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
between our Neighbour Churches, &amp; the next
Churches of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> there is not
much distance; sure any common understanding, by
Neighbour Churches, would a great deal sooner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the next Churches of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
then the Churches of <hi>Germany, Weteraw,
Anhault,</hi> &amp;c. Especially considering your instance in
those Churches, from whose Moderators our Bishops
differ onely in perpetuitie of Moderatorship: Which
perpetuitie the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Superintendents have as well
as our Bishops.<note place="margin">And even in these Churches of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Superintendents are nothing like our bishops. They are of the same degree with other Ministers, they are onely Presidents while the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod lasteth; when it is dissolved, their prerogative ceaseth: They have no prerogative over their fellow Ministers, They are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their Presbyteries.

wee shewed a sixfold difference: all
which the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> wisely passeth;
that hee may not be forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the difference greater then hee
pretended. Onely tels us with what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

               <p>You put us in minde, that you said the difference

scarce conceive this likenesse by the <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> and
we can lesse conceive it by this defence. For besides
the flat contradictions which this Defence gives to
Episcopacie by Divine Right (for which wee doubt
the Doctor will give the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> little thanks)
the very language of the Defence inclines to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
For though we acknowledge the Defence, for
the substance of it wholly, and for the phrase of it in
a great part, borrowed from episcopacie by Divine
Right, yet the extream disdainfulnesse that breaths in
every page and line pleads with us, to thinke that it is
not his, especially if he have made that <hi>vow</hi> of leaving
his insolent and scornfull language, which an ancient
acquaintance of his hath put the world in hope hee
would. Your <hi>Errata</hi> bids us <hi>pag.</hi> 33. Read <hi>Invectives,</hi>

three knowne texts which we omitted,</hi> because the question
betweene us was not whether ruling Elders are an

But whether ever they had existence in the Christian

of this question, (being <hi>de facto,</hi> not <hi>de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on purpose that we might not be discovered.</p>
               <p>Were this a fault and worthy of blame, yet little
reason hath the Remonstrant to quarrell with us, it is
but this one place in which the Remonstrant chargeth
us, wee are punctuall in our other quotations. How-many
quotations are there in this defence in which the
Remonstrance hath not cited so much as the Book,

                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:33475:99"/>
But here we are not so culpable as the Remonstrant
makes us. The translation of <hi>Origen</hi> which we followed
did not distinguish the booke into Chapters, No more
then the Originall doth, Nor other translations with
which we have consulted; Nor are wee yet so happy
as to meete with that edition where the Chapters are

of fraud or feare.</p>
               <p>For the text it selfe, whether your collection or ours

               <p>
                  <hi>The sence of this place, saith the</hi> Remonstrant, <hi>is
this,</hi> That those which were newly admitted into the Church,<note place="margin">Pag. 142. 143.</note>
who by reason of their late acquaintance with such as were left
behind them in Pagan superstition, might be fit Monitors to
know and notifie the condition of such Candidates as did
offer to come into the Church, were designed to that office of
<hi>Monitorship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:33475:100"/>
Here we desired the Reader to consider: first that
the scope of the place is to vindicate the Christian as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
from the imputations unjustly cast upon
them by <hi>Celsus,</hi> as if they were a confluence of base
and worthlesse people. To cleer this, hee divides all
Christians into two Orders: the first were <hi>Catechume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>
or beginners; and first he shews the care they took
about them, before they were baptized. The other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
comprehends all such as were baptized, whom he
describes in these words. <hi>There is another order of such
who according to their ability expresse their endevours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
nothing but what seems right to Christians,</hi> which two
orders are in antiquity distinguished in <hi>Catechumenos
&amp; Fideles.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Austin. Serm. 14 de verb. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post.</note> Now that this same <hi>alter ordo</hi> might be kept
to live acording to there profession; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
there were some <hi>designed</hi> or <hi>constituted,</hi> who should
look to the manners of all such as <hi>come to them;</hi> (that is
to their meetings) that they that lived wickedly might
be banished their assemblies, and heartily embracing
such as lived well, they might make them better.</p>
               <p>Those persons here spoken of, the Remonstrant
grants to be <hi>lay persons</hi> (as we terme them) and doth not
so much as once goe about to affirme them Presbyters.
Onely the question is, who those so constituted were?
He saith <hi>Novices newly added to the Church.</hi> Secondly
of whome they had the inspection? hee saith <hi>onely of
such as were comming out of paganisme and offered themselves
to be added to their Assemblies.</hi> Thirdly, what their
power was? hee saith, <hi>onely to notifie the lives of such: to
be as it were Monitores,</hi> and no more.</p>
               <p>For the two first, we conceive it impossible for him to
shew in all antiquity that ever the Church did appoint
Novices over Novices to be overseers of their manners,



<pb n="189" facs="tcp:33475:100"/>
and much more impossible to collect it from this place,
since <hi>Origen</hi> speaks indefinitely of any of this order
(to wit of <hi>Fideles</hi>) and punctually of such who had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
such a measure of grace as they were able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
endevours to do that which is right, and were fit
and able by their acquaintance to better others, and
therefore these could not be Novices.<note place="margin">Pag. 142. 143.</note> For the second,
to wit, over whom they had power? they were not onely
such as were lately admitted: for <hi>Origen</hi> speakes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
of all wicked or scandalous livers among them,
who were to be inhibited their assemblies. For the third,
the power they had, (which saith hee <hi>was onely to be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors)</hi>
it appeares from the text, that they had power ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to keepe back from their assemblies, or to receive
into their assemblies, according as the lives of men were
good or bad, and were of that ability, as that they could
better them daily with their good counsell. And if any
were froward or contumacious, what course was further
to be taken with them the following words declare; and
although it is true, the acts of casting such out of the
Church is attributed primarily to the teachers; yet who
dare exclude those former <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from all interest
in this act? when <hi>Origen</hi> himselfe saith, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,

<hi>First, because Deacons are named before these
Seniors where ever they are mentioned.</hi> Secondly, <hi>because</hi>
Optatus <hi>reckoning up</hi> quatuor genera capitum, <hi>mentions
not Elders.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 147.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For the first, though the order of reckoning them
be not so much to be insisted upon, yet wee can tell
you (if here your <hi>confidence</hi> had not beene greater then
your <hi>consideration)</hi> that you might have observed, that
in some places they are mentioned not onely before
Deacons, but the whole cleargie; For so <hi>Gregories</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cited by us; <hi>Tabellarium cum consensu Seniorum, &amp;
Cleri memineris ordinandum:</hi> Are not Seniors here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before the cleargie?</p>
               <p>His second proofe, that these Elders <hi>were no better
then meere Churchmardens</hi> and <hi>Vestry men</hi> was, because
Optatus <hi>mentioning foure sorts of men in the Church men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
not these Elders.</hi> But is this the man that hath with
such height of scorne vilified poore negative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
though drawn from sacred Scripture? And
will he now lay such weight upon a negative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Surely, if all the truth and practice of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times were bound up in one <hi>Optatus,</hi> (as all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine



<pb n="194" facs="tcp:33475:103"/>
truth is lodged in the sacred Volume of the
Scriptures) the Remonstrant might have made much
of his negative argument, yet hee scornes to heare us
reasoning, that because we do not read that the holy
Ghost did by the Apostles appoint Bishops, <hi>in reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
Schismatis,</hi> therefore we cannot believe Bishops
are of Divine or Apostolicall institution, but of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.
<hi>Away</hi> (saith he) <hi>with this poore negative argument.</hi>
And because the Apostle, <hi>Ephesians</hi> the fourth, recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Officers whom Christ hath given and gifted
for the edification of his Church, reckons up onely
Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, &amp; Teachers,
if wee should conclude, <hi>Ergo,</hi> there were no Bishops,
The <hi>Remonstrant</hi> would cry out again, <hi>Away with these
negative arguments,</hi> yet such an argument fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Scripture
may be <hi>valid,</hi> though from no other authority. As
for <hi>Optatus,</hi> First, though in these places he mentions
not Elders, yet that other place which wee brought
out of the same Author doth, which the learned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary
<hi>Albaspinaeus</hi> (though a Papist) with us acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, these places produced by the <hi>Remonstrant</hi>
crosse one another as much as they crosse us, for <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistri</hi>
are left out in one as well as <hi>Seniores</hi> in both.
Thirdly, these <hi>Seniores</hi> are included <hi>in turba fidelium,</hi>
as the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. comprehends all the
Church under these two, <hi>hearers and teachers,</hi> and so
again, <hi>Heb. 13. 24. Rulers and Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet the Remonstrant is resolved to hold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
<hi>Elders in a ranke above Deacons in a setled power
of government</hi> with the Pastors,<note place="margin">Pag. 147.</note> shall be damned by

And good Sir,<note place="margin">Pag. 148.</note> what was your whole
Remonstrance but a <hi>declamation?</hi> And what is your
<hi>Defence</hi> but a Satyre? But ours is worthy of no other
answer then <hi>contempt and silence.</hi> You are very dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
and happy in those kind of Answers, your whole
Defence is full of them. It is true you say, <hi>The reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Bishops of all times have strongly upheld the truth of
God against Satan, and against his Antichrist.</hi> And it is
as true that we told you, that others have upheld the
truth as strongly as Bishops ever did; Yea, &amp; at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
when there was never a Bishop in the world to
appeare for the truth. And therefore never impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
all the glory to Episcopacie. It is also true that
wee told you, that some irreligious Bishops have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
Satan and his Antichrist against the truth of
God, and what can you say to this? <hi>What is this to their
calling?</hi> Sir, their upholding Antichrist makes as
much against their calling, as their upholding the
truth makes for their calling. If you fetch an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the one for their calling, we may as Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
fetch an argument from the other against their
calling with as much concluding strength; but <hi>you can
tell us of Presbyters wicked and irreligious, shall the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

then the painfullest Ministers.</hi> But if Presbyters should
be as generally corrupted as Bishops now are, have as
much strength to suppresse the Gospell, and promote
Popery, as the Bishops by their supreame power
have, if they can bring no more evidence of Divine
institution then Bishops can, and are of no more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to the Church then Bishops are, let the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
suffer.</p>
               <p>We told you what an unpreaching Bishop said of
a preaching Bishop; <hi>this say you is our slander</hi> not <hi>their
just Epithite,</hi> and challenge us to <hi>shew any unpreaching Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
in the Church of</hi> England <hi>this day.</hi> Sir, pardon us if
we tell you that you put us in minde of <hi>a poore Sir Iohn</hi>
that because he had made one Sermon in 40. yeeres
would needs be counted a preaching minister: if you
speake of preaching after that rate, then indeed you
may call all the Bishops in <hi>England</hi> preaching Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
But the people of <hi>England</hi> can so well tell who
deserves the name of a preaching Bishop, that it is not
the preaching of a Sermon once a yeere, or a quarter,
or a month, that will bee sufficient to merit and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that name. Some indeed have taken some paines
heretofore; But there are so few of them now, that
sure the Remonstrant intended this booke for posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
The present Age will never beleeve that <hi>England</hi>
is so full of preaching Bishops, that there is not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching

in</hi> England, wee beseech you consider whither the
Scripture doe not speak as properly, when it speaks
of the <hi>Churches of Iudea</hi> and of <hi>Galatia,</hi> as if it had

we had said, if the bounds of <hi>a Kingdome must needs
be the limits of a Churth,</hi> Why are not <hi>England, Scotland,</hi>

               <p>This discourse of <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> cannot end

had upbrayded the Divisions of that part, wee made

<hi>the great heart-searching God plead not guilty.</hi> The

exorbitancy hath caused, we have not fomented, but
have smothered our thoughts and griefs even untill

inclined the heart of our gracious Soveraigne to call
a Parliament, that hee and they might together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of the pressures and grievances of his people,
and conclude their removall. And now we <hi>cannot, wee
dare not</hi> hold our peace, but declare our judgments, that
if it shall seem good to our dread Sovereigne, and this
Honourable Parliament, upon the many complaints
brought in against Bishops and their Hierarchicall
government, to remove the Hierarchie, This Act of
State may appeare to all to be farre from sinne; this

               <p>The bounders we shewed from your late Canons,
which (say you) are too narrow: let them see to that

the rest of the Nation.</p>
               <p>For distinction wee brought bowing to the East,
to Altars, &amp;c. Now these (say you) are not <hi>fit
distinctions whereon to ground different Churches.</hi> Yes Sir,
if it be true that some have held,<note place="margin">Pag. 153.</note> that the <hi>outward
Formes of worship, and ceremonies attending it</hi> are the
characters whereby one Church is differenced from
another; but especially when such as will not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
these, shall be disclaimed by such as doe them,
as none of the sonnes of the Church. When men
shall be forced to subscribe to the practice of these
things, or else they shall not bee admitted either
into Livings, or Cures, (as in the instanced particulars
wee have knowne it) then they make a difference
of Churches. And who are the authours of such
differences, but such as thus urge them? Next
wee brought their Creed and instanced in Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie
by divine right: Hee replies, <hi>Did ever man
make this an Article of Faith?</hi> Judge you by what Bishop
<hi>Hall</hi> saith in his Episcopacie by Divine right part 2.
pag. 47. <hi>I am so confident of the Divine institution of the
Majority of Bishops above Presbyters, that I dare boldly say,
there are weighty points of faith that have not so strong
ground in Scripture.</hi> Is this to make it an article of
Faith or no? And if not an Article of Faith, yet
we are sure it is made an Article of the Church. For
whereas by the orders of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a

               <p>We added, absolute &amp; blind obedience to all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Bishop &amp; Ordinaries: <hi>you bid us blush.</hi> But
alas Sir we are not such strangers in <hi>England,</hi> nor your

hath been the common doctrine, and almost the

                  <hi>Is

Absolution by a Priest to be absolutely necessary to

               <p>Their Heaven we said <hi>was a receptacle of drunkards,

so, for when did your Consistories, that pretend to

the gates of Heaven against such sinners, as that a sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

your charity keepe them in Heaven while they
live such, yet our charity shuts them not out of
Heaven, if they did not die such. But it may be you

               <p>We professe still wee had rather goe on in our

the Archprelates froune in the opposition.</p>
               <p>Having given sufficient answer to the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant,
wee thought it not unfit to subjoyne some
<hi>Quaeres</hi> about Episcopacy, for the Remonstrant, (if

to answer? but like a <hi>Socraticall</hi> disputant put off
the question with question; knowing it is safer
and easier to propound new questions, then to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
ours.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Your first <hi>Quere</hi> is, who ever <hi>held the Lordships of
Bishops to be jure Divivo? if no body, whether this be not

but of Lordbishops <hi>in concreto:</hi> And who

But you aske <hi>why it is a greater fault in one of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
to hold the Lords day to stand by humane right</hi>
(and is there but one of our Doctors of that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?)
<hi>then it is for Master Calvine,</hi> (whom for honours

But did Master <hi>Calvin</hi> ever hold Bishops to be <hi>jure
Divino,</hi> or did Master <hi>Calvine</hi> ever as one of our
Lord-bishops, who having received a letter from a

Or did Master <hi>Calvin</hi> ever cry up Altars
instead of Communion Tables, or Priests instead of

and what ever Master <hi>Calvin</hi> doth in his

We will not impute it to want of wit, or grace
in the Remonstrant; but sure himselfe doth not

understand the right of Episcopacy better,
let the Readers to whose censure both in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
must stand or fall, determine: for our

yes certainely, if the Remonstrant would not
have baulked that which he knew not how to
take away; the <hi>distinction of Apostolicall right,</hi> which
say we, is either such as is founded upon the Acts, or
Epistles of the Apostles, and is (we grant) divine: or
such, as is not recorded in their writings, and is

onely of things reported to be introduced into the
Church the Apostles yet living. Now if the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant
hold Episcopacy to be of Apostolicall right
in the first sence, why doth he then grant us in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

why doth he in the same page make his retreat from
the writings of the Apostles, to the monuments of
succeeding times? If he hold it in the latter sence,
these two things yet remaine to be done: First, he
is to prove that Bishops in a superiority of power
over Presbyters, were introduced into the Church
the Apostles yet living, and answer his friend <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander,</hi>
and our other testimonies produced to the
contrary. Secondly, to prove, that such things may
be of Divine right, whereof no record is found in

                  <p>Wee will not create trouble to the Reader, by
a reiterated justification of our sincerity, though it
be againe prodigiously wounded. Here is much
cry, and little wooll. Hee cannot deny what in our

ever since <hi>Austins</hi> erection of the See of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
onely first hee salsely tells us, <hi>that wee have
borrowed a great part of it out of Sions plea.</hi> But if that
Author hath collected any of the same Stories
(which yet wee know not) out of the Chronicles,



<pb n="217" facs="tcp:33475:114"/>
why should we be thought to have borrowed them
from him, (whom wee durst not for feare of the
<hi>Prelates</hi> keepe in our studies) rather then from the
Chronicles themselves?</p>
                  <p>Secondly he answers, <hi>That they were popish Bishops,

know that in <hi>Henry</hi> the eights time, when this head

that they have bin lashed for these many yeares

if wise men had the handling of it, we might be reconciled

<hi>that the Religion of the Church of Rome is not onely a

availe to say that our Bishops and they have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

                  <p>Thirdly, he answers, That <hi>a charitable man might

is one <hi>Scultetus</hi> to the many hundred learned men
amongst them of a contrary judgement? We might
here retort upon our Remonstrant, that he saith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the moderator of <hi>Geneva</hi> page 138. <hi>You
tell me of the moderator of</hi> Geneva <hi>as if all the Church of
God were included in those strait walls.</hi> We could have
