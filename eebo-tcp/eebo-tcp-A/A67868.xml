         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The MATCHLESS ROGUE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HAving perus'd that most Elaborate-Piece which marches abroad
under tie Title of an <hi>Answer to Malice Defeated, or some Reflections
on Madam</hi> Cellier's Case; I could not but wonder how so much wit
and ingenuity, accompanied with so <hi>clear a Demonstration</hi> of the Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of my Book, could be crouded into so narrow a compass as one
side of half a sheet of small Paper, like <hi>Homer's Illiads</hi> in a Nut-shell;
And how one single Person could be so strangely inspir'd as to be
the Author of it: For it seem'd to me as if all the wits of the Town
had clubb'd their ingenuity towards the writing thereof; and several
Reflections and Imaginations crept into my Head about it.</p>
            <p>Sometimes <hi>I</hi> was apt to think its Author's Name must needs be
<hi>Legion;</hi> or at least that some Gentleman of at least 3 Names, must be
the Pen-man; For <hi>Marcus Tullius Cicero</hi> was a great Orator.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>I</hi> remembred how the <hi>Famous Doctor</hi> wholly refuted the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
and rescinded all his Arguments in these three words, <hi>Bellarmine
thon Ly<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st;</hi> and began to think that the opinion of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> touching
the Transmigration of Souls, was true; and that the Spirit of that <hi>Great
Refuter</hi> had only shifted places, and was transmigrated into You.</p>
            <p>But considering the <hi>good Manners</hi> and <hi>Civility</hi> with which you treat
the whole Female sex at once, by joyning them with those you call
the <hi>Popes Damnable and Malitious Imps,</hi> and saying, <hi>they are as great a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to</hi> England, <hi>as Hell it self is to them;</hi> and remembring withall,
the Names and Titles which you have appropriated to your self, and
the <hi>Marks</hi> wherewith you are <hi>adorn'd</hi> or rather <hi>stigmatiz'd,</hi> and the <hi>Civil
Education</hi> which you have had in the several <hi>Universities</hi> wherein you
have <hi>study'd</hi> under <hi>severe Tutors;</hi> then <hi>I</hi> concluded none but your self,
or some Person of your Civil Education, could let flie this Answer
into the World: And the rather, because you say Capt. <hi>Thomas Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield</hi>
is worthy of that title, wherein <hi>I</hi> fully concur with you; for
it is a Maxim in the <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> that <hi>Fortitude consists more in Suffering than
Acting;</hi> And You having had so many, and so frequent occasions to
exercise that <hi>kind of Valour,</hi> as appears by the many Records of Your
<hi>Worth:</hi> And there being a Commission vacant by the Death of Capt.
<hi>Spurn-cow</hi> your Brother, <hi>I</hi> freely bestow it upon You, as Him that has
the best title to it: For though <hi>I</hi> found no Records of your Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stealing,
Yet <hi>I</hi> have been fully inform'd how you rid away with Mr.
<hi>Briknel</hi> the Lieve-guard man's Horse, depositing conuterfeit Guineys
for him, making him thereby such a Guiney-merchant, that he very
narrowly escap'd Hanging, to his great charge and trouble. Go on
therefore (Noble Captain,) and inherit the Virtues as well as the Title
of your Predecessor; and it is not impossible but You may be a <hi>Lord</hi>
in due time, as it appears he was both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49220:4"/>
And if the Critical or Envious should reproach your Pamphlet with
Nonsense, and meer Railing; And say it is no Answer at all to any
matter in the Book, Rejoyn with them again, and tell them likewise
boldly they Lie, which will be so great a Vindication of your inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
that you shall not need to use any other Arguments to Confute
them; and at the worst, [if the World will not allow your due
praise, put your Answer into your Pocket, and tell them the Story
of the unskilful Painter, who bringing home (to a Person that bespoke
it,) a Picture very ill drawn; and the Gentleman refusing to give him
his Price for it because it lookt so ill favouredly, and was nothing
like him: the Painter reply'd, he would carry it back again, and add
something to it, and doubted not but to sell it at a good price for a
<hi>Baboon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this will not satisfie those unreasonable Criticks, but that they
should tell you they have heard most things in the Book affirm'd to
be true, by Persons of great Integrity; and that much more than is
there incerted, is already deposed upon Oath, and that I have the
Depositions, and daily pray that my Witnesses may be heard, upon
the hazard of my Life, if I do not prove more than I have incerted,
by many Witnesses of unspotted Reputation. And if Capt. <hi>Richardson</hi>
(our old Landlord) say the Articles you gave me, were Lies of your
writing; tell him the Father of Lies once told Truth; And also, that
<hi>I</hi> do not give so much credit to You, as to depend upon the Articles,
having more then enough to do his business without them: Tell him
<hi>I</hi> am well inform'd of his Affairs, and know who it was he last car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
out at Midnight, and sold for a Slave to <hi>Virginia;</hi> Tell him also
<hi>I</hi> know a Person of Generous Extraction, and unspotted Reputation,
whom he loaded with a pair of Shears about a yard long, and 40 <hi>l.</hi>
in weight, and kept him confin'd, and in Irons several Months, tho
the Warrant of his Commitment gave him no authority to do so Tell
him withall, that in MALICE DEFEATED, and else-where, <hi>I</hi> have
both Writt and Spoke more good of him than he hath prov'd true,
but not the tenth part of the Evil that will certainly be prov'd at his
<hi>Tryal.</hi> And tell him <hi>I</hi> am not affraid of the Statute of <hi>Scandalum Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum;</hi>
But if any Person be offended at what <hi>I</hi> have Written, or
hereafter shall write, <hi>I</hi> am ready to go to Tryal with them, and to
justifie the truth thereof. And now Noble Captain, as you inherit
the Title and Virtues of your Famous Predecessor, may you also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
his Fortune, and the Wealthy Dowager he has left behind, and
make as quiet and Honourable an <hi>Exit,</hi> as He did, (with both your
Hands on,) before you be Tryed for striking in Court.</p>
