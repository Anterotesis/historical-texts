         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

good Reader (I speake it with grief) the very case and disease of to many of vs at this day. There is nothing in a maner tedious and burdensome vnto vs but the furtherance of holy Religion, and the Christian practise of the same: on th'other side there is nothing commonly so deare and of price vnto vs, but the loue of our vanities and fleashly delightes can easely make it melt and consume. Mooue men to contribute any thing to the relief of Gods Saincts, or to the re-edifying of a decaied Church and place of praier, alas they haue in a readinesse without studie a whole bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get full of letts and excuses, able to drown and extinguish a better mans devotion then theirs. Why, they giue forsooth, in their owne parishes; they haue a great charge at home, or els they are so indebted and behind hand, that they can not &amp;c. And yet to the maintenance of their pleasures, or to nouzle themselues in their vanities (whether it be in apparell, gamening, gadding to plaies, masking, dauncing, bellicheare, shewes, or such like.) It is wonder to see how chearfully they can vntye their purse-stringes without respecte either of parish, home charge, debt or anything els. The young man in the Gospell went away sorrowfull and mourning, but when? When our Saviour bade him, <hi>Goe sel all</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 21.</note> 
               <hi>that he had, and follow him.</hi> Wherin if we marke the words well, the holy Ghost seemeth to lay down vnto vs that the young mans grief did arise not only from this, in that hee was to depart with his substance and wealth, which hee loved so dearely, but also from this that he must depart withall to so base, so hard, and dangerous an end as he imagined, namely <hi>To follow Christ,</hi> wherein hee saw there was no earthly comfort and felicitie to bee hoped for. For if our Saviour had enjoined him to sell that he had for his better attendance on <hi>Caesars</hi> Court, or for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrement to any place of credite or commoditie, like enough it would not haue gone so nigh him, nor haue bene any such gall

or coresie to his heart, but, <hi>To sell all and follow Christ,</hi> this was the stinger that made him thus to hang down his head, to looke droopingly, and to fling away thus inwardly wounded and discontented. And hath not this yong man to many fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and successours in this age of ours? or, are there not Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites enow among vs readie to giue any thing to the golden Caulf, and repining at euery thing that they should depart withall to the good of Gods Church? Doe we not see before our eyes, howe he that can hardly be drawen to spare a penie in the Church, can yet willingly and chearefullie afoord both pence and teaster, enow for himself and others at a play?

D. <hi>Gager</hi> is likewise, I vnderstand, a man of giftes, a good Schollar, and an honest man, and (as it should seeme by Maister <hi>Rainoldes</hi> his seuerall aunsweres and replies) hath saied more for the defense of <hi>Plaies</hi> then can bee well saied againe by any man that shall succeede or come after him. So that the cause beeing thus wittely and scholler like maintained on th'one side, for, and in defense of plaies, and yet in the end all this rampier of defense quite ouerthrowne and laied flatte to th'earth by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistable battery of profound and vnaunswerable argumentes and resolutions on th'other side, this must needes make the case more cleare and evident in th'eies of any man of iudgement, then if it had not bene gaine saied or withstoode at all. I haue bene informed also that Maister <hi>Gager</hi> himselfe vpon the last rejoinder of Maister <hi>Rainoldes</hi> hath let goe his hold, and in a Christian modestie and humilitie yeelded to the truth, and quite altered his iudgement. If it bee so (good Reader) and that so graue and learned a man hath chosen rather with that <hi>aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> father <hi>humile peccatum,</hi> then <hi>superbam ignoranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> be not thou for thy part willfull and obstinate in thy conceite, whosoever thou art, but ponder the reasons and argumentes on th'one side, consider the dangers and inconveniences on th'other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side. And if thou haue bene bewitched with his vanitie hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, see whether th'advised perusall of this excellent treatise may happely by Gods mercy vnwitch thee againe. And take this with thee for a generall lesson and observation while thou livest, <hi>That whatsoever thy fleash, according to the common course of carnall men, delighteth in, suspect thou there is mischief in it, though thou be able to defende it by thy reason.</hi> Surely for mine owne part, I am perswaded if this present discourse bee read, marked, and disgested as it should bee, the gentlewoman that sware by her trouth, <hi>That shee was as
<pb facs="tcp:16014:4"/>

The like may fall out also to those men too, that haue not bene afraied of late dayes to bring vpon the Stage the very sober countenances, graue attire, modest and matronelike gestures &amp; speaches of men &amp; women to be laughed at as a scorne and reproch to the world, as if the hypocrisie of Iudas (if it were brought vpon the stage) could any whitt disgrace the Apostles of our Saviour Christ, and yet if these men had but thus farre exceeded, kept themselues there, and gone no farther to the foule prophaning and abusing of the holy Scriptures of God, their sinne had not bene half so great as it is. Well to heale, if it may be, or at least, to correct the bad humour of such humorists as these (who in their discouery of humours doe withall fouly discover their own shame and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednes to the world) here is now laied before thee (good Reader) a most excellent remedie and receipt, if thou canst be so happie to make thy profitte of it. Reade it therefore and disgeast it, and, if thou find good thereof, giue God the glory, and blesse his Name, for so worthy an instrument.</p>

            <p>The point that is in question betweene vs touching stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playes,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16014:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was generallie mooued: to weet, whether such as play them doe offende, or such as reprooue the playing of them. You vndertooke to shewe that the reproouers are faultie: I, that the Players. And least the dissension of opinions heerein should breed exulceration of mindes betwene vs, if that, which either of vs said touching the matter, should be taken odiously as meant against the persons whom it might concerne: you, with protestation of your good will to mee-ward, desired mee not to thinke that you meant to note me by the name of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> I prayed you the like with like protestation in respect of your players; &amp; that with greater reason why you should haue yeelded to it in my opinion, sith neither one of their names, <hi>Phemius</hi> for example sake, doeth signifie a lewd player, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> doeth an vniust reproouer; neither did I know who played that part and others, as you knew my mislike of playes. Now, I condescended to your desire most gladlie: your selfe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, and hartilie thanke me for it. I would to God I might haue likewise thanked you: whereof you haue giuen me so li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cause, so great cause to the contrarie, that I must needes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>But in this matter your fault is the lesse, because you had some colour thereof by mine exemplifying in three of your players: nor did the <hi>Romans</hi> alwayes count them so infamous but that the best of them were sometime well esteemed of, as <note n="g" place="margin">Macrob.

For being to proove that the prohibition of men to put on womens raiment <hi>(in Deuteronomie)</hi> belongeth to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law, and therevpon declaring how it is referred by learned Divines, to the commaundement, <hi>Thou shalt not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie:</hi> I said that they had reason to referre it so, because, among the kindes of adulterous lewdenes, mens naturall corruption and vitiousnes is prone to monstrous sinne against nature, as the Scripture witnesseth in <hi>Cananites, Iewes, Corinthians,</hi> other in other nations, one with speciall caution <hi>Nimium est quod intelligitur;</hi> and the putting of womens attire vpon men, may kindle great sparkles of lust thervnto in vncleane affections, as <hi>Nero</hi> shewed in <hi>Sporus, Heliogabalus</hi> in him self; yea certaine, who grew not to such excesse of impudencie, yet arguing the same in causing their boyes to weare long heare like women. This, in your examining the sense of <hi>Moses</hi> wordes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I vsed it, you passe ouer wholly; without mention of the iudgement of the learned Diuines, or of my reason giuen for it. But in the point following, where I handled other inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and discommodities of playes, with speciall applyinge thereof vnto yours: <hi>We pray you Syr</hi> (say you) <hi>to make a great difference betweene vs and Nero with his Sporus,</hi> or <hi>Heliogaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus with him selfe,</hi> or <hi>the Cananites, Iewes, Corinthians,</hi> or <hi>them that cause their Pages to weare long heare like women, or any such dogges: we hartilie abhorre them.

            <p>Howbeit, I should not complaine of this rigour, but for the taile of it, and the sting of breeding euill will among brethren, which doeth lurke therein.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16014:25"/>
had declared that by the name of <hi>Momus</hi> you noted all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proovers of playes. And howsoever that be, wherof more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: dowtlesse I meant scholers trained vp by such in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and good learning, when I prayed that <hi>your actors might shew greater fruit of their time well spent, then any that is bredde vp by Momusses discipline can.</hi> Which is plaine and evident by the words following, in that I affirmed, that <hi>this which you terme the discipline of Momus, is not his but Cyprians, or rather the holy Ghosts.</hi> For God forbid that you should proceede from evill to worse in such excesse of sclandering, as to tell your actors, that I say, <hi>the discipline of the holy Ghost is the schoole of carping, nipping, depraving, &amp; reprehending of every good thing.</hi> Now, though my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit of them be so good, that I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or rather knowe in part, they can shew great fruit of their time well spent, and haue in triall done it: yet I know withall some of so great towardnes brought vp by the other, that, if all your actors think they can shew greater fruit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any of these, they will make mee thinke their good conceit of themselves is worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mine ill.

You, vnlesse I thinke that your Christ-church actors can shew much greater fruit, doe iudge, and giue sentence, that my conceit of them is ill: so ill, beyond all huy and cry, that it is a token I imply in couert speech (expounded charitably) that they are cast away, yea, cast away altogether, and irrecoverably lost.</p>
            <p>Lesser is the wrong, yet a wrong also, that of your actors likewise you say, <hi>they are condemned by me to hatefull infamie, a thing to all honest mindes more intollerable then death it selfe:</hi> and farther, that <hi>your house, your selfe, and many honest towardly young men, your frendes, whom for good causes you hartely loue, are charged with open infamie.</hi> It may be, the circumstance no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted herewithall, in that you adde <hi>it greeveth you and them not a litle, that they should in private, but much more in publike, bee charged with such infamie:</hi> hath reference to the Sermon ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16014:25"/>

If the reason bee, for that wee are men of note who worke the discrediting of you: they are men of note too, whose verses you hauing prefixed before your book, doe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance your disgrace of vs. Nether doe I see what reason else you bring, or can, but that wee shall meete you in the same (speake of consent, or what you list) to wring out of the speciall reproche of your players the generall of your house. As for the former concerning the infamie, the qualitie whereof not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to amplifie with termes that may bee common to all infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in a sort, you name it <hi>more intollerable to all honest mindes then death it selfe:</hi> whether doe you meane the infamie they are charged with by the <hi>Civil law,</hi> in the first reason; or that

            <p>For whereas you tell vs, that <hi>you demanded not of me, or them, or any man but Momus, any such question, if you may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued; as, why you should not, you see no cause:</hi> first how prooue you this, that <hi>you see no cause, why you should not bee beleeued?</hi> Forsooth because <hi>you were as sure</hi> (you say) <hi>that I or any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man did not despise poëtrie, as you were certaine that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus did.</hi> O miserable blindnesse shall I say? or madnes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with your humorous greedines of crossing me distracted you.

               <hi>what man shall there be among you that hath a sheepe, who, if it fall on a Sabbat day into a pitt, will not take holdof it, and lift it out?</hi> Hee asked not any such question of the <hi>Phariseis,</hi> or <hi>Scribes,</hi> or any man, but your <hi>Momus</hi> brethren, that is, the men whom fansies imagine in the cloudes: because hee was as sure that the <hi>Phariseis</hi> or any wise man would not suffer his sheepe to lie in the pitt on the <hi>Sabbat day,</hi> as hee was certaine that the cloudes would. For if you perceaue that <hi>Christ,</hi> to make the <hi>Phariseis</hi> confesse that <hi>it is lawfull to heale a man on a Sabbat day,</hi> had reason to demand whether they would not lift vp their sheepe out of a pitt then, which hee knewe they would; that by granting this they might discerne the better they must needes graunt that: how could you choose but see, that your purpose being to make vs confesse, that comedies &amp; tragedies may bee lawfully played, you had like reason to aske whether wee did despise learned poëtrie, which you were sure we did not; that by graunting this (you thought) wee might the rather be forced to graunt that. Wherefore sith-even here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was cause sufficient to make mee imagin that you did

demande the question of vs: you should conclude rather that your sight was naught, who saw not so much, then that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you saw it not, you should bee beleeued affirming the contrarie. Moreover, to admitt there was no cause herein why you should not be beleeved, yet might there bee in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what else: and such, as you should also haue easily espied, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the inordinate passion of your minde had daseled your sight.

            </p>
            <p>Yea, even for the branches and points wherevnto you stand in the particulars, the fower heades of reasons, neither denying their drift, the marke they aimed at; nor excusing them as faire against Momus, though they come nothing neere the marke: albeit you deale with greater probabilitie, and therefore cary your selfe the bolder, yet deale you like your selfe, and lay still the colours of probabilitie on sophistrie. For whereas in the first, concerning the iudgement of the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all stage-players infamous by their lawe, you saide that the <hi>Praetor</hi> pronounced none infamous but such as played for gaine sake, and I prooved the contrarie by the <hi>Praetors</hi> words: you reply that the <hi>Praetor</hi> meant the same that you say, though his wordes were generall of stage-players without distinction. This in the formost ranke, if it will prevaile. If not; you adde thereto, that the actors of your playes are no stageplayers. But how false both these thinges are, and how fraudulently sought to bee avouched: our bettets, if it please them to compare my proofes with your reply, shall see. For <hi>Tullie,</hi> as I shewed, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the <hi>Romans counting all kindes of stageplayes shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dishonest, agreed that such as played them should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie want the honour of other citizens, but also bee disfranchised:</hi> Which, for the last note of infamie, beeing also witnessed by <hi>Livie,</hi> and <hi>S. Austin</hi> having therevpon observed that <hi>the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans counted all stage-players infamous: Gothofredus</hi> knowing that the edict of the <hi>Praetor</hi> did expresse the iudgement and <hi>law</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and marking that the words of the edict were generall touching all stage-players, saith in the interpreting thereof that both players for gaine sake and without gaine were helde infamous by it, according to <hi>S. Austin</hi> and <hi>Livie.</hi> And this to haue bene truely saide by <hi>Gothofredus,</hi> I declared agreeably to the grounds of law by testimonies of the <hi>Romans;</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:16014:36"/>
of <hi>Cornelius Nepos, Laberius, Iuvenal, Suetonius, Tacitus, Die,</hi> and others. As for that <hi>Vlpian</hi> (whose wordes you cited as the <hi>Praetors)</hi> and <hi>Pegasus</hi> with <hi>Nerva,</hi> doe say that <hi>such as play for gaine sake are infamous,</hi> I aunswered that it foloweth not that therefore they thought free players not infamous: sith the Scripture likewise counteth a woman infamous who prostitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her body vnto men for mony; yet counteth her infamous too who doeth it freely.

            <p>In the second head, to a reason drawn out of the law of God for the reproofe of stage-playes as now you handle it, denying that you made it to proove that men may lawfully put on we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens raiment therein, as I tooke it; though howe iust cause I had to take it so, I haue declared; but vnto this reason groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the <note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 22. 5.</note> law of God in <hi>Deuteronomie, Whatsoever man doeth put on womans raiment, he is abominable to the Lord; But men did put on wemens raiment in your playes; you must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge therefore that you were iustly blamed:</hi> you reply in like sort as vnto the former of the civill law; first, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of men to weare wemens rayment is not generall, but toucheth certaine cases onely; next, that your players did not weare wemens raiment. And because in treating of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition I shewed out of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that it doeth belong not to the ceremoniall law, but to the morall; and no parte of the morall law may bee transgressed, no, not for the saving of honour, wealth, or life: my proofes hereof beeing so cleere, strong, and pregnant, that you durst not deny the thing to bee prooved, you moue a dout, as your terme is, out of wordes of mine; in deede you reason thus against it. <hi>I pray you giue mee leaue to propose my contrary dout. The morall law, as you truely say, is the law of loue and charitie; to the which wheresoever the ceremonial law is repugnant, there it giveth place to the morall. The morall law therefore is never contrarie to loue and charitie, in commanding or forbidding any thing. But the place of Deutero nomie, being taken strictly, absolutely, and in the rigor of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may sometimes hinder the actions of loue and charitie, both towards our selves and others; as in those cases, which both you and I propose. Ergo in that strictnes it belongeth rather to the law ceremoniall, though the equitie thereof pertaineth to the law mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and so it is perpetually and simply to bee observed.</hi> Nowe, I haue given you leaue to propose your contrary dout.

            <p>Sutable to this new argument of yours is the defense of your olde (the onely one you pressed before) from two examples. For whereas you had reasoned thus, <hi>Some men of Macedonie, mooved by Prince Alexander, did putt on Wemens raiment to save the honor of Ladies; the like did Achilles, the sonne of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, to save his life; Ergo it is lawfull to doe it in such cases;</hi> and I made answer thereto, that the reason is naught, because <hi>we are to live by lawes, not by exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples; neyther may we lye or forsweare our selves to save our lives, or benefitt others,</hi> though <hi>David</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> did so, men worthier to be folowed then <hi>Macedonians,</hi> or <hi>Achilles:</hi> you reply, that the reason is good (this must you meane by saying that <hi>the examples are alleadged to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in the circumstances that you apply them for,</hi> or else you delude vs with an other sophisme;) and why? <hi>For Alexanders fact is commended</hi> (say you) <hi>as proceeding from a most noble, and true heroicall minde; and because it was better that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Embassadors were slaine, then that the chastities of so many great Ladies should so dishonorably be either overthrowne, or so much as assailed: and Thetis might well hide her sonne Achilles in a maidens apparell in respect of motherlie love &amp; pitie which shee was to beare her sonne, knowing, as shee did, that hee should be slaine in that iourney to Troy, whether he was requested to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie the other Grecian Lords.</hi> Touching the former wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to admitt, that <hi>Alexanders fact proceeded from a noble true heroicall minde,</hi> and that it was <hi>better the Persian Embassadours were slaine then the chastities of so many great Ladies should so dishonorably be overthrowne, or assailed:</hi> yet doeth it not folow that men might therefore lawfullie put womens raiment on to kill them; the thing might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>venient and good to be done, the meanes of doeing it not good. As <note n="1" place="margin">Satius est impunitum relinqui fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus nocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, quàm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentem damnari.</note> it is <hi>better that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son guiltie should bee left vnpunished, then a person guiltlesse should be condemned:</hi> and <note n="2" place="margin">Trajan the Emperour lib. 19.

of a noble true heroicall minde. Yet were the meanes naught to procure by bribes or by false witnesses the escape or acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of a guiltie person: and if any man, who had vsed such dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, should be commended for it, he should bee commended amisse in that respect, as <hi>Alexander</hi> is by you. Now, for the later, how proove you that <hi>Thetis might well hide her sonne Achilles, as shee did?</hi> You say, that <hi>you thinke not but she might doe it well.</hi> So. Your reason then is: <hi>I thinke shee might doe it well; Ergo she might.</hi> A common kinde of argument with you; but thinne, and leane: nor likely to proove better at the length in triall, of whatsoever plight it seeme in your writing. For let it fare as it may in <hi>Topickes,</hi> in <hi>Analytickes</hi> it must fast: it can not away with <hi>moode</hi> and <hi>figure.</hi> And what if you thinke not that <hi>shee might</hi> neither? as I thinke you doe not; vnlesse you thinke contraries, or speake otherwise then you thinke.

The major of which syllogisme the Lawe (to goe no farder) matched with <hi>Divinitie</hi> by your selfe in this case of rules and limitations, propositions &amp; exceptions, wil approove vnto you.

            <p>So many heads, so many wittes: your fansie lead you an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.

To the fine perswading whereof you take advantage by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that I said: and the point of my sworde, which pearceth through the heart of your defense of playes, you striue (though in vaine, for want of strength) to draw out, and turne against my selfe. For, because I amplified the vnlawfulnes of the thing by the inconvenience and hurt which it breedeth, principally to the <hi>actors,</hi> in whom the earnest care of liuely representing the lewde demeanour of bad persons doeth worke a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of waxing like vnto them; next, to the <hi>spectators,</hi> whose maners are corrupted by seeing and hearing such matters so expressed: you encounter mee herein with two disputes; one, that <hi>neither the spectators of your playes, nor the actors, could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceve any hurt thereby;</hi> an other, that <hi>no evill affections could bee stirred vp thereby, but rather good.</hi> Which points it is a worlde to see how you struggle to proove by shewes of reason; and it will not fadge. Besides, were they prooved: my conclusion standeth neverthelesse entier, because neither of them doeth touch a heare of the <hi>praemisses.</hi> The shewes of reason firste, wherby you would proove that <hi>neither the spectators, nor actors could receue any hurt by your playes,</hi> are these; that <hi>for your pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               <hi>the law of God</hi> condemning stage-playes likewise, because that might goe higher then the <hi>light of nature.</hi> Otherwise, you may be sure that I, who cited him for mens <hi>lawes,</hi> a thing of weaker proofe, would not have omitted the lawe of GOD, his strongest argument.

prooved by those testimonies. For the proofes reach not you immediatlie, they fight not nigh at hande: the proposition doeth; as being the maior of that argument, wherof your stage-players make the minor. And the proposition, condemning all <hi>stage-dansing,</hi> doth giue a deadlyer wound; nether can it choose but light on your stage-dansing: the proofes might seeme to be more easilie avoided; or, comming so farre off, to raze the skinne onely. Againe, my applying of the proposition to you, by the assumption, would deserve more woorthily the name of a comparison: and the assumption being particular, or singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; the proposition vniversall; were not this <hi>applying of all</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some, <hi>a comparison without all measure?</hi>

Quid enim tu me impietatis, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitiae dicis architectum in quaestione de mendacio officioso, in qua ipsum hoc non intelligis, quid sit officiosum mendacium? Etenim meministi, recensuisse te Petri illud in officiosis, quod contra omne officium fidei, &amp; religionis suit. Quid me impurissimo assimulas
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:16014:90"/>
principi, si imò reliqui nullum tibi in eadem quaestione scriptorem extra theologos, at alios omnes nec sine theologis mecum facere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicavi? Te ad epistolas meas amando: caeteros ad libros magis, quàm ad commentationes, de iure belli; quos exituros aliquando, praemonui dedicatione prima ad illustrissimum Comitem: &amp;, Deo volente, edam brevi. Tuae enim istiusmodi admonitiones non te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent me, quem aut in ea parte non improbant viri in Ecclesia, &amp; republica vestra clarissimi, &amp; laudatissimi. Quid me modestiae laesae facis tu reum, qui nunc ex papistico spiritu arces me à tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione librorum sacrorum: Et, quod Erastus ait similibus tui, non vides, tentare haec te cis, annos istos septuaginta? Non vides, te cum eo sic agere imperiose, qui Papae imperium contempsit, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulare patria potuit, &amp; universo regno Papali? Uerissima ferunt, qui haec ferunt: et in his tu vinceris à me, qui pro pietate me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurgas tamen. Communes sunt sacri libri; &amp; in his, quae spectant ad secundam tabulam, nostri magis, quàm vestri. Sic ut, autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati theologorum valde nos tribuere hîc, minimè necesse sit. Doce contrarium tu, si potes. Noli calumniari, me pueros docere, ut de rebus morum non magnopere curent, quid sentiant theologi. nam de me, de iurisconsulto scripsi, &amp; re politica. De re religionis quod scripsi, id sentio: &amp; in ea seriò theologorum valde tribuo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritati. Sed res religionis quid est? Scripturarum interpretatio omnis, aut omnium, non est res religionis. Theologia fidei, &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae magistra est. sed non omnis vitae. nec omnis pars sermonum Dei in solidum vestra est. Ostende diversum, audiam. De ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus theologorum in quaestione ista de histrionibus sic censui, ut quas contra histriones illos publicè mercenarios, &amp; indignarum fabularum actores habent, eae nihili non sint. Sed quae sunt adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sùs omnem histrioniam, eas minus nihilo esse, asserui, &amp; verò eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amnum assero. Pudet earum me, quas Tertullianus, quem unum è nostris iurisconsultis opinantur, adfert adversùs cothurnos tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicos, &amp; fictas scoenicorum personas. Quam etiam obtrudere pro Potentissima videtur, esse nihili, demonstravi. Nec fidenter (ut tu ais) adfirmo, quod nescio: sed tu reprehendis confidentissimè, quae non capis. Audi, audi. Quae in histrionia vitari peccata negotio nullo saepe solent, &amp; possunt semper; ea nihil contra histri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniam faciunt. Sed peccatum illud, si quod est, promiscui vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16014:90"/>
usus vitari saepe solet, &amp; semper potest. Ergo. Qui sensus bonarum aliarum legum est prohibentium hunc usum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stium, idem verisimiliter est &amp; bonae legis Dei. Sed aliarum le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum sensus nihil facit contra histrioniam. Abomin tio ubi dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in Scripturis, ibi peccatum significatur, quod facilè superet flagitia pleraque omnia. Sed hoc vestimentorum non est tale. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ubi dicitur abominatio, ibi hoc peccatum non significatur. Et ubi propria significatio non accipitur, ibi figurata fuerit, vel ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impropria. at in lege illa Dei propria significatio non accipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Quae autem figurata locutio sic exponitur, ut verae sententiae conveniat, &amp; aliis similibus locis stabiliatur, ea benè exposita est. Sed sic exponitur à me figurata illa locutio. Utinam, utinam sic contenderes, &amp; non reijceres argumentis bonis fabulas non bonas semper: quibus illudere pueris potes, nobis non potes. De Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stini sententia, &amp; de sententia Aquinatis ad eundem locum, quas recitavi, &amp; falso, aut frustra urgeri adfirmas, nihil nunc dico, quando tu me ablegas ad scripta tua Anglicana: nisi illud tacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum non sit, ex sententia utriusque adfirmarique, peccatum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiarium non esse flagitiosissimum. Mea sunt reliqua. Et ea (falleris) non dixi nihili esse, quae tu nunquam refutaveris, si tibi sententiam non pronuncias: sed quae aut te, aut me, aut alium mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari ab operibus maioribus tantillum non debeant. Nec morabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur me sanè quaestio haec. Itaque nec à te literas alias de ea expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto, nec expeto. Ego cupiam à te iterum audire, quae à te primo convicia audivi in vita? cupiam illa?</hi> priusquam tu cathedram istam, ex qua ludios laudas, occupares. <hi>Ego ludios non laudo, sed tu cum convicio ludis genere istoe loquendi laudatissimo, &amp; per suasorias Senecae per suasissimo tibi.

Magna ego horum nomina defendo in commentatione mea de histrionibus. Si enim Tobias Matthaeus, si alii tot viri gravissimi, &amp; religiosissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi ist haec iuventutis aut exercitamenta, aut ludos adprobarunt, praefecti, &amp; moderatores collegiorum, atque totius lumina acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miae: si princeps sanctissima, religionis summum praesidium, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Nec enim scripsi ego, oratori necessariam histrioniam, sed poëmatibus: &amp; it a argumentatus sum, Si eius, quod leve, &amp; importunum est in oratoria, ut est actio, habetur ratio tanquam necessarii: eius etiam, quod leve, &amp; importunum est in poetica, habenda ratio est tanquam necessarii. hoc autem hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strionia est.
