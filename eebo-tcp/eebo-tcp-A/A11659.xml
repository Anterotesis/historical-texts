         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of GOD, and the secrets of the
wayes of the most high cannot be
sounded nor found out by us, till
they be discovered and unsecreted
by himself; yet so far as we can
conceive and consider of the course
of divine providence in our present affaires, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to think, that the LORD is about some great work
in the earth. For the cup which hath been propined
to other reformed Kirks is at this time presented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us: We have used all meanes by our earnest inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
by our true remonstrances and humble sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
to informe his Majestie, and to deprecate
his wrath: but finde both his eares possessed by the
false and spitefull misinformations of the late pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Prelats, and of such as hope to catch some
great things in our troubled waters: whereby his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
wrath waxeth hoter every day: as is too sensible
to us his Majesties humble and loyall subjects, who
were expecting a gracious answer to our last suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and may be apparant to all men, by the late
Proclamation and Declaration in <hi>England</hi> Feb. 27.


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17366:3"/>
ordained to be read in every Kirk within that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>We are indeed confident and comforted in this;
that the gates of hell shall not prevaile against the
cause mantained by us, and that in the end glory
shall be to GOD in the highest by the testimony
which shall be given to the kingdome of his son
IESUS CHRIST now in question, that peace shall be
on earth, and good-will and loving kindnesse shall be
to the people of GOD. But in the meane time it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but wound our hearts and grieve us sore; that we
are brought to this extremity, that we must either
perish under the burthen of so many foule aspersions,
or be constrained, to appeare in termes of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
against such pieces and Proclamations as the
malice of our adversaries, prevailing with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
doth lybell and send out continaually against us.</p>
            <p>Although the foresaid Proclamation and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
chargeth us with nothing materiall, which we
have not from the sincerity of our hearts and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
truth and reasons of our proceedings abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
answered before, in our printed Protestations,
information, and answers unto the Declaration made
by his Majesties Commissioner, and unto the Bishops
their Declinatour, yet lest by our silence the cause of
GOD and our innocency in defending thereof, receive
the smallest prejudice in the mindes of the well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and that we may yet more convince the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
if not close the mouthes, of our self-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
enemies, we shall not wearie to make a summarie
repetition and true application of what hath been
formerly written at large.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:17366:3"/>
The title beareth, 1. that the Proclamation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>to informe the loving subjects of</hi> England; which
is the desire of our hearts, and for which we have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured;
being confident that all his Majesties loving
subjects of <hi>England,</hi> after true and full information,
wil allow of our actions, as proceeding from the love
of CHRIST, and of our King and countrey, which
to us are inseparably joyned, and wherein we are so
emulous, that we are heartily grieved, and think our
selves heavily wronged, that in love and loyaltie, we
should be reckoned second, or inferiour, to any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in the Christian world. But what truth of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
may be expected from our Prelats, with their
pages and parasites, who can have no hope of rysing
again, but from our certaine ruine, all the judicious
subjects of <hi>England</hi> may easily discerne.</p>
            <p>2. The title beareth that <hi>by our seditious practises we
are seeking to overthrow his Majesties regall power under
the false pretences of religion.</hi> None of all our actions
is more challenged of sedition, then our necessarie
confession of Faith and nationall Covenant, wherein
we are so far from overturning regall authority, that
<hi>we declared before God &amp; men that we had no intention or
desire to attempt any thing that might turne to the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of the Kings greatnesse and authority.</hi> We could
not so much as imagin, that the refusing of the service
book, and the rejecting of Episcopall government,
which two over-turne the frame of Gods worship
and the discipline of the Kirk, as they were here esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
should ever have been interpreted to be the
overthrowing of regall power; The pillars of true
regall power are religion and righteousnesse, which


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17366:4"/>
by our oath we have endevored to establish, and are
confident, if we can have them in peace, shall be seen
by all the world to be strong supporters of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
throne. Our <hi>practises</hi> are called <hi>seditious,</hi> our
carriages <hi>tumultuous,</hi> our returnes <hi>froward and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi>
our intentions <hi>traiterous,</hi> our informations and
declarations <hi>infamous lybels,</hi> our protestations <hi>muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,</hi>
our covenant <hi>aband or rather a conspiracie against
the Lords anoynted, pretended to be with God, that we may
with the better countenance do the works of the divell, such
as are treasons and rebellions,</hi> our preparations for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<hi>hostile, as if the King were our sworn enemy,</hi> our
aimes to be <hi>the invasion of the good subjects of</hi> England,
<hi>to make whole our broken fortunes,</hi> our actions <hi>increasing
and dareing insolencies,</hi> our present case <hi>a brain-sick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,</hi>
our selves <hi>evil and traiterously affected persons,
factious and turbulent spirits &amp;c.</hi> To which we answer,
1. It may be that <hi>the Lord will look on our affliction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 16. 12. Mat. 5. 11.</note> 
               <hi>and
that the Lord will requite good for this cursing. Blessed
are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and
shall say all manner of evill against you for my sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. These railing accusations have proceeded from
the unchristian hearts of our Prelats, who are rageing
waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame, and
thereby give publick proof, that by the sentence of
excommunication from the Kirk, they are indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
unto Satan, the spirit which now worketh
mightily in them. All their revilings against us, shall
not draw from us one word, which may reflect upon
the Kings Majestie. They have learned an arte, like
unto that practised of old, cunningly to insert the
image of their Hierarchie, into the Kings portract,


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17366:4"/>
that no man can do reverence to the one, but he must
adorethe other, no man speak, or do, against the one,
but he must speak, and do against the other. But we
are not unacquainted with their craft, and God hath
taught us the way to honour the King, and detest trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
sedition and rebellion, without honour done to
them, and without the perfidious acknowledging
of their abjured tyrannie. 3. By two things all
men may perceive, that the Prelats would have their
anger to come to a mischief: the one is, that they use
extreme bitternesse of words. Yet in this they faile of
their end; that their words are rather common rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and flyting, then sharp, pointed and proper, more
labouring to speak all the evill they can devise against
us, then to speak any truth against our persons and
cause. The other is, that they would ingage his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
so far in their businesse, that no place may be
left to a retreat. But in this also we trust they shall be
disappointed, and that they shall never induce his
Majestie, to act any thing which is not revocable.
Princes who ought to be common parents, will not
make themselves a party; for that were to overthrow
the boat by unequall weight on the one side, and
make not only the passengers, but him that sitteth at
the helme to perish; which our Prelats have desperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chosen, rather then to repent, or with <hi>Ionas</hi> to cast
themselves in the sea, that they may perish alone.
Their maxime is old; <hi>when we are dead and gone, let the
earth be burnt up with fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the narrative we are glad that they judge of our
intentions (which are directly known to GOD only)
by our proceedings and actions before the world:


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17366:5"/>
which against their obloquies and misconstructions
we justifie. 1. By our long suffering the outrages
and insolencies of the Prelats; who against the unity
of hearts, authority of Assemblies, order of Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
purity of doctrine and worship and whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of religion in this Kirk (which was the
wonderfull work of Gods greatest mercy to this
kingdome, and the glory of our land) for no other
end, but for satisfying their ambition and avarice
(which are known to be the two great inchanters of
naturall men, and have proven cruell Harpyes against
religion) they did overturne all; bringing in for unity,
division, for authority of Assemblies, their own usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
for order of the Ministerie, episcopall tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
and for the purity of worship, first humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
and thereafter (being now grown by their
rents and Lordly dignities, by their power over the
Ministers and other lieges, by their places in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Councell, Session, Exchequer, and high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to a plenipotent dominion and greatnesse)
they frame a book of Canons for ruling the Kirk and
disposing upon religion at their pleasure. And yet
all this time the greatest opposition was the zeale of
some preachers in giving testimonie to the truth, and
sealing the same by their sufferings, and the groaning
of the people, and their crying to God, that he would
come down and deliver them from these more then
<hi>Egyptian</hi> taskmasters. 2. By the peaceablnesse of
our proceedings, ever since we begune to appeare in
a publick way of opposition: although their insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
ascended so high as without consent or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Kirk, they have framed a service book


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17366:5"/>
to be received in all the Kirks of the kingdome, as the
only forme of Gods publick worship, procured let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of horning against Ministers for that effect, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
it themselves, and not only discharged some
Readers and Ministers who refused the book, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
obtained a charge, that no man under the paine of
death should speak against the Bishops or their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
book: And yet although the book was brought
in without order, and known to be a change of the
whole forme of Gods worship; The Noblemen,
Barrones, Burgesses, Ministers and Commons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veening
although in a very great number, yet in
most peaceable manner without any tumult, did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
supplicat most submisly the Lords of his Majesties
Councell, and direct their supplications to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
for remeeding their just and important grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Thirdly, when their supplications received no
other answer, but terrible Proclamations condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all their meetings and proceedings, and highly
allowing the evils which were their grievances;
their complaints against the many haynous crimes
of the Prelats were not heard, and their distresses still
pressing them more; The supplicants entering into a
deeper search of the causes of all their evils, and of the
barring of their supplications; found them to be from
themselves and their former perfidious dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Covenant of God. And therefore resolved
to renew their nationall oath and Covenant with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
humiliation and prayers to God for reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
and for better successe afterward. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
also to renew their supplication to the Kings
Majestie for a generall Assembly and Parliament, as


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17366:6"/>
the ordinarie and able meanes to redresse their evils,
and essayed all possible wayes of presenting it. They
answered to the full all exceptions taken against the
Covenant, and left nothing undone, which beseemed
Christian subjects, who honour God and feare the
King. Fourthly, after many petitions and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectation
when a generall Assembly was conveened
by his Majesties speciall indiction, and orderly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
in all the members thereof, in the presence of
his Majesties Commissioner; we were forbidden to
proceed and commanded to rise, without any just
cause offered by us. In this extremity of the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
of the Kirk and kingdome in a world of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
upon the one side, and of sitting after the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
on the other part, we chosed that course
which was warranted by Christ, was most agreable
to his Majesties will formerly manifested, and to the
publick weale, as is contained in the supplication of
the generall Assembly directed to his Majestie,
whereof no mention is made in the proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Since
that time we have been threatned with armies and
hostile invasion from <hi>England,</hi> against which we have
been preparing for our lawfull and necessarie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
far from the least thought of invading or harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our neighbours. Our wayes then have been, after
long silence, no other but humble supplications to
GOD and the King, necessary Protestations, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
renewing of our nationall Covenant, sitting in a
generall Assembly conveened by his Majesties indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
information and preparation for necssarie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against open hostility. The particular evidences
of our traiterous intentions are expressed in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17366:6"/>
to be: First, <hi>the multitude of infamous libels
stuffed full of calumnies against the Kings authority.</hi> If
any peice coming from us had been here designed,
our answere might have been particulare; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in generall we are bold to affirme, that what hath
passed from our hands of that kinde, as it hath been
meant to cleare our intentions of disloyalty, so it
carrieth nothing with it which can merite so foule an
aspersion, all being done both in matter and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
with the highest respect we could conceive to
his Majesties sacred person and royall authority, and
with the best construction of his Majesties proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Secondly, <hi>letters sent to private persons in London
and sending some Covenanters to privat meetings at</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<hi>to incite people against the King and to pervert them
from their duty;</hi> A traiterous intention we confesse,
which will never be so happie as to harboure in a
Loyall brest. And as we are assured that such missives
or messengers were never sent from the Covenanters
in common; So must it be, either cunning in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
to alledge that which we cannot prove to be
false, or malice to attribute that unto us, which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
persons have done from their own motions
without our knowledge: That in such a time there
should be found libels or licentious discourses, false
news running up and down, and letters carrying the
names of such authores as never saw them, should
seem nothing strange. And whether the search of such
things with too great diligence, and the suppressing of
them by too much severity, or the neglect and despy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of them by authority, be the best remedie against
them, let statesmen judge. It is known when water is


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17366:7"/>
stopped one way it runneth asunder and breaketh out
many wayes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Our publick contemning of all his Majesties
just commands, and our mutinous protesting against them.</hi>
It is our delight to obey his Majesties just commands,
and is farre from our hearts to contemne any of his
Majesties commands, although unjust, or to protest
mutinously against them: But to protest in a faire
way, and as beseemeth duetifull subjects, is a course
customeable, legall and ordinare, and in some cases
so necessare for preservation of right, and preventing
of evil, that at sometimes it cannot be omitted, and at
no time can give just offence. Fourthly, The fourth
evidence beareth three points, which require particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare
answere. 1. <hi>That no Covenant or band of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is warrantable without civill authoritie.</hi> This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
hath been so fully answered from warrands
of divine &amp; humane authority, both ecclesiasticall &amp;
civill, from the practise of the godly of old, from the
example of our Religious progenitors, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
subscription used in this Kirk, and from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the oath it self, which is nationall, that we trust
all men, who are not strangers to what we have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
are satisfied to the full, except the Prelats &amp; their
adherents, who are endlesse in their cavillations, and
craftily labour to bring us back again to the beginning
of the controversie, that they may (if it were possible)
undoe what hath been done by us. 2. That we have
<hi>rejected the Covenant commanded by authoritie, because
commanded by authoritie.</hi> The reasons not of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting,
but of our modest with-holding of our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
commanded by authoritie are at length set


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17366:7"/>
down in our publick and printed Protestations, <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
22. and <hi>December</hi> 18. in our answer to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
made by his Majesties Commissioner, and
in the acts of the late Assembly, which properly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the publick judgement and interpretation of the
confession of Faith. In all which it is found that the
confession commanded by authoritie according to
the meaning put upon it, is in matters of Religion, not
only contrarie to our subscription in <hi>February,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to the confession as it was meant and professed in
the year 1580, and therefore could not be subscribed
by us, except we would by manifold perjurie have
made our selves transgressours, and have brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our selves a farre greater weight of the wrath of
God, then the first was, which by our subscription
we laboured to avert and prevent. Thirdly, <hi>That our
Covenant is a conspiracie against the King pretended to bee
with God, for doing the works of the devill.</hi> This is a
blasphemie, to which we are sure, neither the Kings
Majestie, nor any fearing God, can be accessory, and
which addeth much to our confidence, that the Lord
hath ratified in heaven the curse pronounced upon the
Prelates, that he will reprove the words which hee
hath heard uttered by them, and that their work shall
not prosper: And therefore comforting our selves
in the Lord our God, who hath been pleased by so
many signes and undenyable evidences, to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and confirme our Covenant, we bring against
them no railing accusation, but say, <hi>The Lord that hath
chosen Ierusalem rebuke them, and save the King.</hi> Lastly,
<hi>Our hostile preparations to invade England:</hi> Against
which as much hath been said and sworne by us in


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17366:8"/>
our late informations, as we trust hath given satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to all good subjects there, although they had
been so uncharitable, which we will never beleeve, as
hastily to have embraced such reports. Our best acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp; which ought to give to that kingdome great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
contentment, will never by them be wrested to
that sense: And although the Prelates in the mood of
despaire to recover their losses, except by our ruine,
traduce us to be desperate hypocrites, yet the event
will bear witnesse, that we have spoken, as men fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great name of our God, with whom we have
reneued our Covenant; and who, when his time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
will be avenged, whither upon our hypocrisie,
or their calumnie. Yet our enemies, seeking the
way to make suspicion, where no cause is, have given
out, <hi>That many, and some of the chiefest amongst us, are
men of unquiet spirits, and broken fortunes, &amp;c.</hi> But
in this they have been evil advised. For suspicions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoughts, are by wisemen compared with bates
among birds, which flee not at the no one-day, but in
the time of twilight. It is known by all, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with this Countrey, that almost the whole
Kingdome standeth to the defence of this cause, and
that the chiefest of the Nobles, Barrons, and Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
are honoured in the places where they live for
Religion, wisedome, power, and wealth answerable
to the condition of this Kingdome; that the meanest
of the commons who have joyned in this cause, are
content of their meane estates, with the enjoying of
the Gospel; and no lesse known, that our adversaries
are not for number, any considerable part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and that the chiefest (setting aside some few


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17366:8"/>
states-men, &amp; such as draw their breath from court)
are known Athiests, or professed Papists, drowned
in debt, denounced his Majesties Rebels, for a long
time past, are under caption of their creditours, and
have already in their imaginations divided amongst
them the lands of the supplicants, which they hope
to be possessed in, by the power of <hi>England.</hi> But we
hope that by this shift they may well be worse, but
they shall be no better. In the meane time against
all these calumnies, the Lord from heaven hath looked
upon the integritie of our hearts, and in his wisedome
hath found the way to clear our innocencie. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
our supplication to the Councel <hi>Ian.</hi> 13. for this
end, and our late information to <hi>England Feb.</hi> 4. we
have the publick testimonie of the councel of the
Kingdome to make it known. A letter sent to <hi>England</hi>
from one <hi>George Sterlin</hi> in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> with the advise
of <hi>Iohn Sterlin</hi> commissar of <hi>Wigtoun</hi> both in neer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the late pretended B. of <hi>Galloway,</hi> did come to
our hands, bearing what the Prelates now say; this was
exhibited to the councel, <hi>Feb.</hi> 22. &amp; 28. with our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
supplication, attestation of the great name of
God, and our own consciences, and offer of our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
or any other meane of purgation to the
contrare, whereupon the Lords of privie councel,
sent up our supplication to the Kings Majestie, with
their own, wherein they humbly supplicate, lest upon
such informations, his Majestie should be more easily
moved to think upon harder courses, than he had
heretofore been pleased to keep with his Majesties an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and native kingdome and subjects; that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
in his accustomed fatherly care of the good and


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17366:9"/>
preservation of this Kingdome, would be pleased, to
resolve upon some such course, as without force of
armes, or shewing of his Princely power, the estate
of this kingdome may be setled, as may be seen at
greater length in the letter it self. We are challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here also as usurpers of regall power. First, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we have taken upon us to command the print,
and forebidden and dismissed the printer, whom his
Majestie established.</hi> This is the old complaint of
the Popish Prelats against our reformers in the yeare
1559. and very untruly by their successours renewed
against us: for we have neither dismissed nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the printer, who still hath his liberty, and resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Nor doth the act of the generall
Assembly, which we take to be here meant, containe
any thing that can be construed to be the usurpation
of regall power, or the smalest diminution of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
royall about printing. It only forbideth
under the paine of Kirk censure to print any piece
that concerneth the Kirk, without warrand of the
Kirk: A power belonging to the Kirk in all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and ordinarly used in this Kirk, not only in
the times of Popery, but since the reformation, as is
manifest by diverse acts of Assemblies censuring ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uses
of printing, appointing some treatises to be
printed, and naming some to revise what was to be
put to the presse. Neither must we think that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Kirk is shorter in her liberties of this sort, then
our Universities are, who without restraint, use their
own liberty; nor will any man think, that schollers
shall have the liberty to print their propositions year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without controlement, and liberty shall be denied


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17366:9"/>
to the generall Assembly to print their acts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions.
Particulare professours use to publish their
treatises with adjurations of printers (because they
have no further authority) that they print them not
in another edition, nor in another character: and shall
not the Kirk make use of that authority which GOD
hath granted her for her own peace and the good of
Religion? Secondly, because <hi>we have conveened the
subjects, raised armies, blocked up and besieged his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
castles &amp;c.</hi> So many of these heavy challenges
as have any shew of truth, are so fully and plainly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in our last protestation <hi>Decemb.</hi> 18. that as
the Prelats needed not to make the objection, so need
we to make no new answere.</p>
            <p>In our last information intended for <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that the true, honest and loyall expressions of
our hearts, are taken to be false, base and fawning pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages:
we are particularly challenged of two scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and most notorious untruths: First, <hi>that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
now raised, are in the hands of Papists.</hi> So indeed
were we informed, and therefore spake with this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(<hi>as we are informed</hi>) and why shall not the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and leaders of the armie, be sutable to the prime
movers, the cause, and end of the work, all which
smell of Rome and of Popery? The other untruth is,
<hi>that some of power in the Kirk of</hi> England <hi>have been the
cause of taking armes for invasion of this kingdome and of
medling with our religion.</hi> This we offer to verifie both
by write, and by the deposition of prime stats-men
and Councellours, against some Kirk-men there,
namely against <hi>Canterburie</hi> himself, that he did nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
with <hi>Rome,</hi> about the frame of our service book


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17366:10"/>
and Canons, that with his own hand he altered, and
interlyned diverse passages thereof, tending to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
with <hi>Rome:</hi> A plot so perilous, that had not
the Lord disappointed it, First, <hi>Scotland</hi> and then <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by him, and such as cooperate with him, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
in their religion, Romish. His reprinted confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Fisher,</hi> will not serve to vindicate his
reputation. And therefore we earnestly intreat all
in <hi>England,</hi> that affect the truth of religion, and the
Kings honour, and all true Patriots that love the
liberty, of the kingdome, to supplicate his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
for calling a Parliament there, that this mysterie
of iniquity which hath been in working this time past
may be discovered, and the prime agents therein, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their demerits may be tryed and punished,
and that this craft and treacherie, in joyning both
kingdomes in a bloody war, that by weakning both,
<hi>Rome</hi> may be built in the midst of us, and the Pope
in end set over all, may be seen and disappointed, that
GOD may have his own glory, the King his honour,
and his subjects may be in safety, from forraine ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
over their bodies, and soules.</p>
            <p>Least the Prelats should passe any point true or false
that may serve their turne; This also is laide to our
charge; <hi>that the Kings lawes are in a manner oppressed
by us, in so much that the judges are so awed as they dare
hardly proceed according to law.</hi> The prime judges of
the land remember, that by them justice hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
us, according to law; not from their own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
but for feare to offend against missives pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
against us: we must also now remember, that
having of late requyred letters of horning and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17366:10"/>
against the excommunicate Prelats, conforme to
the act of Parliament: whereof they use not to deny
the common benefite to the meanest subject; The
Lords of Session resolved upon a letter to be sent to
his Majestie <hi>March</hi> 2. wherein they bring his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
pleasure, signified by his Majesties command,
and otherwise, as the only cause of refusing these let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
according to the act of Parliament, and withall
joyn their most ardent desires and humble wishes for
such peace and quietnesse to the kingdome, as it hath
injoyed before. Which evidenceth that not only the
laws, but the judges are for us, and that from consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of their duty to GOD, the King and countrey,
and not from feare and aw from us.</p>
            <p>To make all that hath been said the more credible,
it is alledged <hi>that some of us refuse both the oath of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeance
and supremacie, and publickly mantaine that we
are not oblidged to take the same, and that three Scotish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
taken in</hi> Wales, <hi>are at this day, imprisoned for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
these oathes.</hi> We can say nothing of these taken
in <hi>Walles,</hi> neither there persons nor their purposes
being known to us. It seemeth that the inquisition is
hote there. But for our selves, although there be a
difference betwixt the oath of alledgeance, and supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie,
and we cannot take the oath of supremacie as
it is extended, and glossed by the flattering Prelats,
yet we heartily rander that to his Majestie which is
due and useth to be given by reformed and sound di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
to the civill Magistrate, knowing that the Fifth
command containing the duty of subjects to their
Princes and rulers, is the First commandment of the
second table, and that our confession of faith, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17366:11"/>
his Majestie to be the Lordsvice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
on earth: to whom the conservation and purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of religion, doth belong.</p>
            <p>As this is the conception which our enemies have
begotten in his Majesties minde against us, so may we
learne by this declaration, what his Majesties inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are against this Kirk and kingdome, and what
birth may be looked for, if divine providence by
changing the heart of our King, or by some other
way known to himself, make not an abortion, or
chock it in time. For first, through the incurable su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
and inveterate malice of the Prelats against
the reformed religion, declaration is made, <hi>that by
introducing the service book, there was not the least thought
of innovation of religion, but meerly to have a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
with the worship of God which is observed in both
the other kingdomes; though evil minded men have wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
somethings in it to a sinistrous sense.</hi> Thus the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
book is still no innovation of religion, but by
our sinistrous sense, is made to seem so: conformitie
with the worship of GOD in other kingdomes, is
urged upon us, as if we were, <hi>tabularasa,</hi> and had not
a forme of worship established by the acts of the Kirk
and laws of the kingdome: meerly to have conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is averred, although the manifold litures and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlynings
of the service book, used in both the
other kingdomes testifie the contrare, by the hands
of our own Prelates and of <hi>Canterburie</hi> himself.
Hence wee must pay for abusing the book, and
the book it self must in the own time be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Secondly, through the pride and greed of our
Prelates, <hi>Episcopall government must be retained as it is


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17366:11"/>
established by acts of Parliament; as known to the whole
world to be most Christian in it self, most peaceable
for the civill estate, most consonant to Monarchicall
government, and without which the Parliament will not
stand compleat of three estates:</hi> Although the truth
is, there be no act of Assembly, nor of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for that office in this kingdome, that it is
known to reformed Christendome, rather to be
antichristian in it self, most prejudiciall to the peace
of the civill estate, and hath in all nations proven
the most pernicious enemy to Monarchs, and true
Monarchicall government. And that the Parliament
hath been, may be, and is in the nature thereof, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and perfect without this excrescence. Hence
Bishops we must have <hi>jure divino</hi> to serve the will
of the Prince in the worship of GOD, and these as
lordly as ever before. Thirdly, <hi>No Covenant must be
indured to which the Kings Majestie shall not consent,
and our Covenant only pretended to be with God, that we
may with better countenance do the works of the devill,
such as are treasons and rebellions.</hi> Hence our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
can be no more endured then treason and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
and the Covenanters either renounce God,
so solemnly attested by them, or punished as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
and traitours. Fourthly, <hi>the question is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to bee no more about the service book and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall
government: But whether the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
shall bee our King or not: And is determined
that we have stricken at the very root of Kingly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
vilified the regall power in his Majesties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and assumed it to our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, it is declared, that <hi>his Majestie is forced to take


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17366:12"/>
armes to establish and set his Kingly authority right here,
to make the best of us see, that he will indure no such Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
as we have made.</hi> Hence resolution is taken
and declared, that for establishing the service book
and episcopall government, for abolishing of our
Covenant, and for being avenged on us, as rebels and
traitours, his Majestie cometh in a hostile war, with
all the power that can be raised in <hi>England,</hi> by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes and by this Proclamation, which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to be reade in time of divine service, in every
Kirk within the kingdome, for that effect.</p>
            <p>Our part in this case is to resolve, whither we will,
with sin and shame lie under the pressing weight of so
many foule aspersions, as rarely in the worst times
have been laide upon Christians, receive the service
book, as the only forme of divine worship, which is
declared by the Assembly to be a masse of errours, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
idolatry and antichristian tyrannie, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
home againe our Prelats and their abjured go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
condemne our reformers and the glorious
work of reformation, renounce our Covenant and
be so many times perjured as we have sworne and
subscribed the same, losse all our labours and paines,
bestowed for so large a time in so good a cause, open
with our own hands a wide doore, and by our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
shew a brode way for the entring of Popery
&amp; of all changes in religion hereafter, lay a stumbling
block in the Kings way to the kingdome of heaven,
and hinder the Queens conversion, give offence to all
the reformed Kirks who have been praying for us,
harden the hearts and strengthen the hands of all the
enemies of the truth at home and abroad, make our


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17366:12"/>
selves an odious spectacle to men and angels, forget
our bygone slavery and our wishes for redemption,
deny our own experience of the mercy truth and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of GOD, so many times, and so many wayes, to
our unspeakable comfort, manifested this time by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past,
losse the posterity and the children that shall
come after us, who shall mourne in misery for our
misdeeds, make the faces of so many to blush and be
ashamed, because of us, leave nothing but laments to
our friends and jubilees of joy to our enemies, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the march of the LORD of hosts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth, and wrest his dis-played banner out
of his hands, pull the crown from the head of
CHRIST our judge, our lawgiver and our
King, grieve and resist the holy Ghost, pull
down the golden-candlestick and put out the light,
and bring all the plagues that are written in the book
of GOD upon us, so that all nations shall say, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath the Lord done this unto this land? What
meaneth the heate of this his great anger? Then men
shall say because they have forsaken the Covenant of
the Lord, therefore are these evils come upon them;
A word of defection could no sooner come from our
mouthes but the horrour of hell should enter in our
souls: Or rather on the contrary use the power which
GOD hath put in our hands, not for invading <hi>England,</hi>
or doing the smalest harme to any of the people of
GOD who trouble not our peace; cursed be the
breasts that harbour such intentions, and the hands
that execute them, but meerly for our own defence
and safety against armed violence and unjust invasion.
And therefore where it is demanded in the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17366:13"/>
               <hi>what we will defend;</hi> we answere; not our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
but our religion, liberties and lives: And
where it is asked <hi>against whom we will defend;</hi> Least
our intentions or actions should be mistaken, by
such as are not acquainted with our case, or miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued,
as contrary to the doctrine of sound divines,
or to the laudable practises of Christians of old, or of
late, we desire that distinction may be made, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
put between the King resident in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and by opening his ears to both parties, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
informed, and the King farre from us in another
kingdome, hearing the one partie, and mis-informed
by our adversaries: Between the King as King, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
royally according to the laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
against rebels, and the King as a man comming
down from his throne (at the foote where of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
supplication of his subjects lyeth unanswered) &amp;
marching furiously against his loyall and weal-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
people: Between a King who is a stranger to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and tyed no further, but according to his own
pleasure, to the professours of Religion, living in his
dominions, and our Kiug professing with us the same
religion, and obliged by his Fathers deed, &amp; his own
oath, to desend us his own subjects, our lives, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
liberties &amp; laws: Again, difference would be put,
between some private persons taking armes for resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
&amp; inferiour Magistrats, Iudges, Councellors,
nobles, Peeres of the land, Parliament men, Barrons,
Burgesses, and the whole bodie of the Kingdome (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
some few either Courteours, stats-men, Papists,
or popishly affected, and their adherents) standing
to their own defence: Between subjects rising, or


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17366:13"/>
standing out, against law and reason that they may
bee freed from the yoke of their obedience, and a
people holding fast their alledgeance to their Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigne,
and in all humilitie supplicating for Religion
and justice, between a people labouring by armes to
introduce novations in Religon contrarie to the laws,
and a people seeking nothing so much as against all
innovations, to have the same Religion ratified, which
hath been professed since the reformation, and hath
not only been solemnely sworn long since by the
Kings Majestie, and by the whole Kingdome both of
old and of late, but also commanded by the Kings
Majestie to be sworn by his Counsellours, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by his Councell to bee subscribed by all the
people as it was professed at first: Between a people
pleading for their own phantasies and foolaries, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
and a people suspending their judgement and
practise about things controverted, till they should
be determined by a nationall Assembly, the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and competent judicatorie, and after determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
receiving and standing for the conclusions of the
Assembly. Whither in this case, and matters so stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
wee shall stand to our own defence, we are
taught by the light and law of nature, by the word of
God in the old and new testament, by the Covenant
betwixt the people and God, by the end for which
Magistrates are ordained of God, by our standing in
our order and line of subordination under God, the
great Superiour, when our immediate Superiours go
out of their line &amp; order, by the testimonies of the best
divines and sound politicians and Lawyers, even such
as pleadmost contra <hi>Monarchomachos,</hi> by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17366:14"/>
contract betwixt the King and the people at the
Coronation, by acts of Parliament, and by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of our own predicessours.</p>
            <p>And now for our brethren and neighbours, in
<hi>England,</hi> whose eares, we suppose, have been filled
with this Proclamation in their particular Kirks;
From that honour which we ow unto authoritie, as
the ordinance of God, and from the naturall and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
affection which we bear unto our King and dread
Soveraigne, borne and baptized amongst us, we are
unfainedly, and from our hearts grieved that first his
sacred eares should be so farre possessed, and next his
royall Name so farre abused by wicked men, as to
receive and give way to so many absurd and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
false calumnies against a whole Nation, his own
native Countrey and Kingdome; It is too manifest
how extremly pernitious, and damnageable are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,
especially universall ones of this kinde, and
therefore to represse them, ought not any law or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
be spared, that may serve to the purpose;
From that love which is due from us unto them, to
whom in verie many respects, and by many strong
bands naturall, civill and spirituall, we are sibber and
more nearly joyned, then to any other Nation or
people on earth, wee are heartily sorie that their
Kirks and hearing are taken up with such discourses
and would wonder at their credulitie, if they should
be beleeved by them; yet because speeches may be
the seminaries of sedition, even amongst brethren,
who are at greatest distance when they have once
begun to divide and discord, we must intreat (if with
so wise a Nation there be any need of intreatie) that


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17366:14"/>
they will not upon any declaration which they have
heard, be suddenly stirred to attempts against us to
our mutuall hurt, or with a golden hook to catch so
small commodities, as may bee hoped for in such a
warre, and by so doing, make both Nations a mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to strangers, and this Yland which hath been bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with so long a peace, to be a field of blood, and
a prey to our common enemies, who now for many
years have been looking upon us with an evil eye, and
are still waiting for an evil houre: that when they hear
of any of our preparations for defence, or of any of our
actions which to us are so necessarie, that without
them our defence is impossible, and wherein there is
no wrong done, or intended against them; they will
judge charitably of us, and of our doings in such an
exigent and extremity, as this is, and that they will
wisely and christianly, supposing our case to be their
own, make use of that common rule of equity, <hi>what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ye would that others did to you, do ye even so to them.</hi>
That hereafter, reports and declarations made against
us by our enemies, be not suddenly beleeved; since the
authours, from the conscience of their own deceitfull
dealing, publish them amongst the <hi>English</hi> only, who
cannot controle the untruth of them, and keep them
up from the knowledge of this kingdome, where they
cannot abide the common light and triall, every
one of the commons knowing their forgerie and
falshood, And when any of them happen to come
to our hands, the difficultie and danger is so great in
carying our answers, and the true information, as
matters now stand, unto their knowledge. And
that they will at last, both poure forth their prayers


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17366:15"/>
to GOD and their supplications to the King in
our behalf; and if need be, use their power for our
lawfull defence against merce-naries and wicked men
the sons of <hi>Beliall.</hi> Are we not their own brethren,
their own flesh and bone? Are we not all under one
roof, in one and the same shipe, and members of one
body? Their religious progenitours at the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
vouchsafed us their help and assistance for
establishing the reformed religion, neither have we
so evill deserved, nor are they so far degenerated, as
that we have reason to feare, that we shall be deserted
by them at this time, the cause being the same, the
case not much different and the persons only chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Our salvation is common. Let us together ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
contend for the faith which was once delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Saints, that mercy peace, and love may be
multiplied unto us.</p>
            <p>Considering also how far our late actions against
the persons of our greatest enemies and the chief
strengths of the kingdome, as of the castle of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,
&amp;c.</hi> are subject to the obloquies of such, as have
to the worst sense wrested all our former counsels
and necessary conclusions; and may be mistaken by
our friends, who looking at a great distance, cannot
well perceive the ripenesse of the occasion and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of our doing, we judged it necessary for si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing
the one, and for satisfying the other, to make
known to all, how we were driven to this by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
exigence of our affaires for our lawfull and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
defence.</p>
            <p>It cannot be unknown to all the subjects of this
kingdome, what have been the terrours and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17366:15"/>
of diverse Proclamations at home, as of that,
<hi>Iuly</hi> 4. and of the other <hi>Decem.</hi> 18. And to many it
is known also what missives have been directed to the
Nobles and Gentlemen of <hi>England,</hi> for attending the
royall banner at <hi>Yorke April</hi> 1. and what Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have been made in <hi>England,</hi> both that of the date
<hi>Ianu.</hi> 29. and above all the last declaration <hi>Feb.</hi> 27.
condemning our loyall proceedings, our humble sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
our legall Protestations, our true and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
informations, and our very intentions (after we
have attested GOD so many times and so solemnly
on the contrare) as false and traiterous, our selves as
rebels and traitours, and therefore denouncing war
in the most hostile manner against us. We are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
what letters have been sent to some of our
cold-friends, to excite them, and some of our profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
enemies, to embolden and strengthen them against
us, with moneys and munition, and with directions
and order for the wayes of their combination and
running together with their forces; and on the other
side, of the large promises and bold undertakings, of
our dis-natured countrey-men, some at court and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
at home, to mak up armies of so many thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
in the North and South parts of the kingdome, for
environing us on all sides. The <hi>Scotish</hi> Councelours,
Nobles, and Gentlemen about court are made to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the Kings Covenant with this addition; That
they shall not acknowledge the late generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
that they shall not adheare to the late Covenant
and band sworn and subscribed by us; And that they
shall oppose against us to the best of their power as
they shall be directed by his Majesties command; Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17366:16"/>
to these warnings and preparations, the
Kings houshold hath entered on their journey, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
last <hi>March</hi> 18. The King himself taketh post
Wednesday next <hi>March</hi> 27. intending on the third
day to be at <hi>Yorke,</hi> or <hi>New-castle,</hi> to march forward
with his forces, The <hi>Scotish</hi> Noble-men appointed
to come home, accompanied with skilled command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to draw together their friends and followers, to
put them in order, and under their generall the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse</hi>
of <hi>Hammilton</hi> to joyn with our forraine enemies
attending the Kings Majestie. The Earl of <hi>Lind-sey</hi>
goeth to sea with 17. of the Kings great ships furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with three thousand Souldiours, to come in their
expedition to such places of this kingdome, as their
commission, when it is unsealed, shall command them;
Six hundreth hors-men are to be sent presently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Scotland,</hi> to infest the borders, our enemies
at home are waiting for their comming; our excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
Prelats and their adhearents are fled to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
the lands and estates of Noblemen, of chief Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones
&amp; Burgesses, who have joyned in this cause, are
designed as a spoil to be parted amongst our enemies.
While matters stand thus, And the maine confidence
of our adverse partie and pursuers is placed in our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
in the power of some Papists and others of
note amongst our selves, and in some places which
are appointed to be strengths for defence of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
against forraine invasion (as is at length cleared
in our Protestation) especially the castle of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
a chief member of our incorporation and the
place of our meetings; There was no time for longer
delay, but in this extremity we must either do or die


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17366:16"/>
either defend our selves or come in the reverence of
our enemies, whose mercies are cruell. And therefore
such dispatch, as ye have heard, in matters necessarly
serving for our defence, hath been used in <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
and in other parts of the land.</p>
            <p>Where this work will end, the Lord whose work
it is, and who hath led us so far on, he knoweth; and
as we resolve to stay where we finde not his presence
going with us: So are we able to justifie what we have
now designed and done, to the consciences of all men:
Shall defence be necessary, and shall the necessary
meanes, without which there can be no defence, be
judged unlawfull? May we not prevent the blow as
lawfully, as repell it? is not the taking of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
out of the hands of our boasting enemies and the
apprehending of such as draw the Kings Majestie to
so hard courses against his subjects, as lawfull, as the
defensive war it self, and is it not more safe both for
the King and the kingdome, then to take them in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell?
The law both naturall and civill teacheth, that
<hi>ad defensionem sufficit, quod praecedat offensa vel justus
timor offensae, nec debet quis expectare primum ictum:
melius enim juraintacta servare, quam post vnlneratam
causam remedium quaerere. Quando praecedunt signa &amp;
actus manifestae offensionis, &amp; quando aliter nos met tueri
non possumus tum inculpata ac necessaria dicitur tutela, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

in dubio insultatus quicquid facit in incontinenti praesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur
ad sui defensione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> facere.</hi> It is enough for defence
that offer of offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or just fear of offence go before.
All our reasons for lawfull defence and for guarding
the castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> militate for us in the surprysall
thereof in this case and at this time. This necessary


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17366:17"/>
prevention was the practise of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> of
<hi>Germanie,</hi> and of our own nation, when for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their religion or liberties they took armes,
which they offered alwayes to lay down how soon
they should be secured; Likeas we declare at this
time, that we take armes not for invasion, not for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of the civill government, not for wronging
any mans person, or to possesse what belongeth to any
man, but for the defence of our religion, liberties and
lives. That even when we hold our sword in the one
hand, we will present our humble supplication to his
sacred Majestic with the other; that how soon our
supplication is granted, our selves secured, and the
peace of the Kirk and kingdome setled, we shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
our swords to fall from us, shall leave nothing in
our power unperformed for perfect pacification, and
shall vow to live and die in obedience to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
laws, and mantainance of his Majesties royall
person and authority, which we heartily wish and
earnestly pray, that GOD would incline his Majestie
to heare, before matters be desperate, and the rupture
become uncurable.</p>
