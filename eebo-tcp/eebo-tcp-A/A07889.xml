            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is the bréeder, and onely bringer vp of good Mariners, ſkilfull Pilots and cunning Nauigators, who to a ſtate are as neceſſary in peace as
<pb facs="tcp:13296:3"/>
huſbandmen for the tillage, and in warre, as ſeruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as ſo many Captaines for the field. Traffique is the carier abroad of our owne home-ſpun commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and a bringer in of the fruites of forraine king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, by which meanes the Merchant and Cittizen grow vp to wealth, and the tradeſeman that liues by the hardnes of his hand, is ſtill kept and mainteyned in good doings. There is no coaſt be it neuer ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, left vnſought no language (be it neuer ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or hard to learne) left vnſtudied, no people (neuer ſo wilde) left vnue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tured vpon, nor any treaſure of the earth or curious worke of man left vnpurchaſed, only for this end, to do honor to our country, &amp; to heape ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to our ſelues, both which benefits do only ſpring out of our Trading to forraine ſhores.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe therefore (A peace being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded beweene the two greaf and opulent kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine)</hi> an engliſh Ship (called the <hi>Three halfe Moones)</hi> being manned with eight and thirty Mariners and brauely armed with munition, was rigd, victualled, and readie furniſhed to take her voyage to <hi>Spayne.</hi> The Gods of the Sea (the windes) knowing her intent, prepared themſelues, to goe along with her, and making the waues ready it becomed this Ship to hoiſt vp ſailes &amp; come on, So that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> a merry gale ſhee tooke her leaue at <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> bending her courſe towards <hi>Siuill,</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Cittie in <hi>Spaine.</hi> Gallantly did ſhee for many dayes beare vp her head, and daunced euen on the top

But (alacke!) howe ſoone does the happineſſe of this world alter? In this brauery had ſhée not caried her ſelfe long, but entring into the <hi>Sraights, Neptune</hi> grew angry with her, or els enuying her glory, ſent eight gallies of the <hi>Turkes</hi> to beſet her round. Now or neuer was both the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and the cunning of the Mariner to bee ſhewed, for either he muſt by the wings of his ſailes fly away and ſo ſaue himſelfe, or manfully ſtand to it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue all from danger or gloriouſly to ſuffer all to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. Of flight was there no hope, for the windes &amp; waues (that before were their freinds and tempted them to ſet forth) grew now trecherous and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their deſtruction.

It was a goodly ſight to behold how to the very face of danger they did defie danger, and howe in the midſt of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow which had round beſet them, they wiſely and ſtoutly laboured to worke out a ſafetie, nothing

            <p>For after the cloſe fights were made ready aboue and that the deuiliſh mouthes of their <hi>ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> were opening to ſpit hell fire out of the bellie of the Ship: vp comes the Maiſter (whoſe name was <hi>Groue)</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſword and target, wauing his bright blade about his head in defiance of his barbarous and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enemies: his very lookes were able to fright death from his company, and ſo wel did his courage become him, that it ſerued better then all their warlike muſicke to hearten vp the reſt: cloſe by his ſide (as vowed partners in all fortune good or badde whatſoeuer) ſtoode the Owner, the Maiſters mate, Boteſwayne, Purſer and the reſt of the Mariners. All of them armed, all of them full of valor, al of them full of braues: they ſhewed on the top of the hatches, like ſo many well garded battleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts on the walls of a beſieged citty, euery man encoraging his next neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bor, to fight valiantly becauſe they were <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> and to die honorably (becauſe they were <hi>Chriſtians)</hi> rather then ſtoope to the baſecaptiuitie of thoſe, that were <hi>Chriſts</hi> profeſſed and open enemies.</p>

As the Engliſhmen were thus buſie to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues on the one ſide, ſo were the <hi>Turkes</hi> actiue in their Gallies on the other ſide, their <hi>Semytaries</hi> gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the Sun, their ſteeele targetts receaued the fire of his beames vpon them, and beat it backe to dazle the eyes of them whom they aſſailed: Showers of muſketts with bullets chargd ſtood ready to bee powred downe, ſome were preparing to toſſe balls of wilde fire, as if the Sea had bin their tennys court, others with bulles pizzells in their hands walkt vp &amp; downe betweene the <hi>Rowers,</hi> ſomtimes encoraging ſometimes threatning, ſometimes ſtriking the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable gally ſlaues, becauſe they ſhould be nimble at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oare who for feare of blowes more then of preſent death, tugd with their armes, till the Sinewes of them were ready to cracke with ſwelling, &amp; till their eie-balls in ſtead of bullets did almoſt fly out of their heades.</p>
            <p>At length the drummes, trumpets, &amp; fifes ſtrake vp their deadly conſort on either ſide: preſently does y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> demy canon &amp; culuering ſtriue to drownd that noiſe whilſt the Sea, roares of purpoſe, to drowne the noiſe of both. In this conflict, of three elements, (Aire wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and fire) <hi>Iohn Raynard</hi> (the Gonner) ſo liuely. &amp; ſo ſtoutly be haued hinſelfe, in diſcharging his <hi>ordnance</hi> of their great bellies, that at length fire ſeemed to haue the maiſtry, for ſo thickly did his bulletts fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, &amp; were wrapt vp in ſuch cloudes of lightning, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſea ſhewd as if it had bin al in flames, whilſt the

Gallies of the <hi>Turkes</hi> aſwell as the Engliſh Shippe, could hardly but by the grones and ſhowtes of men beene fownd out where about in the Sea they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. Many <hi>Turkes</hi> and many gally ſlaues did in this battaile looſe their liues, and end their Captiuitie: but thoſe who ſuruiued doubling their ſpirits at the horror of the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger with which they were inuironed fell vpon the Engliſh Shippe in ſuch ſtormes of haile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, which ſtill like hammers on an Anuill) lay bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the ribs of it, that at length, the Sea offred in many places to breake into her, and to get the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, of which glory the <hi>Turkes</hi> being enuious, came flying with the force of all thoſe wodden wings that bore them vp, and of purpoſe to board her. But at this ſtirring feaſt, <hi>Neptune</hi> was made drunke w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> the bloud both of <hi>Chriſtians and Turkes</hi> mingled to gether. Here came the gallyes and the Ship to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, looke howe a companie of howndes, hang vppon a goodly Stagge, when with their noiſe they ring out his death, So hang theſe Gallies, vppon the bodie of her: nothing of her coulde bee ſeene for Smoke and fire, ſhee was halfe choked with the flames and halfe ſtifled in the waters. Yet as you ſhall often ſee a Bull, when his ſtrength ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee all ſpent, and that he is readie to faint and fall on his knees, caſtes vp on a ſuddaine his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly head, and brauely renewes a freſh and more feirce encounter: So did this ſhip breake from the Gallyes, like a luſtie Beare from ſo manie dogs or
<pb facs="tcp:13296:5"/>
rather like an inuineible Lion from ſo manie beares. The <hi>Turkes</hi> leapd out of their veſſells, and like ratts nimbly climed vp to the taclings of the ſhip, But the Engliſh Mariners, ſo laid about them with ſwords, browne bills, haluebeards, and morris pikes, that in ſo tragicall an act it was halfe a comedie to behold what tumbling tricks the <hi>Turkes</hi> made into the ſea backwards. Some of them catching hold of the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per deckes, had their hands ſtrick off, and ſo for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer loſt their feeling, other claſping their armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a cable, to fling their bodyes into the ſhip, loſt their heads, &amp; ſo knew not which way to goe though it lay before them. In this terrible inſurrection in <hi>Neptunes</hi> kingdome it was hard to tell for a great while who ſhould bée the winners, albeit how ſoeuer they ſped, both were certaine to bee looſers, for the <hi>Turks</hi> would not giue ouer, &amp; the Engliſh ſcorned to yéelde, the Owner, Maiſter and Boteſwayne cryed out brauely and with lowd luſty ſpirits let vs all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to die, but not a man bée ſo baſe as to yéeld to a<hi>-Turke:</hi> eſpecially did the Boteſwayne ſhew the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courage of a Mariner, both in directing without feare, and in beſtowing blowes in ſcorne of danger, which hard almes whilſt hee was dealing amongſt the <hi>Miſcreants,</hi> a ſhot was ſent from a gally as a meſſenger of his death, &amp; ther by a ſpoiler (though not a conqueror) of his valour, for it brake (with the vie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtroke it gaue) his whiſtle in ſunder, &amp; left him an the hatches with theſe laſt words in his mouth,
<pb facs="tcp:13296:6"/>
Fight it out as you are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and win honor by death.</p>
            <p>His fall did not abate but whetted their ſtomackes to a ſharper reueng, onely the maiſters mate, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe not worthie of that name, or to bée mate to ſo noble a maiſter as he was, for cowardly he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yeeld, yeeld, pulling in his arme from ſtriking in the hotteſt of the ſkirmiſh.</p>
            <p>What cittie is not ouer come by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyrany of <hi>Time,</hi> or the oppreſſion of aſſaults? what ſhoares though neuer ſo high can beat back the ſea, when he ſwelles vp infury? what caſtles of flynt or marble are not ſha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the continuall thunder of the Canon? So was this poore Engliſh ſhip: whilſt her ribs held out, and were vnbroken, her Mariners held out and had their hearts ſound. But when they felt her ſhrinke vnder them that ſhould beare them vp in all ſtormes and that ſuch numbers of <hi>Turkes</hi> did ſo oppreſſe them with thronging in, and with beating them downe, when they had ſcarce féete able to ſtande, then euen then did they not yéelde, but yet then were they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>Glad was the <hi>Turke</hi> that (though in this ſtorme it rayned down bloud ſo faſt) he was wet no farther: hee looked vpon his ill gotten commodity with a dull &amp; heauie eye, for the foote of his account ſhewed him that his gaines of this voyage woulde not anſwere the treble part of his loſſes: Inraged at which, emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying the wetherbeaten and the mangled ſhip both of

men, and of ſuch things as were woorth the cariage, the one he tooke home with him to enrich the number of his ſpoiles, the other were condemned to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
            <p>Néere to the cittie of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> (being a hauen towne) &amp; vnder the <hi>Turkes</hi> dominion) is a Road, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by ſtrong walles, wher the gallies are drawn vp on ſhore euery yeare in the winter ſeaſon, and are there trimmed &amp; layd vp againſt the <hi>Spring.</hi> In this Roade ſtandes a priſon where all thoſe that ſerue in thoſe gallies of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> are kept as captiues, ſo long as the ſeas bée rough and not paſſable for their <hi>Turkiſh</hi> veſſels: hither were theſe Chrſtians brought the firſt villany and indignitie that was done vnto them, was the ſhauing off of all the hayre both of heade and beard, thereby to rob them of thoſe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which all Chriſtians make much of, becauſe they beſt become them.</p>
            <p>It is well knowne to all nations in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (by the wofull experience of thoſe wretches that haue felt it) what miſerie men endure in this thraldome vnder the <hi>Turke.</hi> Their lodging is the cold earth, their diet, courſe bread and (ſometimes) ſtinking water, for if they ſhoulde taſte of the cleere Springe, their drinke were as good as the <hi>Turkes,</hi> who neuer taſt wine: their apparell, thin and courſe canuas, their ſtockings and ſhooes, heauie bolts and cold Irons, the exerciſe to put life into them, or to catch them a heate, is at the pleaſure of a prowd and
<pb facs="tcp:13296:7"/>
dogged <hi>Turke</hi> for the leaſt fault, nay for none at all, but onely to feede his humor, to receiue a hundred baſtinadoes on the rim of the bellie with a bulls dried péezle, at one time, and within a day after two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſtripes on the backe.</p>
            <p>In this moſt lamentable eſtate did theſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans continue, but it was not long ere the Maſter and Owner by the good meanes of freindes were redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from this ſlauery: the reſt lying by it, ſoone were ſtarued to death, others with cold, and blowes brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed out their laſt.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Iohn Reynard,</hi> (the gonner) being enabled by the prouidence and will of God to endure this affliction with a ſtronger heart then others coulde out liued moſt of his fellowes, onely to bée (as it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fell out) a preſeruation of his owne life, with ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny other Chriſtians. For hauing ſome skill in the trade of a barber, hée did by that meanes ſhift now and then for victuals and mended his hard dyet, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>upon growing (after a long impriſonment) into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with the <hi>Keeper</hi> of the Chriſtians that were gal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſlaues, hee ſo behaued himſelfe, that at length hee got libertie to goe in and out to the Roade at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, paying a certaine ſtipend to the <hi>Keeper,</hi> &amp; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a locke about his legge: and this libertie did ſixe more likewiſe purchaſe vpon like ſufferance, who by reaſon of long impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, were neuer ſuſpected to ſtart aſide, or that they had in their boſomes euer any thought to workethe <hi>Turkes</hi> any miſcheife, with
<pb facs="tcp:13296:7"/>
whom they had ſtayed ſo long, that in a maner they were as brothers familiar together.</p>
            <p>But the wrath of winter driuing all the Gallies into harbor, by which meanes they lay there vnrigd and diſfurniſhed of al their properties which ſet them forth: the Maiſters, Captaines, and officers of the Gallies, retiring likewiſe either to their priuate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, or to ſome other imployment of the State: behold there remayned (at this ſeaſon and parte of the yeare) in this priſon of the Road, 266. Chriſtian priſoners, who were of fiftéene ſeuerall nations, and all of them taken and made ſlaues to the <hi>Turke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt which there were (at this time) but onely thrée Engliſhmen, &amp; of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was this <hi>Iohn Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> one: who hauing worne out the miſerie of 13. or 14. yeares ſeruitude vnder ſo barbarous a tyrant, beganne (as hee full often had done before) to call to minde the happines and fréedome of his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which comparing to his preſent ſtate, he wept to remember the one, and gat vp his manly courage and caſt in his thoughts how to ſhake off the other.</p>
            <p>Not farre from the Roade, ſomewhat néere to one ſide of the Citty, was a victualing houſe which one <hi>Peter Vnticaro</hi> had hired, paying alſo a certaine fee for his libertie to the keeper of the Roade, this <hi>Peter Vnticaro</hi> being a Spaniard borne, and a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, had beene priſoner vnder the <hi>Turkes</hi> by the ſpace of 30. years, yet neuer (though many times the forelock of occaſion was thruſt into his hands did he
<pb facs="tcp:13296:8"/>
practiſe any means for his enlargement, but liued ſo quietly &amp; ſo conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tedly in outward appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as if he had forgotten that he was borne amongſt chriſtians, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee euer deſired to be buried amongſt them. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, did <hi>Iohn Reynard</hi> open his intent to this <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented to put it in act, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in few daies after a third perſon (of their fellow priſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners) was drawne into the conſpiracy: which there ſo often as they could without ſuſpition held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to gether, laide ſeuerall plots for their eſcape and at the end of ſeuen weekes or there abouts, their councels had fully begot the meanes of their preſent deliuery. Fiue more therefore are made acquainted with the buſineſſe to all whom libertie being ſweete, (eſpecially out of ſo baſe and in famous a ſlauery,) theſe eight reſolued (in three nights following) to free not onely themſelues but all the reſt of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that were in priſon. In y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> priſon doe theſe eight meete (at a time conuenient) and there did <hi>Reynard</hi> &amp; <hi>Vntecaro</hi> deliuer to all the reſt what was intended: euery man was glad of the newes, euery man vowed to aſſiſt them, &amp; in the action to win free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or to end their liues. Upon this confident truſt put ech vpon other, <hi>Reynard</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> ſecretly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with files, which they had as ſecretly prouided for the purpoſe, charging euery perſon to beſtir himſelfe nimbly, and to haue his heeles at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from ſhackles by ſuch an hower of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> following euening.</p>

The night approching, <hi>Reynard</hi> and <hi>Vnticaro</hi> with the other ſix, being at the ſpaniards houſe, ſpent their time merrily, to blind the eies of ſuſpition, till darkenes had taken hold of the world, at which time <hi>Peter Vnticaro</hi> was ſent to the Maiſter of the <hi>Road</hi> in name of one of the Maiſters of the Cittie, with whom the keeper of the Road was acquainted and at whoſe requeſt he would gladly come: who deſired him to meete the other at <hi>peters</hi> houſe preſently, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to bring him backe againe to the Roade.</p>
            <p>The keeper vpon deliuery of this meſſage, agreed to goe with <hi>Vnticaro,</hi> commanding the warders not to barre the gate, becauſe his retourne ſhoulde be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
            <p>In the meane ſeaſon had the other ſeuen who ſtaied in <hi>Peters</hi> houſe, furniſhed themſelues with ſuch wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons as the time and place did afford them, amongſt whom <hi>Iohn Reynard</hi> had gotten an old ruſty ſword blade, without either hilt or pummel, which not with ſtanding by bending the hand-end of the ſword in ſtead of a pummell, to ſerue his turne, the other had ſpitts and glaues &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The keeper of the <hi>Road</hi> being with <hi>Vnticaro</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the houſe, the lights were of purpoſe put out and no noiſe of any liuing creature to be heard: At which the keeper of the <hi>Roade</hi> being aſtoniſhed, and ſuſpecting ſome villanie, ſtept backe, but <hi>Iohn Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> hauing hid himſelfe in a corner next to the dore, ſtept forth vnto him and ſtopped his paſſage, who
<pb facs="tcp:13296:9"/>
perceiuing it to be <hi>Iohn Reynard,</hi> and that he was armde (as he might wel feare) for miſcheife, ſaid thus O <hi>Reynard</hi> what haue I deſerued at thy hands, that thou ſeekeſt my death. Marrie this haſt thou deſerued (quoth <hi>Reynard)</hi> and ſtrucke him on the head, that he cleft his ſkull, thou haſt bin a ſucker of much Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian bloud, and therefore die like a villaine, no ſooner was his hands lifted vp to giue his fatall blowe, but the reſt (being at his elbow) came forward, &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpatched him, cutting of his head and ſo mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him that he could not be knowne.</p>
            <p>This prologue to the <hi>Tragedie</hi> going off ſo well, heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was by this time hung al ouer with black to ad a grace to that which was to be acted: no time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe they looſe, but ſteale ſoftly and yet reſolutely to the <hi>Road,</hi> where entring they found ſire warders onely, who aſked <hi>who is there:</hi> All friends replied y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>-other &amp; were let in, But inſtead of welcomes blowes were giuen and the ſixe warders in a ſhort time left dead on the floore.</p>
            <p>Upon this, (taking their enemies weapons to defend themſelues,) were the gates preſently barred vp ſtrongly and the mouth of a Canon planted full vpon it, readie charged and one appointed with a linſtocke to giue fire if any aſſalt were made vpon them. Then entered they into the Iaylors lodge where they found the keyes both of the <hi>Fortres</hi> and of the priſon, by his bedſide, and in his chamber were they armed, with better weapons. In this lodge of the keepers,
<pb facs="tcp:13296:9"/>
founde they likewiſe a cheſt, which <hi>Vnticaro</hi> and one or two more opening, found well lined with Duckets: the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and ſome others neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the buſines in hand, ſtuft their boſomes and pockets with this golde, but <hi>Reynard</hi> diſſwaded them from that couetouſneſſe which was likely to bee the ouerthrowe of them all, wiſhing them to prouide for their liberty which ſhoulde retourne to the honour of God and of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, rather then to ſell their liues yea perhaps their ſoules for the treaſure of <hi>Infidelles.</hi> But the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and his companions liked the colour of the Duckets better then <hi>Iohn Reynards</hi> doctrine, and therfore they haſtned away to the priſon, whoſe dores being opened, It appeared that they with their files had plied their worke aſwell within, as the other had with their weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s abroad for euery mans legges were deliuered from his Irons: whereupon hauing firſt put certaine warders (that were to looke to the priſon) to ſilence for euer ſpeaking more, they all fell roundly to labour, ſome to ramming vp the gates, ſome to launch out a certaine Gally which was the beſt in all the <hi>Roade,</hi> and was called the <hi>Captaine</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſome caried maſtes, others fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Sayles, others laide in oares, all of them were buſie, all of them ſweat hard, yet none of them were weary.</p>
            <p>In killing thoſe <hi>Turkes</hi> that were warders
<pb facs="tcp:13296:10"/>
about the priſon, eight other <hi>Turkes</hi> hearing a noiſe, and ſuſpecting miſcheife, got vp to the top of the priſon, betwéene whom and the priſoners, (who coulde not come neare them but by ladders) was a hot ſkirmiſh. Some were wounded on both ſides, ſome ſlaine outright. <hi>Iohn Reynard</hi> was thrice ſhot through his apparrell but not hurt: <hi>Peter Vnticaro</hi> and the reſt that ſhared in the Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets being not able to cary their bodies in this danger, by reaſon of the gold about them, which wearied them with the weight were there firſt mortally wounded, and afterwere ſtricken down dead.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the <hi>Turkes</hi> was one thruſt through, who falling from the toppe of the priſon wall, made ſo horrible a noyſe that the <hi>Turkes</hi> who dwelt within hearing (for here and there ſtoode a houſe or two ſcattring) came to take him vp ere he was ful dead, and by him vnderſtood, how the Gally ſlaues were reckoning with the <hi>Turkes</hi> about their ranſome without paying any thing but cracked crownes towards it: hereupon they raiſed both that part of <hi>Alexandria</hi> which lay on the weſt ſide of the <hi>Roade,</hi> and a Caſtle which was at the ende of the Cittie next to the <hi>Roade,</hi> alſo another fortreſſe which lay on the other ſide of the <hi>Roade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Allarum thus on euery ſide being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, danger and death did round about beſet the
<pb facs="tcp:13296:10"/>
poore <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> there was but one onely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to eſcape foorth, and that lay betweene the very iawes of deſtruction: yet not withſtanding no mans heart failed him, the nearer death came towardes this companie of wretches, the leſſe ſeemed they to care for his threatnings, for the <hi>Roade</hi> is ſtill repleniſhed with luſty Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, with ſtout labourers and with tough Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, all whoſe handes are full of helping one another in this great worke of life and death, ſome to victuall the gally that muſt ſaue them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to hang vp the tacklinges, others to line it with ſhot for defence againſt enemies, but the moſt part were buſie in keeping the <hi>Turkes</hi> from the wall of the <hi>Roade.</hi> In the end all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a readines, euery man leaped into the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ioyfully, hoiſted vp ſailes luſtily, and lanched into the Seas merrily, ſubmitting their liues, and fortunes to the mercy of him, that commands both ſea and land.</p>
            <p>The veſſell flotes on the waues like a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pageant, ſhee flies away by the helpe of oares as if ſhee had borrowed ſo many winges, and in a moment is ſhee gotten ſafe out of the <hi>Road,</hi> but hauing eſcaped one danger, ſhée encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a greater, for now on both ſides of her, doe the two Caſtles ſende out their vengeance: the Canons roare, and ſhoote to ſinke them, the waues watch that aduantage and gape to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure

them: fortie and fiue bullets, (dreadfull as thunder) fell about theſe Chriſtians eares, yet not one of them bruiſed their heades: they came out of the <hi>Roade</hi> ſafely, and went from the danger of the Caſtles ſecurely, for ioy whereof, they gaue a luſty ſhout, that ecchoed and reboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded backe againe betweene the cloudes and the ſhore.</p>
            <p>On they went, and though the windes beganne to grow angry, and to threaten ſtormes, yet with cheerefull hearts did they chooſe rather to periſh in the eye of heauen, and by the hand of God, then to bee fetched backe againe and beare the yoake of <hi>Infidelles.</hi> For caſting their eyes backe, they might beholde the <hi>Turkes,</hi> (for by this time the ſunne was a good way on his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noones iourney) comming downe to the Sea-ſide in ſwarmes like locuſts to deuoure a country: all of them laying their handes to launch out Gallies, and follow the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But ſuch a ſpirite of rage, madneſſe, diſorder, and feare, fell vppon them, that what one ſet forwarde, three hindred. And as in a Cittie fired in the night time, men are ſo aſtoniſhed, that they ſcarce can finde the common wayes by which they may ſaue themſelues, no more could the <hi>Turkes</hi> in this wilde &amp; giddy tumult, know how to furder themſelues.
