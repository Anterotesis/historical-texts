            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Malachi</hi> (in English, Messenger

to prepare the way before the

MESSENGER OF COVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANT,
viz. CHRIST. These
speaches of <hi>Malachi,</hi> (or last
ANGEL of the old Covenant)

Chapter 1. 20. bringing
newes of IESVS: and Chap. 2.
1. The Messenger of Covenant
is borne: and Chap. 3. IOHN
BAPTIST the PREPARER
of Christ his way, is introduced
in that worke. <hi>Mark</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

in <hi>Malachi,</hi> &amp; the first
BREATH of the Newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the mouthes of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VANGELISTS,
is all ONE
BREATH CANONICALL
from Heaven. They looke not

            <p>Who nowe dare hinder their

            <p>Exercise thy selfe in pervsing
the Bible, the whole of al these
several writs, and thereby thou
shalt easilie (God his Spirite as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
<pb facs="tcp:8441:6"/>
thee) discerne the true
Christ from False, the True
Church from the False: True
writ from False: and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
all holy Trueth from
Falshood. And for helping thy
weake Memorie, as also, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a taste of that large Truth,
in short speach, I haue (throgh
God his helpe) manifested my
poore power, but riche good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
in this little booke. First,
I haue in English Poësie (drawn
according to an ancient <hi>staffe</hi>)
delivered summarily the hysto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the olde and newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Secondly, vpon the most
difficult points of the Poësie, I
haue dilated by way of Illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not only for the fulfilling
of the hystorie: but also for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing
sometimes, some neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
question: as also annexed
hereto, such certaine computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of time, for speciall joynts
<pb facs="tcp:8441:7"/>
of the Story, as whereby the
spirituall minded, may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
bee furthered to deeper
points contemplatiue. As thou
shalt receiue any good hereby,
so I pray thee be thankful vnto
God therfore, &amp; quickly thou
shalt finde his hand vpon thee
to every good work. The Lord
be with thy spirit Amen.</p>

The word importing Halfe, some vnderstand it of
the first halfe: Some of the latter halfe of the 7.

the Newe Testaments Revelation, where it is

be so long in the Wildernes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. Neither is
this (for many mysteries that seeme to arise from

                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> In the first hee was. Neither might any soule-maime debar any Circumcised from the old Supper: nor yet any Soul-soare vnseene in the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, debarre from the newe Supper. Seene and knowne pollutions in the bodies of the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, would debar them the holy Congregation and Supper: so, only seene and knowne sin vnrepented, can debarre such the newe Testaments Assemblie and their holy Supper.</p>
                        <p>To the question therefore I answer thus: Many learned and worthie deep reverence, haue written, that <hi>Iudas</hi> was present: but yet I see somthing that keeps me from so thinking. But first let it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>Iudas</hi> was there a Communicant, what then? you wil (it may be) with others conclude, <hi>Then may wicked ones</hi> be admitted to the Lords Supper; I answer, it prooveth not, that <hi>Knowne wicked</hi> may bee admitted: for <hi>Iudas</hi> was not an open wicked one, but a secret wicked one, and therefore vnder God his Iudgment, that knowes the heart, and not vnder mans censure, who knowes not the heart.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obiect.</hi> The man Christ knewe him for a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and yet would not debarre him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:8441:70"/>First, the Man Christ knewe him not alreadie a Traytor, for as yet he had not betrayed Iesus: and Man must censure <hi>Actions,</hi> or things that bee <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> not <hi>Latent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, Christ as he was man knewe not that hee had such a trayterly thought in his heart, no more then as he was the sonne of man hee knewe the latter day: for every meane wit knoweth, that Thoughtes of men, and personall Future Actions, were communicated vnto his Man-hoode by the God-head, or his divine nature. If <hi>Iudas</hi> then had beene present, hee was to Man there, considered as man, an hypocrite or vnseene Traytor: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing maketh, for admission of vnrepentant knowne wicked, to the Lords Table.</p>
                        <p>But as before I saide, I rather think he was not there, for this cause: Blessed <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 13. Chap. 30. Verse, saith: <hi>As soone as he</hi> (namely, IVDAS) <hi>had received the soppe, he went immediatly out.</hi> Now, the <hi>Soppe</hi> was no part of this <hi>Newe Supper,</hi> but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the old Testaments Supper: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iscariot</hi> went out from them, <hi>Immediatly</hi> vpon the receipt of the <hi>Soppe,</hi> (and so saith <hi>Iohn</hi>) then went he out to go vnto the high Priests, before the Institution of the Newe Supper: and this let the godlie hearted consider.</p>

                        <p>(c) As <hi>Marie</hi> had much forgiven, so shee-loved much. Her loue partly appeared, in this her earlie repaire to the Sepulcher. Before her comming, an Angel from Heaven had rowled the sealed stone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, Iesus was risen, and the hyred watchmen were gone to the Rulers; who bribed the Soldiers, to the end they should say, that Iesus his Disciples had in the night stole away the body.

                        <p>Fiftly, hee appeared to the Eleven (the greater number bearing name of the whole) at night being assembled to holy exercise, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. who brething on them, said: <hi>Recciue the holy Ghost: Whosoeuers sins ye remit, they are remitted vnto them: and whose sins soeuer yee retaine, they are retained.</hi> At this time, <hi>Thomas Didymus</hi> was wanting.

that Temple was a figure not onely of the whole

we receiue the knowledge of all necessaries: but in

                        <p>As all these Epistles tend to the advancing and
confirmation of the christian faith: so, for this time,
I will propound some speciall heades of Doctrine,
wherein one Epistle is more copious than another,
or at least, first in order according to the vsuall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Epistles.</p>
                        <p>In the Epistle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> I obserue: First,
the Apostles concluding all (Iewe and Gentile) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
sinne, taking away all merit by workes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
delineating or plainly picturing foorth the
difference betwixt the <hi>Carnall</hi> and <hi>Spirituall</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Secondly, I obserue his plaine proving of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi>
generall calling and obedience to the Christian
Faith, what time the <hi>Fulnes of the Gentiles be come
in.</hi> Hereof see, 1. part, at <hi>Iuda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>s Ozias.</hi> Thirdly, the
doctrine of obedience to Princes and Magistrates,
not so much for feare of the sworde, as for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
sake. Fourthly, I note the doctrine he delivers
for supporting the weake brethren.</p>
                        <p>In the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> I obserue spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie;
First, the <hi>Methode</hi> of truly preaching Christ.
Secondly, the danger by having any communion
with an open leavened, or vnrepentant brother: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
with the carriage due towards such. Thirdly,
I note the power is given to the Saintes for iudging
their owne causes civill. Fourthly, the Apostle put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
an end to questions touching single life, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such married Couples, as whereof one was an
vnbeleever; touching the dutie of such as were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the Christian faith, in such or such Vocation.
Fiftly, I note his doctrine concerning the vse of
meates sacrificed first to Idoles. Sixty, the true vse
of spirituall guiftes. Seaventhly, the absolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of <hi>Loue</hi> (or <hi>Charity</hi>) in a Christian. Eightly, the<pb n="164" facs="tcp:8441:84"/>
description of the <hi>Schoole of Prophecie.</hi> Chap. 14.</p>
                        <p>Vnto this holy exercise of <hi>Prophecie,</hi> hee stirreth
vp every particular man (for women <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

specially after Prophecie. Every man that hath a

                        <p>The brother that is able onely, or specially, to
teach in a strange tongue, hee in this holy Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

                        <p>They that Prophecie, that is, which divide the
word and apply it to the soule (<hi>Verse</hi> 24. 25.) are at
the most to be but three, (for one season of Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie)
every one orderly teaching after another: the
Iudgement of whose doctrine and discreet Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
appertaineth in the first place to the other
Prophets. The principall of this holy Schoole, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
to be the <hi>Doctor,</hi> even as is the <hi>Pastor</hi> over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
peculiar exercises.</p>
                        <p>Fiue peculiar <hi>Graces</hi> or <hi>Guifts</hi> are in this School,
to be vsed for aedification. 1. The guift of a Psalme.
2. of Doctrine 3. of Tongues. 4. of Revelation.
5. of Interpretation, All (saving that of Revelation)
is granted generally: yet simply neither can all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
be debarred: for at sometime may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
(and that vnto the meanest member) that
the whole Congregation hath in former time bene
carried away into some error. If any one such thing
(or any speciall point not revealed to the former
speaking Prophet) be vnto another revealed (<hi>Vers.</hi>
30.) he is orderly to be heard.</p>
                        <p>But because that of a <hi>Psalme</hi> is easilie graunted
of all, I would gladly demand, <hi>What is it for a man
there to haue a Psalme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> Heere a number lay their<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8441:84"/>
hand on their mouth, or else they foolishlie answer,
<hi>It is the singing of som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> Psalme in the Bible:</hi> or else,
<hi>It is to pen a Psalme, and afterwards to sing it.</hi> Alas,
alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no: neither the one nor the other. The Apostle
commendeth to the Church <hi>Spirituall guifts, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
guifts of the Spirit of Iesus,</hi> not fearing in the
first place to prefix the guift of a Psalme, as no
common guift, but at least as vneasie to be attained
as that <hi>of Doctrine, of Tongues, Interpretation, &amp;c.</hi>
Howsoever other Churches, yet <hi>Corinth</hi> (the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
testifieth) was destitute of no guift, Chap. 1. 7.
No marvel then, if this guift be rather commended
to vse amongst them. As onely to pen a Sermon,
and then to reade it, cannot properly be called the
<hi>Guift of Preaching or Prophecying:</hi> so neither can
the singing of a penned Psalme, be truly called, <hi>The
guift of a Psalme:</hi> I therefore conclude; even as <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
and <hi>Exhortation,</hi> is by the immediate instinct
of the Spirite, so is this <hi>Psalme</hi> vttered or soong.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quest.</hi> Who ever heard of any man, that could
so sing the praises of God and his wonderful works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that could deliver his holy meaning in <hi>Number</hi> &amp;
<hi>Measure.</hi>
                        </p>

by heart, the brethren thus tryed him. First, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
two brethren had taught from two severall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
(onely fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> knowne to the speakers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues)
he was appointed to ground his <hi>Psalme,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that doctrine they first had delivered. He did so
presently, enlarging the doctrine and vse thereof:
and that without vnseemly pawse. Secondly (which
was the next time of Prophecie) he was placed in
the face of the holy Assemblie, and vnto him was
read a certaine Text (agreed vpon by the Church,<pb n="166" facs="tcp:8441:85"/>
but at that instant) and therevpon, without more
adoe, he vttered a <hi>Psalme.</hi> After that, he was again
<hi>Proued,</hi> and so of the Brethren <hi>Approued.</hi> I my self
was an eate and eye-witnes of all this. So much of
the 8. Observation.</p>
                        <p>Nynthly, <hi>Paul</hi> confuteth the deniers of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
resurrection (as for the supporting of the weak,
I observed it to the <hi>Romanes</hi>) And lastly, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
laying aside somewhat for the helping of
the poor, appointing thereto the Lords day, or first
day of the weeke.</p>
                        <p>In his second to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> I mark specially, 1.
His care of having the <hi>Humbled</hi> sinner comforted.
2. His care to haue one Church to contribute to
anothers necessities. 3. His care of suppressing the
insolent contemners of his letters &amp; reprehensions.</p>
                        <p>In his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> specially I note,
1. The curse of all false Doctrine and Gospels, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh
published by an Angel from heaven. 2. That
<hi>Moses</hi> yoke of bondage, is not to bee ioyned with
<hi>Iesus</hi> his Gospell: the former longing to the sons of
<hi>Hagar</hi> the bond-woman, for whipping them vnto
Christ: the latter longing to the sons of <hi>Sarah,</hi> the
Free-woman, whose Children are of a newe Citie,
even of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from aboue.</p>
                        <p>In his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> First, I beholde E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
to be before (not only our b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rth, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
the foundation of the World: and that Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be in Christ Iesus onely: which Election be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
time, maketh it selfe knowne to vs in time, by
the sanctification of the holy Spirit. 2. I cast mine
eye to the immediate end of Christ his Ascension,
which, as touching his Church, was this: vz. <hi>To fill
all things, by giuing gifts vnto men:</hi> the end of them
guifts being twofold: First, for converting People,
and bringing them into holy constitution: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for edifying or building them more and more vp<pb n="167" facs="tcp:8441:85"/>
in their newe-byrth, after they be once constituted
in orderly communion. Vnto this two-fold end, he
appointeth two sorts of Teachers: First, <hi>Apostles, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists,
Prophets,</hi> for the planting Churches: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> to the Churches once
planted: whereof see more in the next Staffe but
two following, in number the 17.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, in this Epistle, I obserue his care of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Husbands and wiues, Parents &amp; children,
Masters and servants, in their mutuall duties.</p>
                        <p>In his Epistle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> specially I pick
out: First, that it is a matter of reioycement, that
Christ bee preached, though some preach of envie,
and with affections impure. 2. That Bandes or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonement
maketh the Gospell more glorious.
3 That the imprisoned Saintes (specially Ministers
of the word, &amp; more speciallie <hi>Kopiontes</hi> they that
haue traveled Churches planting, and delivering
Canonicall ordinances, are to bee provided for of
their Churches.</p>
                        <p>In his Epistle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> (besides former
mentioned doctrines) I note, that such <hi>Religion</hi> as
is not in the writings of the Prophets and Apostles
<hi>Seene,</hi> but rather forbidden in the new Testaments
Canon, (as, worshipping of Angels, Touch not, tast
not, handle not, &amp;c.) is but a <hi>Wil-worship,</hi> carying
onely a shew of wisdome, and herein my Brethren
faile, that wold tie men to such Legal observances.</p>
                        <p>In his first to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> specially I take
heede: First, to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> true hearing and
receiving the Apostles wordes; who heard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that word, not as the worde of men, but as
the word of God. 2. That to mourne much for the
Saintes departed, is Gentile-like. 3. That Iesus his
comming to Iudgement, will be very sodaine, and
therefore needfull, that the Saintes be watchfull.</p>
                        <p>In his second to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> onely I nowe<pb n="168" facs="tcp:8441:86"/>
obserue: That there was a general Apostacie from
the Christian faith, plainely foretolde. Which <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture</hi>
should fall out by reason <hi>The Man of Sin,</hi>
the <hi>Antik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>imenos,</hi> or <hi>Layer of a contrary Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
should arise in the Church (through Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
not watching,) and so cause the Churches
for to vndergo his <hi>Spirituall Badge.</hi> Which Beast
(notwithstanding) in time should bee destroyed,
by the bright powerfull appearance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell:
he in the meane time prevailing onely over
such, as had not received the loue of the truth, and
therefore iustly giuen over to beleeue lies, that so
they may be damned.</p>
                        <p>In his 1 Epistle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> I specially take vp:
First, <hi>Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, Thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuings</hi>
are to be made for all sortes of People. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
howe <hi>Church-Overseers,</hi> and <hi>Seruitours</hi> are
to be qualified. Thirdly, that the Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ministers
at home (that is, in their owne Assemblie) is to be
provided for. Hee that provideth for his Oxe, and
with-holdeth necessaries from him that watcheth
over his soule, is no better than an Oxe, and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
the Gospell: yet Teachers must measure the
weak, and loose bodily right, if thereby they haue
hope to winne vnto Christ. Fourthly, that one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Rebuke appertaineth not to all the Saintes:
nor yet to receiue an Accusation against an Elder
so easilie, as against others.</p>
                        <p>In his 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>Timothie,</hi> First, an encouragement
for <hi>Timothie</hi> against al adversitie. 2. A plaine prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticating
of our covetous sals Prophets, who sell
themselues &amp; their people to the devill for money.</p>
                        <p>In his Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> I only pick out the end of
the Evangelist <hi>Titus</hi> his abode in the litle Iland <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap>,</hi>
viz. to plant Churches, and in every Church her
Elders. In his Epistle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> the Apostle sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<hi>Onesimus</hi> back to his Maister <hi>Philemon,</hi> who<pb n="169" facs="tcp:8441:86"/>
before had run away from his Master, therewithall
robbing <hi>Philemon</hi> of somewhat. The fellowe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> (by some secreet draught of

my obserues in the former Epistles, I note speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
in him: First, that <hi>Prayer</hi> must bee offered vp

Faith is not to be held in respect of Persons; be they
many, be they fewe; be they noble, be they igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
seeme they learned, seeme they vnlearned.
4. That a Person with gold-fingers is not therefore
to be seated vpmost at our Table. 5. That <hi>Faith<pb n="170" facs="tcp:8441:87"/>
without Workes,</hi> is but the Devils faith. 6. That
Elders ar to visit the sick; and if the sick haue some
sinne troubling their conscience, they are with loue
to take notice thereof, and fervently therefore cal
vpon God by Prayer, for that sins remission. These

are once borne of God, no more doe sinne: that is,

Their Fall brought a blessing to the Gentiles, but their Rising shall bring much glory to such, as will walke in their light <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12. 15.</p>
                        <p>This their Rising, the Apostles were not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, who (the last time that ever they asked a question of Iesus) did demaunde, <hi>If so hee would at that time Restore the Kingdome to Israel,</hi> ACT. 1. I well knowe that some (otherwise godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) haue blamed the Apostles there, for exspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a worldly Kingdome: but (<hi>Tantorum pace</hi>) I dare not thinke that the Apostles are blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie: nay, I deeme them praise-worthie, who had so speciall care for their owne peoples good.</p>
                        <p>First, If they dreamed that <hi>Israel</hi> should haue restored to them a Kingdome not onely spirituall, such a dreame cannot be infringed: nay, reade the Prophets attentiuely, and they insinuate a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome not onely spirituall.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they saying <hi>Wilt thou at this time Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the Kingdome to, Israel,</hi> what answer doth <hi>Iesus</hi> returne? doth he reproue them? No: what saith he? Thus he answers, <hi>It is not for you to know the times or seasons, which the father hath put in his own power.</hi> Hee is so farre from denying the Kingdome they dreamed of, as he doth plainly graunt it. He grants it by answering only to the <hi>Tyme,</hi> wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected such <hi>Restauration:</hi> as though hee should say, <hi>You are greedy of vnderstanding, WHEN the Kingdome I shall be restored: the Time thereof is in the Fathers hand, neither is it necessarie for you to know:<pb n="183" facs="tcp:8441:93"/> looke you to your own present busines, &amp;c.</hi> This I take to be open &amp; plain ynough: specially, if we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that in the next place before, <hi>Hee had taught them the things that concerned his kingdome,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly wherevpon, they demaunde onely the <hi>Tyme</hi> of <hi>Israels Restauration,</hi> and onely hee answereth to the <hi>Tyme,</hi> as graunting their meaning of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. If they had now erred in Iudgement, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think, but hee would not haue ascended before he had reformed it: considering the holy Ghost af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes was not sent downe, so much to teache them any <hi>Newe thing,</hi> as to bring vnto their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance <hi>The things he had before taught.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, God dwelled in <hi>Shems</hi> Tent, even in the middest of <hi>Israels</hi> People, and such Gentiles were blessed, as had recourse vnto them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, God hath inhabited amidst the Gentiles, and such Iewes haue bene happy as haue had recourse to them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, God will againe dwel amidst the Iews; and blessed shall such Gentiles be, as gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto them. Thus the Lord concludeth both vnder Sinne, that on both hee may haue mercy: and that neither may swell in any thing of their owne; he hath shut vp all in vnbeliefe, that so hee may haue mercie vpon all: The first shall be last, and the last shall bee first. Oh the deepnes of the riches, both of the wisdome and knowledge of God! howe vnsearchable are his Iudgments, and his waies past finding out.</p>

an immediate vtterance of the Lord his

that he may stirre vp the <hi>Heart</hi> of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted

call vehemently vpon God, as vpon a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

none can truly pray, that haue not
this Spirite, as also, because no Requests

ought, but the Spirite it selfe maketh request
for vs:</hi> that is, <hi>The Spirit of Iesvvs putteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the mouth of our spirite vvhat to praye.</hi>
To prescribe therefore and enjoyne <hi>Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvordes,</hi>
is to strip the Spirit of his office,

                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> True: and so doe the written set
Scriptures help such: but yet it followeth
not, that that is praier it selfe: The helpe
to Praier &amp; Preaching, is not our Prayer
and preaching it selfe: the first is a <hi>Cause,</hi>
the second the <hi>Effect:</hi> no Cause and his
Effect are the same: every halfe-pennie
Sophister knowes that. Secondly, where
you say, <hi>Euery one hath not knowledge to
pray,</hi> thereto I answer: every one that is
adopted (as afore) hath the spirit of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:
every one that hath that spirit, hath a
speaking (not a dumbe) spirite, a spirite of
knowledge and holy Light.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> But every one (who is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to haue Gods spirite) cannot vtter
words orderly as were to be wished.</p>

                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That is besides the Question: the
Question is this: <hi>Can every one of God his
children</hi> (meaning of aged Persons) <hi>pray
rightly?</hi> I haue saide, they can. Nowe, for
praying so orderly as were to be wished,
I graunt, that young ones in Christ Iesus
cannot pray so fully and methodically, as
these that haue spent som years in Christ
his Schoole. Children cannot speake as
do Elder persons: yet Children (aswell as
Elder persons) can cry vnto the Parents
vpon the feling of some <hi>Want:</hi> even so can
the youngest Babe in Christ. That, the
blessed Apostle teacheth, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15.)
when he saith, that the <hi>Adopted do cry:</hi> as
also (<hi>Verse,</hi> 26. 27.) when hee affirmeth,
that the Spirit teacheth vs to pray <hi>vvith
grones vnvtterable,</hi> the meaning of which
grones is well knowne to God: for hee is
not ignorant of the meaning of his own
spirit. And most grosse headed are such,
as think that any words please God, but
what hee himselfe first breathes into our
hearts by his spirit: for he only accepteth
the fruites of his owne spirit, the fruits of
his Sonnes spirit: which first fruites are
the sanctifier of our whole lumpe. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to think is flat Idolatrie, and dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Quest.</hi> Do you then simply condemne
all such as vse the wordes of our Saviour,
as they are set downe?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> No: S. <hi>Peter</hi> (1. 4. 11.) saith, <hi>If
any man speake, let him speake as the vvords
of God.</hi> Better wordes than our Saviour,
than the Apostles, than the Prophetes
haue vsed, we cannot vse: nay, wee must
learne to speake as they before vs haue
spoken, as in other speach, so specially in
<hi>Prayer,</hi> which is, <hi>An holy speach vvith
God.</hi> Whosoever shal vse all or any of our
Saviors words according to knowledge,
and that by the instinct of God his spirit,
which Spirit teacheth the soule, what is
most fit &amp; necessary for the time, to him I
say, <hi>Go in peace.</hi> But if any for customes
sake, and of a foolish superstitious affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the words, shall vse them, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forme of speach in the Scriptures, of
such I say, <hi>They are no better than Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Magi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>al inchautaters,</hi> neither knowe
they what prayer meaneth. Two sorts of
People offende against our Saviour his
forme of Prayer: the one sort are such, as
through a Romish custome do value all
their other prayers deade and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if so they do not annex it: the other
sort are such, as think it vtterly vnlawfull
(because the same is repeated) for to vse
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:8441:98"/>
them wordes for Prayer. If our Saviour
(<hi>Marke</hi> 14. 39.) did at his second time of
praying, vse the <hi>same vvords he had before
vsed,</hi> then why should the same in any
Faithfull their vse, be offensiue to vs? But
as our Savior there vsing the same words
did it, because his case was one and the
same vnchanged, so let vs learne then, to
vse the same words, when our case is the
same: otherwise, we shal make holy <hi>Words,</hi>
but prophane <hi>Idoles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concluding therefore, that <hi>Prayer is
a povvring out of our soules-feeling accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the present motion of God his spirite:</hi>
as also, that <hi>Neither olde vvords nor newe
vvordes are acceptable to God, otherwise
then they are sent vp to God the Father, in
the name of Iesus, and that by the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
vvorke of the spirite:</hi> I now come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Saviour his <hi>Exemplar of Prayer,</hi>
(<hi>Math.</hi> 6.) consisting 1. of a <hi>Preface,</hi> in
these wordes: <hi>O our Father vvhich art in
Heuen.</hi> 2. of a <hi>Supplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> in these words:
<hi>Hallovved be thy name, thy Kingdom come,
thy vvil be done in Earth as it is in Heauen:
Giue vs this day our daily bread, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
vs our debts, as vvee also forgiue our
detters: And lead vs not into tentation, but
deliuer vs from euill.</hi> 3. It consisteth of a
<hi>Reason,</hi> why Prayer is offered vp onely to
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:8441:99"/>
God, in these words: <hi>For thine is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and the povver, &amp; the glory, for euer.</hi>

do testifie, that that <hi>Original</hi> sin
was convayed vnto vs in our

from thee our <hi>Father,</hi> that of

thy <hi>Image,</hi> whereof justly wee
were deprived: carrying vpon
vs (in steade thereof) the <hi>Blacke

                     <p>But thou <hi>Our</hi> sweete <hi>Father,</hi>

Oh, no. Thou soughtest vp our

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:8441:101"/>
and Catechized them: freely,
promising vnto them, that of
womans <hi>Seed</hi> one should come,
by whome the seed of man and
woman shuld overcome Satan.
When the fulnesse of time was
expired, thou accordingly didst
send thy <hi>Sonne made of a vvoman,</hi>
who in our Nature triumphed
over Sinne, Death, Hell, Sathan,
and so finaly sitteth at the right
hand of Majestie, making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
intercession for all such
of Man-kinde, as do come vnto
thee (oh Father) by him: in and
by whome, Salvation onely is
come vnto Iewe and Gentile.</p>
                     <p>Thus, when of a <hi>Father,</hi> we had
justly made thee our <hi>Foe,</hi> it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thee, sweete Father, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
a Mediator betwixt thee
and vs, that so by him, thou and
wee might bee reconciled and
made one. Oh Mercie of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,

oh thou fountaine of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
howe are wee bounde vnto

<hi>Creation,</hi> our Father by <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
in Mercie, twise a Father:
but wee in <hi>Obedience,</hi> not once
worthy the name of Children.
But so it hath pleased thee, to
call out a companie of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
(and amongst them <hi>Me,</hi>
most vnwoorthie) to whome it
hath pleased thee to <hi>Seale</hi> thy
Loue vnto their hearts by thy

                     <p>This testimony of thy Spirit
vnto our Spirits, causeth vs to

Yea, that which more is, wee

What herein is further

In the mean time, vse the litle

the faith, and thou (in
being faithful in thy litle) shal
in time be made the owner of
much. As many of you as

vouchsafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

and the Lord bee with your
