         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ARMY
Brought to the Bar.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been for theſe ſix years ſpace and more, the
complaints of divers of the inhabitants of this
Kingdom, concerning the ſlaviſh ſervitude they
endured under the King and his Cavaliers; and
there be others who complain of the ſervile bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
they groaned under by the Parliament and their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,
but now 'tis juſtly to be feared, that there is a yoke of
ſervitude far worſe then the two former, preparing to be put
upon the necks of all Engliſhmen, by an over-ruling Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Army, who have aſſumed ſo much boldneſſe and auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
(having the power in their own hands) to controule the
Parliament, City, and whole Kingdome, meerely to drive on
their own intereſts and deſignes.</p>
            <p>And our ſervitude is like to be very miſerable, if three things
be conſidered.</p>
            <p>1 The condition and nature of the ſervitude: 'Tis a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
ſervitude, the worſt of all: what will not the ſword in the
hands of ſuch an ignorant multitude doe? our eſtates, lives,
fortunes, liberties, and Religion, will proſtrate themſelves at
the glittering of a naked ſword, all ſhall be within the reach of
a ſwords point, to be diſpoſed of according to their pleaſures
and commands.</p>
            <p>2 The qualifications wherewith the perſons are endowed
who muſt rule us: Namely the Armies Agitators, men of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53418:3"/>
knowledge and judgement, eſpecially one of them,
of whom (by one that knows him) I am credibly informed,
can neither write nor reade. If we were to be governed by
men found in judgement, and experienced in the Laws of the
Land, we might expect a milder ſervitude, but from them wee
muſt expect according to education, for as their breeding is,
ſo is their diſpoſition, we cannot expect a gentle uſage from
men of rude education, but if theſe and ſuch as they be men
rightly qualified to give rules and Laws to a Parliament and
Kingdom, then I leave it all indifferent men to judge, then this
proverb ſhall be verified, <hi>Sus Mivervam docet:</hi> Ideots ſhall
teach the learned, and men ſcarce fit to be ſubject, ſhall become
our Rulers: But yet let the Agitators and the reſt of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
remember this, that <hi>Malum concilium conſultori peſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 The third thing which will cauſe our ſervitude to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
miſerable if it happens, (which I pray God I may never live
to ſee) will be the ſtrangeneſſe and unwontedneſſe of it: Wee
were before happily governed by our King (<hi>Charles</hi> our dread
Lord and ſacred Sovereign, (whoſe dayes God prolong,) but
now we ſhall be miſerably governed by many Tyrants, who
would fain be Rulers and Magiſtrates, yet can ſcarce tell how to
be men. We were before governed and ruled by Monarchy,
we ſhal now be governed by Democracy, how wil our Engliſh
necks be accuſtomed to ſuch unwonted and uneaſie yoaks, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we muſt needs kick and winch, which if we doe, let them ſet
faſt (being good-horſe-men becauſe Souldiers) leſt they be caſt
out of the ſaddle to the ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſome may ſay (and I doe verily believe many
meerly upon that ground cleave to them) that they have been
the only Inſtruments under God, of our preſervation and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and therefore their proceedings now may be warrantable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis true, they have done very nobly (through God)
in what they undertook, yet one good act committed cannot
be a veil to hide all other offences: ſhall a villain be pardoned
for murther, becauſe hee hath done ſome worthy deeds before,
God forbid? ſhall a man for ſome brave exploit before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53418:3"/>
be ſo far exempted as to eſcape puniſhment, if hee be
guilty of a crime, No: the more Noble and brave their former
proceedings were; makes their preſent undertakings ſeem more
horrible, for <hi>Nullius viri ſpecies vehementiùs acceſſit, quàm quae
ab initio habuit dulcedinem:</hi> No Wine becomes more ſowre
then that which was at firſt the ſweeteſt: ſo they, ſo long as
they obeyed, and honoured the Commands of the Parliament,
they were moſt notably victorious and ſucceſsfull in all their
enterprizes, and none did better, but now having revolted, and
become like ſweet wine turn'd to vineger, &amp; doing things, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
warrantable by Law nor Reaſon, in this none did worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But again, ſome may ſay, there is no feare of any
oppreſſion, or ſervitude, when as all their Declarations, Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;
and Letters do ſignifie that they entend, nay, proteſt
they will endeavour to preſerve the prerogative and honour of
the King, to uphold the priviledge of Parliament, to mayntain
the Liberty of the Subject, to eſtabliſh a true and ſound Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and to ſettle a firme and laſting peace in this Kingdome,
and therefore before all theſe be eſtabliſhed, 'tis not neceſſary
they ſhould disband.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis true, it cannot be denied, that all their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
Remonſtrances do ſignifie, they do really intend, or at
leaſt pretend all theſe, and firſt they will endeavour to preſerve
the honour and prerogative of the King, and to ſettle him in
peace and happineſſe in this throne, which they will very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do, for the very tenents, and principles of an Independant
run croſſe, and quite blank againſt King and Monarchy. Now
if ſuch as go quite contrary to me, may be ſaid to go along with
mee, and if hee be accounted my advancer, who endeavours to
pull me down, then will I believe that an Independant will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a King, but againe, if example may ſtrengthen beliefe in
this particular, then this of Major <hi>Scot</hi> by name, (an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
by Religion, a Villain by his actions) is moſt remarkable,
who (if fame hath not forgot to tell truth) being asked by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Brown,</hi> whether he were come to kiſſe his Majeſties hand,
made anſwer, Hee had rather follow him to the Gallows;
<hi>O monſtrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum:</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53418:4"/>
Now, if this mans opinion being an Independant may go for
the reſt, (man did I call him, more fit to be termed a Devill) I
ſay if the reſt agree with him in opinion, being of one and the
ſame Religion, then 'tis plainly ſeen which way their hearts,
and reſolutions tend, although their Declarations (to delude
the World) ſeem and pretend to go quite contrary; this is that
Sect, who being employed as a Factor by the Clothiers of
<hi>Barfould</hi> in <hi>Suffolke,</hi> runs away at one time with the value of
1500 pounds worth of cloth (as I am credibly informed.) I
omit to recount many more (as that daring affront offered by
Cornet <hi>Joyce</hi>) in removing his Majeſty from <hi>Holdenby,</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the pleaſure of both Houſes, and his own royall aſſent. I
omit that of <hi>Crumwel,</hi> who (when his Majeſty refuſed to
ſigne a paper given him, by him) anſwered his Majeſty, that he
had as good he had: yet in paſſing by theſe, and many more his
Royall Majeſty hath ſhewed an incredible patience, yet though
the Lion ſleeps, he is not dead, but keeps a Catalogue of all in
his ſacred breſt, and will repay all with much uſe upon the
backs of ſome, although hee be now their priſoner, if ſuch as
theſe preſerve the Prerogative of the King, then ſay men goe
upon their heads, when they goe upon their feet, and you may
as well,—</p>
            <p>2 Their Declarations profeſſe to uphold the priviledges of
the Parliament, but I beſeech you tell me who are leſſe uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
nay, who are greater diſſolvers of the Parliament, and
confounders of the priviledges thereof, then themſelves? which
is manifeſtly evident by ſeverall particulars. Firſt, What was
the impeaching the eleven Members upon a meere bare pretence
of ſome great thing laid to their charge, when nothing could
be proved againſt them, No, 'twas meerly their policy (under a
pretence of frivolous ſlanders and reproaches) to draw them
out of the Houſe, and to rob them of their birthright given them
by their Countrey) whereby (by their abſence) their own party
might be the more prevalent to carry on their own deſignes, and
upon this bare pretence they muſt be forthwith ſuſpended the
Houſe, although by the ſaid houſe they were fully cleered, yet for
modeſty ſake (a thing very commendable in them) they upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53418:4"/>
their own deſire (and to ſatisfie the humour of the Army) ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
themſelves from ſetting in the Houſe, and yet for all this
ſome of them are threatned, ſome <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought for, and ſome ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous hue and cries ſent after in a reproachfull way, ſome taken,
and others ſearched, as Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> who had leave (with
the reſt) and paſſes from the Speaker, to goe beyond ſea, or any
other place whether they pleaſe. Now I would fain know by
what authority they doe theſe things, they could not have their
authority from the Parliament (they having the Speakers paſſe
to goe at their pleaſure,) 'Tis well known they had their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from themſelves, and the root and ground of all this
malice, and calumny, and envy againſt them, is becauſe they
were not friends to their proceedings as they deſired, and yet
their charge is not yet brought in (becauſe they pretend firſt
to ſettle the more important affairs of the Kingdome, which if
it be not brought in before the Kingdom is ſetled by them, the
eleven Members ſhall never need to be afraid of their tryall, and
again, was it not an incroaching upon the priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
to ſet them a certain day, nay, a prefixt houre of the day,
by which time they ſhould ſend them an anſwer to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
(though unreaſonable) or elſe they would do ſo and ſo,
march with their Army towards <hi>London,</hi> What was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of the Agitators of the Army, when they voted all them
to be ſuſpended the Houſe, and to ſit there no more, or to ſit at
their perill: who ſate in Parl. when the Speaker &amp; the reſt fled to
them? was not this a great diminution to the priviledges of Parl.
but pray why are thoſe that ſet then thus cenſured, becauſe they
did not (contrary to their conſciences) deſert the houſe, and
their truſt, and come to them, I pray aſſure mee you that know
the Laws of this Land (of which I confeſſe my ſelf to be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant) who have been the faithfulleſt Patriots, thoſe that
ſat, or thoſe that deſerted the houſe, I know you will ſay thoſe
that ſat, and mayntained their truſt againſt all oppoſition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
however if it be their fortune (I cannot ſay ill fortune) to
be driven fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the houſe (though contrary to their priviledges) by
the power of the Army, yet they will have many companions,
and <hi>foelice eſt miſeris ſocios habuiſſe doloris,</hi> yet if it ſo come to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53418:5"/>
paſſe, yet confident I am, that the time will come againe, when
they ſhall ſet to do their Countrey ſervice, and ſhall enjoy (in
ſpight of ſuch an over-ruling Army) all their former Priviledges
and Honour, and ſhall at laſt be accounted the beſt lovers of
Peace, and their Countrey.</p>
            <p>I admire what bloud ran then in our Nobles veins, when
they ſo deſerted the Parliament, was all the Royall bloud which
was wont to run in our Engliſh Nobles veins then loſt, by my
conſent, if they commit the like act again, they ſhall forfeit both
their honour and dignity, if ſuch as theſe (I mean not the Lords)
be the upholders of Parliaments, they are like to have good
houſholders, and if ſuch acts as theſe be upholding, the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of Parliament, I ſay no more but, <hi>ô tempora! ô mores!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Their Declarations (I confeſſe) demonſtrate how that they
will endeavour to mayntain the <hi>Liberty of the Subject,</hi> which
is a thing they as little intend as the former, elſe what meanes
their oppreſſing the Countries by their daily needleſſe Quarters
(though it be not denyed, they carry themſelves very orderly
where they come, 'tis true and 'tis policy ſo to do, for thereby
they make their actions more plauſible, and their ruling longer-liv'd
then it would of it ſelf be, for if they ſhould carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
any way unbeſeeming, all would vie with one hand and

the Liberty of the Subject, what do they meane when they force the

it doth not pleaſe the pallat of the ſweete tooth'd Army, (as I
may juſtly tearm it) theſe be them that in all their Propoſitions, and
Remonſtrances, ſpeak for a free Parliament, and yet none ſo much doth
force the Parliament as themſelves. But we may ſee light through the
leaſt crevice. I would fain know what confidence, and truſt, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>England</hi> can repoſe upon any Vote the Houſes paſſes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them, when as their votes are beat back again (as I may ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) by

obeyed by a lawleſſe, and over-ruling multitude: what fruits, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyements,
can the ſubject have of this Parliament, when as their votes
are made voyd, and nulled (though contrary to humaue reaſon, and
their own priviledges) yet by the threatning power of an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Army. And by this their actions, they not only hinder the free
courſe of the Parliament, but they cauſe the people to loath Parliaments
as long as this generation laſteth, and if the Parliament ſhall vote
what they deſire our of feare, or condicend what they propound out of
love; what Engliſh man will ever again honour a Parliament? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
I deſire to know what ſecurity, and hopes theſe ſubjects can
have who are lenders of the Publique Faith, for their mony ſo lent,
when as their greateſt ſecurities, the Exciſe, and Biſhops lands, and
many other lies under the command of the ſword of a revolting Army.</p>
            <p>I wonder what liberty the Citizens can expect, when Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>
is the Merchants Caſh-keeper, and the Tradſmens ſhopkeeper. (pray
God he gives a good accompt) He commands all, the Tower key is
the picklock key, whereby hee may enter every mans houſe at his

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> wonder what priviledge the Apprentices will reap by their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
when as every tag, rag, ſhagd ſouldier will be free of any trade
in the City, by the Armies Copy-hold. Is the Liberty of the ſubject,
and the freedome of the City like thus to bee maintained? Iudge all
reaſonable men, to reaſon it is impoſſible, that that which is deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enacted by the Parliament can be of force, when it is repealed again
by violence.</p>
            <p>4 Their Declarations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Preſents to the view of the world another
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53418:6"/>
falſe glaſſe, which is, that they will to their utmoſt endeavours procure
to ſettle a firme, and laſting Peace in this Kingdome. I believe they
they will uſe their utmoſt endeavours, and doe (but what to doe?) to
procure all into their own clurches, not to ſettle Peace and Vnity:
which if they do, let their military preparations ſpeak, their daily liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of men, there fetching Armes and Ammunition from the Tower
of London, the taking of <hi>Tilbury</hi> Blockhouſes in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and their
poſſeſſing themſelves of many ſtrong Holds in this Kingdome, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Colonell <hi>Liburne</hi> Governour of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and yet for all that,
the City, nor Kingdome muſt not raiſe a man for their own defence,
for fear of involving this Kingdome in a ſecond war.</p>
            <p>What means ſuch acts as theſe? bee ſuch preparations for warre as
theſe, ſettlers of a happy Peace in <hi>England?</hi> O reaſon, ſpeak the truth!
Fooles do you determine? Can he which comes thruſting with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſword at my breaſt, be tearmed the ſaver of my life? Reaſon ſaies
no, and the ſame reaſon tels me, that their preſent proceedings truly
conſidered, ſhall not (neither ever can) ſettle Peace in the land. But
if they intend to ſettle Peace, for what purpoſe do they ſurround and
incompaſſe <hi>London,</hi> (Londoners looke about you) and their having
the commands of ſome Forts thereof, is it to confirme Peace? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive

or if it ſee the light, it will not live long, but will dye before
the mother riſes up, or to ſpeak plaine, before the Armies layes down.
But if it prove contrary to expectation, and reaſon) that theſe their

diſſembling, pretending one thing, intending another; 'tis
like to prove ſuch a Policy; I feare their hearts doe turne tounges, to
give their tongues the lye in this particular.</p>
            <p>5. Laſtly, their Declarations profeſſe that <hi>they will be establiſhers
of true Religion in its purity.</hi> If they be the guardions and eſtabliſhers
of our Religion, <hi>Actum eſt de noſtra Religione,</hi> you may ſhake hands
with true Religion; if they ſettle true Religion, it will bee the cleane
contrary way, and under pretence of allowance to tender conſciences,
which they deſire) all Schiſmes, Sects, and dangerous. Opinions will
(ruſh in; that gap is ſo wide that many other Opinions deſtructive to
the Common-waalth will ruſh in unavoydably. Though <hi>I</hi> confeſſe in
things meerly indifferent, and no wayes prejudiciall to the Common-wealth,
a reſpect is neceſſary to bee had to tender Conſciences, but in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53418:6"/>
things of great concernment (the word of God not ſincerely conſtrued)
is to beare more ſway then a tender Conſcience, for if a religion or any
thing elſe ſeiſes a mans genius, he wil flye to the Altar of a tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
though he hath not a tender Conſcience, or rather none at all,
I ſay he will make Conſcience the ſhelter, and refuge for his villanies,
but in any thing which the word of God diſtinctly commands, and
reaſon, and experience, and examples confirmes, in my opinion wee
muſt not controle, nor diſobey it, under pretence, or coulor of a
tender Conſcience. I pray God ſuch ranging ſouldiers (uſed hereunto)
doe not open this gap to let in all manner of fower footed beaſts, and
two legged Monſters as themſelves to graze in the flouriſhing field of
our true Religion. But if ſuch actors, and acts ſuch theſe be the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Prerogative of the King, the upholders of the priviledges
of Parliament, the maintainers of the liberty of the ſubject, the ſetlers
of a laſting Peace, the Eſtabliſhers of true Religion, I ſhall deſire to
uſe but one clauſe of the Letany before it bids adieu to us, and gives it
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimum vale</hi> to the world. which is, from ſuch <hi>Preſervers, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholders,
Maintainers, Setlers, and Eſtabliſhers, good Lord deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But rule they will, for in reference to ſome Petitions preſented to
them, they ſay, this, and this is the ſenſe of the Army, whereby they
make their ſenſe the ſupreame law of the Land.</p>
            <p>And the unreaſonableneſſe of their proceedings is ſeene in two
things.</p>
            <p>1. In this, the tumult of the Apprentices on the 26. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> forcing
the Parliament to unvote, what they had formerly voted, and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and affronting the members of both Houſes (which truly I do not allow)
muſt be by them tearmed a breach of the Parliaments Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and the contrivers and abbettors thereof muſt bee proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
according to law, and juſtice, and themſelves (though gu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>y
of the ſame crime) are ſcot free, and eſcape unpuniſhed, and eſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed,
not becauſe they have not merited any, but becauſe the ſword
ſayes nay, they ſhall not ſuffer.</p>
            <p>1 Now take a review of both their acts, the Apprentices came ('tis
true) in their perſons, and compelled the Members of Parliament to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voake
what had been before voted upon the deſire of the Army. But
<hi>Vollitur cauſa deſinet effectus,</hi> there is never no effect without a cauſe;
if the Army had not firſt (by their unjuſt deſires) compelled the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
by their Votes to alter the old Militia, the Apprentices had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
came in ſuch a tumultuous manner to force them (in the ſame kind)
to revoake that which before upon the Armies unheard of demands had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53418:7"/>
been paſſed; ſo that if the Army had not firſt piped, and led the way,
the Apprentices would never have danced after them, for they fearce
knew the way to <hi>Westminſter,</hi> ſo that the Army was the only cauſe of
that mutiny.</p>
            <p>2. The Army they ('tis confeſſed) came not in their own perſons,
but they ſent their power, and command (as their ſubordinate deputy)
to them, and forced them to revoke, and call in their Declaration
wherein they were proclaimed Traytors (yet they will be traytors up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
record) or if they did not, they would do ſo, and ſo, thus, and thus,
and march with their whole Army up to London, as if they would
compell them by their preſence.</p>
            <p>Now the ſtate of the cauſe ſtands thus, whether a deputy ſent from
a Ruler, or an Embaſſador ſent from a Prince, be not as effectuall, and
of as much force as the Prince, or Ruler in perſon, if ſo, then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
are as deep in that crime (nay deeper) then the Apprentices, ſeeing
they can command as much by their deputyes, as others can do by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in perſon; however it ſtands with reaſon, that what is not
allowable in the one, cannot bee expedient in the other, and yet the
Army is not proceeded againſt, but <hi>Quod defertur, non offertur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſome may ſay that of the Apprentices was the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
in regard they forced the Speaker, and ſome of the other
Members to flye from the Houſe. 'Tis true, the ſubſtance doth worke
more upon mans nature then the ſhadow, yet being the ſhadow is the
Image of the ſubſtance, and the Deputy repreſents the Image of his
Lord and Maſter, the Army is as equall guilty of the ſaid crime as the
other, yet neither are warrantable neither by Law, nor reaſon, nor can
ever ſuch claſhings ſtrike good fire to the Common-wealth: but how
can the Speaker warrant that his abſence, you ſay he was forced and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted,
and was not they that ſtayed behind forced and affrighted
as well as he and the reſt, if ſo, how then comes it to paſſe that they
deſerted not the Houſe as well as the other, yet for their faithfullneſſe
in cleaving cloſe to their truth, they muſt be ſubject to the Votes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
of illeterate Agitators, and a Councell of War, and to deſert
the Houſe according to their pleaſure: if this be juſt, and to uphold,
nay if it be not to break the free priviledges of a Parliament, let
themſelves be their own judges. Againe doth it become the Speaker
and the reſt, being placed as Magiſtrates in ſuch authority, to deſert the
Houſe upon a pretence of feare, and leave the kingdome in the loweſt
ebbe, and in the greateſt ſtorme, like a ſhip in a tempeſt ready to ſink,
no, 'twas not feare, I believe it was a thing called a guilty conſcience
which made them flye.</p>

2. There unreaſonable proceedings are manifeſt in the manner of the
Impeaching the 11 honourable Members, they did not (as thoſe which
cenſure aright alwayes do) examin two things before they cenſure: firſt
whether the parties cenſured have done good or ill: ſecondly whether
they themſelves could have done better. But they never have theſe
conſiderations, but being turned by the wheele of their own in tereſts,
never regard how mens good names are as white balls, which will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
get ſoyle by toſſing: but their cenſures againſt theſe 11 wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Impeached Members, are like the butts of Rams-hornes againſt
the walls of <hi>Iericho,</hi> they lay levell all their worthy deeds at once.
But for all this, the ſaying of a worthy writer may be fitly applyed
