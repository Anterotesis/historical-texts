            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Your courtly sportes a whyle:</l>
               <l>Cast on your wailefull weedes of woe,</l>
               <l>Dame pleasure doo exile.</l>
               <l>Beholde a platforme playne,</l>
               <l>Of death, fit for the Graue:</l>
               <l>Who late inioyed a lyuing Soule, as you this season haue.</l>
               <l>His birth right noble was, honour beset him rounde:</l>
               <l>But Death amidst his lustie yéeres, hath shrind him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground.</l>
               <l>When time is come he waightes, according Gods decrée:</l>
               <l>To conquer lyfe, respecting not the mightiest in degree.</l>
               <l>Intreatie cannot serue, Death séekes no golden gift:</l>
               <l>For from his reache no potentate, to flye can make the shift.</l>
               <l>The Glasse runne forth at large, the howre fully spent:</l>
               <l>To share lifes thred a sunder hée, by mightie Ioue is sent.</l>
               <l>The daunce of Death no King, nor Kayser but must trace:</l>
               <l>The Duke, the Earle, the Lord &amp; knight to him must yéeld a place</l>
               <l>The aged olde, the midle sort, the lustie youth in prime:</l>
               <l>To liue on earth cannot inioy, the certentie of time.</l>
               <l>For as time hath no staie, but fleeteth euerie howre:</l>
               <l>So is the lyfe of mortall men, compared to a flowre.</l>
               <l>Whose beautie knowne to daie, to morrow fadeth quight:</l>
               <l>And vanisheth, as though therof, Man neuer had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sight,</l>
               <l>So fickle is our state, we fading Flowres bée:</l>
               <l>To daie aliue, to morrow dead, according Gods decrée.</l>
               <l>Of lyfe no Charters giuen, to any worldly wight:</l>
               <l>Oh who can say that he shall liue, from morne vnto the night.</l>
               <l>He that at fyrst gaue lyfe, of lyfe will beare the sway:</l>
               <l>And when him lykes, as pleaseth him, will take this lyfe away.</l>
               <l>Sith he workes all in all, and rules as séemes him best:</l>
               <l>Lets learne that earth we are, and earth to claime her owne is prest.</l>
               <l>The perfect proofe wherof, apparently is séene:</l>
               <l>By this good Earle, whose lusty yéeres, did florish faire &amp; greene.</l>
               <l>But in a moment chaunged, and withered lyke the haie:</l>
               <l>Bereft of lyfe and honor great, and coutched close in claie.</l>
               <l>Yet though he sencelesse lye, South hamtons Earle by name:</l>
               <l>Yet death in him lyes dead no doubt, by meanes of noble fame.</l>
               <l>For whilst on earth he liu'de, to vertue he was bent:</l>
               <l>And after wisdomes lore to hunt, he gaue his frank consent.</l>
               <l>In Iustice was his ioye, and iustly he did deale:</l>
               <l>As they can tell that for his aide, had cause for to appeale.</l>
               <l>The widow poore opprest, he carefully did shield:</l>
               <l>And to the Orphane in his right, did dayly comfort yéeld.</l>
               <l>The néedie poore he fed, with Mutton, Bread and Béeffe:</l>
               <l>His hand was neuer slack to giue, the comfortlesse reléefe.</l>
               <l>The naked back to cloth, he euer ready was:</l>
               <l>No néedy poore without reward, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Earles gates could pas.</l>
               <l>His House kéeping right good, there plentie bare the sway:</l>
               <l>No honest man forbidden was, within his house to staie.</l>
               <l>His faith brought foorth swéete fruite, the Lord God to delight:</l>
               <l>And made him as a seruant good, accepted in his sight.</l>
               <l>Unto his tennauntes poore, this Earle was euer kinde:</l>
               <l>To work their weale, he carefully did alwaies yéeld his minde.</l>
               <l>Inhaunsing of his rentes, did he enlarge his store:</l>
               <l>He alwaies had a care to help, and aide his Farmers pore.</l>
               <l>His seruauntes weale to worke, no time he did forbeare:</l>
               <l>To doo them good that wel deseru'd, his zeale did still appeare,</l>
               <l>On God his hart was set, in Christ his hope, did rest:</l>
               <l>And of the mightie Lord of hoastes, this noble Earle was blest.</l>
               <l>To Prince he was most iust, to countrie alwaies true:</l>
               <l>The fruites of loue and loyaltie, in him all states might view.</l>
               <l>In wedlock hée obserued, the vow that he had made:</l>
               <l>In breach of troth through lewd lust, he ne would séeme to wade</l>
               <l>Thrice happy thou, of God and man belou'de:</l>
               <l>That euer soughtst to make a peace, where discorde striffe had mou'd.</l>
               <l>Though thou from vs begone and taken hence by death:</l>
               <l>Among the sonnes of mortal men, thy prayse shall liue on earth.</l>
               <l>For as thy lyfe was iust, so godly was thy ende:</l>
               <l>Not on this world, but on swéet Christ, thou alwaies didst depend</l>
               <l>And as in health his name, thou reuerently didst praise:</l>
               <l>So in his feare in sicknesse thou, didst spend thy lotted daies,</l>
               <l>This world thou heldst as vaine, thy lyfe thou thoughtest no losse:</l>
               <l>In hope of Heauen &amp; heaueuly blisse, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> déemst al things but dros.</l>
               <l>This houering still in hope, to heauen thou tookst thy flyght,</l>
               <l>where with thy Christ the Iueller, of ioy thy hart is pight.</l>
               <l>And he in extréeme paine, when anguish did abounde:</l>
               <l>To giue thée comfort from aboue, was euer ready found.</l>
               <l>Amidst his mercie he, though iustice wrought thy smart:</l>
               <l>Euen lyke a louing sauiour, did alwaies take thy part.</l>
               <l>When Sathan, sinne, and death, about thée round were set:</l>
               <l>To pray for thée most earnestly, he neuer did forget.</l>
               <l>And like a Souldier iust, by faith thou foughtst the Féelde:</l>
               <l>And armst thy self gainst all thy foes, to whom y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> woldst not yéeld</l>
               <l>But so didst kéepe the fort, that all thy foes did flye:</l>
               <l>And lyke a lambe in Iesus Christ, preparedst thy selfe to die.</l>
               <l>Of Court thou takest thy leaue, thy Prince thou bidst fare well,</l>
               <l>for whose estate thou praydst to God, her enemies to quell.</l>
               <l>The Noble Péeres eche one, with hart thou bidst adue:</l>
               <l>And praiedst that they to glad her hart, may loyaltie ensue.</l>
               <l>Of all thy louing friendes, thou takest a fynall leaue:</l>
               <l>And vnto God most constantly, for comfort thou doest cleaue,</l>
               <l>Thy noble children thou, right louingly doest blesse:</l>
               <l>To Seruants all thou giuest adue, they may thée not possesse.</l>
               <l>From them thou doest prepare, thy passage straight to make:</l>
               <l>And vnto Christ with cheareful voice, thy soule thou doest betake</l>
               <l>Who with outstretched armes, receiues it to his grace:</l>
               <l>And with his saintes, in glorie great, appointes the happye place.</l>
               <l>Thy fréendes thy losse lament, thy Children waile and wéepe,</l>
               <l>To sée their Father and their fréend, in Clay inclosed déepe.</l>
               <l>Thy seruants streme foorth teares, they wring their wofull handes:</l>

               <l>His Tennants all doo mourne, their smoking sobs abounde,</l>
