            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:21640:4"/>
and by reason of their discontentments to be vnthankefull; for there is no euill, that man sooner apprehendeth, then the opinion of his own; which maketh him (for the most part) an vniust esteemer of what good, he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; so conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly vnthankfull vnto him that gaue it.

I will not tell you (a thing too well known) how all conditions are vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but I will say with my Author (which may serue to cure them) that the great and awfull ruler of men, times, and things; the liberall and wife disposer of all that are annexed to mans life, <hi>Knoweth how to deuide, much better, then wee can chuse.</hi> In this Treatise, thou shalt find much rypened wisedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to cure this sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

CHAP. 1.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, why euery man thinks himself euill dealt withall, that hee is, that. which God would haue him to be (Great &amp; Right Honor.) (and that which is more worth and better then all titles) (right vertuous): I finde no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason; but that euery mans vnthankfull mind towards God, is the fountaine of this euill. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are most sparing, but most, most vniust esteemers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21640:8"/>
of his benefits: not so much accounting those things which they haue receiued to be benefits, as those things which they haue not receiued, to bee los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; wee passe all moderation with our shamelesse wishes, whilst whatsoeuer (foolishly) we couet wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, we hope; and whatsoeuer we so hope for, that with vnsatiable eyes, and greedy vnlimited thoughts wee feede vpon. From hence is our impatience, from hence are the perpetuall complaints of men, from hence are the frantik &amp; wicked speeches of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing impiety, from hence is that mutuall rancour that burneth inwardely; In one word, there is no worde so common in our mouthes, as these cogitations are in our minds. <hi>O vnaequall and Vniust Lost, howe hast thou aduaunsed him without all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit vnto a hye place, whilst thou holdest mee who am (many wayes) more worthy, in lowe estate;</hi> These and such like tearmes, wee repiningly vtter by reason of our rashnesse, and whilst in nothing we thinke humbly, in all things wee ouerweiningly flatter our selues; accounting whatsoeuer wee receiue, not to be <hi>giuen,</hi> but <hi>payde.</hi> And although no man be so impudent, that hee dare openly accuse God; yet that which they speake not, they either murmur or conceale in the secret of their thoughtes, and whilst euery man bitterly complaines of his lot that is not, he doth itreligiously thinke of God, who tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is; and whose name hee concealeth his power and Maiesty he despiseth. This inborn impiety with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21640:8"/>
mans nature, I pursue with this labour in this treatise, neither do I it so much to confute inconsiderat and wicked speeches, as to controule secret and impure thoughts; for from wicked thoughts arise infected and poluted words, and therefore to suppresse those, is to represse these. Neither will I circumuent or treacherously vndermine this fault, but deale plainly, not deceitfully; I will lay open the deformities of this sinne, I will pull vp the rootes of it, the boughes and branches I will cut off. Neither haue I procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more slougthfully in this taske, for that as soone as the title of this booke is seene, I know many either disdainfully will repine, or (as the manners of most are) proudly scorning will say, what can there be in this argument either witty, or learned? Nay, what is there not here rather cold, frozen, worne, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon? For this argument is vsually withall bitternesse handled of the Preachers at this day, and plentifully in those bookes, which euery vulgar eye may reade. And besides peraduenture they will say, these are but the fragments of some auntient wits, as the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of <hi>Aesculus</hi> were of <hi>Homer.</hi> I confesse, I am not ignorant, that the Argument of this treatise, must passe depriued of his chiefest commendation, and is vnfit to shew any exquisite learning, vnpleasant to the care, and too low &amp; humble, to participate with same. And least any thing should happen newe or vnexpected; besides all these, I haue considered with my selfe, the seuerity and distastes of Readers at this

day; the delicacies of mens eyes, and eares; their whisperings and secret reproofes, that resolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising these, I might passe them ouer. With me the necessitie of this meditation hath only preuailed, and that alone hath imposed this labour vpon mee. Neither can the rumours of the common sort, or the darke cloudes of secret estimation, hinder mee from obseruing those things which are fit, or from bridling (as far as I am able) these impieties, vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly the best men, whose vertues (though with farre distance it is honorable (euen creepingly) to follow; haue bestowed most of their leasure to this end. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue I from hence a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence to ouertake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but a loue to follow them. Neither is there in this, any ostentation of nouelty, to slirre vp or feede any mans curiositie. Scarse shall I say in this any thing, <hi>Famous, newe, or as yet vnspoken by others,</hi> there is little pleasant to the reader, or hearer; because I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect nothing lesse then curious trimming; I would please, I confesse if I could, but I know not to smooth; I labour wholly to profit. I affect no name from hence. I do not ambitiously wooe the voices of the learned, nor couet the applause of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; I know these things are reserued for those wits that mount hier. For my selfe, who in humility scarce creepe, it is sufficient not to be blamed; not to be prouoked; whilst thus I labour to make some defence against those troopes of vices, that are euery where dispersed. To this I exhort all, against whome
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21640:10"/>
these monsters bark, cheefely <hi>vnthankfulnesse,</hi> which is the worst of all; No sinne sooner doth estrange God from Man then this; by no enemy, are we more cruelly and more treacherously undermined, then by this; with this monster, man can haue no trust, but deceitful, no peace, but deadly. Our armour therefore must neuer be put off; as euer being in the sight of an enemy, most watchfull to ouerthrow vs. No combate is of such importance, no conflict of more resolution, nor any that requireth more valour? In this victory are al those things, that are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bee the reward of piety. But there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest that is harder, later, or more doubtfull. For this poyson of vnthankfulnesse (being pluckt vp) often groweth againe; beeing subdued, often rebelleth, conquereth vs often, when we thinke, we haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it: to conclude, <hi>vnthankfulnesse</hi> is neuer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisht in vs, but by a <hi>pyety most perseuering and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting.</hi> Wherefore it is fit, that all vertuous and religious minds do stirre vp, and arme themselues, in the vnderstanding and prouision of such danger; and with continuall and earnest prayers obtaine of his deuine goodnesse, necessary defences against such an enemy; He erreth, that in this, waiteth vpon others; This businesse admitteth no delayes, here euery man must be a spurre, and a guide to himselfe. Euery man must stirre vp and awake himselfe with excellent examples. Heere euery man must be an example to others, and whatsoeuer helpe is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21640:11"/>
for his owne safety, that he must imploy, for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good. There is no vertue if it be seasonably vsed, wherein there is not some helpe and aduantage for this victory; Often times those, whose chardge is least, both in the Church and Common-wealth, if they labour that they may ouercome; if with wishes, vowes, indeauours, if with all diligence they fauour this businesse, they are reckoned amongst Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Thinke (Right Honorable) thou that art the light of this age, that amongst these I account my selfe; if I be not in this conflict a captaine of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued valour (as I confesse I am not) yet in my holy wishes, I am a faithfull souldier, who respect not my selfe onely, but seeke for a common good, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce that chardge, that is layd vpon me. Now I earnestly intreate your Honour to patronize these papers (how meane soeuer they are) if you thinke they haue any publique profit in them; the thing is small, yet it attempteth a great worke; and the matter at the first sight is easie, but if you looke nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of all which I might and would speake if it were not to your selfe.

            <p>
               <hi>Themselues,</hi> that is, that great argument of this deuine goodnesse. For man is the glasse of God, wherein he behouldeth himselfe, and his benefites; truely <hi>benefits,</hi> because they are <hi>free,</hi> and indeede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of vs, before they are either thought of, or expected by vs: And indeede benefits, neuer enough knowne, neuer enough vnderstood, or esteemed of vs. O man, it is nothing, that God hath made a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt thee, and the liuelesse, and sencelesse creatures? from those that are without reason? from all those who are created to this end: to bestow all their benefits vpon thee: to admire, and worshippe thee? to thee, and for thy vse, the Starres arise: they arise, as to their better: they striue to compasse thee about with their heauenly light, to follow thee in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, with their fauourable aspects, because they see thee to be man, and in man God. If this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly army, serue thee with such diligence, as being appointed to thy vse, what ought, and must those doe, in the midst whereof thou art placed? dost thou not know these things to be appointed for thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice? Thou commandest the Sea; thou rulest the

And to conclude, then it shall bee manifest vnto thee, how vntruly thou hast complained of God, by whose commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thou art borne in that condition, which with much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine thou callest basenesse. Furthermore he, whom thou esteemest noble, doth bring forth the old and wormeaten monuments of his auncestours, in this more vehement vpbraiders of the vnworthinesse of their posteritie. And thou, to whome, thy auncestors haue left no outwrad ornament, where of thou maist boast, draw forth out of the generous, vertuous, and noble heart (the liuely image of the soule) true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; which thou maist deliuer to thy posterity to be imitated, subiect to no age, to no forgetfulnesse. By this meanes thou shalt rise to honour, and with infallible arguments, leaue thy true Nobility witne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssed, and sealed to euerlasting posterities. From hence maist thou see how much thou art bound to GOD, who hath ingrafted that in thee, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou indeauourest thy selfe, thou maist be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. And if thy affections bee not so erected, nor thy liuelinesse so awaked, if thou doost not affect the highest dignities, if thou dost not aspire to these large aduantages of praise, yet indeauour that thou maist be found in the second rank. At the least compose thy selfe to <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Simplicity;</hi> vertues no lesse acceptable to God, then the other that are more conspicuous. VVith these adorne thy selfe, and thy obscure family; so shall it come to

passe that in this humility, thou shall finde matter large and sufficient, to make thee thankefull; which though they bee not exquisite, or curious, yet they shall not want their commendation, being priuate and sincere; and by so much more acceptable to him, who will be worshipped sincerely and in truth. Thus by thy example and inuitation, the rest of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull multitude, shall learne to acknowledge, and worship that diuine benignity; neither art thou onely vnthankefull, for there is no mortall man that lyeth not sicke of this Infirmity.</p>

It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a sluggish insolent disposition, to think that he hath right to vse any man without respect as a vassall. For (saith he) I was no sooner a man, but I was borne Honorable. If I do respect both my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, I am able to deriue my petigree from auntie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t memory, and Honorable families: From hence I haue noble, and many affinities, vpon which I may leane and support my selfe. My riches and estate are answerable to these; and that which chiefely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents me, I see base persons borne to scarsity, and the bondslaues of pouerty. This man drudgeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually at plough: that man all the day long sitteth at some sordide trade to gaine his liuing: An other man he buieth cheape, to sell deare: and to that end saileth with danger into forraine seas: Another, hee studieth vnpleasing learning, to make a gain of in the market; I do not meane in the market where things are sold, but the market of gainefull knowledge, and the mercenary tongue, who euer finds out of other mens businesse a good aduantage to inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And the minds of all these, are base; and to this <hi>basenesse</hi> are ioyned <hi>deceits;</hi> and as brokers to these deceits <hi>vntruths.</hi> Now as I scorne all these courses, so I liue as a King amongst them; and that which these labour for, to that am I borne. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21640:19"/>
my mind is not, as euery base fellowes; groue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; but hauty, erected, and full of high thoughts. For it weareth not it selfe away, in these sordide and obscure things, nor liues intangled in any base gaine. This is my excellent prerogatiue, that I am behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to none. And other men before I was borne were in my debt, that men may vnderstand that I am not borne to my substance, but my substance to me. Besides I haue the best aduantages to rise to honour, to come to great preferments; and what other men can wish for, that can I no sooner hope for, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it. Last of all (which is the chiefest of all) that other men do liue in safety, it is by the meanes of me, and such as I am. For if any publique danger arise, then is the common safety required and expected, at our hands. It belongeth to our honours, to defende our countries, and offend our enemies. It belongeth to vs, to haue the chardge, and the leading of them.

owne happinesse. And that hee may proceede, to make experience, of his owne felicity, in all things that himselfe desireth: therefore freed from al cares, I will take what pleasure so euer may bee had: I am purposed to tast all that may season my life.

So farre hath thy disdaine whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly besotted thee; so farre hath thy sinister dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on spotted thy faire estate and honorable condition: thou saist thou wert a man and noble, both at once; thou doost please mee in that at the first ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, thou confessest thy selfe a man; although I knowe this speach, rather foll from thee vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, then was spoken with any consideration. For in that worde, thou art putt in minde of thy beginning, which is common to thee with the lowest of the common sort; And although thou
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21640:20"/>
contemne him in respect of thy selfe, as one grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the dunghill, yet he hath the same begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of humanitie, that thou hast; His life is to bee run in the same race, and with the same course, must he finish the period of his mortalitie &amp; to conclude, he flyeth aloft with the same wings of eternitie that thou doest. In one word thou art not more a man then hee (or to say more plainely) hee is as much a man as thou. But thou proceedest further, to set forth thy selfe, and him, that by comparing, thou maist grow insolent; depressing him, whilst thou ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancest thy selfe; esteeming him, as base, and of no reckoning.</p>
            <p>Herein, if any man should aske thee, what Nobilitie is, I know thou wilt answere, it is the <hi>Honor and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of Kindred;</hi> But I will tell thee some-thing more plainely, and more soundly, that thou who dost admire nothing so much as thy kindred, by which thou growest insolent, yet mayst confesse, to be true: <hi>Nobilitie, I say is an honor due to a vertue emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; publikly profitable;</hi> not only in his person, that first doth it, but also in his posterity, which are not adulterate, ingrafted, or degenerous: And therefore <hi>Note,</hi> is onething, and <hi>Nobilitie</hi> is an other. Many are of <hi>Note,</hi> of whom we are to take heed, as of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, but he that is truely <hi>Noble,</hi> it is a vertue, and a dutie, to knowe him. Thou, when thou wert first borne, broughtest no vertue into the worlde with thee, therefore thou mightest be of <hi>Note,</hi> as one
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21640:21"/>
richly borne, and of a great family, but thou couldest not be Noble; but only in the suffrages, and wishes of those, who fauour the name, vertue and posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Auncestours, from whence thou art des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended; and from thence presupposing all these to be in thee. For men are naturally apt, to hope for those vertues in thee, which are promised in thy birth. For all good men (saith <hi>Tullie)</hi> fauour No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, both, because it is profitable to the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that Noble men be worthy their ancestours, and because the memorie of honorable men, who haue deserued well of the Commonwealth (though dead) doth and ought to preuaile, with vs. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy Nobilitie; then when thou wert borne, was in hope, not in being, peraduenture in the roote, not yet in the braunches; neither doth alwaies,

            <p>Now when thou art growne vp, and stronge, I demand, wherin thou dost make men know, that the honorable, and happie vertues of thy famely, are not withered in thee. How shal we vnderstand that thou who art begotten, &amp; borne of great hope dost grow to the glorie of thy auncestours, &amp; that the fruite so much hoped for, doth grow out of thy braunches? Where is thy auncient bloud? Where is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie of thy fore-fathers? Where is the glorie of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21640:21"/>
thy house? I graunt the signes, and tokens of honor, may be receiued either from thy Auncestors, or from the Prince: but <hi>Nobilitie</hi> and honor it selfe, is the rewarde of thy owne vertue. That vertue, which in things acceptable to the people, doubtful, and full of profit, and hazard, at all times, and by all meanes, doth show it selfe; which in the time of peace, and securitie, erecteth the ensignes of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and iustice, wherein all both publike and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate felicities are contained; and then doth bringe foorth troppes of all those vertues, which are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids to both. And when the Common-wealth, is disquieted with warrs, either at home, or abroad, doth oppose against the enemie, <hi>Fortitude,</hi> and what ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue soeuer is a companion to it; for what vertues, for what prayses art thou to be esteemed? speake boldly. Instead of answere, I see thy doubting: for that which is not, neither can the tongue vtter, nor the minde conceiue. Seing therefore thou wilt say nothing, I will answere for thee. But canst thou here? In one word, neither vertue, nor praise, that either I, or thou, or any man els knoweth, is in thee. But goe to, with what right or with what confidence, dost thou vsurpe this same honorable title of Nobilitie, which thou admirest in thy selfe, and for which thou thinkest thy selfe so excellent? It is (thou saist) the gift of my ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, as are the other signes of Nobilitie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I boast. I heare the name; I see the signes; but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the thing.

I feare least the auncient honor of thy forefathers, in thy person, be darkened and growen out of vse. If not, as it was first gained by men, vertuous, and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valiant, so it ought to be borne againe, in thee, this Nobilitie, which thou boastest to be born with thee: neither can any thinge bee more foolish, then to bee called, that which thou art not. Nothing hath more affinitie with slouth, then to be willing, to bee taken for another, then thou art. Nothing is more vniust, then to vsurpe another mans, for thine owne. Nothing is more shameles, then to desire to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Noble for kindred, not for vertue. Neither is vertue transferred with the same facilitie, that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, are to the heyers. Vertue is euerie mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and peculiar good: and whosoeuer hath not this, doth not only carrie the Idle, but the odious name, and title of Nobilitie. But thou boastest of those, whose posteritie thou art, and desirest men to obserue thy petigree. Well if I should doe so much for thee, and by degrees go backe with thee, to him whose father first gaue honor to thy familie, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture I should bring thee to a beginning, thou wouldest bee ashamed of: why art thou pase? It is auncient, that <hi>Plato</hi> saith, <hi>Seruants doe come of Kings, and of seruants doe come Kinges.</hi> And what maruaile?

And vertue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the iniurie of fortune, doth best show what euerie man is. And therefore if thou wilt know
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21640:24"/>
what thou art, who and how great thou art, defende not thy selfe with this glorious title, borrow not the vertues of others, but bring forth thy own; thou foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly boastest the benefit of thy stocke, if thou suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest thy ancestours that are dead, to be better known then thy selfe, that art aliue: Show how much true nobilitie there is in thee, that is, how much vertue in thy minde, how much faith in thy words, and deeds. Show from what stocke thou art. By this meanes shall men esteeme thee in hope greater, for fame better, and for inward vprightnesse, more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, that thus honours, may be giuen thee, not thy kindred, thy person, not thy name, thy manners, notthy auncestours.

                  <l>Nor boast their vertues that did liue before,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Kindred and our stocke is like a faire Table, which either may be made more beautifull by a picture, or polluted and defaced with staines. If those things be ioyned to thy birth which do make thy birth greate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are the praises of thy auncestours renued; if those things, which do blemish thy stocke, then there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle greatnes in thy kindred, &amp; in those things that are annexed to it; Infamie, &amp; reproach? These are those polluted staines, that deface the Images of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21640:25"/>
which the more honorable, they showe our auncestours to be, the greater and more intollerable; is the slouth of their sluggish and degenerous poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
            <p>Now with the insolency of thy kindred, thou dost arrogantly remember thy supporters, thy <hi>Affinitie,</hi> &amp; <hi>Riches;</hi> which are good to those that vse them well, but to those that vse them otherwise, are euill; Nay, carefully take heede least the aboundance and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plentie of ouermuch riches, drowne thy narrow, and weake minde in many vices, and consume those seedes of vertue, that are planted in thee, for

            <p>If thou truely vndestoodest how little or nothing, riches do helpe to vertue, then thou wouldest thinke more mildly, and more honestly of pouertie, and of the poore multitude painefully, and profitably dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed into vertuous courses.

Neither the Countrie, the Citie, the Court, nor the campe.

For as in the bodie, the thighes, legges, and feete, though they be in inferiour, yet are not in worse and lesse needfull place, then the armes, and the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; so these kinde of men doe inioye that roome, and place in the Common-wealth, which if they for sake, it must needes fall. For whethersoeuer <hi>Necessity</hi> extends it selfe, thither reacheth art, which is natures follower. For as great and wise states-men gouerne our liues, so artificers and workemen serue our liues: whilst they furnish and adorn our liues with their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie vses. Woe vnto mans weakenes if it bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of these helpes, for none of these but liueth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods rule, because hee can show how he liueth; which whosoeuer in old time could not doe, it was death vnto him; which custome <hi>Augustus,</hi> that famous name, amongst the <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> precisely obserued, when he obtained the <hi>Decemuirs</hi> of the <hi>Senat,</hi> that euerie Knight might giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how hee liued, And of those that were disalowed, some were punished, and some noted with infamie. Therefore if thy birth aduance thee, their industrie commended them; and as thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life is hyer, so theirs is much saffer, and more assured; For whilst they are about good busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they auoyd Idlenesse, and serue the Common-wealth, whatsoeuer is necessary to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth to applie thy witte, and thy hand, to that, though it bee not glorious, yet it is honest. Furthermore in that thou reprehendest husbandrie, thou dealest
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21640:26"/>
frowardnes, and after the manner of the <hi>Thralians</hi> which prouokest thy nourisher, without which thou mayst neede, thou maist hunger: Besides it is a kinde of life, most sincere, and most innocent. In it, there is againe, vertuous, most stable, least enuious; For the Diuine nature (saith <hi>Varro)</hi> gaue feilds, but humane arte built cyties. Surely of husbandmen (saith <hi>Cato)</hi> are borne the strongest, and best souldiers; and men of least harmefull thoughts, are they that liue of husbandry. Next vnto these are Merchants, which seasonably prouide for mens necessities, whilst they so mingle the commodities of seuerall Countries, that whatsoeuer is afforded any where, may bee founde euerie where. It is a fauourable trade, and that which mingleth in trafficke, all the Kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the earth: But at this daye, with much losse to the Common-wealth neglected. For there are a kinde of vulgar and common people, who neclecting the honest course of auoyding pouertie, and inriching their families, doe ambitiously affect honors, which are euer sumptuous. From hence po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie creepeth into their houses, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their houses into the Common-wealth, which wanteth wealth to vphold it. Besids, that which is gotten by Marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, is not so much to be tearmed the praye of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, as the Instrument of bountie, cleanlines, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, and honor. Take away the spots of the mind, &amp; with all you take away the staines of the thing; &amp; whereas you say that Merchantes wearie their time

Besids, the wits &amp; capacities of many, by this means are made more exquisit &amp; in the managing of afaires haue a riper knowledge, and more perfect wisedom, whilst euery man maketh a profit of an others expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Now Iudge if there be any thing in this which either thou or any man can dispraise, and not rather commend, and admire. Besides, from great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise, arise often great reuenewes, and from great reuenewes deriued innocently to their vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous posterities, Nobility. And this I see to be and euer to haue been the iudgment and account of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery honest, and wise man, as right so by publike co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent most approued. But whilst out of euery thing, you take that which is worst, that from the faults of men (an vsuall fault) you may take occasion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base whatsoeuer you despise, as your manner is) you
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21640:27"/>
also scoffe the Lawyer. Neither you doo consider, that euery mans doubtfull estate, destitute of this so profitable a defence, dooth easily run headlong, and the helpe which a man wanteth in himselfe, by this meanes he findeth in an other. For this cause there is nothing more excellent, then to exceed in faith, wisedome, and eloquence; because there is nothing more full of humanity, and more deuine then to bestow so many and so great ornaments, and the whole course of our life in defending of other mens dangers. For whosoeuer amidst so many and so great tempests of this life, and in this vnbridled licentiousnesse of impiety, mildely doth helpe the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, or bestoweth his labour in so troublesome an office; hee is to all men as a fortunate and sauing Starre. For men are not more bound to any man for any thing, then to see part of their burden deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vppon an other; and by a substitute care with an vnited force, their owne weakenesse to bee supported. Of what reckoning the praise of this hath beene (that I may call thee to auntient and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous exampels) the Noble <hi>Romanes</hi> well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; From hence they made their enterance to fame, and besids these, Consuls and men worthy to haue triumphed gained in the defence of causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Iudges, no lesse opinion &amp; matter of prayse, then when they before had triumphed ouer their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered enemies.</p>
            <p>For these men after things valiantly and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21640:27"/>
performed, made knowne that the valiantest breasts are often accompanied with the happiest wittes; and that the best wits haue often the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test eloquence, and that the praise that riseth from hence, is equall with the campe, and deserueth as much, as to bee a valiant Leader. For the profits that arise from hence, are not lesse then those which proceede from the other. Therefore I beseech you what enuy is it, if at this day there be not a meanes of more honorable aduantage, both to attaine riches, and greatnesse then this is? In that you say mercenarily, they set to saile, a thinge that is excellent, you note foorth the faults of men, and not diminish the dignity of their calling; take from them extortiones, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue wranglings, cut off indirect courses, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish all base and vnworthy dealing, (things seuerely punishable by lawe) the honesty of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth from which these fees and deserued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances doo no whit detract, nor any other lawe doth giue iust imputation of basenesse, which forbid the corruption of a mercenary tongue. Neither is it fit, that this kinde of men, both priuately and publikely so profitable, should be depriued of the iust recompence, and fruite of their labour, seeing those auntient honours, due to this gowned war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare are taken from them, <hi>dignity and Office;</hi> in place whereof haue succeeded these which properly and fitly are called <hi>Honorable fees;</hi> both, because
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21640:28"/>
they are giuen for honour, to honest men, and for an honest cause. Besids, this is as a seminary, from whence princes doo take not onely men skilfull in law and iustice, but those who weare fit to sit at the helme of the common wealth, and to be of counsell to kings: And seeing their office is but a part of the Prince his charge, what hath the armour &amp; the sheild, why it should despise as base, the gowne, and the pen. Let these imployments be accounted ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure shadowes, whilst we must needs confesse, that they are very great, and very profitable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very honorable. And whereas thou sayst, thou hast no base mind but high and generous; I should prayse thee if this were truly spoken; if in steade of high and great, thou didst not shew thy selfe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of those things, which ought to be much esteemed. For the greatnesse of the minde, is not discerned by swelling wordes, but by the often and accustomable vse of vertue; and things that are boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of, are nothing but a disdaine of the eares; and a loathing and hatred to the mind. And this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in that thou saist those things wheare-with thou swellest, were first thine, before thou wert the worlds or inioyed this light. From hence thou gatherest, that thou wert not borne to serue them, but all these things to serue thee.</p>
            <p>These speeches are the rules of pride, and the arguments of thy Ignorance: as though thou were borne to some other end, then all others are; and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21640:28"/>
not to worship and reuerence him, whose gift it is, that thou art, and who hath commaunded thee no lesse to procure other mens good, then thy owne. VVhich is not done, by idle think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and proude expecting, what honours men doo vnto thee, And wherein they doo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe thee but in a diligence of profitable duties, and in a vertuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and willing readinesse, to doo good. This will prooue those Honours that do come to meete thee, not rashely to bee caste and throwne vppon thee, as a liberty, not to bee as spoyles are, but to bee giuen with good aduise, as to one who placeth true honour, first in his owne conscience before the iudgments and opinions of men; rather in the vprightnesse of behauiour, then in the glory of titles. For he that is any thing or little lesse then his honour, is not honoured by it at all, but ouer-loaden. Therefore thou must consider circumspectly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what confidence thou boastest thy honours; which are so, to those whome they doo adorne, or thy great Ecclesiasticall dignities which thou estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest best, that are most rich, not most holy; and what holinesse is required of those, who aspyre vnto that honour. A Preest sayth the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rauennas</hi> (who had his Name from his goulden speech) is the forme of Vertue. Thou boastest also thy Dukedomes and thy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21640:29"/>
Lordships, which to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, to those also is committed the common and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique safety. Take from a <hi>Generall</hi> the arts and true properties of a generall, hee is not a generall, but a trifler; fatally erected as a destroier, and subuerter of the common good.</p>
            <p>If thou vnderstoodest the greatnesse of this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, thou wouldest constantly refuse it, seeing, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer gouerneth without iust furniture for such a chardge, doth not gouerne and command, but man doth commit this chardge to a vaine glorious, and improuident man, exercised in nothing, strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with no good counsell, relying only vpon his birth, not his owne firme vertue, what shall become of the commonwealth? Doo you not see, and must you not confesse, that a sword is giuen to a mad man wherewith he woundeth himself and him that meets him? Nay, wherewith he slaieth the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth? Do you then call this praise, honour, fame, which is a staine, and infamy, a reproach? Alas, I am sorry, least thou flatter thy selfe with a fauourable &amp; plausa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble error, &amp; that be happines to thee which is vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines in the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of others, whilst thou boastest of the goods of the body, and fortune, insteade of the goods of the mind, &amp; things which are of low place, thou placest a lost and which are impediments, thou settest in the forefront of honour: Mans true good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is in the minde, which if it be furnished with profitable arts, it neither admireth these as rewards,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21640:29"/>
nor refuseth them as accessions, to his rewards, as things wherein there is neither praise nor honour, because they make no man better, they make no man worse. Hee is very idle that admireth these things; seeing then that kindred without vertue is neither good, nor euill, and that possessions by many casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties may faile, and so the multitude of followers forsake a man, it must needes bee, that honour is no greater then you that haue it; the strength of it then being in the hands of others, what is it that thou carriest thy selfe so proudley? and as though thou hadst placed thy selfe and all that is thine in safety? thou aimest only at this, that laying all care aside, thou maist cast thy selfe into the armes of pleasure, which will poyson the good bloud if there be any in thee; if any vertue, it will weaken it, if any beauty, it will staine it. O strange error! He that may haue true and permanent good things, to take pleasure in things of no continuance; beleeue me, to liue a life; idle, and full of pleasure, is not to liue, but he which bestoweth his time vpon vertue, all parts of his life, are beautifull and full of pleasure. This is that, which the seuerity of the schoole teacheth, &amp; which is contained in the monuments of those, who labour to drawe men from vice, and commend vertue. Dost thou account these seuere admonitions, that are wholesome, and indeede nothing els but Gods own voice, which awaketh those which are drowsie, calleth backe those that do erre, confirmeth those
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21640:30"/>
that are weake, and blesseth all? To these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels thy fore-fathers obeyd, whose examples in like manner, I wish thou wouldest followe, in this respect that they are familiar, domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and not farre sought. It was not their sluggish and voluptuous life, that gained those things to thee which puffe thee vppe. But first they were Conquerers of their owne faults, and of their enemies forces: With both these they gayned triumphant Garlands: which with thee I feare me will wither, waxe pale, and lose their greenenesse; From these if thou hast receiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny motions to vertue, thou art very vnfortunat, if thou doost not perfect them, with all labour, and immitation. By this meanes thou shalt not bee loaden with the honorable Images, of Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours, but thou shalt increase thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie with a greate Citizen, and an Honourable Autor, to thy posteritie. This one thinge, shall bee a meanes, to make thee like those, from whome thou art discended; so that, they shall bee thought either borne againe, or to liue in thee, whose glorie by thy vertue, thou hast renewed. From hence maist thou bee thankefull to GOD, who hath placed thee in this watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower, that thou mayst neuer cast thy eyes, from the Commonwhealth; but bee as profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto it, as thy condition requireth; which by this meanes only thou mayst make excellent.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21640:30"/>
If thou art otherwise minded, the more insolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou boastest of that prerogatiue, the violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth thy arrogancie discouer it selfe; thou shalt perceiue (but too late) thy great fault, and thy greater punishment.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Man, I did thinke thee to bee poore, but not in this manner that I now see thee, namely with a pouertie much worse, and farre more dangerous. to thee as to the rest of the multitude, whether thou hast riches or no, it is in others mens power; and thou dost not consider that nothing is more subiect to robber, theeues, fire, and other innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable casualties then they are; Oh, how rich wert thou, and consequently how happie, if thou knowest how these things are to bee valued at their iust price; then thou shouldest vnderstande, true riches to bee placed in the minde, which if it bee equall to it selfe, not a couetous, not an admirer of anothers, not an enuier of any mans estate, not an ambitious affector of any mans greatnes, it may then contend in happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21640:32"/>
with any mans felicitie. But from pouertie to vertue thou sayst the way is harde, full of difficulties, and almost beset: hard I graunt, but not beset, for a minde that is truely great, hauing vertue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as a reward, doth cast downe whatsoeuer is a let vnto it; &amp; the diligent and industrious mind, doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quer those things which to slouth seeme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable. Nay, what if vertue be neerer in freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to pouertie, then to enuious riches? Surely, the waye to vertue seemeth more readie, by which pouertie creepeth, then that wherein riches boast.
<q>
                  <l>Learne thou from hence, the power of sober want.</l>
                  <l>Carius was poore, when Kings he ouer came.</l>
                  <l>Fabritius poore, that scorned Pirrhus gold,</l>

            </p>
            <p>For pouertie, and faith, a good minde and true valour, are often inseperable companions; but to riches, there cleaueth oftentimes, the drosse of leaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, insolencie, and slouth, many haue liued fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly, by induring pouerty patiently; a weake minde (and who allmost hath not a weake minde) is easily corrupted with riches.

of all things: and as a man may bringe forth an infinit number of poore men, which with frugalitie, and sparing, as with sure, stayres, haue climed vp a loft. so there be millions of rich men headlonge cast downe, whether riotousnes, and pleasure, sweete (but pesti'ent vices) haue led them. From this wombe, haue proceeded so many troupes of sinnes, so many Idle slow bellies, as the Gretians call them: fatte and vnweildly.

                  <l>No sinne from thence, nor act of lust did want,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For it often happeneth that whosoeuer seeketh to enter into fame, beginneth with vertue, &amp; endeth with sin, and iniuries: with vertue, whilst he is poore, with sinne, through the perswasion of increasing ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Thou saist, rich men haue a plaine way to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: I graunt it plaine, but deceitfull; and in it there are a thousande windings of vices, a thousande al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of pleasures, a thousande by-pathes of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: for to rich men, that desire to sinne, all wayes are open, but a poore man that declineth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the waye of vertue, necessitie (as it were by the hande) leadeth him to the right way: for whilest hee indeuoureth himselfe, to that which is harde, and full of difficultie, hee scarce euer tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his eyes, from vertue, which is his loade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starre. Then in suffering labor, hee inuiteth dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21640:33"/>
frugalite, modestie, and going vnto vertue, hee only treadeth the right pathes of vertue. The way peraduenture is hard, but direct, and sure; for hee is much more nimble in this course, then hee that walketh loaden with burdens, whome many things call aside, many things do hinder, and howe much hee goeth on, so much hee soundly reioyceth that he hath profited.</p>
            <p>Then hee is infinitely inflamed to the rest of his iourney that remaines, and hee is so ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his proceeding, that hee is scarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a mediocritie; and to conclude, hee thinketh nothing done, if hee haue not perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted what hee hath begunne, and by so much more hee imbraceth his owne pouertie, by howe much hee seeth, more occasions hereby offered to lay a side, and to putte off his base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to conquer lettes, and also to obtaine honor.</p>
            <p>Surely, if a man wash away those staynes, that cleaue to euerie man from his birth, if then hee bee beautifull, and like the Champion of vertue, if hee then be reckoned amongst those, that be honorable, if with the guiding of vertue, hee come for to gouerne the Commonwealth, if from the plough (as the prouerbe is) hee bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to the scepter, if hee bee in his owne knowledge a performer of honorable attemptes; then shall hee perceiue what it is to serue

vnder such a captaine, when he seeth so great allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance made vnto those that follow him; besides often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a man in danger, there is no hauen safer then pouertie.

that this substance was so richly bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, not to be an iustrument of madding &amp; fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick desires, not a coach to draw you to all pleasures not a nourishment to your ryotousnesse; not foode to your vnsatiable bellies, But that rather amidst heape of riches, should shine your modesty, shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse, frugality, sobriety, and your especiall thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mind to God. It is no praise to be rich, but it is a glorious thing in the midst of riches to be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and from his daily allowance euer to lay some thing aside, to relieue those who haue neede of a helping hand and a ready and seasonable liberality. These are those gratefull thankes, which he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of you, who is the great bestower of all bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, and whome mortality can requite in nothing, but in a thankefull minde.

This substance (asit seemeth) is not a pleasure vnto thee, but a torment.

            <p>And amongst so many benefits of God, thou dost only be wray a rauenous, furious, and vnthfankull mind. I beseech thee acknowledge that these lets are remooued from thee, which hinder the attaining of thinges excellent; and that the occasions are taken

For as we comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d men, so things command vs, and no man hath things in his power, but he that obeyeth the necessitie of them. They say, whatsoeuer pleaseth me is a Law; these are tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles. For it is much truer that the law often ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth what I like. For the lawe to mee is harde and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable: and as it restrayneth the multitude, so to my words and deedes it is a most seuere censor. My words (they say) with no contrarietie nor no consent of men can be deluded. There is nothing so false as this, seeing I am compelled, often to speak one thing, and thinke another. It is often my greatest aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that I am not vnderstood. Surely, whosoeuer with a reaching head vnderstandeth mee, sometimes doth vnderstand a little more then is fitte. Therefore
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21640:49"/>
to my wordes (but when they are solemne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with deliberation) men must not euer giue credit. And although often I do speake truely, yet those that doe catch my wordes, either with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersnesse of their owne, or an ingrafted sinister dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, turne them to what they please: they say it is in my power, in what state and condition euery man shall liue. If I should grant that this were so, yet I must confesse that euen in this respect, I scarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue true quiet.</p>
            <p>For I am euer doubtfull, and in suspence, least I offend any man vnwillingly, least I discountenance him that is worthie, aduance him that is vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or vnawares ouerthrow my selfe, and my owne state: For euen this verie <hi>Soueraintie</hi> it selfe, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth me (both publikely and priuatly) to the enuies, hatreds, and iealousies of men: all which easily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this state.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, the longer they lurke, the more fatally and more dangerously they breake out. Besids you say (as I please) I doe giue to my subiects peace, and warre. Yea euen this, is amongst the ils of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that great distructions, and publike calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are referred vnto them onely, as to the cheefe authors: when indeede the true causes of them are hidde secretly, in the deepe, and sticke fast in more hidden rootes, then the counsels of men. This is that vniust ignoraunce of the common people, from whence so much enuie is deriued

to the prince. Of things well don, euery man drawes the honor to himselfe, but the prince alone, must beare the burden of others madnes. They say, I haue that preheminence, that whatsoeuer I wil, or wil not, is in my owne power. It were indeede an excellent thing, if it were. If thus a man might satisfie all; if all men were of one minde. But whosoeuer thinketh thus, doth not consider, that I only neuer sayle in a calme, but am perpetually tost in the waues of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and lie only open to the differinge censures of good and ill, and to euerie light ignorant and idle fable. Therefore in this respect, that so much is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto mee, I haue reason greatly for to feare, least I should do any thing to ouerthrowe this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. If any man consider well, hee shall see, that in this great libertie there is least. Neither doe men take vnto themselues more harde iudgement, or secret speeches then against the pince; Of whome to speake euill, and to dislike his doinges (whether they bee good or badde) it is not a corruption of a fewe, but of longe time, a popular vertue, you say, those whome I doe admitte into Counsell, they doe first gather out my meaning, before they expresse their owne, least they should thinke something diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from me.</p>
            <p>Let it be so, may not my crueltie and that feare, which men haue of mee, bee gathered from hence, as also their owne sluggish and iniurious distrust of mee.

For if they be admitted, to this end to guide me with their counsell; why doe they dissemble it? If they thinke well, profitably, and for the good of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth; why doe they first gather what is my meaning? VVhy doe they so carefully and warely deliuer their owne opinion to trye mine? why doe they so slauishly submit their voices vnto me? doubt lesse, they doe it to that end that they may seeme to thinke the same that I doe; that thus by the likenes of councell, they may make themselues easily more neere vnto me. Doe they not thus withdraw their faith and fidelity from me? Am I not by this means forsaken of those I ought not, in things that are most weighty? Namely, those who ought to call mee backe when I erre, to hold me vp when I slyde, to raise mee vp when I fall, craftily doe cast me head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into destruction. So farre doe they proceede in the contention of flattery, in the impudency of lying, and in the study of deceit. Then in what state am I, if these be true as they are most true? Do not these deuouring gulphes euer gape after my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes? what? if I bestowe so much vpon them as they wickedly couet or impudently beg? If in those things which falsely and fraudelently they steale, they see our winking at it, are we not streight made a pray vnto pouerty, then which, no enemy can bee greater to a kingdome? If I do giue with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and according to mens deserts, presently they account mee base and nigardly. So whether I giue,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21640:51"/>
or not giue, I must either want or bee enuied; but you say all men striue to insinnuate themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my fauour, to bee neerer and more powerfull with mee, seeing to bee inwarde with princes and to execute their commaundements is nothing else but to part and deuide soueraignety with them; this may teach all men, in what slippery estate were stand, and how little wee are at our owne pleasure, who must be subiect to other mens vyces, to obey o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens wits, and to be led whether they will haue vs. If vices would shew themselues as they are, there is no man but would be affraid and tremble at them; but to Princes they offer themselues disguisde, they carrie a shape of vertue with them, and so easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinnuate themselues.

Indeede thus I am safe, as a Cittie, all whose gates are diligently kept, except one, which is open to the enemies; neither can the Prince (though with his authoritie he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand euery man) eschew the trecheries of all; for there wil neuer some be wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, which (moued with vniust hatred) conspire his ouerthrow; there be eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where examples of this, by which we may see how the liues of Princes, are open to euery mans wicked conspiracie; yea and oftentimes such furious assaults are ioyfully accepted amongst the multitude, So that those are thought to haue deferued best of the common wealth, who haue compast vs about with such treacherous factions, and amongst the vulgar multitude, there is no newes receiued with greater applause; nothing more acceptable to the ignorant people, then this; that the yoke of a tyrant is taken from their neckes, and rewards are bestowed vpon the murderers.

And am I by this more famous? more excellent? and not rather more stained, more vexed? whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer belongeth to mee, that they say it is fit to bee knowne publikly. This also is to bee reckoned, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the infelicitie of Princes; that priuate mens faults oftentimes humility, conscience, and charity dooth hide, and the least blemishes in vs, are publikely shewed as great deformities; from hence it commeth, that whatsoeuer sinne, or filthinesse is any where, all that almost, is thought either to proceede from the PRINCE, or to rest vppon him; neither doe priuate men sinne more sparingly, but more secretly; men easily doe pardon their owne faultes, but neuer the PRINCES, nay the more equall euery man is to himselfe, the more vniuste hee is to the PRINCE; and as concerning pleasures, from the plenty whereof, commeth a difficulty of choice, I would to GOD those could see the end of them, who from these do measure our felicitie, with grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous (yet deserued punishments.)</p>
            <p>They should well vnderstand, hovv light, how flitting, how fearefull, they are and full of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for the very aboundance of these thinges, which you so much esteeme dooth take from euery thing, the sweete and the pleasure of them; neither dooth that euer delight vs, which truth commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to vs, but which nouelty; what is exquisite, speciall, and not common; Euery common

thing be it neuer so excellent, groweth base; and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone as there be many of them, they are cheape; It is scarse any pleasure at all; that is a pleasure to all; but these which in the opinion of the multitude are so much to be desired, doe compasse the princes young yeares about, before he learne to know them, hate them, or eschewe them; hee first tasteth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill things, before hee knoweth them to be euill, he first vnderstandeth himselfe to bee taken, before hee hath any power to take heede of these ineui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deceits; neither can hee with any force he hath, repell the violence of those pleasures, that doe assaulte him. Away with that felicitie, (which if it bee any) yet is not of that value, that thereby the minde should bee besotted; the body weakened; and the fame darkened; and to follow pleasures, what is it but to hunt sickenesse, griefe and shame? True pleasures, and which indeede deserue the name of pleasures, are fewe, and do happen to priuate men oftener, then to Princes; our pleasures are counterfeit, masked, and full of danger, and to conclude, they are not that they seeme, and that which truly is in them (if there bee any thing truly in them) is lesse then that which is not, or worse, or more daungerous. My wishes they say are not onely performed, but sweetned. Those wishes must needes bee lowe, and beneath the dignity of this place, which a man may so easily obtaine; they ayme at nothing that is great, at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

From hence there springeth so much enuie to vs, as we nan scarce endure; as though wee had gotten the vttermost happinesse vpon earth, So that our kinde of life is scarce knowne to bee vnsafe, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, full of daunger, of any other, then of those that are borne to bee Princes. All things with vs are full of suspitions, cares, and feare.

            <p>He that ought to be altogether in giuing of thanks, is ashamed to be seene thankefull: he whose conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is aboue all, placeth himselfe lower then all; not in want of vnderstanding; but in that (though his place be excellent) yet he dare boldly vpbraid the bestower of it, with what termes shall I censure this corrupt and sinister disposion: Shall I call him blinde, that cannot see those thinges, whose brightnes shine in euerie mans eyes? Or rather madde, which

proudly treadeth vnder foote, which all men admire, that they are bestowed vpon him? or dull and earth ly, which perceiueth not those things, in the midst whereof hee is placed? or to say more truely wicked, which with a strang confidence acknowledgeth none of those things that appertaine to his calling? Well I will deliuer my selfe, and thee whosoeuer thou art that readest this, out of this doubt I will call him <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull;</hi> and in this one word containe all his sham. And first in the verie entrance thou bewrayest thy friuoulous boasting, who saist that they know nothing which esteeme thy condition better then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of other men; As though thou only in respect of all other men (who thinkest thus) thought truely, and other men were deceiued, who see thee in the midst of the Sonne to complaine of light. But indeed it is much truer, that thou only hast weak eyes, which together with thy minde are both blinded, with that light that doth shine about theee; This first dazeleth thee, then others; whose minds are infected with thelike error. Thou sayst that <hi>principalitie</hi> and <hi>Souerain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> are like a Tower seated in a straite, and slipperie place, where a man must perpetually watch: this hitherto is well spoken, If thou speakest it with that minde that it ought; but I see thou showest not the excellency of that place, but the danger. Thou dost not acknowledge, that thou art seated in a glorious, and high place, but complainest that it is slipperie, &amp; full of downefalles; Neither dost thou speake as one
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21640:56"/>
warie, but as one quarrelous, and complaining; not as one remembring, and magnifying thy condition, but detracting from it. Art thou in that minde that thou thinkest it is lawfull for any man to bee Idle, and secure? Suppose thy selfe not to be in that place, set thy selfe with the common people, make not thy selfe singular, yet thou canst not denie, but thou art committed to thy owne charge; if no other, yet this charitie (I am sure) is ingrafted in thee; For to this ende thou art borne, that thou shouldest neuer leaue thy selfe, but toward thy selfe keepe a continuall guard, goe whether thou wilt, bee as dissolute and as negligent as thou canst; yet thou mayst not flye nor escape thy selfe; from thy selfe without any tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, thou art warnd, that thou must nourish, frame, and till thy selfe; Surely no hard prouince, no labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious worke, whereunto willingly thou commest and by the light of nature; But as it is easie to bee cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this, so it is as hard and difficult to performe it: For all other things are to be left, or rather al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges are to bee done, that this one thinge may be perfected.</p>
            <p>There is no mortall man, that hath not this person, this charge, put vpon him: and therfore what care, or labour soeuer is bestowed in this, it is not <hi>Labor,</hi> but <hi>Nature.</hi> And if thou bestowe this care and paines vpon others, it is <hi>Gouernement,</hi> that is a dutie to rule others. But whether it be a dutie, or a burden, vpon whomsoeuer it is imposed, with all it
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21640:57"/>
is commanded him to beare it valiantly; and firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obey him, whose only benefit it is, that euerie man is. Therefore rightly thou maist call <hi>Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or rule, a care of an other mans wellfare:</hi> seeing the great weight of it, can neither be ballanst, nor stand without a gouernour. Therefore whosoeuer is aduanced to this dignitie, to him is the publike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit propounded and he is giuen (as it were from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen) as a remedy and safegard for all. This if thou more carefully considerest, what and how great it is, then shalt thou vnderstand the excellencie and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of this place: wherein whosoeuer standes, he so farre exceedeth all other men, as farre as euerie man exceedeth all those thinges which admire man as their Lord, their gouernor, and their ruler. Therfore it is true that thou (who art a Prince) sustainest the person of God: and performest his office, in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, example, gouernment.</hi> And dost thou thinke that any thing can be spoken, or wisht for, higher and more honorable then this? But if this dignitie doe not erect thee, but ouerwhelme thee, take heede that thou accuse not the bountie of God, but secretly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the narrownes of thine owne breast, and the weakenes of thy minde, vnfit for so great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and vncapable of such a Maiestie. But because <hi>Soueraintie</hi> (as thou callest it) is a Tower, know that therein thou art a continuall watch man, a searcher out of mens manners, a continuall obseruer of all that is done, least a passage bee made through
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21640:57"/>
sinnes and faults, and other pestilent infections, to ouerthrow those things which are committed to thy faith, and credit. If thou excludest these things, if thou layest Iustice as a foundation of concorde: If this concorde of thy subiects thou increasest with faith; If thou sharpenest the loue of the Common-wealth with vertue; If all thy subiects perceiue thee to bee a Prince, not by <hi>Impositions,</hi> but <hi>benefits;</hi> If with these benefites thou preuentest their desires; to conclude, if thy goodnesse bee equall to thy power; if the higher thou art, thou art so much the better; thou shalt assure men that Maiestie is well bestowed vpon thy person: thou shalt possesse their hearts, and euerie mans vowes and wishes shall be, that God the great King, and gouernour of all thinges, will be as gratious to thee, as thou art to those that liue vnder thee. Last of all, this Maiestie shall supplie vnto thee, those sweete pleasures which are layd aside, for those only whom God aduanceth to so high an honor. Further, <hi>he that careth for the good of the Common-wealth, the whole Common-wealth watcheth for his good,</hi> and the guard, that he is attended with all, are not so much a defence as an ornament: hee that establisheth this concord of all, this concord is to him an inuincible defence, he that imbraceth al with a true loue, him al men imbrace with a true and happie loue. This therefore is to bee a Prince, in the most highest place; that is, for the safetie, of all
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21640:58"/>
to bestow his care, his labour, his study, to be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of lawes: to plant a loue of that which is iust and honest, and to ingraft a hatred of vice, diligently to care that none perish, no not those that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he that thus disposeth himselfe, shall haue the helpes of vertue, whereunto if hee leane, hee shall not fall, as from a slipperie and daungerous Tower, but shall remaine firme in that state of Maiestie: there his busied care in the busines of all shall keepe him safe.</p>
            <p>And if at any time (as humane things are vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) sleepe stealing vpon him, he chaunce to fall, he is carefully supported in their hands, which with their good will, defence, and safetie, are desirous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue his life; Neither shall his fall bruise him, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish him: For the swordes of enemies shall haue their edges rebated in the loue of his people; in this shall deceits bee disclosed, and trecheries bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered. For there is scarce any other Prince oppressed with faction, but hee that first oppre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sseth the people with so many iniuries: Neither is it strange that hee lyeth open to the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of all, that hee is torne in pieces with their opinions, wishes, and reproaches, who labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himselfe, to procure the destruction of all.</p>

O thou Prince, (whosoeuer thou art) quiet and calme thine owne heart; erect thy selfe hyer and aboue all those things which inflame the minde; holde the desires vnder a bridle; so shalt thou preuent warres, sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, tumults; if any thing turbulently fall out, thou shalt not buy thy peace of straungers, with great summes of money, or with deminishing or disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring of thy Empyre; but thou shalt make the Articles and Couenants of peace thy selfe; If anie man shall propounde thee, and thy kingdome as a pray: if any foolishly cruell, and placing right in violence, commeth to oppresse thee, doubtlesse all men wil arise in armes to defend thee; because whilst
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21640:61"/>
they establish the authoritie in thee, they do likewise fortifie their owne. Last of all, he will defend thee himselfe, who as hee is Iustice it selfe, so hee euer firmely standeth and fighteth for that vertue. Thus, whatsoeuerthou wilt, shall bee lawfull for thee; that is, if thou euer embrace, that which is iuste and honest; andremooue from thee, whatsoeuer is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Thus, no mans wishes shall differ from thine, no mans wishes shall hurt thee; no tales shall trouble thee; nothing so popularly shall come to the eares of the common people, as thy praises; neither shall any man compare thy faults (which are none) with thy good deeds as doubtfull, which in the ballance do weigh the heauiest; thy vertues shalbe hurt with no affinitie with vice; the multitude of thy vertues and the greatnesse of them shall take iudgement from men, and place insteed thereof Admiration. This shall ingraft thy name to posterity; but thou complainest, that those who are intimate &amp; of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell with thee do not deale faithfully, and sincerely, when as first they gather out the meaning, before they expresse their owne. This (thou sayst) is an argument of a minde corrupt, and vnfaithful. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I doe thinke so with thee: there can bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more wicked, more corrupt then these. But mee thinkes thou seemest not to knowe that the greatest parte of this vnfaithfulnesse altogether proceedeth from thy selfe; consider what these are
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21640:62"/>
to whom thou hast committed thy selfe, thy name; thy dignity; and in one worde the Souereignty of state. They are either chosen of thee to that place, and esteemed for their vertue, and worth; or rashely admitted into councell. VVhat ornaments haue they brought to thy friendship? with what py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety? with what manners, with what guifts of the minde are they aduaunced? Or rather haue they not possest that place with boldnesse? Are they not seruants vnprofitable, seruaunts of their owne and thy vnlawfull desires? Are they not staines to thy friendshippe? Blemishes of thy Empyre rather then instrumentes and seruants of a good gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If thou acknowledgest any of these, thou must first accuse thy selfe before thou accuse them; neither ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>st thou maruaile that this sorte of menne should shewe any other thinge then those they are furnisht with. To conclude, it is no argument of a Great PRINCE to haue such friendes, and surely what Mortall Man can expect either truth or sinceritie from those, who neuersomuch as heard of vertue, beeing the bondslaues of vice; who with boldenesse haue rusht into the councell of PRIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CES, who scarse where euer knowne vnto him, but by daungerous fawnings; which onely compasse him about, that they may robbe him; thus they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</p>
            <p>First they blinde the PRINCE with flatterie; they not onely powre oyle into his eares (as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21640:62"/>
the prouerbe is) but with their filthie mouthes dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deadly poyson, thus they proceede to deceiue him; first by soothing, then by scraping: if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aduersirie be at hand, these stand neuer sure to the Prince; nor to the better cause, but to the stronger, &amp; the greater factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They incline especially thither, whether gaine, leuitie, &amp; falshood lead them; they rest not in their watch-Towers, to yeelde themselues to their cheefe and lawfull Prince, but to him that shall conquere. These neuer seeke what is honest, but what is safe and profitable. But if thou desirest, neuer to be deceiued, neuer to haue the faith of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, to shrinke from thee: If thou wilt be stronge in Counsell; to conclude, if thou wilt haue firme rule of gouernment; diligently inquire into the liues, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, the fame of those, whome thou admittest ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into Counsell to thy selfe, or to the gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Common wealth, choose, &amp; carefully choose not the most popular &amp; most in fauour; but the best. These will counsell thee &amp; perswade good; but those will suggest ill. Thus shall the state of things be verie good, whilst thou thus gouernest; thou shalt ingraft into thy contrie the true notes of happinesse. For when men shall vnderstand, how hard it is to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell such a Prince, wholesome and profitable things: verie few will thinke it belonges vnto them, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this honor, to bee of thy secret counsell; when men shall obserue that men only conspicuous, in wisedome and honestie are admitted of the Prince
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21640:63"/>
and to the Prince, they will not floc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e vnto thee in such swarmes. There is no man can so farre forget himselfe, but that in his owne minde, hee will thinke thus; who am I that should goe about to be of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell with the Prince? What vertues am I furnished with-all answerable to so high a place? Haue I giuen any testimonie of my life, of so profitable and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable a paines; that I should deserue that place, that I should bee called into counsell with him, who hath the principall &amp; cheefe gouernment of things? How often shall there be consultations of doubtfull and vncertaine things: when in Courts, feares and terrors are thicke dangers barking on euerie side, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what is there in all my store of wisedome, learning, and experience, wherewith I may ease either the Prince, or the Common-wealth. The more learned that euerie man is, the more experienced, the wiser; the more earnest hee is in such a cause, in such a place at such a time. What part shall I play here of a wise man, or of a foole? Or shall I not lay open my owne ignorance and folly, shall not this honor bestowed vpon me, be like a wonder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> these and such like true thoughts will driue a man into a conscience of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: therefore to aspire to such a place, to such an honor, men must haue feare, respect, modesty, things not euer seene in the affectation of these places. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man first must feare himselfe, his owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then the iudgement of his most graue, &amp; most wise prince: then the iudgement of all. Therefore
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21640:63"/>
there is no cause, why a Prince should feare men of ill disposition, when his Court is not open to any such monsters, when honors are not stayde either by selling them, or casting them vpon vnworthie persons: but rather to marke and obserue, men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in vertue, although priuate and obscure, and to compell such (how vnwilling soeuer) to take the charge of gouernment of things, &amp; to be of his own Counsell.</p>
            <p>Surely such a Prince, shall neuer be in daunger of euill Counsels, and vntruthes; for such will euer speake to him as it is. Thus excluding the dregges, hee shall make choyse of the most sincere, and with a sharpe eye, hee shall wound masked and counterfeit vices. For they shall not dare to mingle themselues with vertues; which he shall euer haue true; eminent and conspicuous about him, with the helpe of these, he shall sustaine the heauie troublesome weight of gouernment. Thus from the Court shalbe banisht continuall boldnes, and Impudencie. Nowe thou saist (O Prince) that it is in thy owne power; that there be no bottomlesse gulphes in thy kingdome, which to fil vp, thou shalt be brought to a dangerous pouerty. Be bountifull, but not a waster: set vnto thy selfe Limittes for thy libertie: nor releeue not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with thy bountie, but such, as with true prayses, may celebrate thy vertue. These will not secretly breake thy treasurie, but silently deserue thy liberalitie. Then such a Courte
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21640:64"/>
shall vomit out no plague to infect the ayre; from whence are heapt together pestilent clowdes that do threaten stormes and tempests. But there shall bee a perpetuall and euerlasting <hi>Seminarie</hi> of most firme and sownd tranquilitie. From hence shall euerie man take example of life; there thou that art the Prince shall shine as the sunne amongst the other starres; the nobilitie shall looke into thy wisedome as into a bright and true glasse; thy wisedome shall be stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the craft of any; so farre shalt thou be from hauing the sinnes and the vices of others imputed to thee. To conclude, all the darts of enuie (dartes that are often-times dangerous) shall be rebaited and dull in the sheeld of a publike loue, which shall make thee not to be wounded. Goe to (O Prince) giue an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in thy whole life, that thou hast cast an 'account with thy Kingdome, as one ready to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to God, &amp; men, &amp; that thou art not only, not a tyrant, but a defender of the publike state, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, that thou art the soule of the Empire, and that life that the people breath. In one word, that thou art in the place of God, whome the good loue, and reuerence as a father, the wicked feare as a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueire Iudge. If thou art indued with this vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, with these vertues, no danger shall assault thee, no treasons, no poysons, no murthers. Valiant and most faithfull guards shall defend thee. Thy subiects loue, and that which is thy vnseperable companion, a celestiall grace. For what Prince soeuer is chast,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21640:64"/>
holy, and like vnto God, as he shall seeme to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to that place by God him selfe, so euidently it will appeare, that hee is vnder the defence of the most high. This is that strong and safest guard, which can neuer bee mooued against the life of the Prince; which can neuer be corrupted with any reward, nor forced with any violence, against the Prince his safetie.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21640:65"/>
desire besides this one thinge; neither euerie kinde of fame, but that which is good. For any fame is great enough, if it be good enough. This is that which to man prepareth the way to immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: nay, it selfe is an Image, a beginning, and not the least part of eternitie, with this touch-stone in the ende euerie mans life and manners are tryed: For seildome is fame vntrue, if it be Constant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall: Neither, do I call that fame, which is but the indiscret rumors or the rash speech of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, or the voyces which are extorted from feare or violence; neither euerie estimation of those that are present do I call fame: but the iudgements of strangers, and of late posteritie: then both which nothing is more vncorrupted. whatsoeuer thou art (O Prince) know that all that is placed in thy fame: This is to thee a treasure much more pretious then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mettall: From hence dost thou drawe a name, and honor, a memorie of thee, not only continuall, but continually glorious. There is nothing which thou canst carrie from hence sauing this.</p>
            <p>If thou shouldest bee such a one, as all men doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues of thee: as all men would haue thee to be, &amp; to be accounted: such a one shal fame report thee. A glasse doth not more truely represent the face, then the fame doth the man, especially thee, who canst escape the iudgements of none, because thy brightnes hath set thee in the eyes, the speeches, the opinions of all, thy life shall bee lookt into, thy

Now choose which thou wilt, whether those things which are written of thee, shall be reade to thy honor &amp; prayse, or to thy euerlasting infamie, weigh and ballance both these, thou canst not choose or eschew both; the one thou mayst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide. I do not thinke that thou art such an enemie to thy selfe, but that thou hadst rather fauour thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, then procure thy shame; that thou hadst ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee esteemed vertuous, then dishonest.

So excell amongst men, as thy honor, thy dignitie, thy power doth, that thy honor may be aboue mortalitie, propound vnto men thy life, as a perpetuall censure, build this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to thy selfe, that thou (which deuidest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor

to all) maist worthily sit in that high seate of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy selfe. As thy originall shewes thee to bee Lord of many countries, so let thy vertues assure men, that thou art a preferrer of them. Neuer place more in thy wil, then in equitie; neuer more in force, then in iustice; gaine vnto thy selfe a good Name, which often flattery will not affoorde vnto thee, nor these riches which thou obtainest by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, nor the strength of thy mightie Kingdome, nor so many thousands of men warring for thy safety; thy fame must bee thy owne gift. Vices will gaine vnto thee a fame odious, and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but vertues, honourable, and euerlasting. Intreate this fame of thy selfe; show in this, how fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable thou art to thy selfe, to thy country. For the fame of the PRINCE is oftentimes the fame of his countrey: and though fame (as I saide) be the name of a future and late-lasting good, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding thou in deseruing wel of the common wealth, inwardly shall perceiue those ioyes, which aduance the best men, aboue the common delights of the ignorant and base multitude.

Thus thou vnderstandest, how little acquaintance, thou oughtest to haue with sordide and infectious pleasures, which most of all do hurt him, whome most of all they flatter, which effeminate any man, bee hee neuer so strong; wheresoeuer thy are, from thence, strength both of the body and mind are spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily banisht; whosoeuer he is (be hee neuer so vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant) after that pleasures haue laide hold vpon him, hee is nothing else, but the relikes and shadowe of that he was.</p>
            <p>To conclude, pleasures do drowne the minde in that gulph from whence it cannot easily be freede. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ye, what can be more vnworthy, him that is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with that honour to be called a man? what can be a greater enemy to him, who is a Prince? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the armed troupes, nor the enemy that hath possessed the field, or shaken the walles, is so much to bee feared by a Prince, as this sorrow making mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster pleasure: These doe not besiege the wals, but deceiue the sences; they come not a farre off, but are at hande and within our selues; they assault vs not with foote, and horse, but they stirre vppe our whole body and all partes of it against the soule; I say they distract man and are authors of a ciuill warre within himselfe. In mans inward parts they fight so fiercely and so treacherously, that the better, and more noble part of man is brought into subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the worse; so that whilst man particularly dissenteth in himselfe, hee is wholy conquered;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21640:67"/>
all brought vnder the rule of an other; whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compelled to yeelde altogether from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and plainely transformed into a brute beast.</p>
            <p>Therefore (O Prince) if thou desirest that thy Name may bee gratefull, and honourable to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, and from hence obtaine ioyes, that are sound and continuall; if thou wilt haue this dignity, to be a steppe to those happie and euerlasting rewards, that are reserued for good Princes; blowe away and disperse these darke cloudes of vulgar and base pleasure which interposed before thy eyes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse from thee the sight of those heauenly ioyes: If thou at any time bee brought into a true contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of these, then thou wouldest not knowe what those impure pleasures are, which are alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to sordide and base persons. Let them keepe vnto themselues that which is fit for them, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe thou that difficult labour, in the ende where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is true felicity. It is euery mans worke to looke at that which is before his feete, But it is thy office, to looke further and to aime higher, and those thinges which are either behinde or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath thee (as beeing ouer base) not once to regard them.</p>
            <p>Surely whosoeuer is drawne throughly with the loue of heauenly things, can be no more intangled in these base and vile desires, then an Aeagle in the small threades of a spyders webbe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21640:68"/>
resolue thy selfe, that no base thing is to bee thought of by thee; that nothing is to bee desired of thee, which is not great and excellent. And last of all, that nothing is to bee esteemed great by thee, which is not indeede such in the iudgments of all. Thus shalt thou obtaine, that thy wishes shalbe worthy thy selfe, and that place which thou sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest; and in the highest place, thou shalt obtaine the highest honour.</p>
            <p>Thus, if thou neuer seuer thy wishes from the common wishes; if thou intendest nothing, that is of a priuate and vnlawfull hope, if thou equalest thy hopes to the rule of right; al men wil striue, who shal most further them: hee will thinke to haue gained much vnto himselfe, who shall approue himselfe most to thee: who shall performe to thee most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, most studie, most seruice. Thus walking this way, thou shalt neuer be thrust into those headlong and dangerous downfalles; thou shalt couet nothing that is anothers; thou shalt neuer take armes for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and only to boast thy greatnesse and power: Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer not thy ill ambition with false names; thinke it not a Kingly thing to striue for that which is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and inglorious onely to defend thine owne: but proceede vnwillingly (and as it weare compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the malice of those with whome thou hast to deale) to reuenge publike iniuries, and recouer the right of thy kingdome from vniust possessours, with a vertuous and religious warre. Admit for thy

companions not headlong <hi>Couetousnesse,</hi> and blinde <hi>desire,</hi> but <hi>duty,</hi> and <hi>fortitude;</hi> and then doubt not, but thou shalt breake open those passages that are shut; thou shalt goe through those pathes that are beset; thou shalt make playne those places that are vneuen; and easily escape all difficulties what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer; in one word, what course soeuer thou take, it is sure to bee ballanst and certaine. The reason is manifest, because all things are easie, obuious, and open to these two vertues, <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Fortitude.</hi> And as infelicity, repentance, and sorrow are vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the end of wicked and vnwise designes, so vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, successe, and felicity, are the recompence of those actions that are well begun. If these and such like thoughts, be firmely rooted in thy inward soule, thou (whosoeuer thou art that sittest in the throne of Maiesty) if thou professest the feare of GOD, if thou crauest his holy spirit, to be the author of thy councell, and the directour of thy life, thy mind (doubtlesse) shalbe purified, and all blemishes of an vnthankefull minde being remooued, and thy eyes cleered, thou shalt then perceiue those heauenly and happy giftes wherewith thou art compased, and aduaunced to that honour. Thus banishing all inward blindnesse, thou shalt not measure this place with his watchfull cares, with his vngratefull labours; not with the liberties of vices not in the opertunities of pleasure, but in the occasions of iuste aduantages of well deseruing of mankinde,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21640:69"/>
which is the onely and chiefe end of <hi>Souereignity,</hi> and by this meanes thou shalt giue iust, and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thankes with due honour, and a gratefull full minde, to the KING of all kinges, who is only most great, and most wise.</p>

And thus am I vsed, although I see and know well enough, what is fit to be donne, and for any thinge that I see, me thinkes I haue more witte and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing then these auncient folke, which seeme to be so wise, which speake nothing but these ould do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sayings, euer imposing hardnes vpon me, labor, studie, watching, manners, respect of my elders, and all sad and hard things. And all these things (say they) belong to vertue: When indeede they knowe not what vertue is.</p>
            <p>This I am sure of, that by this meanes they take vniustly from me my pleasures, my play, my delight; thus obstinatly they deale, to take me from my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, whilst they seeke not only to keepe me from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing merrie, but hardly and straitly keepe me in, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing vpon me at these yeares auncient and graue behauiour: Neither do they consider that by this meanes, they do weaken that liberall, and ingenious disposition, which I knowe no comparison of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to bee in mee: Shall I neuer come out of this bondage and gouernment? Shall I neuer liue at my owne pleasure? Must I euer be ruld by others?

They call also in derision the scoole a play; were we scarce play, but I am put thither, that they may play <note place="margin">Ludus.</note> vpon my skinne; and such as I am. A playe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, nay a most vnpleasant place where still I am either beaten, or afrayd; There I must euer liue vnder a tyrant, who if hee inflict any punishment, I cannot appeale from him, hee himselfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth, subscribeth, inquireth, knoweth, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth.</p>
            <p>Thus doe their ieastinges prooue earnest to vs, and in their confidence they rule in this play as if they were in earnest. Thou shalt neuer see them, but frowning to terrifie vs. But alas, what learne wee there, and against our willes to? what rewarde haue wee of this dayly and continuall labor? and of such vexation? vnlesse peraduenture they thinke it concernes the Commonwealth, to haue our tender wittes wrapped vp in these trifles, &amp; to sticke fast in these rough thornie quidities of Grammer: For what else shall I call these letters, sillable, nownes, verbes, inflections, coniugations, terminations, cases, tenses, Syntaxis, exceptions, and to conclude whatsoeuer els is contained in those harse rules of Grammer? Which (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing) they vrge and boast of, as a thing seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the hight of all learning. Must our wits be thus miserablie tormenmed, as though there were nothing, which could more pleasantly bee learned, or more profitablie bee knowne? Is this

that aduantage that I haue to bee borne noblie, or honestly as I am? I would to God I had beene borne in some poore cottage, in no reckoning, or account, there might I haue liued more at libertie: there eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man is wife enough without a teacher: there is no such word, as a more liberall education, which I thinke to bee harde seruitude: there no man is kept in so straitly: neither are manners there so carefully and exactly squared by the rules of this scrupelous and odious ciuilitie, which destroyeth the manners, which men haue by nature, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them into feined counterfeite and composed manners, which you may better call a counterfaiting of an ingenious disposition.</p>
            <p>There those that are my equalles liue with little res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, or reuerence to their parents and elders: there euerie man followeth his naturall libertie: at least they are freed from this feare, which continually makes me sweate, and no maruaile, if I bring out my wordes slowly, and stumblingly: if (neuer at my owne gouernment) I liue a life vnpleasant, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweete. But (they say) this is the way to honestie, to honor, to dignitie, whatsoeuer in mans life is rare, to bee wished for, to bee admired, it is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and allotted to no other, then those who haue their childhood and youth trayned in those learnings.</p>

soyle, poysoned weeds doe grow of their owne accord, when as wholesome hearbs scarce grow with out tilling, so in the minde of man, if discipline and wholesome precepts do not first possesse him, there may be easily reaped a haruest of much ill, which I do obserue in thee at this time; Thou disdaynest that thou liuest at an other mans gouernment. Here let me aske of thee, if thou knowest what it is to liue. I know, thou wilt answere me that to liue is nothing els but to be: For those that are dead are not: Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in this speech how much ignorance thou bewra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yest, thus things without life do liue, because they are, why dost thou blush? I know thou wishest it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoken, this witte of thine, doth in this discouer his ignorance; take heed therefore that thou do not say; that thou liuest because thou art: I confesse nothing hath life, but that which is, but to man there must something more be added to make him liue, not the life of plants, hearbes, and such like, nor the life of beastes, but of men, the life of man is the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, and vnion both of bodie and soule. The soule is a deuine breath, which infused into the body doth mooue it with his owne and proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Therefore thou mayst cal man a body animated, or rather a reasonable soule composed with a bodie, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto it for his gouernour. Therefore when wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say man liues, wee doe not say man only vseth the offices of the body, but of the soule, which possesseth

So that, humanitie is nothing els, but a certaine diuinitie, exprest in this mortall flesh: now with what steppes dost thou think do wee ascend into this high dignitie? Surely, with <hi>pietie</hi> and good <hi>manners, pietie</hi> we haue sayd to be a true knowledge and worship of God: <hi>manners</hi> are the fruites and effects of <hi>pietie,</hi> or rather a <hi>pietie,</hi> which seasons the affections, from whence it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed into the sences; then seeing to liue, is nothing else but dayly to be purgd, to waxe pure, to be lifted vp, and more vnited to God; man (in his life) ought to propound no other thing but <hi>pietie</hi> and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>manners:</hi> to bee indued with these not of any sorte, but with the least, the most chast, the most seuere, the most holy.</p>
            <p>Thus thou seest, that thou art not borne by chance, but of purpose and to a great ende, namely that thou mayst bee come religious, and holy, and a renued Image of that Diety, that framed thee.</p>
            <p>Now I demand of thee, if thou of thy selfe knowest what these are, which I haue named <hi>piety</hi> &amp; <hi>maners.</hi> I think thou wilt answere, that thou knowest not those things, which thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st not know, vnles thou learne

them; and now thou confessest that thou art ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of vertue, which is nothing else but a <hi>Pietie</hi> working in the inward man, and showinge it selfe foorth in his life, in one word, vertue is nothing else, but <hi>actiue pietie.</hi> Now thou must needes confesse that thou knowest not what it is to liue, be not afraide to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it, It is an excellent thing (saith <hi>Columella)</hi> and hee is a wise and a skilfull writer, who vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that hee is ignorant of that hee knoweth not, and desireth to learne that, whereof he is ignorant, If thou art ignorant, thou art to bee taught, and to bee instructed.</p>
            <p>Dislike not this speech as too hard. For in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of yeares, and when thou hast more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thou shalt finde thy selfe full of rashnes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch loue; what art thou to be taught? to know to loue, to follow God, and consequently to auoyde those things which God hateth &amp; abhorreth.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou wilt be wholy a man, not halfe a man, and halfe a beast, yeeld thy selfe wholy into the gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thy soule; let thy soule with the bridle of reason, rule thy affections; let thy affections commaund thy sences, then shall thy sences bee contained within the lymittes and boundes of chastitie, holinesse,

Innocency; they shalbe such as is fit, for those that are seruants to the soule, Thus thou shalt frame <hi>Pyety</hi> vnto thy selfe, that most holy good, and the fountaine of all good things. From <hi>Pyety, Holinesse</hi> is disperst into the manners; both these waies dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly lead vs to that most happy estate which I haue spoken of before, which is a likenesse of God. Thus according to that towardnesse that is in thee, thou art wholly to be stirred vp, wholly to be inflamed, with an honest desire, to lay aside whatsoeuer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadge disposition is in thee; that thou maist bee wholly a man, and from being a man be translated into God. I doe see thy mind which out goes thy age, I see thy sparkes of gentility, which if thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low rightly, doubtlesse thou shall attaine this honor. I see those branches of vertue in thee, swelling full readie to burst foorth. I do see the blossomes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of thy shining vertue; therefore proceede to lend thy mind and thy eares to my councell, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whither thou must goe, nothing can bring thee but seuerity of education. The ground (though it be fruitful) yet it is tamed with the plough; the clods must be broken, harrowed, and the whole field duly husbanded; in this maner there must be a violence done to thee; thy wit must be manured, which thogh it bee good, yet till then it is vntilled and full of thornes, from thence must bee weeded whatsoeuer is hurtfull; oftentimes must it be turned ouer, and brought vnder, that it may be ciuill, soft and tender;

This is neuer done, without much weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the husbandmen, and not without some vexation vnto thee; whilst the person is cured, they set farre from him the touch of those meates which are not only apparently hurtfull, but of those which are somewhat vnwholesome; the one ouerthrow the strength of medecines, the other hinder it; so, when the witte is tamed with the force of education, with all, thou art to bee drawne from thy desires, thy delightes, thy pleasures, thy insolent spirits are to bee supprest, and kept vnder, thy insulting and quicke wit is to bee contained within the bonds of frugality and modesty; amongst all vertues there are none fitter for that age, none fitter to receiue learning; thy opinion beeing at that yeares (if thou hast any) is to be directed by the sentence and will of an other; thou must of necessity wholly depende vppon the iudgment of those, to whome thou art committed; these are those carefull workemen, of so great a taske; who vndertake to perfect, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish what nature hath begunne; Doubtlesse thou art thrice happy, if timely thou gainest this disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and indeede more seuere and more sincere,

by the helpe whereof thou shalt passe those shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of sinne, and wickednesse wherein so manie men (although well instructed) vnfortunately sinke; whose maisters haue not so much instructed their toward dispositions, as haue armed their vices; I will vse the examples of great men, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> and <hi>Crycias</hi> (the daily auditors of <hi>Zocrates)</hi> were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally instructed, who can deny it? Yet neither of them was honest, Nay both rather the reproach and staine, not onely of their families, but of the Common-wealth. For the one assaulted his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and with the others riches was the liberty of it shaken. What shall I say of <hi>Nero?</hi> was there euer any man better taught?

            <p>Now what doe you thinke shall happen to them, which are left to themselues? Who are left neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and vntaught? In how daungerous, how slippery, how headelong a place are they? Are they not withall laide open to a Worlde of vices, to the froth of infecting pleasures, to the dangerous tempests of sinne? Must not these expect in the end, an ineuitable shiep-wracke? not to detaine thee longe, it must bee confest, that without

discipline, men are not made men, but forged the vnhappy &amp; deformed brood of villany, and so the hatefull procurers of Gods wrath. Moreouer thou complainest, that thy maners are seuerely corrected, and thy wits informed into wisedome with auntient rigour &amp; strict discipline, least they should be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; deformed with vices. Surely if it be not done at this time (&amp; with all speed) it will neuer be done. It is once done, that it neede not euer bee done; and it is done now, that it may not bee done too late, For it is much to be accustomed to any thing, when one is yong, I do not deny but amidst the cares of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the study of learning, remission of labour, play and recreation are to be granted to thee; so that, that whatsoeuer be, be done warily, moderatly, and tempred with holinesse, and modesty.

From hence it followeth, that that which wee call learning, leadeth him directly vnto this. Now lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning no man throughly obtaineth, without the help of seuere discipline, which thou lately blamedst; one part of learning is the knowledge of things created, and of all those things which are without vs; but there is an other part, which is more inward, true, and better, which is the true knowledge of God, and of himselfe, so farre as the minde of man is capable of them, this knowledge we call true wisedome: which then truly is so, when there cleaueth to it a true strength of the minde, gathered and collected from true precepts, and worthy &amp; honourable examples. This is that which good learning promiseth, and performeth, not to euery learner, but onely to him, whose good and fortunate wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now when I say learning, I meane no such thing as the vulgar thinke, that is, a vaine ostentation of learned schollership, that which furthereth a man nothing to the feare of God; that learning for which so many insolent and triuiall Saterists knit their browes, as men busied in most weighty affaires, when indeede all that great noise they make, is nothing els, but swelling &amp; importunity: and no thing more vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then such learning. Neither doe I meane that learning, which hath buried those auntient manners; the forerunners of lust (which these effeminate halfe learned men, that haue an itch of Poetizing) long

That I account learning, which so beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man outwardly, that inwardly it dooth arme him, and instruct him, whether he speake or hold his peace: silent in manners, and innocency: speaking in wisedome and eloquence. Now to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there is no entrance, but by <hi>Grammer;</hi> I confesse the entrance to <hi>Grammer</hi> is so hard, so thorny, that it seemes to bee without any path, there is nothing can delight him that commeth to it, but meerely <hi>Hope.

Surely one that is so borne, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth so well beseeme them, as a disposition
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21640:83"/>
quiet &amp; modest; wherof thou art well admonisht by thy habit, in that thou art maskt &amp; hooded. As soone as thou art desirous of rule, and seekest to deale with those things that are aboue thy strength &amp; capacity; and as soone as by incountring daungers thou wilt shew how valiant and strong thou art; thou dost put off that woman, that God made thee, &amp; putst vpon thee, I know not what shape of a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ster, thou canst not lay aside thy womanish dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but thou stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest it with manlike vices; neither is it strange, if all men abhorre that kinde of women as vnlikely, which laying aside their modest garments and behauiour, put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in armour, commanding their troopes of souldiers, challenging the enemy; which haue such foreheads that they dare make long orations to the people, to giue lawes; and to conclude: handle all publique and ciuill duties; this sex ought to bee acquainted with none of these actions; these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nature hath denied vnto them: If any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ouer impudently affect these, ouer-uiolently be carried to this course, shee is no more a Woman, but an vntamed creature, which treadeth vnder foote all Womanish ornaments. But thou saist all these praises men haue. Indeede it is so, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by order, for the good of the common wealth, And as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth men: it belongs vnto a man with valiant acts to make waie to those honours, without which, their vertues are nothing els but slouth, for euery power of the minde that hath not his ende
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21640:83"/>
propounded doth wax faint, and if no man dooth affect praise, if no man desire to bee made Noble by dangers, If vertue haue nothing to awake it, straight all society of life is troubled and confused, the Common wealth is left to bee torne in peeces, by euery base fellow. There is nothing sacred or holy, no man shall haue any substance: outrages shall possesse all places: boldnesse shall challenge all things to it selfe: to conclude, we shall neuer liue a life safe, and secure; but wandring and full of scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Therefore God hath prouidently ingrafted in men this desire of performing hard things, and so of obtaining praise: the worker of those things which in this mortalitie are greatest. I doe not thinke in this there is an enuie that dooth trouble thee; for so thou enuiest thy selfe, so thou shouldest looke asquint at thy owne good, there is nothing with thee seuered from thy husband. No not thy beeing; nor any of these things which belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, or wherein thy safety and welfare consisteth. Beeing thus admitted to bee his companion of his goods, thou art admitted into fellowship of his good nesse, and of his praise, and art honoured with that glory which thy husband doth cast vpon thee: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it strange, if both your wishes be contained in either, If thou pertakest with his prosperity and aduersity. For thou canst not if thou wouldest putte off this minde, nor abrogate this lawe of Nature; nay nor breake this same
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:21640:84"/>
league; these same tauntes and disdainefull gaulings of the mind, which so much trouble thee, account them no more to be the effects of true gentility then mushroomes, burres, thistels, and such like are to be tearmed fruites. Take heed that thou dost not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that modesty, which is more gratious then any fauour, and fairer then any beautie. Thou canst not ascribe too much to thy selfe, but with all thou must despise thy husband; and how farre thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partest from feare, shame and respect; so farre thou departest from those vertues, which may truly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led iewels, of that sex, pretious without cost, and so pretious, that they ought to be esteemed as life, and ransomed with death. Therefore this violence of minde, vnprofitable and vnseemely, containe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bovndes and limits of modesty; bee not ouer wittie to abuse those good-gifts that nature hath lent thee, make not vnto thy selfe a needelesse businesse: but wholly addict thy self to his loue and obedience, to whome this sex of thine hath tyed thee; especially to that diuine will, wherein it is fit, all humane desires be extinguisht: if thy care be any, let it bee this, to cut off all womanish complaint, and foolish wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, neuer bee puft vp with inconsiderate violence, neuer trouble thy selfe with an needelesse labour: whatsoeuer liketh thy husband let it please thee: wherin he placeth thy name, dignity &amp; honor in that rest. To conclude, so resolue, that as he is born to the common-wealth, so thou art borne to him. For God
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:21640:84"/>
will haue our whole life contained in these limittes, <hi>Commandement</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> These are those two firme bondes, wherewith all humane societie is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. God commandeth and man obeieth. But that, due obedience may be giuen to that wise Creator of all things, hee hath giuen and disposed to euery man his speciall chardge; to men, to be Gods vicegerents; to women, to be mens helpers; thou canst not inuert this order, but thou must bee equall to thy husband. For when thou ceasest to obey, thou beginnest to be his equal; if equal, to be his superiour, if his superior, surely to bee his worse, because thou wilt bee wise o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then GOD hath appointed; who would haue both you to liue in obedience to him, and betwixt your selues in that order which hee hath set downe, and to those that do this, hee hath submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all this (how great soeuer) frame of his creatures; and hath alotted to you wisedome, &amp; vnderstanding fit for it; to him, what is fit for commanding, to thee, what is for obeying; hence it is that thou oughtest to permit vnto thy husband all the gouernment of thy minde, and the strength of it; neither think that thy husband doth ad more to your common good, by this knowledge and power of commanding, but thou dost as much by thy diligence of obeying; and in that thou art not hazarded in publique dangers, know that this is for thy honor, who as a more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vessel, art kept safer. To what end then are so many complaints? what meane this foolish quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reling
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21640:85"/>
with God? How art thou becom so talkeatiue? so ingenious? so subtill, in reproach and dishonour of that sacred power? Dost thou diligently obserue those vertues, which are the ornaments of thy sex? Doost thou thinke those small which are reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the greatest honours, because the greatest cannot bee without them? Doe not herein shine those neuer enough esteemed ornaments, which haue aduanced some women to the highest honour? amongst these I must account those Women who excell in this, that they respect the bringing vppe of their children; whereof that thou art made an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerseer, belieue mee the greatest businesse of all is committed to thee; for Education is nothing else but the information of the whole life, which way this leaneth, doubtlesse that way doth a man bende. A diligent and innocent education vsually maketh men good; but a negligent and wicked, maketh them euill. Education is contained in the motherly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diligence, looking to, admonitions, chastenings: all these things (in the tendernesse of age) doe drawe the first lines of vertue or vice, those staines or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours that after rest vpon our liues, here do first take roote. Now consider how much is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to thee, to whom the whole man is committed. Doost thou then complaine that thou art euill dealt with all, and that thy vertues are shutte vppe in a narrow roome? Doubtlesse this is a place large and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitious, where thou maist shew them as thou doost
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21640:85"/>
vse thy care; this is no seruile office, all things in this are not only ingenious, but ful of honour, surely man of both kindes, when he considereth his birth; riseth to thee, dooth reuerence and doth worship thee, as his parent, and a parent in a two fold respect, both by the office of nature and the dignity of brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp. For it were little that hope committed to thee in thy wombe, by thy husband with a happy successe to bring into the World, if this latter care also were not added, which formeth and frameth the minde to all humanitie. Oh honorable name of a parent, O excellent prerogatiue of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the family, with whose vertues the whole house dooth shine: Oh happy family, wherein the sayings of a choyce and wise Woman, are so many instructions, and her deeds so many vertuous exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of religion, chastitie, and holinesse, to this may bee added the care of looking to the house, which thou maist performe with frugalitie and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. These are those vertues, whereunto if thou apply thy whole minde, thou shalt gaine vnto thy selfe nobility, and honour; these are those thinges which nature, manners, lawes, impose vpon women &amp; these businesses &amp; cares oftentimes exclude those vices, which are vsually incident to that sex; wilfull leuity, motions variable and inconstant, pratling, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous ambition, by themselues, by their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, by their children, in their power much weakenesse, impatiency of delay, sickenesse of hope,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21640:86"/>
wantonnes; ready anger, ryot, boldnesse, confidence an immoderate mind, and all those other monsters that doe rise from these; wherewith too many laying aside all modesty, doubt not to staine their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish ornaments. Besides, oftentimes this sex is lifted vp, to the noblest vertues; yea, many times the most honorable vertues are more conspicuous and eminent in women, then in men
<q>
                  <l>The Greekes did feare Pentheseleas hand,</l>

Besides, as the examples of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are more rare, then of men; so they are more glorious and more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull in respect of valour. Haue not those times often fallen out, wherein the common wealth by the hand of women, from a headlong danger, hath been set in safety? peruse the antient histories, there is nothing so common as the great mindes of women; by whome decaying armies haue been strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the warres ended; sometimes by opposing their brests, &amp; sometimes by interposing their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, examples of valiant actes made vnto poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not onely of modesty, and chastity, but also of an vndaunted spirit, and that which is farre more admirable and of a certaine rare
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21640:86"/>
and deuine prouidence; and of those admirable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers whereunto the euents haue giuen credit and authoritie: These we must confesse a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e not only wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of prayse but admiration, if these thinges be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the vertue of a present necessitie. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be true that this sex is not framed for these things, yet it is not altogether abhorred from them, neither is vertue forbidden to chuse out seuerall persons; and indeede it doth so, for laying hand vpon some weoman, and arresting them to obey her, thus shee blameth men: What haue I to doe with you sluggards? I will hence forth animate the hearts of these; I will inflame their mindes, arme their hands, and I will wholly fit them to deserue well of the common-wealth, that ye being sluggish, may be twise ashamed, and these awaked to honorable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may be more glorious. From hence wee may gather, that there are not fewer seedes of vertue and valour ingrafted in women, than in men, and both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (vnder the same yoake) must draw to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good. Although to men vsually belong publicke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, &amp; to wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priuat, &amp; as those require strength so these require diligence. And besids, the time will ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fall out, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both these are to be mixt together, as publickly and priuately it shall be needefull: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus are the duties of both sexes confounded, but the hand that is readier and better furnisht for the businesse in hand, whether it be of the man or the woman, ought seasonably to vndertake it: Then the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21640:87"/>
strength and courage of the minde shall not be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred either by sex or weakenesse of bodie. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though these thinges thus happen extraordinarily, yet they are done in order, because they haue God for their author: who then stirreth vp manlike minds, when there is neede of manlike vertues; without this warrant, it is not lawfull for a woman to out passe the limits of her sex, and to vsurpe the dutie of man; no more then for a man to put of all humanitie and to be wise aboue God. But to returne from whence I began, I say (O Woman) thou art to haue fetters put on thy seete; not those wherewith that <hi>Venus Morpho</hi> was bownd amongst the <hi>Lacedemonianes;</hi> but those which keepe in the lasciuiousnes of thy minde; which restraine the immodestie both of thy words and deedes, and thy too licentious habits; then thou art to haue a ring vpon thy lippes, not of brasse, as was the custome of the Egyptian women, but a bond to keepe thee in silence; for nothing is fittter for thee then humble spirits: a meane in speaking, and the wisedome in being silent. To conclude, thou art to be guirded with the girdle of holines, that which way soeuer thou goest, there may breath those sweet and deuine smelles of thy vertues, and whosoeuer seeth thee, may not see so much a woman, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge an excellent patterne of all vertue. Then when thou art such a one, there remaines (for thee) honourable and great rewardes of fame, honor, dignitie; all which are not laide a side for men,

            <p>In the meane time, whatsoeuer may be giuen vnto thee, are aboundantly heapt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, those are those ensignes of honor, wherewith the auncient and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent wisedome doth crowne thee.

I neede not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member examples of the present time, because they proceede from those auncient; what is more knowne then those Romane laws, and lawes like the Romans? We know the Matrons were not to rise vp to the Magistrate, least they should chaunce to hurt them, or to vse them euill being with child; nor that their husbands going in Coaches with them should come downe: others not lesse then these, that men should giue way to weomen that they might weare eare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and other differences of head-tires, that they may vse purple and golde cloathes, that they may bee carried through the streetes: all which things are giuen to women, either for a rewarde or a benefitte: as GOD himselfe teacheth in the 16, Chapter of <hi>Ezechiell.</hi> I clothed thee also with fine broydered worke, and shodd thee with badgers skinnes, and girded thee about with fine linnen, and couered thee with silke; I decked thee also with ornamens; and I put bracelettes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy hands: and a chaine vpon thy necke: and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:21640:88"/>
I put a frontlet vpon thy face, and eare-rings in thy eares, and a beautifull crowne vpon thy head: Thus weart thou decked with golde and siluer, and thy raiment was of fine linnen and silke: for these and greater then these, men bestow vpon women, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their loue, and speciall affection, that it may be vnderstood, that no sexe is either better or worse then other, but modestly and louingly to agree betwixt themselues; nor that women is not the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, but another ornament of humanitie: both must striue in this, which may be more worthie of reuerence, which loue one another better: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (O women) represse thy vnsatisfied and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious desires, and as one furnisht with all excellent ornaments, at length learne to worshippe God, and acknowledge his benefites, lay aside all complaints, suppresse thy foolish speeches, put vppon thee a thankfull minde, if thou wilt needs complaine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of thy selfe, that being betrothed (as it were) with so many benefites of God, yet thou withdrawest thy selfe as vnthankfull and vnmindefull of thy duty: remooue this infamie, blot out this staine, and place in steede thereof, an ingenious and thankefull minde liked of him, whom to please, is eternall happinesse.</p>

I see this man ouerloaden with his riches: that man with his followers, with his authoritie, with his power; another to abuse the gifts, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts of his witte; another to growe insolent by reason of fauour; another to become intollerable with the fortunate course of honor, and the happie successe of his fauours, and how great any man is in these things, so much he swelleth, hopeth, dareth, and how much he wanteth of these, so much hee is dismayd, cast down, deprest, scarce any man acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that his increase and grouth is from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine shower, and heauenly deawe.</p>

many and how great vices, wee are compassed: Oh saith euery man I would to God I had beene borne in that golden world voyd of sins, &amp; fruitfull in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: Oh, what ioy it had bin to haue liued then, when me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> willingly, &amp; of their own accord imbrace honesty.

            </p>
            <p>Whatsoeuer was good either in things, or time, it is vanisht long since, the dregs only and that which is left in the bottome, are reserued for these dayes: for it plainely appeareth:
<q>
                  <l>That all things wast and on that rocke do perish</l>
                  <l>Which time thus wearied can no longer cherish.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We now loue our vices, no lesse then they did then reuerence their vertues: Now it is scarce lawfull for any man to be good: wickednesse possesseth all roomes: honesty is euerie where dispised, and vertue scornd, and the better any man is, the more basely &amp; worse he is esteemed.</p>
            <p>This showeth that there is nothing more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt then the manners of these times: yet with these are wee compelled to liue; wee that desire all thinges might bee well, and who (against our willes) are drawne to allowe those thinges
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21640:90"/>
which we dislike. From hence, from those auncient times proceede the precepts of wisedome, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable examples, and from these dayes, these present corrupt manners, which differ farre from them: thus are we carried as it were with a streame or a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde.

               </gap> and honestie would I then show? How would I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe all other vertues? How should I wholly then bee inflamed to allowe those thinges which my tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers (when I was a child) did put into me, and which I red out of graue authors? Oh, happie antiquitie which knew the best things and followeth them. But in these dayes and in these places who can? If I be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to other men what a sport &amp; derision they make of it? How presently do all men say, what an incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble brayne hath he? For wisedome is nothing but to thinke as the most thinke. If I had beene borne in a free state, these things should not goe thus. I would wholly haue indeuoured my selfe to reforme publick manners; I would haue beene to all others a forcible extorter to these thinges, and as it becommeth a free and valiant man, being author of a free and a true opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I feare not to find assista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, thus, more of vs would apply our selues vnto it, &amp; I doubt not, but we should bring to passe that the best thinges should preuaile: amongst free men, we would deale with
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:21640:90"/>
liberty and expresse our mindes with free tearmes. For where a free state is, there is true vertue and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious manners. But here where men are gouerned, some one or other prescribe conditions to al the rest: The multitude follow in heapes which way any goe before them, without choyce, without care of any goodnes, Without any difference or respect of true or false. Thus by degrees we become such (as wee when it is too late) wonder at our selues to see how we haue lost all freedome and ingenious simplicity. But although these thinges might in some sort bee borne with, yet, what way shall I say commeth it to passe, that as many countries as there bee, so many differences there are, not only of language, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but of rites, and religions? So that a man may dispaire that in our time there shall euer be an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; For what cause of euil shall I say men are set thus at discord? In this difference there is no man that taketh not himselfe to bee very godly, There is no man that dooth not either pitty, deride, or hate any other that treadeth a course contrary to his owne; thou canst scarce goe out of dores, but thou shalt light vppon some one which shunneth thy speech and company as a thing most odious; why, thinkest thou? because thou followest those rites which hee abhorreth: For what thou accountest holy, that hee esteemeth prophane and wicked, Euery man thinketh what hee liste of GOD of his VVorshippe, of all things that belong
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21640:91"/>
vnto it. Euery man wandreth what way he pleaseth; scarce any man pittying him, warning him, or stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.</p>
            <p>And this is the generall disposition of men at this day; what wilt thou choose? which way wilt thou goe? what part wilt thou take in these distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? some beeing violent, others being drowsie, all disagreeing: My wish is religious, but silent: and of no force. For where should I cast anchour in these stormes? which way should I goe to seeke the truth? which amongst all these is but one. I desire to haue all these cloudes disperst, and directly to goe to that deuine brightnesse, but I cannot doe it. I finde al waies so beset with darknes, thornes, and infinit lets. Therefore I must lye secret and speake low, and fold vp my hands and looke vp and expect what good, time will bring with it. In the meane time, I must represse my time which is no way fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured; I must cherish my slouth and sluggishnes; and this is indeede to bee wise, and to know the time. Neither is it too safe to know what is to be followed as what is to bee eschewed. To conclude, in this my condition is the harder, that I vnderstand those things from which I am kept, and beeing borne to excellent things, yet I must follow the worst: Besids, I haue chosen that course of life, then which there could if not more honest, yet none be more vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant; or more vnprofitable. It is an excellent thing to be brought vp in learning, to be instructed in arts
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21640:91"/>
and sciences; to know the ciuill lawes, to be chosen amongst those that haue authority and iudges, to be euer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersant amongst the best. But none of al these can bee praised but with much exception: For if they bee compared with other courses of life, they make faire showes; but there is little substance in them. Who seeth not that all these courses of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are full of care, labour, and that a kinde of life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth from hence, illiberally, vnpleasant, vnsecure? In one word, we are subiect to the authority of our superiours, and likewise to the speeches of the vulgar.</p>
            <p>These will call thee a subtile and a crafty fellow, &amp; one that what way soeuer thou goest wil deceiue; of the multitude thou are rather feared then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced or loued, these will take heede of thy cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, these care not what thou thinkest. But how much thou canst and art able, so much onely they feare. I omitte that the times doe often fall out, wherein we liue dispised whilst gowns must, and doe suffer the disgrace and the wrongs of armes, what? in these tumultes we indure wronges of those, who in peace durst not come into our presence without blushing, feare, and danger, well it is much better to be one of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sort, then to suffer those indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that are incident to this calling, neither am I ignorant that wee seeme happy in the eyes of many as they seeme to vs. I knovve no man is content with his lotte, this is the infelicitie of men.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:21640:92"/>
But what wouldest thou doe? VVee must beare our euill fortune and euery man his owne. VVell, all thinges considered, there is nothing more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, then this life, which either amongst thankefull or vnthankefull must bee spent.</p>

wicked thoughts, forged complaints against God, for thou that speakest these thinges, wouldst seeme exceedingly honest and religious; and thy whole la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is in this, that thou maist rather seeme then be so. Neither art thou ashamed to sorrowe that thou wert borne in this age and not long since: and in some other place. Thus the common souldier spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euill of the Centurion, the Centurion of the Tribune; the Tribune of the Lieftenant; or the Emperour; that he is placed in this station and not in that, as though it were in thy power to determine and dispose of thy selfe, and not in his, vnder whose subiection thou art; who notwithstanding dost not consider (being hindred with an inward blindnesse) how irreligious thou art, for thou canst not desire an other country, nor repent thee of thine owne estate, and condition, but thou must first loath and hate thy owne marke then from the beginning what assurance thou hast giuen of a preposterous and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated minde.</p>
            <p>I would to God thou couldst learne that all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of a Souldier consist onely in obedience. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is to dare to do nothing but at his command at whose cost thou fightest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the lawe, the religion, the reuerence of of the oath; this is the whole ornament of military discipline; the strength and maiesty of the whole gouernment is built vpon this vertue; the souldier hauing put off obedience is hurtfull and rebellious,

not to hee corrected with the rod of this Captaine, but to be beaten with his truncheon or put to death, as a staine and blemish to the whole army. Take thou heede that thou be not of this infamous marke, whilst thou complainest that thou wert not sent vnto thy standing, in the first, or second, but in the third or fourth watch, thou wishest (thou sayest) that thou hadst beene borne in that (which they call) the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den World barren of vice and fruitfull in all vertue: thus (as thou speakest) thou wishest thy selfe that thou hadst neuer been borne, because no monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of antiquity to be credited that euer I read in, taught what time there was such an age. Poets and such i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle heades might deuise these things, faire in shewe, and pleasant to bee heard, and feine that vertue was taken out of sight that men might be lesse asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and acquit themselues if they followed not those vertues, whereof this age is saide to be vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: But for my own part (as I do remember) (when I haue runne ouer al that euer I either read or heard) I cannot determin the space of that excellent world, when it was, wherein vertues reigned not mingled with any vice, the Poet abuseth mens credulity, when he saith. <hi>The Latins</hi>

First was that golden age, when men without all law</l>

This I am sure of, that in man are ingrafted the seeds of vertue and vice; and that vices do their grow lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriously, where vertue is vntilled; and contrariwise, where vertue is seriously and painfully tilled, there vices are kept vnder, worne away, and extinguisht. Therefore all ages haue been laide open to vertue and vice; there was neuer any which brought not forth good men, neuer any that brought not forth badd; nay at all times and in all places there was euer greater plentie of euill, then of vertuous and good men. Let vs not idlely therefore please our eares, with false and emptie things; for those times which we call the old World, that is furthest remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from this present, euen in those times the hatred of brethren extended vnto death; the father was driuen out of his kingdome by his sonne; the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants foolishly made warre with the gods.</p>
            <p>To conclude, many other things were committed of those auntient and first men, which faine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be born of heauen &amp; earth; by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth how far this opinion of the amiable simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and reuerend innocency of those times differeth
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:21640:94"/>
from truth, for surely what prayses soeuer mortall things had, these were not proper to those or to these times, but to those or to these men; neither was there euer any time which in some fort euill men haue not staind, and which good men haue not honored. For the prayses &amp; reproach of the times are from hence, that vertue or vice are more followed. For it delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men eminent in vertue to liue so longe, as they may be either priuatly or publikely profitable. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, wherein they chance to liue, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace as that station appointed to them, wherin they must stand &amp; watch, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they must incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter those enemies to this mortalitie; where likewise they must show their vertue, from whence they must neuer depart, vntill this battaile bee fought, and the victorie obtained; therefore the world is an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent place, wherein all things are indifferent to him that placeth his strength in vertue, therefore thou dost ridiculously laye that fault vpon the time, which is thy owne: Awake thy selfe, whosoeuer thou art that outwardly art so fine and in showe so pure; straight way thou wilt bee ashamed of thy inwarde deformitie, Thou shalt see how that in thy manners, there is nothing pure and sincere; how all thinges are counterfeite, staine, and polluted, and withall thou shalt vnderstand, what a trister thou art, in that thou extollest with praise and admiration that aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent sinceritie, and innocency, from which thou art far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:21640:95"/>
not labour to attaine vnto it: thinking it only vertue enough to professe it with thy tongue, and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it in thy manners, surely seeing there are not stronger motiues to vertue then examples, if wee might wish, wee ought rather to wish to bee borne late, then in these first times, and rather to looke at all those times that haue beene before vs, then to be looked at by those that come after: it is much safer to be taught by the examples of others, then to haue none whom thou mayst imitate and followe. Doubtlesse that learning is more true and certaine, which experience hath brought forth, and collected out of many examples: Doest thou admitte and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe my counsell? Then take away all those cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines drawne before the truth, accuse not the world and the time, that is all men besides thy selfe, rather looke into the thing, and diligently examine thy own vices, and if thou obserue thy selfe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thou wilt confesse that thou art one of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude better then none of the rest, and perhaps (which is like) worse then a great number, and to say plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou that art so great a talker of vertue, that is so great a trifler, what hast thou yet furthered the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, whereby either the staines of this age may bee wiped out, or the prayse of it increast.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:21640:95"/>
and talkatiue idlenes, in which thou makest a showe of vertue, to be something. If all men thus should thinke it sufficient to commend the times past, and no way to further the aduancement of the present, should not the commendation of this age lye buried and forgotten? Thou sayst, thou art compeld to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low things not to bee allowed. What wicked hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor doth thus possesse thee, that so foulely thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblest? that if thou seest any thinge to bee done otherwise then well, thou must needes bee a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer of that, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mender of it either in deed, word, gesture, allowance consent or silence? Why doest thou not rather make known to the commonwealth, that there is so much honestie in thee, that no disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie whatsoeuer can ouerthow it? It is not vertue that which will bend so soone, and yeeld to vice; or lurk neare it. Vertue it is either not at al, or whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is, it is in a high place, if in those places where thou art there be none, showe thy own vertue: If there be any, striue that thy owne may bee more eminent and conspicious. To conclude, laying aside this same sluggish and vnprofitable wisedom, which thou professest, be a powerful exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of true vertue; if not to many, to a few, to thy selfe alone, least that any man seeing thee exclayme: O smith thou forgest armes for one that is full of slouth: as those that were before, gaue much light vnto thee, so hold thou out some light of this diuinitie to those that come after. In this, neuer regarde what the vulgar sort either
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:21640:96"/>
alloweth or disalloweth, but only what becommeth thy selfe; what any graue and wise man may worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinke of thee. Imitate not publike and vsuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (no not the auncient in this respect only as they are auncient) but out of both choose that which is best, thus the age wherein thou liuest shall be to thee auncient, or if any thing can bee thought more holy and more pure, then those times that are more aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, neuer stand vpon other men, other times, or countries.</p>
            <p>So make accounte that wheresoeuer thou art, there vertue may make her seate.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21640:96"/>
this only I reprooue in thee, that thou art a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menderonly, and not a follower, whereas by this meanes alone thou mayst gaine that commendation which thou expectest, which were a thinge much better, then thus as thou dost with auncient and glorious names, to couer thy owne staines, and with those euils whereof thou thy selfe art guiltie, to accuse and burthen the time (a thing most innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t): thou wilt also be known how careful &amp; circumspect thou art, whilst thou diligently takest heede, least men should follow thee with stones like one distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, if thou shouldest be seene diuers from others: Indeed I require nothing lesse of thee then that thou shouldest be diuers from the multitude: But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that thou shouldest be better; not that thou shouldest be obserued in an vnvsuall habitte, and a singularitie of life, as a contemnor of others, but that in holinesse and vnaffected maners; thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest exceede others.</p>
            <p>Thus be as an auncient example to bee looked at; by this euerie man shall esteeme what and howe great thou art, by thee euerie man shall bee stirred vp to chastitie and innocency: and as it is a proud and intollerable thing so to deale, as though thou only, or aboue the rest wouldest bee accounted wise; so there is nothing so foolish, as that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that exceedeth not the capacitie of the Common multitude; but doubtlesse, that wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath all the perfections of wisedome in it,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21640:97"/>
which vnderstandeth &amp; followeth nothing, but that which is right; whether they be allowed or disallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the common people. Furthermore not conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to detract from those times, thou also complaynest that thou art borne in a monarchie vnder gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as though any man hath libertie, or bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage from any other but from his owne minde: be thou thy owne, not a slaue of thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: stande firme amongst all the darkenesse of vice: moderate thy sences: take thy minde into thy owne power: then thou perfectly shalt see thy selfe in the bosome of libertie: though borne vnder the Persian seruitude. Besides, thou wouldest haue it knowne what a great man, thou wouldest haue bin, if thou haddest binne borne vnder a free state. I knowe there thou wouldest haue set vp a shoppe of vertue; thou wouldest haue corrected thinges that are amisse: that people should haue had thee an excellent reformer of manners: this indeede were credible; if in that place where thou art, thou hadst giuen any token of it: if thou hadest made cleane thy owne manners: if thou hadest excelled and gone before others in true and vertuous examples, not in a glorious speech, but thou (whilst thou ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishest others) differrest all to other times, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, as though time and place had rule ouer vertue.</p>
            <p>What? darest thou say, that thou wouldest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21640:97"/>
manners to others, which hast either none thy selfe or vncertaine, vnordered or verie euill? Wilt thou showe the waye to others which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est it not thy selfe? Doest thou thinke that thou art priuatly discharged, because thou promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest that thou wilt publikely doe it? But I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide that amongst thy familiars, with whome thou mayst do much, thou art scarse a powerfull example of vertue, if thy inwarde life do not first aunswere to these glorious admonitions: this (beleeue mee) is the most compendious waye of informinge thy owne manners to honestie, and reforming the vices of others.</p>
            <p>Here, if thou beginnest, there from thee ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue shall bee deriued vnto thy neighbours; from thence into thy whole kingedome: and so into forraigne and straunge Countries. Why doest thou suffer a thinge so profitable, and of euerie good man so much wished and desired, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for: so longe to bee expected and desired of thee? Goe no further, expect not any solitarie, or priuatte place, there were thou art, giue vnto thy selfe, giue vnto those, that are about thee, giue vnto all, an vndoubted experminent what thou wouldest doe if thou haddest beene borne there, where thou mightest haue had authoritie, and beene a great man, and had much power ouer the mindes of other, giue assurance, that if thou
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21640:98"/>
haddest place, nothing els were wanting to thee, it is in thy power to performe that: and what there, would bee authoritie, here shalbe example, and yet it is true that in good examples their is much autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
            <p>Do not thinke that any place giueth libertie to manners. I do not see if thou weart one of the great states in a free Commonwealth, howe thou couldest more profitte thy Countrie then now, when thou art borne vnder gouernment: and in no great fauour, vnlesse peraduenture thou art of that opinion, that there is more vertue and generous honestie, ingrafted in those that are borne in a free state, then vnder a Prince like gouernement. If thou thinke thus, thou thinkest euill; and with all accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test nature to bee a stepmother, not a mother, nor indued with a kinde of motherly affection. For surely, <hi>Necessity</hi> inuented all formes of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes; being inuented, <hi>Reason</hi> hath disposed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> hath confirmed them: there are places, where publike consent require lawes; other places, where they stande in neede of Kinges and soueraintie: and amongst these the excellencie of a King-like authoritie is no lesse glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, then amongst those the sweetnes of libertie. Doubtles, to both there is no other thinge propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then <hi>publike security,</hi> which consisteth in this that euery man haue his owne, and that cheefly in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses there be a rule of aequalitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:21640:98"/>
For the establishing of this security there is need e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way of much concord of the Citizens; to this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord, men that are willing are driuen by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, and by a naturall instinct of goodnesse; those that are vnwilling are compeld by the lawes, and all the guarde and strength that lawes haue; he whom the condition of birth hath brought vnder a free state is a debter to his vertue, and a subiect to that. He that is borne vnder a King, it is fit for him vvhatsoeuer he hath, he imploy it to the obedience of his Prince; from both ariseth the commendation of a good Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, to enquire which place is neerer and more open to vertue, it is rather a matter of curiosity then profit, and not for this purpose.</p>
            <p>And all this I haue saide to this end that it may appeare, that in euery forme of a Common wealth, there is some one marke of vertue, whereunto men must runne in all courses. It is ready and easie to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man, euery where to learne manners; If fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those that are vertuous, he shall be furnisht with vertuous qualities, if from the multitude, he shall be furnisht with manners variable, and impure. This also dooth much trouble thee, that thou saiest that in these dayes there is no where any certainety of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and holy worship, that wheresoeuer thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest, men go astray and er: nor that the waies &amp; true paths of religion are so much opened as the entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to all impiety. From hence all</p>

               <hi>Right and wrong are turnd, and warres do still increase And face of sinnes in many shapes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For at this day there is nothing which is so fruitfull a ground of all publique calamities as this variety of religion. From hence are the ruines and falles of whole kingdomes; the workers and contriuers wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of appeareth to bee a number of vncertaine, vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant men, which swarme in all places, desirous not onely of nouelty, but of the ouerthrow of states; by whose disputations and subtilty, the truth long since hath been spoken, not perfected; For these do rend the common wealth in sunder with an itch of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and a desire of ouercomming without care of learning. With much impudency and slouth in their euill contentions of the greatest things; to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it plainely appeareth their most wicked fruite is, to speake great things of God, and yet neuer to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him nor to thinke there is any; much lesse to feare him as the iust punisher of such offences. From hence it commeth that they scarce forbeare from impyety, No not in those things which ought to be sacred and most solemne. For what else meane these contentions, from disputations, tumults; from tumults, warres growing from warres, one trouble and vprore from another. I doe not onely sorrow for these but mourne them. For I confesse in these kinds there haue more errours sprunge vp within this hundred yeeres then can bee cured either with <hi>Admonition, Authority,</hi> or <hi>Reason.</hi> But what are all
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:21640:99"/>
these to thee? If thou hast learned in thy child-hood; if in thy youth thou hast beene nourished; if in thy mans estate those thinges were confirmed in thee, wherein thy safetie and the vertuous duties of thy life are contained? Can any stormes drawe thee to a contrarie course? Can the leuitie of others or their craft mingled with fury, be strong enough, to shake thy constancy and to trouble thy quiet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution? Nay, rather the more the vulgar with the inconstant motions of their mind and euery tempest floate vp and downe, the more show thou, that thou canst not be mooued. What? Doost thou turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout at euery noise? Is it not a shame that in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of such moment, strength and constancy should bee wanting in thee. Therefore stand and remaine immoueable:
<q>
                  <l>Euen as the Rocke in midst of sea doth stand</l>
                  <l>Vnmou'd, when waues most furiously do tosse:</l>
                  <l>And like those stones fast fixed as the land,</l>
                  <l>VVhil'st silly reedes are shaken to the lesse:</l>
               </q>
Why doost thou desire to see how here euery man delighteth to doubt, to float, to perish? either thou art rightly entred into this true way &amp; in good time, or from thy infancy thou art of no valewe? If this bee so, doe not I loose my labour, which do thus reason with thee? If otherwise, from whence is this inconstancie of thy disposition? VVhy doost thou not goe on as thou hast begunne?
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:21640:100"/>
Those precepts of pyety that are ingrafted in thee, take heed that thou be not a forsaker of them. Do not so much as doubt. For whosoeuer so doubteth that he neuer compose and stay his wauering mind, he is wholly drawne in peeces, with variety of opinions. Surely such a one either erreth or is next vnto one that erreth, and thus erring, next vnto him that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth. Therefore with this foule inconstancy ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne not thy bringing vp, Be not willing to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed for thy idle wishe, but heape thy holy wishes with study and true Piety, which to man as the Poet speaketh is safest vertue. I say <hi>true piety,</hi> because I doe warne thee to take heede of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit pyety of these dayes, which professeth a soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary wandring knowledge of God, without any fruite at all, whilst it seeketh to know all things lawfull and vnlawfull of God, Open or secret, and with a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile mouth skilfully argueth those things which their euill minds deride and scorne.</p>
            <p>Thus farre are these sorts of men from worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God: sincerely &amp; rightly ordering of humane duties, for it becommeth men neuer to be more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, then when they haue to deale with God; to be most holy, and most reuerent in those things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to religon, rather to professe an humble simpli city of beleeuing, then to boast of a sharpenesse of piercing into his secrets, and knovving of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>In other things I commend thy confidence, but
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21640:100"/>
in this thy feare. Surely in the very entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred power &amp; vnsearchable maiesty, there is a bright nesse and glory that opposeth it selfe against euery curious searcher, and blindeth both the eyes and the mind of him that pryeth with ouer much boldnesse, against this vsuall rashnesse at this day, or any such that is like vnto it, set lockes vpon thy eares; for it is not pyety but a counterfait impyety, which leadeth men into errors; to which that olde saying may bee truely spoken
<q>
                  <l>Which way thou please runne slily, playe the Foxe,</l>

Exact that true and seuere pyety of thy selfe, which is scarce found in conference and concourse of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; seldome is cloathed in pretious garments, seldome walketh into the streets, scarce is seene in publique, but dwelleth in a true and honest brest and from thence is dispersed into his mouth and hands; thus beeing affected, thou shalt neuer bee drowned in the waues of false opinions; no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest of errour shall cast thee downe;

Thus assure thy selfe thou shalt bee worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the best, to the meanest, to al, in al places thou shalt be esteemed honest, amongst men, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God.</p>

Well howsoeuer it is, consider whether thou haste not in the time of peace, abused thy skill and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the hurte of men and not to defende them. Dooth not worthely (then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can bee more iust) thy owne example fall vpon thy owne head?

            <p>Last of all, whosoeuer thou art learned or vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whether one of the states or a common person, whether thou art a leader, or an ordinary souldier, whether thou art rich or poore, of what sort soeuer thou art (for it were infinit to reckon vp all) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I speake vnto all that euery man may take it spoken to himselfe.

those things wherein thou oughtest to be instructed. Now it were fitte to arme thy selfe with wisedome, and true valour: sad and loathsome olde age ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh men that are inconsiderat and vnprepard: In time to come thou wilt bee able to do nothing but trifles, the mind will wax olde in a decayed bodie.

Therefore free thy selfe from these delayes, least thy sluggishnes bring thee into those daungers, from whence thou canst not deliuer thy selfe, without much perill. Repentance at the last yeares is late. Wee looke for meanes of life then late, when wee are in the last part of it; when our burdens are to be packt vp: nay, to bee layd aside.

Any hope whereto dispaire was not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion? in one word, what is all that I haue spoken, that I haue done; that I haue hoped, that I haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but the matter of sorrow, and repentance?

What is our childish estate but the showe and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of miserie, or rather a glasse wherein a man may see all the miseries which are to come? What our youth but a vading flower, growing to a better fruite?

And to conclude, the pray of death? VVhat further can hee doe or hope whose soule is euer going out of his mouth? What am I fitte for, who am vnmeete for the lightest cares? whose strength of bodie is weake? The age of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and power past?

nothing likes me; and as hope doth more and more freese in me, so all pleasure decayeth; whereof this worne and decayed bodie of mine is vncapable. I haue no healpe in my kindred, for all slippe from me by little and little, and sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>My familiaritie is pleasant to none; I walke as the hate of the earth; neither am I more almost estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of any then a thing worne and of no value, as many men, and many thinges doe not please mee, no more doe I please any. I am forbidden to meddle with any thing vnder a colour of honour; to which they giue the name rest, and ceasinge from labour, that with the mildnes of the name, they may mittigate the asperity of the thing, and the grief that I take from it. In my sayings there is no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for all men say I am now past, and brought to a doting age; the very memory of my life past wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was some pleasure, daily weareth away.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:21640:106"/>
Of one thing I haue more vnderstanding then euer I had, namely, of this miserable estate to which I am appointed, and as it were reserued; to this age, and to this experience rising out of these miseries I am beholding for this one thing, that it hath opened my eyes and laide before mee the whole army of those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles wherewith this mortalitie is guarded, and can neither finde remedy nor meanes to escape them. Neither can learning (that deuine inuention as they call it) mitigate this griefe; I haue no comfort out of my learning how great soeuer it is; nay the more plentifull that is, the more plainely doe I see ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what is not true then what is; yea, it rather brings mee into the large sadde fieldes of errour, and there placeth me, from whence I may see with a large prospect, ignorance that is of kindred to our mortalitie; So farre am I from beeing brought to any delightes or pleasures of knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>Last of all, there remaineth pyety, whereof I was euer a diligent worshipper, wherein I finde no refuge. If for all this being worne with yeares, my last houre must come, and that fatall necessity whereunto against my: will I must obey and follow, not whether it leades mee, but whether it draweth mee. For in that my heape of miseries giueth mee a minde to speake freely.</p>
            <p>From hence am I grieuiously tormented in that I see my selfe brought vnto that peryod of life,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21640:107"/>
which is set so fast that it cannot bee remooued. There is nothing that dooth more trouble my rest and quiet then the often thinking of the approach of death, which the more I labour to cast from me, the more and more violently it commeth to my minde, and this is that same inward and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall corrasiue:
<q>
                  <l>This dimmes my life which no delite can cure,</l>
                  <l>And leaues no ioy that pleasant is or pure.</l>
               </q>
If I beginne to talke with any; If I doe any thing; If I walke; If I rise from sleepe; continually I am encountred with the euer present memory of my neare aproaching death, I haue euer (as that Romane king) those two gods present with mee (dread and palenesse).</p>
            <p>Now at the last, the conscience of my former life, which is full of trouble, and a torment to me, gathereth his forces and doth shew it selfe. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a little hope doth comfort mee, sometimes dispaire dooth trouble and afflict me. Now I float as it were betwixt life and eternall death: whether is nearer I cannot easily tell: so am I an old and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed man deluded by both. Farewell all, let it goe, And that humane wisedome, which is meere madnes let it blinde and deceiue it selfe, let it be insolent in this same show of perswasion, for which it would be esteemed; let it delude it selfe in thinges accutely

VVhatsoeuer the state is wherein I am, it is nothing els but a fit place to renew my euils. Amongst which I reckon this, that my minde doth wauer: I know nothing but that I am ignorant of all things: Shall I speake it or holde my peace. To a traueller it is a hope, and an ease to thinke of the place wherevnto he goeth, I, why I am, or what shall become of mee, whether I shall goe, what is all this wherein I am, but as a droppe in the sea, or a stone vpon the shore, or a sparke in the fire? I am more vncertaine then euer I was, happy is he that thinketh hee knoweth this. Doubtlesse, at least hee inioyeth a sweete error, and perisheth pleasingly. Let humane curiositie arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate vnto himselfe, applaude himselfe, giue vnto himselfe this honour, that hee may thinke that hee hath obtained the knowledge of that which is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mortality.

and more then is fit for one who is about to dye. But thou if thou louest thy selfe, suffer a few things, truly and simply, to be spoken to thee; It belongeth chiefly vnto thee, that thou be awaked with this my admonition; howsoeuer it is: Let mee leade thee a long not through all the benefits of God (which thou corruptly doost interpret, for that were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit) but through the best and cheefest. For amongst all the complaints of men whereby they show how they are infected, with this fault of vnthankefulnesse towards God; there is none more delicate, there is none worse, and more wicked, then that which is in thy minde, and in thy mouth. This most is from hence, that thou darest obiect thy reason; reason, that is the bounds betwixt God and man, the onely light of the minde increased and confirmed with vse of things, that thou darest (I say) oppose and obiect this reason against that deuine prouidence; and after the manner of the Gyants with a bolde attempt, prouoke thy Creator to a single combate.</p>
            <p>Neither dost thou consider that thou art most friendly, and as it were by the hand, ledde euen to that place where is the end of this Iourney (thorny and full of brambles) which wee call life; who in this chiefely repinest that it is giuen vnto thee. To witte, the first in order, and in his bounds containing the rest of Gods benefits. Heere thou art to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider first of all how thou art not agreeable to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:21640:109"/>
thy selfe, who complainest that thy life is giuen thee, the which impatiently thou lamentest to bee taken from thee. Thou repinest that thou liuest, that thou must dye, that thou art borne, to waxe olde; that thou art in this state, that either perpetually (as thou saist) thou must not bee at all, or perpetually be miserable.</p>
            <p>From hence thou gatherest, that it had beene better for thee, not to haue been at all, then in that thou art, to knowe so much that thou maist vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how much vnhappinesse it is, not to bee after thou hast beene. Thou fearest death not as the last destruction, calamity and extinguishing, but perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture as the beginning of some new, and vnknown euill; To conclude, so frowardly, so staggeringly, so prophanely, thou thinkest of the greatest thing of all, that is of thy owne saluation, that when thou art dead to thinke of thy selfe thou thinkest it belongeth not to thee. Oh how am I afraide least.

                  <l>Thy wits do hault, thy tongue, thy soule, thy minde,</l>

            </p>
            <p>First let me deale with thee by way of excursion &amp; skirmishing, then nearer, not a far off with the speare, but at hand with the sword; last of all more strongly and with all my force: Thou saist thou wouldest not haue had life giuen vnto thee.</p>
            <p>Now in the beginning, and in one word thou
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:21640:110"/>
showest that thou knowest not what life is. For if thou didst know it, doubtlesse thou wouldest more considerately esteeme the greatnesse of this benefit. Doost thou (who art so olde) not vnderstand that life is the beeing of man, and the seat of all those bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which that deuine goodnesse bestoweth vppon mankinde? Surely, there is the same reason of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is dead, as of that which is not; for that onely is saide to bee which liueth in that manner as the giuer of life hath prescribed vnto it; therefore by the helpe of this only benefit, thou art all that thou art: And when God hath giuen thee life, he hath giuen thee wholly as a guifte vnto thy selfe. Thou art his debter for thy whole selfe, which gifte by so much is greater, and more to bee esteemed, in that hee gaue it, who was not bound vnto thee, which then wert not at all. Surely it is such a benefit as thou wouldest wish it to bee; that is (if it be not long of thy selfe) very great. From so great a giuer there can come nothing but what is great; especially this, which being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, al the other gifts of God are not only voide and frustrate, but none at all. For that thou art, it is the first of all those steps, whereby thou ascendest into the likenes of him who truely is. For surely there is nothing so vnlike vnto God, as not to be at all. But doubtlesse it is a small thing for thee to be (for that is common to thee with the rest of the creatures) vnlesse thou bee that which thou oughtest to be.</p>

For how dost thou show that thou art olde; by thy yeares and white haire? But these are common to thee with euerie vnhappie and vnwise man. There is nothing swifter nor more violent, then the course of time. One yeare goeth before another; &amp; ages spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely do passe away. There is nothing sooner heaped together, then the number of dayes, monthes, and yeares.</p>
            <p>Therefore there must be something more, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou mayst proue thy selfe to be olde, and from thence obtaine the authoritie and reuerence, which is due to olde age.</p>
            <p>Surely as the first age of man is, such commonly is the middest, and such is the last. The middle age doth agree with the first, and the last with the middle.</p>
            <p>For commonly what foundation of olde age is layd in our childehoode; and our youth; such is euery mans olde age, that is built vpon it. For to be olde, is not to liue without sence, and to growe sluggish with Idlenes, but in liuing to bee formed to that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, which I mentioned before. From hence is gained the honor, authoritie, and Maiestie of a man: These and no other are the cheefe ornaments of old age.</p>
            <p>There is nothing left vnto an olde man which he may call his owne, but only this one thing, which he obtaineth by spending of his life purely, religiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly, fitly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:21640:111"/>
These are the richest, and the best fruites which a man last tasteth, in the last part of his life well spent. Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>rariwise an olde age, credulous, foolish, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull, dissolute; to conclude, sad, dispised and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, must needes follow a former age spent carelesly, riotously, lasciuiously, intemperatly, couetously, and wickedly. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> surely it is not so much a name of age, as a showe of extreame leuitie, doating madnesse, and the beginning, and tast of eternall miserie: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer desireth to haue this age furnisht with his owne vertues, and to bee eminent in these orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; doth so frame his life, that he feareth God, and reuerenceth man; doth so compose himselfe wholly, that when he must growe olde, or die, men may accuse fewe things in his life, and he can excuse himselfe.</p>
            <p>If thou hast liued thus, though thy body goe away with thy years, yet thy manners shall not wax old. Surely the minde shall be young with his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and flourish with true praise.

not, that this whereof thou complainest, is a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitte of that age not to be contemned.

There to thinke of nothing which is not acceptable and pleasant: to waxe olde in bodie and stronge in wisedome: yet to flourish in a sounde Iudgement and to be eminent in all vertues: to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from humane affaires, and to be busied in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine: to be amongst men, more then a man, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue put of man, and to haue put on God: these are the proper and particular happinesse of an age quiet, calme, wise, &amp; purified; which as it ought to be slowe to take paines in his owne affaires: So this wisedome and authoritie are necessarie for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good, for although all things quiet and without trouble, are seemely and conuenient for that age, yet in the minde of old men, there resteth a care of the publike Maiesty.</p>
            <p>Therefore none lesse are exempted from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the common-wealth: nay, that age doth challenge as proper and peculiar vnto it selfe this care of gouerning of others: For verie often those times do happen, wherein olde men with their
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:21640:112"/>
wisedome, and vertue haue established and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened the common wealth, which the rashnesse of young men hath almost ouerthrowne, For they thinke (indeede truely) that it doth no lesse belonge vnto them to take care what manner of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth they haue receiued from their auncestors, then what they haue left vnto their posterities; the names and memorie of some olde men shall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of all posteritie as a thing (I know not how) verie honorable, sacred, and deuine. <hi>Camellus</hi> was foure score yeare olde, when hee tryumphed ouer the <hi>Gaulles,</hi> and <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> was not much lesse, when with his patience he weakened <hi>Hanniball.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the minde of <hi>Massinissa</hi> feeble when he was eightie and eight years old, at what time befriending the Romans he gaue an ouerthrow in a prosperous battaile to the men of Carthage; <hi>Plato</hi> (that same piller of wisedome) in writing attained to the age of fourescore &amp; one yeares; <hi>Isocrates</hi> wanted not schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, no not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had liued ninety &amp; eight yeares; but what doe I goe about the examples of such? olde men (as are of numbersome and vertuous yeares) are infinit. Whose wites haue beene fresh, their mindes sound, the strength of their sences perfect, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies able, themselues honorable, and their graye hayres crowned with many ornamentes; and their whole bodies carrying a reuerent showe to increase a dignitie and a maiestie in them. To conclude, such as from whome age hath taken nothing but euill
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:21640:113"/>
desires; delightes of sinning and the abuse of strength and sence, whose giftes of their minde grow and increase: whome vertue hath set for all ages to looke at, as certaine lightes, or rather sacred powers.</p>
            <p>Therefore, when the lawes gaue rest to those, which were aboue threescore yeares olde, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted them from those actions, which could not bee sustayned, but with bodily strength: they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vpon them, that care which is performed only with the strength of wisedome, for which scarse any other man is sufficient, but only hee who hath his immortalitie almost in his sight. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer a man (so pure, so refinde) speaketh or doth, he is conuersant in it, as one alreadie receiued into those heauenly seates, the power of iudgement is not only not dulled in him, but rather sharpened: hee ceaseth with his hand, not with his counsell; hee seldome doth any thing, but euer commandeth. Therefore hee erreth, and greatly erreth, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinketh that olde age is a name of a fainte, sluggish, broken, slouthfull, and a weakened age, and so that it is exempted from all publike offices, when indeed it is rather most busie of all: most generous, most glorious: as a most excellent worker of those things, which longe, which publikely, and to all, and which shall profit an infinit posteritie. For thou shalt see that the rest of olde men not onely prescribes what ought to be the businesses of others: but also
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:21640:113"/>
goeth before others, both in quickenesse of minde, and in valiant and famous acts, as the Captaines and leaders of publike Counsell. These properly are the exercises of that happie maturitie: in these courses, cheefe valiant and couragious olde men excell: in these they delighte, and in these the mind that is nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest vnto his eternitie, doth runne swifly: goe to then, at length giue this thankes vnto God, who hath brought thee to this olde age, giue this thanks to olde age it selfe: which hath freede thee from those euill affections; taken thee out of that sinke of pleasures: deliuered thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so many toyes, so vaine and importunat: and hath reserued thee to his owne glorie, that thou mayst will and do that only, which only thou oughtest to wil, which to be able to doe is honorable, and to performe, admirable: other ages must goe through many difficulties: watch amidst things hurtfull, and with a doubtfull hazard stande amongst things that are most slipperie: this age on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath power ouer it selfe: that which either ages desire to obtaine, this hath gotten: to this age only are almost all the wishes of humanitie appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this alone standeth in the highest place: and doest thou sorrow that so profitably and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably thou art growne olde, that is that thou hast acted thy age as a commedy.</p>
            <p>Doest thou take it euill that thou drawest neare to that which is the last part of thy life?

so may the traueller be sorrie that hee is come to his iourneyes ende; and the husbandman to see his fields cloathed with ripe Corne, and his trees loaden with ripe fruite: or lastly his vintage to be in Autum, or the time for Oliues in Winter. I demaund what can be more agreeable to nature, then that that which only spronge vp should whither? that is, that it should rest in his due season, when it can bee no longer. Though death in other ages of mans life may seeme vntimely and vnripe, yet in olde age it is seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>Neither is it violence, but an ende and a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and finishing of our age: therefore to moderate olde men, there is a sacietie of this mortalitie (which wee call life) no lesse ingrafted in them then in yong men a desire to liue; and this satietie doth draw with it a contempt of all those things, which belonge not to the true, and sound felicitie of man, what a man would that happie people the <hi>Hyperborians</hi> haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted thee to be, where the old men hauing a full satieti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

VVholly from those thinges which are about thee to enter into thy selfe? to bee affected and amazed? and then to fall low vpon thy knees; to humble thy lookes, to bee

holden carefully with a diligent meditation, to bee erected in thy minde, wholly to rise vp in a reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and worship of that bounty, from which thou hast receiued so many, so great, so excellent thinges? of all which thou art a very famous example. This properly is piety; whereof lately thou madest thy selfe a professour; which if it were true and sincere, it might well bee assaulted, but it could not bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne; nor cast downe: by that thou shouldest bee taught that thou art hee whom God (though he be inuisible) hath vouchsafed part of himselfe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I thinke that hee erreth, which calleth thee halfe a God; in that thou art made according to his similitude, and admitted into the fellowship of his diuinity. For as thy beginning and originall is from Heauen, so immortality is common to thee with thy Creator. A mind truly sincere and vertuous hopeth this; this is the confidence of those great and holy wishes; whereof beeing made partakers, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into the family of God and are of his house. Man hauing obtained this one thing, in this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all other creatures, and destitute of this, hee is beneath them all. If it be an errour and a madnesse (as some thinke) it is to those who are wicked, and desperate, who from hence are to goe into eternall darkenesse. But to those that are honest, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, this immortality is their sure hope, this the comfort of their hope, this their onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Therefore they wishe nothing more
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:21640:116"/>
then that being taken speedely out of these troubles, out of the multitude, out of this filth, and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and being brought into those holy dwellings, they may enioy that euerlasting life, purely cleare, and perfectly bright; to which is added a sound rest and perpetuall security.</p>
            <p>To conclude: that inaccessable, and vnexpugna-' ble possession of that great good, with whose vnsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken confidence, they haue assuredly defended their hearts in this life. The man that constantly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to this, layeth vnder his feet all those things which either doe not leade hither, or leade from hence. All this sinke of other things, hee leaueth to those that are euill, and to wits that are in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with base and vile things; Of this kinde, are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, pleasures (the nourishments of ambition) that which dazeleth euery ignorant eye, inlargeth their desires and woundeth the mind. He knoweth that with these things he is neither beautified nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, but holden backe and hindred. He knoweth that with these things he is deluded and led into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and deceipt. He knoweth that of these things, there is not onely a satiety but a hatred, at the onely mention of this perpetuall felicity, he is awaked; this onely holdeth him, hath him, possesseth him; he delighteth to heare, and speake of this; this hee often repeateth, and imprinteth in himselfe; all this time he bestoweth in the meditation of this; in this he doth diligently labour, heere he doth more
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:21640:116"/>
satisfie himselfe: and what maruaile? For where els almost doth he meet with himselfe, heere he seeth his beginnings, and his nobility; from hence he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemeth himselfe; and would haue himselfe estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; from hence he beginneth to bee nourished with an etheriall and deuine breath, now he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to liue with his glory, which is to come, and last of all (as novv already receiued into those hye and Heauenly places) hee returneth in his height and perfection, and becommeth an admirer and worshipper of his owne diuinity.</p>
            <p>I beseech thee, why doost thou oppose against this wholesome and sauing light those mournefull and sadde darkenesses of impyety? VVhy doost thou with this daungerous accutenesse of witte foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly faine vnto thy selfe, and falsely obiect those thinges which are not, rather then truly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bee instructed in those things that are? VVhy doost thou not free thy selfe out of this torment? VVhy doe these thinges swimme in thy minde, which if they bee not certaine, sound, and stable, thou shalt bee drowned in the waues of Impyety? VVhat doost thou more trouble, teare, and consume thy selfe (wretch that thou art)? VVilt thou neuer pull vppe couragiously these too much growne branches of Impyety? VVhy doost thou delay to plucke out these doubts out of thy minde? Doost thou delight to bee miserable and to sollicit

and trouble thy olde age with this blinde and vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate vnderstanding? why hadst thou rather dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously floate then staye in a sure place of sayle with wind and oares ouer those rockes? And striue for that quiet and calme harbour, where thou thy selfe wholly maist bee quiet? where thou maist without all doubt bee receiued into that wished ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? Out of which whosoeuer is long, must needes suffer shipwracke.</p>
            <p>Thinke that thy life was giuen thee for this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; without this (as thou sayest it is not life but death; whosoeuer is not assured of the goodnesse of GOD toward him, of his Immortality, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and euerlasting felicitie, hee is past remedy. If thou art such a one, why do I talke to thee? Why doe I striue with a shadowe? VVhy doost thou lend thy eares to those thinges, whose minde is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rider and contemner of them? But consider how frendly I will deale with thee; how I haue not cast away all care of thy saluation; how much I doe giue vnto thee; whatsoeuer I haue before spoken of the dignity of Man I knowe that thou dost beleeue it.</p>
            <p>VVhatsoeuer thou hast heard concerning that; whatsoeuer more subtelly, more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, more largely, may bee spoken of it, deliuered by the auntient or late VVriters, what more truely and more fruitefully Christian
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:21640:117"/>
pyety doth promise, all that (howsoeuer thou see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest to auoid it) I will haue thee grant it as most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and most knowne.</p>
            <p>VVith these and such like, I knowe thou hast fully beene instructed. These once thou hast let sinke into thy brest; of these thinges once thou hast thought religiously; namely when thy minde was purer and not stained with so much frowardnesse. In one vvorde, I know thou knowest these thinges: How shall I conuince thee? Namely, if I drawe thee into the lawe; thou sayest before what Iudge? Before that which thou little (esteeming, how truly and sharpely it confuteth all errour and euery false and truthelesse speaker) calledst the <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thither doe I call thee; that thou maist not goe farre from thy selfe. Dooth not thy conscience tell thee that the presages &amp; diuinations, not of a drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke minde, but of a certaine inward instinct, that those predictions the inward and proper motions of the soule show the deuinity and immortality of it? I say inwarde and propper, because the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest beginning of those motions is in it selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
            <p>And therefore all things must first perish before it forsake it selfe, and cease to mooue, it selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immortall: that which is immortall and being of a simple &amp; vncompounded substance cannot be
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:21640:118"/>
deuided; and if it bee not deuided, it cannot dye; For deuision is the death of that which is deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Death is nothing else, but the deuision and dissolution of one particular into two or many; not content with these, thy conscience proceedeth and sayth, <hi>That the minde is the glasse of the soule, the seate of councell, and the gouernment of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence proceede those gifts of the soule, which testifie the deuinity of it; as quicknesse, prouidence, prudence, and wisedome. Vpon these attend memory, vnderstanding, knowledge, and all the rest of the faculties, that area kinne to these, and vnseparable from them. To these wee may ad those, which from the euerlastingnesse of it are deriued into the affections; from the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the sences; In this ranke first is the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our thoughts; Next our <hi>desires, ioyes, hopes, feares.</hi> From hence it certainely appeareth that the better part of man, is the reasonable soule, &amp; the praises that man hath, belong not to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but to the soule. Likewise that <hi>dispraise,</hi> and <hi>Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> are not so much of the body as of the soule cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, &amp; a runnaway fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his own nobility to those tents of euill affections.</p>
            <p>It is most absurde to thinke that the soule which euer thinketh of his posterite, and is so carefull of the long continuance of the memory of it selfe should dye together with the body. Nay, rather it
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:21640:118"/>
is carefull what, and how great it may be, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men after it is freed from the body; as though then it thought it had gotten life, when the bodie had liued many yeares: For there is nothing can be spoken so falsely, so foolishly, so lyingly, and so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently; as that the body (a thing earthly) should giue life to the soule, a thing heauenly and deuine, which of necessitie must be graunted: if the soule liueth no longer then whilst it is in this vessell of flesh, and that it dieth as soone as it is let loose from thence.</p>
            <p>But there is nothing which either is or can bee more certaine, then the mortalitie of the bodie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it consisteth of those things which haue their motion from others, namely things vncertaine, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, inconstant, waxing olde, withering, perishing, and readie to perish, whereupon it is that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the bodie, which can be said to bee liuely. For to liue is to be mooued of it selfe: but the body hath his motions, and agitations from the soule: wherfore this, whether it be called mortalitie, or fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of life, or extinguishing, seeing it is a sending out, and a freeing of the soule, it is not only not euill, but the beginning of good, and of that good which a-lone is the cheefe, and perfect, and eternall good.</p>
            <p>By which things, that may bee gathered which I sayd before, that the dissolution of the bodie which we call death, is not only not to be feared, but (I had
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:21640:119"/>
almost sayd) to be desired; doubtles meerly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, readily to be desired. For this is that by which alone there is a passage made for the soules of good men, to a true life, his owne, and euerlasting: the same ende of life expecteth all; but the effect that followeth of it, is distinguisht: For some dye once, that they may dye eternally; others, that they may liue for euer.</p>
            <p>Now, thou seest how foolishly this bodily mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie is either feared, or lamented: after which immediatly followeth that heauenly immortalitie. These and farre greater then these, and by many degrees much stronger, which neither the weakenes of my minde, nor the slendernesse of my witte can attaine, nor my selfe expresse, which it is fitte should be taken out of the writinges of holy men, thou canst not deny but they are confirmed by thy owne conscience; the sence whereof (although thy body bee olde) cannot bee dulled. For the conscience is the beame of Cods eye, sent to euery man into the secret of his breast, and the most inwarde part of his heart, this euerie man beareth about him; this no man can auoyde, no more then himselfe: It is fixed in his heart rootes; It is giuen vnto man, as an arbitrator, and ouerlooker. It can neuer be shund, neuer extinguished, neuer deceiued. Why, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest thou? because it is that deuine force, which is present in all thy thoughts, actions, vertues, vices; to those a fauourer and a commender, to these euer
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:21640:119"/>
present though as a secret, yet as most seuere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser.</p>
            <p>This thou mayst vndestand to bee not one of the least arguments of Diuinitie. Therefore (O thou olde man) if thou leanest that way, thy soule is; if that way thou standest firme; thou wilt also be more equall and indifferent, to that which thou callest death, and wise men call the ende of miserie? Thou wilt (to conclud) so perswade thy selfe, that when thou shalt be sent from hence, thou shalt bee receiued there: so that thou goest that way, where thou shalt be knowen as a Citizen, and a heauenly inhabitant.</p>
            <p>From hence also thou mayst vnderstand that mortall things doe little pertaine vnto thee seeing all the vse of them belongeth to thy body: The body ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the mind; which vseth these no further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is fit to keepe her dwelling vndesolued, vntill she be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to forsake it; For surely this which wee call life, is nothing els, but the way of the trauelling soule that goeth to his own Country. And all these which incounter him in this life, are but as prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for this great iourney, and foode to nourish the body, whilst it is the chariot of the soule. But to couet these things too vehemently; to stay gazing and admiring these thinges by the way and so to forget that place wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto we goe, it is not the work of the soule, but of the body not of a man, but of a beast, for it is certain that man in respect of his soule, is a God, &amp; in respect of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:21640:120"/>
his bodie is a wilde beast. And therefore the longer the soule dwelleth in the bodie, his worke is so much the harder. And his praise the greater, if it suffer not it selfe to bee infected with the contagion of it. Yet I do not say that any man vncommanded must goe out of his standing, but when he hath leaue and is called for.</p>
            <p>And when he is cited and sent for to appeare, then if hee be slowe, then if hee bee vnwilling to goe, if hee complaine, if hee striue against it, if hee suffer himselfe to bee drawne, surely hee is ignorant of himselfe, what hee is and of his owne good.</p>
            <p>What? Hee betrayeth himselfe by his owne ill confession, hee maketh fetters to tye himselfe, and for euer hee is excluded from that felicitie, without which a man is nothing but a receptacle of miseries.</p>
            <p>Now see what is thy iudgement of thy selfe, who so much fearest death: thou canst not plainely show that there is more earthly matter in thee, that is claye, filth, impuritie, then there is man: that is then soule, then celestiall substance. The soule in the bodie is as a stranger in an Inne: it is the part of an inconsiderat and vnwise man to goe vnwillingly out of his Inne, in respect of some obiect of the throat or the belly: To conclude, it is the point of an vnskilfull man, and of one that thinkes little of his owne safetie, with the behoulding of earthly
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:21640:120"/>
things to forgoe heauenly: seeing then that in death there is so much good, doest thou blame thy olde age which hath brought thee to so great a good.</p>
            <p>Why doest thou not rather lay aside this voluntary blindnes, and this so carefull a frowardnes, &amp; looke at the light? why dost thou not acknowledg this same excellent gift, or rather seruice of this old age, which bringeth thee so neare so excellent a good? Oh sticke no longer in these sands, pull out thy selfe as speedely as thou canst; shake of these lettes, breake in sunder these hinderances: call the assistance of thy ancient and former minde: stirre vp thy learning: bend the force of thy witte, call vpon the holy spirit, bee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried aboue thy sences, awake thy selfe, to giue God heartie and immortall thankes: esteeme his so many benefits in thy mind; expresse them all in thy words, in thy countenance, in thy gesture, in imitation, in example, then thou shall learne by little and little, that thou oughtest seriously to reioyce, that the time of thy human mortality is come to an end: that the time of thy earthly aboad is expired; that the ende of thy sinning is at hande, that mortall hopes are cut of, and that heauenly hopes are augmented, and increased: surely when thou cammest from thy childhoode to bee a youth, thou begannest to scorne all those things which did please thy childhoode: then being a man I thinke thy wishes were much wiser then in thy youth: to conclude, in thy olde
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:21640:121"/>
age, thou seest all the desires of the former ages to be quenched, as hotte burning yron in cold water, what doest thou learne from hence? Doubtles that there is nothing of such value, in any part of this life, wherewith thou oughtest so to bee delighted, that thou shouldest wish to tarrie in it; but that there is an other life, which who so entereth truely may say
<q>
                  <l>My wishes ende, I haue attaind</l>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto haue I proceeded with all the diligence and care I could, to repell those darts which the vnthankefull mind throweth against God: to these of ours, let any man adde whatsoeuer, he is guiltie of himselfe, neither can I or any man els expresse those things, for they are placed in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est bottome of the mind, where lyeth secret all that poyso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which mans impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, vttereth against God, euery man as he inwardly searcheth himselfe, shall finde it, hee only who is the seer of hearts, and also the measurer of times, and the vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of thoughts: and to whome all secretes are

open; apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the impurities of an others brest, these which we haue set downe which either may be learned by reading, or touched and knowne by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; it is fit the Readers should take in good part.</p>
            <p>Those that are more speciall, and more secret are left to euery man himselfe; it is sufficient for me, to haue shewed those thinges, wherein men in this kinde most vsually offend; furthermore least I should permit by negligence any thing that appertaineth to this subiect; I will in one word set downe those, which by this worst vice delude the society of man, the fault of an vngratefull mind, although it sticke fast by the rootes of every vice, yet as I thinke it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth chiefely his increase, and nourishment, from <hi>folly, couetousnesse,</hi> and <hi>pride.</hi> For the vnthankefull person, neither acknowledgeth the benefits recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; neither regardeth him that gaue them; but him that is ready to giue, wheresoeuer hee is, hee fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him out and hangeth vpon him. He gapeth after things, soone heard, desired, hoped. Hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth him of whom he hath receiued a benefit, as a creditor, whose name hee blotteth out as not being minded to pay him. Surely in that he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that he ought him a benefit, which gaue him one and was not in his debt, hee is a foole, hee that neither repayeth nor thinketh of repaying that which hee hath receiued, is the robber of an other, and the sordide miser of his owne, and in that hee
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:21640:123"/>
doth not acknowledge them, he is proudely maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and malitiously forgetfull. Therefore an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull person (howsoeuer hee wickedly dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles) dooth know that hee hath receiued a benefit, but hee taketh the thankes from it that is due vnto it, and either passeth it all ouer with silence, and daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth ouer the memory of it, or impudently deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fact. I say, denyeth either by dissembling by wordes or in deede; neither dooth the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of an vngratefull person so much faile him, as his vnluckinesse, malitiousnesse, and dissembling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerruleth him, which he himself denies not, by often saying, <hi>many sacrifice, but fewe are hearde</hi> from hence there spring many kindes of vnthankfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, some requite a benefit as they thinke but secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as fearing least it should appeare, so carefull they are, least any man should see it, neither are they so much ashamed to requite it, as to confesse that good turne, which to confesse they ought not to bee ashamed; of this kinde are those for the most part who are bound to their inferiours; to these I may ioyne those who are bound for those giftes, whereby they are more wise, and more learned, yet either they returne some small thing, for so great a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit (and with much a doe) or looke a squint or not at all, at those by whom they are inriched with those benefits which cannot be requited either with gold or siluer, and if peraduenture they do acknowledge the benefit, they so frame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, that they seeme
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:21640:123"/>
not to repay it: But to bestow as it were some bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit vpon their inferiours: like to these are those which either contemne, or hate their Schoole Masters, and those whom they haue had as instructers and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of their young yeares; by all these for the most part a benefit is so requited, that a man had rather not haue it requited at all. In this kinde often and very greatly Princes offend towards men painefull and industrious; such as are most obsequious vnto them; thus often, Generalles, and Captaines of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend towards souldiers of excellent vertue; and the lesse and inferiour persons are not in this kinde lesse froward, then those great and mighty, whilst they often swell, and are pust vp more then either they know or can performe; and whilst they doe admire their owne and odiously extoll them, the bounty of others dooth grow vile and base with them; surely though they be wittie and learned, yet they are swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and arrogant, and indeed unthankfull; and euill interpreters of an other mans liberality. Of this kind was <hi>Lentulus,</hi> he whom <hi>Augustus</hi> had drawne from the Courts and pleading, to great riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; yet found him vnthankefull, for hee was not afraide to say, that the Emperour had not bestowed so much vpon him, as he lost by pleading, &amp; the vse of his eloquence. Amongst vnthankful persons I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon him who is thankful for feare, for he feareth that in his doubtful estate, he shall be forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he be not esteemed for some recompence, and the significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:21640:124"/>
of a gratefull minde. Others require a benefit in some part, but it is of an other mans, whilst in the meane time they spare their owne.</p>
            <p>These vnderstand not that there is scarse any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittall of thankes, but with some coste, nay not without the helpe first of vertue, then of our wealth, and our increasing happinesse (others and these are men of an euill disposition) wish euill to those, of whom they haue receiued a benefit, that in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of an other they may haue occasion to be found thankefull. Neither doe they this so much to helpe him that needeth his helpe, as laying aside all conscience, for a vaine rumour of glory. Others (whilst they are ouer desirous to seeme thankfull) they fall into that vice which they shun; and which exceedingly they hate in others: they are sory (they say) for the least thing to be bound either to this man or to that; they are so impatient for the receiuing of a benefit, that as ouerloaden with some great burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they are presently desirous to lay it off, these whilst they cannot indure to sustaine the benefits of others show plainely that they will no way haue other be beholding to them: others presently return the thing they haue receiued or the like value, as a debtor doth gold or siluer, they dare bestowe nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the principall. These in giuing backe againe that, which they haue receiued, or some thing of the same value, doe not requite a benefit; for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euery requitall of a benefit, is rather the thanks
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:21640:124"/>
of the minde, then of the thing, hee that requiteth not a thing giuen, with the same thankefull minde that it is giuen, doth not requite a benefit.</p>
            <p>From hence it followeth, that hee which dooth not requite a benefit, because when he would, hee cannot, is often thankefull; whereas he that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it not with thy minde, is euer vnthankefull. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers slowly and sluggishly requiting a benefit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite it not at all; for with these a benefit dooth so wither, that by degrees it vanisheth away; these Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> pronounceth to bee vnthankefull, as all those who expect to be called vpon to requite a benefit receiued; others in requiting an old bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, expect a newe, neither doe they know how to giue any thanks, but such as haue hookes in them; which what way soeuer they are applyed, they euer eatch something. This is the Courtiers manner to insnare the liberality of others, in this deceitfull kinde of thankes; and with this minde, speake of the old benefits, to gaine new and much greater by it. Thus they banish benefits out of the society of men, and instead of benefits, bring in a deceitfull gaining kind of trafficke, and plaine filthie basenesse, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the honesty of all benefits is blemisht. Hee also is vnthankefull whome thou hast not tyed vnto thee with thy benefits, nor giueth thee no thanks for them, but requiteth them with euill wordes, and to these addeth also euill deeds.</p>
            <p>Thus he hateth him to whome hee oweth mo
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:21640:125"/>
of a debtor, and one that is bound, he becommeth an enemy, euer quarreling, iniurious, full of braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, threatning, and reuenging. This worst kind of men (from whom there is nothing to be reaped but a haruest of much euill) one resembleth to a ramme which often butteth with his hornes at him that is higher; I should rather thinke such a one to be that Woulse, of which was made the Greeke E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigram, which I haue assayled to translate word for word:
<q>
                  <l>Ifeede the wolfe, with milke (against my will)</l>
                  <l>But so my shepheard needs will me commaunde,</l>
                  <l>Fed with my milke, he fearcely doth me kill:</l>
                  <l>For kinde no kindnes is able to withstand.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This kinde of vnthankfull persons, the wise man no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in these words; he that rewardeth euill for good, euill shall not depart from his house. Like vnto these are they to whom we must giue thankes (and against our wils) for miuries and reproches that are done vnto vs; Of this kind are these cruell heades, tyrants, diffemblers, framed to arrogancy, cruelty, and impyety, who in the midst of sacreledge and flaughter, according to their clemency and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bestow wicked and cruell fanours; at the enuy whereof they blush not, but amongst their sighes &amp; grones, are content to suffer flattering thankes to be bestowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; find praise in hainous offences.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:21640:125"/>
To conclude they thinke it meete not onely to haue thankes but to receiue giftes from those whom they haue spoyled. Neither haue Princes only this great and heauie hand, but others also, such a one did <hi>Marcus Caelius</hi> describe <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> to bee, writing to <hi>Marcus Tullius,</hi> in these words. I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to confesse vnto thee, and to complaine of the iniuries of the most vngratefull man <hi>Appius,</hi> who beganne to hate me because he ought me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good turnes, and when that miserable man could not command himselfe to pay them, he made open warre with mee: wisely and after his manner (sayth <hi>Tacitus)</hi> benefits are so long acceptable, as that there is hope they may berequited; but when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to exceede for thankes, they reape hatred; These are the wayes so farre as I knowe whereby men are for the most part vnthankefull; that is euill deceiuers of benefits receiued; In which vyce (as <hi>Cicero</hi> sayth) there is no vyce wanting; Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there is none a greater enemy to humane socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. By this meanes mutuall charitie is extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, the hope of mutuall helpe is cut off, and all the traffick of humanitie and kindnesse is stopt. For the going and comming of thankes being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, those whom thou seest, are no more men, but wilde beasts in the shape of men, euer rauening that which is neerest vnto them. The vnthankfull person is an enemy of all men; nay of all humanity it selfe: hee is a gulfe that draweth all thinges vnto him,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:21640:126"/>
without respect of any but of himselfe, It may whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee dispaired that there should be any intercourse of humanity with him, who admitteth no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change either of thinges, or wordes: For as their is no greater argument of loue and courtesie then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously to receiue, and to giue thankes: so there is no surer signe of a very crooked nature, then to bee vnthankfull: those that haue called an vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full person, a tunne that is bored through, because it holdeth nothing, but all is lost that is put into it, In my opinion they haue saide little what he is: He is I know not what worse thing, a plague, a poyson, those are more significant in my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which haue giuen to the vnthankefull person, the ewe tree for his badge, a tree sad and vnluckie, full of hurtfull fruite (if those poysoned berries may be called fruite) and a deadly shadowe, nay antiquity did account this vice so odious that the Latins did not thinke it worthy to haue a name, besides what maruaile is it, if as there is no man so hurtfull to all, so there bee no man so hated of all as hee that is infected with this vice.</p>
            <p>There is nothing sayth <hi>Plautus</hi> more burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some then an vnthankefull person. It is much better that thou shouldest bee euer bountfiull, then vnthankefull; For the good will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende him, but this euen the badde themselues will dispraise. VVee haue that same excellent speech of <hi>ENNIVS</hi> to <hi>AVGVSTVS,</hi> taking it
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:21640:126"/>
impatiently that it was not in his owne power, not to be vnthankefull.</p>
            <p>This one iniurie (saith he) O Caesar thou hast done vnto mee, that I liue and die vnthankefull. All which things though they be verie true, and that it is certaine that there is nothing a greater enemie or more odious then an vnthankefull person, yet wee must not hate them, but blame them, and amend them, least peraduenture we hate our selues. For who is there if hee looke more truely, and more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely into himselfe, that is not prone vnto this vice? who is there that loueth not himselfe, so much that almost he despiseth all others? Who is there so vpright, that leaneth not this way? The greatest men oftentimes, and such as were the conquerors of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices (if this were not wanting vnto them) are triumphed ouer, of this fault only; neither is this the staine and blemish of particular persons, and men vnlearned, but of the most and most skilfull: yea (which is more strange) of all, and often of those who are much esteemed for their excellent wisedome. The Senat of Rome is said vnthankefully to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited the first builder of their City: nay, Rome it selfe was held most vnthankefull to <hi>Camillus</hi> and <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio Africanus,</hi> the two greatest and worthyest pillers of that Empire. Surely these are said to be the words of <hi>Africanus: O vngratfull Countrie, thou shalt not inioye so much as my bones.</hi> Hee might truely exclame:

            <p>The Carthagians were not free from this fault, when as they gaue <hi>Zantippus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, for taking of <hi>Regulus,</hi> an honorable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but secretly to the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>maclius,</hi> it is neuer fittenor safe for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to be vnthankefull. It is truely also saide of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> (that wise and most experienced Prince) that two things especially are to bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of a Prince, <hi>not to reuenge his enemies, nor to bee vnthankefull toward his frendes.</hi> As it is true in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate persons, so that common saying is most true in Princes: <hi>The earth yeeldeth not any thing worse, then an vnthankefull person.</hi> Here it is fit to admonish all not to detract from their bountie, by reason of the ingratitude of any, nay rather let him desire to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed a man beneficiall, because this vertue lieth contemned; especially in this age which hath scarse
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:21640:127"/>
left any place either for benefits or thankes. Let him thinke that the greatest reward of this vertue, is in the vertue it selfe. Therefore let him not require thanks for a pleasure done: For thankes perish as soone as they are required; nay the only remembrance of a benefitte, is an vpbray ding, no lesse hatefull in the giuer, then forget fulnesse in the receiuer. It is a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous leuitie to suffer the occeasions, and matters of well doing to perish; because the benefitte with some one man hath perished: Nay, if any where, then here we must be constant; For the first vertue continueth not vnlesse thou adde a second to it: For thou canst scarce defende former benefits; but with following benefits, In giuing and receiuing of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, we must not euer follow which way thinges leade vs, but what way reason counselleth. It is of so much value saith <hi>(Seneca)</hi> to finde one thankefull, that thou must prooue euen those that are vnthankefull. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let euerie one do this, whilst he giueth former benefits, to thinke of those which must be giuen after;</p>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:21640:128"/>
most greeuous kinde of punishment: killing the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull person by nayling him through the necke to the earth with a stake. Surely <hi>Amianus Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> reporteth, that the <hi>Persians</hi> had most seuere laws, amongst which the cruellest were against those who were vnthankefull, or had fayled their frendes.</p>
            <p>Thus amongst the <hi>Hebrewes:</hi> sonnes that were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull to their parents were stoned to death: <hi>Phillip,</hi> King of Macedon branded with a marke that souldier that was vnthankefull; amongst the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans the bondman conuicted of his patron, was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed of the right of freedome. By the ciuill law, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations bestowed vpon vnthankefull persons, were reuersed.

            <p>For seeing the valew of a benefitte can scarsely be esteemed, and of an vncertaine thing the valuation is vncertaine, it is thought sufficient to punish him that is vnthankefull with the hatred of men, and to referre him vnto God the seuere reuenger. Let this action cease saith <hi>Seneca,</hi> because a good turne must be done without hope of recompence, for it is the debt of honestie. Which if it be true (as it is) if any man be called into iudgement for a benefit receiued,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:21640:129"/>

benefit vpon me; you turned the modesty of my wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes into confidence, my confidence into effect; and hauing yet receiued nothing, yet you expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; so that I cannot tell whether your bounty were greter in giuing, or your modesty in expecting: surely if I can perform nothing else, yet I will do this, that the benefit which exceedeth my ability to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite, by my thankfulnesse you shall euer haue cause to remember: although I know that I am more bound vnto you then I can speake; and because I haue nothing wherewith to giue thankes, I will onely wish and desire God to performe it for me. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee that speaketh thus, although he hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen any thing, yet he hath requited the benefit, when as often times hee that hath giuen much, yet hath done nothing, and is vnthankefull. For all the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a benefit (as we haue spoken before) is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto the minde: not vnto that which is either giuen or receiued, not to the vulgar estimation of men, which often-times misconstrueth things, nor to the profit either reaped or hoped for from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: and as we haue said that a benefit is one thing, and a debt an other, so here wee must distinguish the matter of thankes and reward, benefit and debt: of him who is a debter for a good turne, and of him who is debter for money lent, hereupon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that it is in euery mans owne power, how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull hee is, for as soone as thou shewest that thou hast gratefully receiued a benefit, thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited

it; study to be thankefull and thou art thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For as soone as sincerely thou hast but thought of requiting a benefit, thou hast requited it. Look at that which he looked at that gaue it, he that hath giuen a benefit hath filled both the sides of the lease; both of the layings out, and the receits. If thou returnest a benefit with the same mind that thou hast receiued it, thou art thankful, if thou needest none to put thee in mind, if thou be admonisht of thy owne conscience; thou hast obtained the praise of a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful person; thou hast adorned thy thanks with all the ornaments of beauty; last of all, thou shewest that thou art brought vp in the company of those most thankful graces; whose Trinity wise antiquity made to be the badge of a thankfull mind. The next step of a thankfull mind, is, that he which is so affected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form indeed that which he thus thinketh: to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that he ad al the means &amp; the indeuours that he can, and the greater &amp; more acceptable that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is which thou hast receiued, so much the more soone and more cheerefully seeke occasion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered take occasion to requite it; leaue nothing vnattempted to shew thy selfe thankfull, so let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man perswade himselfe, that as it was needfull to receiue the benefit, so it is no lesse needfull to requite it. In one word, whosoeuer thou art, feare God, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the iudgments of men, free thy self from those punishments which remain for vnthankfull persons, know that humanity is contained in the intercourse

of benefits, this being taken away, al right &amp; honesty is vtterly ouerthrown, as much as in thee lieth (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer thou art) defend and maintaine this whereof <hi>God, nature,</hi> and <hi>necessity</hi> is an author to thee.</p>
            <p>These paines Right Honorable I will inlarge no further, although I am not ignorant that much more might be spoken of it, which I know is performed of most learned &amp; most eloquent men, who before me haue trauailed with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendations in this argument, but as euery man followeth his own spirit, so I doubt not but I shall obtaine pardon of you, &amp; of all those into whose hands this labour shall come, if being content with these few things I cut of all other su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, intricate and by wayes; I know that those delight more, but in these which I haue vsed, there is more strength; peraduenture more authority and credit, and if any thing in this bee preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by mee, it is fit that hee that obserueth so much, should supply himselfe, out of those euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting fountaines both old and new, whilst we in the meane time doe meditate something of more worth.</p>
