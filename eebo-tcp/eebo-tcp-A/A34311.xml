         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THink it not ſtrange, if you perceive an alteration in me, from
my uſual method of prejudicary and modeſt expreſſions, both in
my ſpeaking and writeing. And though perhaps you may find more
paſſion, ſo you ſhall find more cauſe for it; and as much reaſon and
truth, nay more of the truth then ever yet I have publiſhed; which
becauſe it hath been abſconded and hid, from thoſe that are real Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of it, and owe allegiance and ſupremacy to it, and have earneſtly
deſired to know it, and I my ſelf bound by the ſame Allegiance to
declare it; though in the mid'ſt of trouble, yet to prevent farther
trouble, I thought good to trouble my ſelf once for all, that all and each
ſingle inquirer might not trouble me once. For this cauſe I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the truth it ſelf hath been Clonded by ſuch thick Miſts of ſome
perſons Imaginations, others Narrations, other wilful Additions,
other Jealouſies, others Suppoſitions, others Suſpitions, others Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions;
ſome being malitious, others captious, others Cenſorious,
others paraſitical, others mercenary, others biaſed by hopeing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a ſelf intereſt in her, or procure a ſatisfaction of their Luſtful
deſires of her, who is the cauſe of theſe reports. Others miſſed by a
ſoft and Candid Nature and eaſie Beleife, being won thereto by her
Charmeing tongue and Sycophantick ſtile: ſome wilfully blind, others
blind, yet wilful I ſay the truth, being gloſſed over and darkned by
ſuch varietyes of diſpoſitions, multitudes of Errors and forged (though
beleived) falſities hath made and juſtly to, the humour of paſſion moſt
prediminant, and my ſoul reſtleſs till the truth be known. And
though, there is no one ſo unfit to write as my ſelf at this time, ſo
there is none more fit to write the truth of ſome part of this then my
ſelf. I ſhould have thought my ſelf in Paradiſe had I not had this
laſt occaſion to write (which was the Judgment of Iudges that I
ſhould have a Wife; a Iudgment indeed to me) ſo I think my ſelf in
Purgatory that I have ſo ſad a ſubject to write on; but I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſteem my
ſelf moſt miſerable, when I foreſee how little my writing will doe
me good in removing the cauſe, of which ſad effects might follow, did
not my faith bridle my paſſion, and tell me my Maker hath a great
work in hand for me to do, otherwiſe I ſhould with <hi>St. Paul,</hi> not only
<pb facs="tcp:42671:3"/>
deſire to be diſſolved, but ere this might had exceeded that deſire, and
diſſolved my ſelf; but a mighty hand of Providence hath, and doth
guide and protect me, and leads me to holy <hi>David</hi> in his afflictions,
where he ſaith, <hi>It was good for him he was ſo.</hi> As yet my affliction
ſeems ſo great, that though I poſſeſs a being, I enjoy it not: and my
very Soul ſerves for no other end, but to make me ſenſible of my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and him that ſent it, and her that cauſed it. That you could but
Sympathize with me a while! or but ſee how grief like ſparkes in
Embers lay ſhrowded in my breaſt, which muſt flame out, leaſt it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
me. <hi>Strangulat incluſus dolor,</hi> Had you but ſeen me when I
wrote this, how the motions of my mind and of my body were ſo alike,
that there was no reſting place for either. That you could but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and read thus far as I wrote it, where every word <hi>Tulit punct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>—bears
a full ſtop. There is no Phyſick, no Grave, no Charm,
that can content and caſt the moleſtntion of my working Soul into a
dead ſleep. They that never knew the happineſs of ſetled thoughts,
and a privat, ſtudious, free, contemplative Life, think Troubles but
Paſtimes. But as it is a maxime in Law, <hi>Unumquodque diſſolvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
eo modo quo colligatur.</hi> So thus I will apply it,—That as a
mighty hand hath brought me into trouble: ſo the ſame hand is as
mighty ſtill to lead me out, and here I caſt Anchor: I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
better ſatisfied when I conſider this true ſaying,
<q>Eſtque pati paenam quam meruiſſe minus.</q>

               <pb facs="tcp:42671:3"/>
One part of whoſe various actions at ſome perſons entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and for the ſatisfaction of all inquiſitive Spectators, I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
ſet forth. My preſent diſcompoſedneſs makes me fearful
leaſt I may commit many Errors; If ſo, I am apt to beleive I may
be excuſed, and I hope every judicious perſon will impute it to the
ignorance of the Error, not an error of ignorance. I ſhall not relate
every circumſtance; for I ſhould give both, you and my ſelf too
much trouble; but as I affect brevity, ſo I greatly reſpect verity;
and as I intend to relate nothing but truth, ſo I will relate ſo much
of it as may be material, to let you ſee her deſigne; and every ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reader may ſuppoſe what additions ſhe made, and how politick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhe enlarged her ſelf in every action, and when the real truth is
known to all (which is already to ſome ſcores in and about the City of
<hi>London</hi>) I ſay, though it will not cure my Malady, it will eaſe my
mind; and though many may and do deſire to hide, yet they cannot
detract from verity. I heartily wiſh there were fewer writings and
more truths; and though I do not endeavour to force and extract a
beleife from any, who have not been acquainted with the truth, nor
my ſelf, yet (to what I ſhall relate of my own knowledge after my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with her) the greateſt atteſtation that a Chriſtian can
make, I will at the deſire of any perſon that ſcruples at the truth of
my relation, and in the face of the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
the Holy Bible, and will atteſt by that Almighty Power that
made me with Reverence to the Oath. I think now I have bound
my ſelf ſtrictly, and if this will not be ſufficient ſecurity to any, then
believe what you pleaſe; I ſhall but doe what my Allegiance to veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
commands me, And ſo with Chriſtian prayers for, and well wiſhes
to you all, I take my leave, preſuming to ſubſcribe my ſelf ſtill.</p>

enſuing relation: And I will bring her now from <hi>Graves-end</hi> to the
<hi>Seſſions-houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About a Month before laſt <hi>Eaſter,</hi> this <hi>Canterbury Walloon</hi> came
in a <hi>Graveſend</hi> Barge to <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> and amongſt other company
ſhe came up with a Parſon (for ſo his habit ſpake him) that ſat near
her, became acquainted with her, or ſhe with him; and as ſhe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to me, (for now Gentlemen I ſpeak but at ſecond hand, yet ſtill
I keep to my firſt Aſſertion, to write the truth, though it be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
relation, and this was hers to me and many others, ſince my
acquaintance) The Gentleman began to be familiar and ſportingly
to offer ſome uncivillity to her unblemiſhed Honour; as ſhe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it, for which preſumption, ſhe ſeemed much to check him. It
being early on a <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning when they landed, they went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a houſe at <hi>Billinſgate,</hi> that waites for the Cuſtom of Paſſengers
that come up with the morning Tide, to repoſe themſelves. The
Parſon offered to ſalute her, whom with great anger ſhe denyed,
telling him, That ſhe was never kiſſed by any man yet, and that in
her Country, If any man, eſpecially a Prieſt, ſhould be ſeen to ſpeak
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42671:5"/>
to, much more to ſalute a Gentlewoman, he might be ſure of a ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.
And for this misbehaviour of his, ſhe ſaid, ſhe conferred the Title of
<hi>Bawdy Prieſt</hi> on him. He out of his reſpects to her, I ſuppoſe, as a
ſtranger, ſtill offered his ſervice to wait on her to finde a lodging,
and would not be denyed: ſo between 5 and 6 of the clock, they
walked along the City, and aſſaulted many Tavern doores for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance,
but finding none open until they came to the <hi>Exchange
Taverne,</hi> where it happened the door was open to admit in ſome
Labourers to work, and there they entred; for the Parſon would
needs treat her with a Glaſſe of Wine, which they had, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of the houſe being up, They deſired his company, ſhe, as ſhe
ſaid, being willing to ſhift off the Parſon, told him, ſhe would ſtay
there till people were more ſtirring, and would leave word at that
houſe where ſhe would go. So after two or three pints he
paid and departed, with the hopes of finding her again, And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alone with the Gentleman of the houſe, the teares ſtanding in
her eyes, ſhe began to bewaile her ſelf. Mr <hi>King</hi> asked her the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?
She with Crocodile teares, and in a canting ſtile, began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
her Adventure: How ſhe was a Stranger, and Sr. ſaid ſhe,
I would willingly be private and unknown, and therefore beg you to
do me excuſe; Only this favour I entreat of you, to inform me of
a convenient Lodging, fit for a Gentlewoman, though a ſtranger.
The Gentleman replyed he knew of none at preſent, but wiſhed he
could ſerve her deſire; And after ſuch like diſcourſe, Madam, ſaid
he, I condole your condition, and if you pleaſe to accept for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of ſuch a one as I have, which ſometime hath been, and is in
ſome meaſure fit to entertain a perſon of quality upon an exigent, it
ſhall be &amp; is at your ſervice. She ſeemingly reflecting on her Honor,
in reſpect that the houſe was publick, earneſtly entreated his privacy,
for that would ſalve her honour; And with many thanks for ſo great
a courteſie accepted thereof very willingly, And Sr. ſaid ſhe, only
I deſire your concealement of what I ſhall relate to you, for you
ſeem to be a perſon of gravity, and of great civility to me; And that
you may not miſtruſt and diſeſteem of me, though I am unwilling as
yet to be known, but eſpecially by my own Declaration, yet I will
in brief inform you what I am, and my preſent condition, which is
thus, Sir, I am a Perſon of honour lately come out of <hi>Germany,</hi>
my Native Country, my Father was an Earl, my Mother dyed in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42671:5"/>
Chilbed with me, about three years after my Father dyed, and left
me to the tuition of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady, a Maiden, to be my Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
one of my Mothers Kindred that lived with her; And the
better to ſecure my perſon and Eſtate, ſhe out of her great love to
me went with me into a Monaſtery, for Protection, from whence I
came out about a year ſince, and have lived at mine own houſe. Our
Emperour and the holy Fathers were willing to force me to a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with an old Count, becauſe, having no Children, my Eſtate
might return to the Monaſtery; the profits thereof they received
for my maintenance there; and had I ſtaid a little longer it had been
compleated: and you may imagine Sir, how miſerable a Life I
ſhould have lead, in this unagreeable Marriage; For I am now but
nineteen or there abouts, and he was near fourſcore. So being in my
own Park that belongs to my houſe, my Governeſs came and told
me, I muſt then lay hold on an opportunity for my eſcape, if ever,
which I willingly conſented too and ſtayed no longer then to diſrobe
my ſelf, and put on this diſguiſe wherein you ſee me, (where by the
way I will ſet down what that was, an old black Velvet Waſtecoat,
and a Black Silk Petticoat, and black Hoods over her Face) And I
will ſpeak of one thing more while ſhe was relating this ſtory, I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her, why ſhe would have no attendance? She anſwered me, that
indeed ſhe had very many Pages and Lacquies, and ſeveral Maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Gentlewomen, but ſhe did not think it ſafe to take any
with her, leaſt they might diſcover her in her ſlight; But I took a
Page with me to bring my horſe back that I rod on near to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
where in a little time I took ſhipping.) I was, ſaid ſhe, laſt
<hi>Sunday</hi> morning in <hi>France,</hi> landed at <hi>Dover,</hi> rod Poſt to <hi>Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,</hi>
took the opportunity of the Barge that was coming off, where
I met with this Prieſt, who would needs wait on me, which I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at, for I was never in any mans company before I made my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventur.
And Sir, ſaid ſhe, If he cometh again to ask for me, let
me be denyed. And ſince I have related to you what I am, and that
you do not entertain a Beggar though a ſtranger, ſo I entreat your
ſecrecy; and whatever I ſhall preſume to call for, during my ſtay
here, though I have little Silver, yet I have that whereby I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
&amp; ſatisfy you. After ſuch like diſcourſe, ſhe retired her ſelf
to her Chamber, and lay on the Bed till about Dinner time; when
at her deſire, the Gentlewoman of the houſe (my ſiſter) went up to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42671:6"/>
give her a civil welcome, and to accompany her, whoſe acquaintance
ſhe having got, after ſome ſalutes paſt on either ſide, and ſome fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
begun on both ſides, ſhe related to her in her diſcourſes the
former ſtory, with more additions, and with the obligation of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
alſo. Thus privatly in her Chamber ſhe remained ſome time at
her work ſhe had procured, which ſhe would do quick and well,
which was to be expected from thoſe that come out of Nunneries:
Sometime at her ſeeming devotion. The afternoon of the ſame day,
the Parſon came again, and according to her order was denyed. The
next day they Tabled together, and ſhe deſired the Gentlewoman
of the houſe to be private, and alſo to honour her with the title of
Couſen, to prevent the miſtruſts and queſtions of ſuch perſons, as
might accidentally ſee her in her company. The Gentlewoman (my
ſiſter) hearing her propable well ſet Story and good Language, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
her to be as ſhe ſaid, and did much comiſerate her preſent
condition, and remained no leſſe compaſſionate for her ſorrow then
admired at her parts; and being of an excellent loving Nature, and
friendly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> curteous, diſpoſition, did much reſent her Adventure, and
gave her handſome entertainment, and conſented to her obliged ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy
and deſired Title.</p>
            <p>Here (<hi>Curteous Reader</hi>) you may ſee, how this Sycophant baited
her hook with ſeeming obliged ſecrecy. I ſuppoſe ſhe firſt intended
to catch the Gentleman of the houſe, to truſt her by degrees with
ſomething of good value, and ſo left him to look her: A trick ſhe
and her Agents have practiſed by ſlight of hand, very many times,
as you ſhall one day fully know, though not by my hand, yet by my
order.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Reader,</hi> I am come to relate what I am Ey-witneſs of, and
to begin my acquaintance with this Grand Impoſtor. After ſhe had
been two or three days at the aforeſaid houſe, my occaſions called
me that way, (not thinking to meet or ſee ſuch a perſon as this)
and after I had compleated my buſineſs, I called in at this houſe, to
give my Relations a viſit and repoſe my ſelf a while being ſomewhat
weary. When I came in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was informed there were ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
perſons of quality in the houſe, (who had dined there that day)
that had lately obliged me by ſome civilities, and I being alone did
imbrace their company, where I found the Gentleman of the houſe
and his wife, and this <hi>Canterbury German;</hi> that is, (a little to leave
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42671:6"/>
my Story) A ſhe Creature like a <hi>Spaniſh Jennet,</hi> got by the wind,
for ſhe knows nor owns no Father, <hi>Cui Pater eſt populus pater eſt
ſibi nullus et omnis, Cui Pater eſt populus non habet illa patrem.</hi> In
<hi>Engliſh</hi> a Baſtard, or, a <hi>German</hi> Soul tranſmigrated into the Body
of a <hi>Canterbury Fidlers</hi> Daughter: or a <hi>German</hi> Fiddle-ſtick, playd
upon a <hi>Canterbury</hi> Fiddle: or, the Sperm of a <hi>Germane</hi> Lord mixt
with, and evacuated into an Ale-Tub, and drank up by a <hi>Canterbury</hi>
Hoſtes, of which came this Prodigious Excreſcens, or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will
not be tedious, this two-legged Monſter then) a pretended <hi>German
Lady,</hi> was amongſt the aforeſaid company, who, at my entring the
room and making towards the company, as it was obſerved, and ſhe
her ſelf hath many times declared, did very much eye me; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I came near her, I was ſtopt ſometime with the ſalutes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
of the Gentlemen my friends, who ſingly accoſted me. In
this time ſhe asked the Gentlewoman of the houſe who I was? She
reſolved her, I was her Brother, which anſwer did not ſatisfie her;
For, as ſhe hath declared ſundry times to very many perſons, who as
I ſaid before will ſubſcribe, at that inſtant, ſhe was poſſeſſed with a
ſtrange kind of an affectionate paſſion, and ſuddainly ſurprized by
Love; and as ſhe expreſſed it, her blood boyld within her, in ſuch
a ſtrange manner, ſhe knew not what ſhe ailed. By this time it came
to my turn to ſalute her, which done, We began to enterchange
friendly Glaſſes for about an hour. My Friends and my Self were
then about to take our leave, occaſions calling us away; but my Siſter
being deſired by her to detain me, would not permit me to go: So
taking my leave of the Gentlemen <hi>I</hi> remained there. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
of the houſe and ſhe entertained ſome Female diſcourſes of
Faſhions, and <hi>I</hi> was ordering my buſineſs in my mind, and ſat fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
Sr. <hi>Nicots</hi> Herbe; and though my eyes were on them, my
mind was remote. But being unwilling to come under the notion of
a Clown, ſhe ſeeming by her broaken Langnage to be a Stranger, <hi>I</hi>
did now and then paſſe a Complement with a Glaſſe of Wine to her,
which ſhe did as often return to me. <hi>I</hi> then little thought of a
Wife; for my mind being intent on a conſiderable buſineſs, which <hi>I</hi>
was engaged to do in the behalf of a friend, I was not ſo active in my
expreſſions, and curteous in my actions and behaviour to her, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſtranger both to me, and as ſhe ſeemed to the Country too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Nor did I then know more of her, then by diſcourſe I underſtood
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42671:7"/>
ſhe had been a <hi>Nun;</hi> ſhe had ſtrange careleſs and modeſt glances
on me with her eyes, and I am ſure mine were more careleſs then
hers could be, for it never once paſt my thoughts to be expoſed to
her.</p>
            <p>After a conſiderable ſtay, and the dark had overſhadowed the
world, I was willing to depart, but ſtill her oblidgeings detained me.
And amongſt other diſcourſes, we began to ſpeak of an excellent
Play next day to be Acted, ſhe preſently deſired to ſee this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
mode in Acting, and procured a promiſe from me to accompany
her and another Gentleman, which I had kept and performed the
next day, had not the urgency of my occaſions preſſed me to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of no delay. After the revolution of 2 or 3 dayes, I was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
by my occaſions that way againe, and being in the Houſe, ſhe
came and check'd me for non-performance of my promiſe, telling
me what a great degradation in point of Gentility it is in her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and Drollingly put a name on me, which name with the title of
(<hi>My</hi>) before it, ſhe often called me. Still ſhe would act and
ſpeak ſo modeſtly and majeſtickly as could be expected, to maintain
and make her pretences ſeem real, and ſhe uſed good language,
though in a broken tone, ever relating of ſublime honourable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and when ſhe was put to a dilema in her diſcourſe, ſhe would
ſeem to be ſo angry with her ſelf, becauſe ſhe could not expreſs her
ſelf in our tongue to that highth as ſhe would; and indeed I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſhe could ſpeak Engliſh ſo well, and I would ask her how ſhe
came to learn it, ſhe anſwered, that her <hi>Governeſs being an Engliſh
Lady, ſhe would ſpeak Engliſh to her, and diſcourſe and write in no
other tongue on purpoſe to be perfect in it,</hi> for ſaid ſhe, <hi>It is a great
piece of Honour for Perſons of Quality in our Country to ſpeak many
Tongues, and I over fancied to learn Engliſh more then any other,
though I can ſpeak ſeveral tongues.</hi> Thus would ſhe anſwer all
objections as readily as you could ask her; and ſhe when ſhe was
with me, would commonly fall into a ſuddain exclamation, ſaying,
<hi>me thinks it is ſo ſtrange to me to be in a mans Company; what ſhould
I be thought of and eſteemed, and what would you be done to Sir, ſhould
I be ſeen to ſit with you thus in our Country; It is a great freedome
that the Engliſh Ladies have, yet I could not do it, but that I ſee you
are a very civil perſon,</hi> and ſuch like ſmoothing ſayings ſhe would
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to me, yet ſeeming loving but careleſs; which becauſe I was not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42671:7"/>
forward, but as careleſs as her ſelf, though I then perceived her parts,
yet not knowing what ſhe was, I ſeemed to mind nothing of her;
till upon a third opportunity ſhe had of ſeeing me, I was pretty
jocoſe with her, and being left alone awhile, ſhe began to break her
mind to me at a diſtance, and then came nearer, that I might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
her fancy, which I did, and ſtood ſuſpended at her ſpeech; and
after ſome ſerious, yet amarous expreſſions, ſhe related to me the
full ſtory (which till then I knew not) of her great Adventure; It
ſeemed to me to be a pretty Romance. ſhe declared to me the
cauſe why, the manner how, and a fuller Relation then I have inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before, and ſo went on in her diſcourſe, ever now and then call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to mind Gods mercy to her in preſerving her, though ſhe ſaid,
ſhe was ſo reſolved that ſhe had rather the Sea had been her Grave,
then to be confined to the embraces of the old Count. I could do
no leſs then applaud her Adventures and noble reſolution, though
all my ſences were even converted into eyes and eares, being plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſo great an extacie.</p>
            <p>Thus ſhe went on, ſtill interweaving with her diſcourſe ſuch kind
of holy expreſſions and Religious ſayings (the better to ground a
beleife in me) ſometimes acting the part of a Saint, for in that ſhe
imitated the Devils craft; when he means to deceive one that is
vigilent and careful, he tranſlates himſelf into an Angel of Light, and
laying before on ſome apparent ſeeming goods, at laſt brings his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to paſs, and ſometimes of a perſon of great quality in a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
diſcontent.</p>
            <p>And when ſhe ſpoke of the Lord, her pretended Father, (by
name as ſhe told me, <hi>Iohn de Wallway,</hi> Earle of <hi>Roſcia</hi> in or near
<hi>Colonia</hi>) and her Lady Mother, ſhe would offer a kind of devotion to
their Shrine; and then she would ſeem to cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>b her ſelf when she told
me of her great Birth and Fortune, becauſe she was ſo much her own
Trumpet, and might be thought to brag of what God had made her
and gave her, a thing ſaith she below my Honour, but I ſee you are
ſo much a Gentleman you will ſcorne to betray me, or have any
hard cenſure of me, and knowing your Gentility will oblidge you to
ſecrecy, I preſume to be free with you, for noble ſouls cannot act
baſely; For (ſaid she) should it be known at this Court that I were
in <hi>England,</hi> and alſo where I was, I am ſure his Royal Majeſty
(Pardon (My Leige) him whoſe ſaithful heart and hand like a true
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42671:8"/>
Subjects are always ready armed, and ſo shall continue as long as it
shall pleaſe Heaven to lend me breath) to show their allegiance to
their Soveraigne, and the humble deſire they have to be employed
in your Majeſtyes Royal Service) who is allied to me, by my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſide, would quickly ſend for me. His Majeſty was in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
with me when he came to ſee the Princes <hi>Lenitia,</hi> who was
in the ſame Monaſtery, and their Highneſſes the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> and
<hi>Gloceſter</hi> were with him there, after they came from the French
Court and were entertained by our Emperour; and ſaid she, as
ſoon as my Attendance come over, that I may goe as my ſelf and
his Relation, I shall give his Majeſty a Viſit and kiſs his hand.
Should his Majeſty ſee me in this Diſguiſe, I am ſure he would know
me; for when he was in the Monaſtery (as Princes have that liberty
to come in) his Majeſty called theſe Moles or Warts (which are 3
over and 3 under her right eye) <hi>Charles his Waine,</hi> and theſe ſpots
on my hand, his Highneſs the Noble Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> made himſelf.
Nay further ſtill, this pretended <hi>Germane</hi> Lady, had in her pocket
a Paſs as she called it, for her Steward, written in French, which she
ſaid his Majeſty Signed and Sealed at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and ſeveral Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that ſaw it, ſaid it was his Majeſtys Hand and Seal; (But this
when we ſearcht for it at the Juſtices, when she was apprehended,
could not be found, for I beleive she burnt it the night she burnt
thoſe Counterfeit Letters, that were by her order ſent her, which
was the night we diſcovered her, as you shall hereafter read.) And
ſaid she, I know our Emperour will ſend to this Court, but firſt he
will ſend to the French Court, and by that time I hope to have all
things over and ſecured here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Curteous Ladyes and Gentlemen,</hi> Imagine what you should had
thought, had you been in my place and Condition; had you heard
her ſpeak this, ſeen her deportment, and had accompanyed her ſo
much as I did, and obſerved all her probable ſtoryes and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
which I do but abridge and contract here, and to have found
her ſo ingenious a Woman (as indeed she is, <hi>to give the Divel his
Due</hi>) and were she honeſt, she were excellent; but having loſt that
she is (truly I cannot tell what, I will not call her Woman, becauſe
I will not diſgrace her <hi>Sex</hi>) a meer shape only? It is true, an Army
of jealouſies did aſſault my breaſt, and entered, ſome I ſent forth by
my objections to her, which she preſently ſtruck dead. For the next
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42671:8"/>
ſentence she ſpake, she would meet my objections above half way
with ſo ready an anſwer, and reply without the leaſt pauſing, being
ready charged, and as readily preſented, which made the other ſpyes
fear to goe forth. Indeed as there is no man that hath the leaſt
ſparke of Honour in his breaſt, but would had beleived ſuch ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
probable, noble acted, ſerious and religious pretended truth,
ſo there is no perſon that hath the leaſt ſpark of Wiſdome, but would
make ſome miſtruſtful queries: And I dare affirme it, that when I
was abſent from her, I made as many as any man could, and when
preſent, I objected to her as many as I could in point of Honour. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the thing a while but to be real, that after she had broach'd her
mind to me, how much she loved me, which did daily ſeem to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
alſo, and notwithſtanding I objected my inequality of Birth &amp;
Fortune, the laſt whereof I atteſted was not as yet a younger Brothers
Portion, though a younger Brother &amp; denyed that it was fit to carry
ſingle, which was the moſt; (a Circumſtance I thought material to
try her fancy) yet ſtill ſhe vowed to like me the better, and that ſhe
did neither deſire nor look for any thing of me, not with me, but
only my love, and I thought ſhe did really deſerve that; but if I
pleaſed I might diſpoſe of all I had; for God (ſaid ſhe) hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
a ſufficient and a plentiful Eſtate on me, which with my ſelf <hi>I</hi>
freely offer and give to you Sir. Such Nobility had ſhe but acted
with reality (which then was thought ſo, and not without juſt
grounds) could not but force and attract a love and likeing
from a ſtone if poſſible, and indeed I made ſome ſcruple of
danger by reaſon of her birth and pretended great, yet near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
And alſo I asked her why she would condiſcend to incline
her affection to ſo (then ſeeming) unequal marriage; ſhe did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that whatſoever my Fortune was, was not material in a noble
breaſt, neither did it compleat a Gentleman; but ſaid ſhe, Nature
hath dealt very liberally and bountifully by you, both in your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and parts, on which I ſet my affections, I can ſupply Fortune.
And ſaid ſhe, I am not the firſt as we daily ſee, when affection hath
induced to make choice of a Conſort far underneath and below the
ſphere where you move, nay thoſe that move in a higher Orbe then
my ſelf, and then would ſhe bring in an example, and I did ſenſibly
imagine, (had her pretences been real) that I ſhould create no
new Cuſtome, or commit any error to embrace the ſmiles of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42671:9"/>
but did and ſhould rather impute it to a great hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
whoſe hand is as great and good ſtill as ever, and truly ſhe
ſaid ſuch things as I knew not how it was poſſible that untruth
ſhould have the ability to faine things reſembling ſo much in ſhew
truth it ſelf, and I am confident her ſeeming excellent parts, variety
of tongues, ſweet diſpoſition, and indifferent comely feature, noble
preſence and modeſt carriage, accompanyed with ſo many proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and arguments of unfained and real high affection, and then ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great trouble at her ſpirits, and amorous words were able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
and enthral any other heart, though as free and careful as mine.
And indeed ſhe fained excuſes ſo plauſeable, that I being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered,
either by my nature, will, or affection, admitted them for
being reaſonable, many queryes my Jealouſie would ſummon up and
object to her: And in anſwering one, ſhe would traverſe over ſo
much, and ſuch a ſeeming real ſtory, that ſhe would ſatisfie me in
very many points, that my private ſuſpitions thought to propoſe to
her; by which freeneſs of hers to declare her ſelf, ſhe not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
of me a greater beleife to what ſhe ſaid, but alſo gave me a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inſight to her good language and parts, and likewiſe to her
paſſionate love ſhe then ſeemed to have for and towards me, all
which diſcourſes ſhe would commonly conclude, with my ſelf by
ſaying, <hi>All this I freely offer to thee my Dear, and all theſe ſufferings
are nothing conſidering God hath provided ſuch a bleſſing for me as
thy ſelf,</hi> and ſuch like concluſions, whoſe Amen was commonly an
Embrace, or a (Lime Twigge) Kiſs, with a Hymn of Thanks-giving
to Providence. Her freeneſs in relateing, did much pleaſe me, for
this reaſon, becauſe it did ſtop all ſtrict inquiſition, which in point of
Honour I could not make to her, that ſeemed ſo free; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
I told her my Fortune was altogether unequal and unfit to
ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y double, and alſo only <hi>ſecundum voluntatem Domini,</hi> as I may
ſo ſay, but yet my fearful mind would make a multitude of private
queſtions, ſome open ones, which when I had opportunity I would
fetch over at a diſtance, by a Similitude or a Romance of ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
adventure, or ſome ſuch ſtory; and I doe not deny, but declare
that her freeneſs in acting ſo nobly pleaſed me, becauſe ſhe ſo freely
offered that then ſeeming noble offering, her ſelf, (whom indeed I
thought then a rate preſent, and ſhould think ſo ſtill, were she but
honeſt, which greives me she is not:) and alſo the free offer of her
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42671:9"/>
ſeeming Fortune, which I Vow to all the world I eſteemed of as
nothing (had it been real) compared with her, if honeſt; for as to
fortune my deſires are limitted, and if they do exceed, it is rather
to contemplate the beauty of Heaven, then the pleaſures of Earth,
ſteps whereby the ſoul Travels towards its firſt dwelling: For as I
told her, I deſired her to Licence my Fortunes to roul in their own
Sphere; and it was thought I was of years ſufficient though under
age to make an election of my ſtate it ſelf, and I proteſt I never did
look at what she ſpake as to that, any further then a bleſſing and
comfortable help, to eaſe the trouble &amp; defray the growing charges
of a Matryed Life; and to maintain Love, which like a fire without
fuel would grow cold in ſome, as is too commonly ſeen, though I
dare ſpeak it, and I make no doubt, my love without it should had
n'ere gone out; for I here ſolemnly atteſt, I could rather drive a
Plow, or dig and delve for one that <hi>I</hi> Love, (as I did her) though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but her parts took my fancy, then to live a Princes life and be
forced to enjoy one that I cannot fancy,</p>
            <l>For I am too effeminate; a tear</l>
            <l>From one I love, goes deeper then a ſpeare:</l>
            <l>Nay when I thought her mine, if ſhe were ill,</l>
            <l>Love ſympathiz'd ſo much, I was not well.</l>
            <l>My love was ſo much, that I dare not think</l>
            <l>of ſome things paſt then, but my heart doth ſink:</l>
            <l>But that I know ſhee's falſe, I elſe ſhould ſwear</l>

which book she Courts the world to beleive that she is a great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
or well read in the ſayings of both ancient and moderne
Philoſophers and Divines: Which acquaintance of hers with them,
as I do not at all beleive, but utterly deny, ſo I do not indeavour
to tye up any one to my opinion herein. The firſt Philoſopher she
(or ſome one for her) names, is <hi>Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Cinick,</hi> who had he
lived now, would have aſcribed to her, her juſt title, and ſtiled her
(what she really is) a Viper, The opinion and <hi>Theſis</hi> she firſt inſerts,
from her or ſome others collection, is this, that detraction is the
cheife branch of envy, which is nourished by lying, by which people
of honeſt converſation, are grievouſly wounded. The laſt clauſe
we have ſuffered, as the world is ſenſible of, the former she hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performed; and I truly think, that if she should live till she
ſpeaks and writes nothing but truth, she would never dye. As to
her Converſation it is well known to ſome hundreds in this Nation,
how dishoneſt it hath been even from her Infancy, to the ruine of
many perſons and Families almoſt, <hi>Quo ſemel eſt imbuta recens ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vabit
odorem orta.</hi> Indeed there is none can wonder that she writes
ſuch a multitude of falſityes in plain Engliſh horrible lyes, for should
she write the truth of her actions, nay of any one act (which act of
hers as to my ſelf, I will declare for her) she would then quite shame
her ſelf for ever, which in a little time if she hath any shame in her,
will be done nevertheleſs. Read the fourth page of her book in her
Epiſtle, where she blames me for not affording her a civil defence
(though this is only to blind the world, and make them beleive <hi>I</hi> had
permitted her to be uncivilly dealt by, when as I Vow to Heaven
there was no ſuch thing) in regard she ſaith I had ſo lately enjoyed
<hi>Hymens</hi> rites with her, would the Divel had had his right, then <hi>I</hi>
should not have been troubled with ſuch a crafty Strumpet; But he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42671:10"/>
may take it now, there's fleſh and bones enough for him to pick, it
is his own and ſhe will hardly cheat him, he will have his own, <hi>aut
ſerius aut citius.</hi> And in the ſame page ſhe commends the prudence
of our Anceſtors, in inſituting ſeveral Orders of Knights to defend
innocent Ladies; and ſhe ſaith, <hi>that ſhe never read of any Knight
that undertook a diſtreſſed Ladies quarrel but he overcame,</hi> and then
brings in an example or two. It makes me ſmile methinks to ſee,
how cunningly her guilt ſeeks to be protected by ſome of the Dub'd
ſouls of this age, whom at one and the ſame time ſhe Courts and
applauds at a diſtance to contiuue their protection to her ſtill. I ſay
how finely ſhe wyre-draws theſe <hi>Dons</hi> to defend her impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
under the notion of innocency. A favour ſhe hath already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of ſome Quixots, or perhaps ere this ſhe might have had her
expreſſed not intended choice, and have been diſſolved into Atoms
for her juſt deſerts, which ſhe acknowledges, only ſhe ſaith in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
page, <hi>That ſhe was inſufficiently proſecuted;</hi> which becauſe
we were not ſo rigid as we might, being well adviſed, as you ſhall
hereafter hear, or as it hath happened rather ill advized, it was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
evidence againſt her to diſanul my Marriage, had there been
leſs witneſs then was produced, which by the Oath of the Witneſſe
that ſwore was void, <hi>ipſo facto.</hi> I will not ſpeak all I know as to
her practiſes therein, as to this matter, for it is paſt, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this, the world will ſhortly find enow that will know her
and will ſpeak their mind. Did you but hear the curſes and exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of ſo great a number that know her and her actions, ſome
whereof she hath abuſed highly, as the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
will produce, who would think it no ſin to ſtone her to death
for the wrong she hath done, and would at any time travel a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

and how disjoynted her ſtory hangs, which fained &amp; curſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of hers (for ſhe owns it and it is like her) Do but compare it
with the truth it ſelf, which by all my aforeſaid aſſerations you

               </gap>, and you
will finde her juſtly Guilty, which by Juſtice it ſelf ſhe is; For here
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42671:11"/>
every word and ſentence ſhall carry ſo much, and ſuch undeniable
and well known truth, both to her ſelf, and many others to whom
this Books relation will be no news; That <hi>I</hi> ſay every ſentence ſhall
bring her in Guilty in the great and juſt Court of Conſcience,
though ſhe ſeems by her great and damnable ſtock of impudence to
allow of no ſuch Court of Equity and Chamber of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Read the ſixth page of her Book, where you ſhall finde ſome mite
witted pedantick Coxcomb hath collected for her, the opinion and
great reſpects ſeveral Philoſophers and Nations have had to that
great Virtue called <hi>Truth:</hi> and you ſhall ſee the diſreſpects he or
ſhe hath for it; For they do not deſire to tell you the truth, only
what Truth is in the eye of the vertuous. She ſaith <hi>ſhe will obſerve
its Precepts in her diſcourſe;</hi> but ſhe doth not nor dare, not dare
not promiſe you to practiſe it, ſo cunningly ſhe goes on that a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory
eye ſhall not finde out her double meaning. <hi>I</hi> will not ſingly
object here againſt her writing, but in my relation <hi>I</hi> ſhall fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
the truth of her, and her politick and printed lyes. <hi>I</hi> will
ſpeak but to one thing more particularly, (though <hi>I</hi> am unwilling to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e) that is this, In the twelfth page of her Book ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts
a Letter as if it ſhould come from me, and <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſend to
the <hi>Gate-houſe</hi> to her, which ſhe ſaith <hi>She will keep as a Relict.</hi> To
this <hi>I</hi> anſwer, by all my aforeſaid atteſtations or what more any one
will, <hi>I</hi> never wrote or cauſed to be wrote, ſent or cauſed to be ſent,
or knew of any ſuch Letter till <hi>I</hi> ſaw ſuch a thing in her Book. Nay
further, <hi>I</hi> was at that time and as on the day of the date of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
letter in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> at the houſe of one that calls her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Law, by name <hi>Richard Foud</hi> a Fidler &amp; Alehouſe-keeper, where <hi>I</hi>
ſaw her own Mother and brethren, as he acknowledged to us. And
though ſhe in the fifth page of her book, is ſo curſedly impudent
(though here rather but cunningly wondring at) as to ſeem to deny
my former Relation as to her Father, in my late printed ſheet,
which is to the aforeſaid purpoſe of his acknowledging her; yet I ſay,
here ſhe craftily uſeth theſe words by way of admiration, ſaying, <hi>It
is ſtrange this Father of mine could not be produced at my Tryal, if
it had been true.</hi> Thus doth this politick Devil by her muſical ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
cheat the World, eſpecially the ignorant ſtill. For what need
had we to have her Father up, and being her Knaviſh <hi>Agent</hi> what
good would he do? Such a Michanick fellow as he is, a little thing
might have perhaps made him ſay any thing. Nay further, as to a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42671:11"/>
Letter, <hi>I</hi> never ſent her one in my Life; but one time before mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and after great acquaintance, and <hi>I</hi> think contraction, She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
me, <hi>If I could not come to her once a day to ſend her a Letter
how I did, that ſhe might underſtand my health, and do her reſpects
to my hand when ſhe had not my perſon preſent, which would give her
much comfort, to read my words when ſhe could not hear me ſpeak
them,</hi> and ſuch like amorous diſcourſes and reaſons ſhe alleadged to
me. And remembring her deſire I wrot one once, but being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of the Ceremonies of a <hi>Nunnery,</hi> which ſhe willingly did, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
alſo ſome paſſages and accidents whilſt ſhe was there, and the
Ceremonies they uſe in conſecrating a <hi>Nun.</hi> And amongſt other
relations, ſhe brought into diſcourſe the cauſe why, and the manner
how the Princeſs <hi>Lewitia</hi> came to the Monaſtery, (wherein ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
ſhe was which was the ſtrict order of St. <hi>Clare,</hi> relating the
manner of her knocking at the Gate, and how attended, and how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the <hi>Lady Abbes,</hi> and of the ſtately Robes that every Nun
at Conſecration is adorned with: and how they diſ-robe themſelves
and offer their rich attire at the high Altar, and then they ſlip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
a hanging and put on a hair ſhift as Nuns weare; And during
the time of this Ceremony, what rare Antheams are Sung, and then
how and where they diſpoſe and put the Riches and Jewels they
bring in with them: How often they go to Chappel in a day and
night, and how little time they reſt at night in their ſtone Cells.
And ſaid she, <hi>into this Order none but great Perſons and Heireſſes are
received ſome for Protection, ſome upon diſcontent will go in and be
Conſecrated,</hi> and many ſuch like diſcourſes, <hi>how a handſome young
Lady</hi> (whilſt she was there) <hi>made her eſcape through a narrow ſinck.</hi>
Thus would she go on, and expreſs her ſelf with a great ſeeming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,

was a ſigh) <hi>that I would marry a private civil Gentleman, and a

and nobly, until the world (which cut my very ſoul aſunder) proved
her dishoneſt, though she will not ſeem to acknowledg it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>I</hi> cannot blame her, to hide that which would quite shame her.
Nay upon her diſcovery, Witneſs many perſons and actions, <hi>I</hi> could
not but love her and beleive her till ſo many atteſted it, that they
caſt my ſoul into a trance, yet <hi>I</hi> did civilly by her; But in regard it

God hath ſent me a mighty bleſſing, <hi>Mine Heartchie, Mine ſcape,

Me thinks I ſee her paſſages, and by all that is true, I can
hardly goe any further, and ſcarce dare to think her falſe, but that
her detracting prints her abſence from me, and mine from my ſelf,
as I may properly ſay, and ſuch like occurrences makes me remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the cauſe, and the late falſe reports commands me to go on and
ſpeak the truth which as yet I have, and have put in as good ſecurity
for that which enſues; that is, what I relate before my acquaintance
is as ſhe told me; that I declare ſince, I do atteſt to, and though I
cannot remember, neither do I promiſe to ſet down every word ſhe

expreſs, that ſhe haveing begun ſuch a deſigne, and pretending to be
ſuch a perſon, how cunningly ſhe gloſſed over her Romantick ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
and pretences with great zeal as comeing from a Nunnery, a
handſome and noble deportment as a perſon of quality, and good
language as being well breed; all which are but ſuitable, and to be
expected to make her ſelf out, had ſhe been what ſhe pretended and
repreſented her ſelf to be, which ſeeming reality did in a growing
familiarity and acquaintance encreaſe mine and many wiſe perſons
beleife. But I will not tyre your patience Gentle Reader, and
therefore will forbear to relate the ſeveral further (though material)
plots and ſtratagems ſhe uſed to undermine me, and to diſcipate my
jealouſies, and extract a credit: How upon her firſt comeing to the
Exchange Tavern, ſhe ſent Letters by the poſt to <hi>Germany,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an anſwer was returned, and while her deſign was going on,
how ſhe ſet her Agents ac work to give out at ſome publique places,
where ſhe knew and had heard me ſpeak of in diſcourſe (but ſeeming
to take no notice) I had familiar acquaintance, and often frequented
in and about <hi>London,</hi> what gratuity ſhould be given to any one that
could make a diſcovery of a <hi>German Lady</hi> of great Quality and
Fortune, which was a 100 <hi>l.</hi> and alſo her obligations ſhe laid upon
me, under pretence of a paſſionate Love, whereby ſhe deſired
and commanded me daily to be with her, that her ſoul might find reſt:
And when I did viſit her, how neatly ſhe would relate to me the

dreams of the laſt night, and the unquietneſs ſhe had in her bed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſo amarous, that ſhe imagined she embraced me, ſometimes fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that she thought I was ſick, with ſuch like amplifications. And then
how earneſtly she deſired to enjoy my company alone, to take the Aire
in a Coach, or by Water, which we often did; and then she would ſo
bait my fancy by her many and high expreſſions of Love to me, and care
of and for me, and ſuch like Love paſſages. And after ſuch paſtime, when
we returned to her Lodging, how unwillingly she was to let me depart,
being angry with the Night that it grew on ſo faſt. And then to ſee
how melancholly she would ſit down, and ſeem to bewaile her preſent
unſetledneſs, and the abſence of her Dear Governeſs, which name com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
produced a ſigh or a tear, to whom she ſaid <hi>ſhe was for ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidged
to ſhow Love and reſpect, not ſo much for Relation ſake, as for her
great Love, in leaving all the world, and her many noble proffers of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to go into the Monaſtery with her.</hi> And thus for about three weeks
did she linck my fancy to her. And here I think good to ſpeak to one
moſt untrue (yet politick) Relation she w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ites concerning me. <hi>That I
ſhould pretend to be a Lord, and Courted her in a great Aequipage,</hi> I
ſuppoſe she hath a double meaning in it, and shows how she acted her
part, only she puts my name to it <hi>Mutato Nomine De te, fabula Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur:</hi>
Change but her name and title, and she means and ſpeaks of her
ſelf, for by all my aforeſaid aſſeverations I never aſſumed any other title,
or ſet my ſelf in a higher rank then Providence had placed me in, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did <hi>I</hi> alter my Habit any otherwiſe then <hi>I</hi> uſed to go in which
was commonly black, decent, and civil enough I am ſure, nay ſomthing
unfit to Court a Miſtriſs; but my Habit was pleaſing enough to me, for
I neither had a deſire nor a deſign to Court any one, though I was Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by her: But <hi>I</hi> never had any great reſpect to a Habit, whereby to
make any diſtinction of dayes, times, or place, which all that know me
can juſtifie; and therefore <hi>I</hi> will not ſtick here. This is but like the
reſt; Who can expect that she should write any thing but prodigious
and execrable falſifies, for she hath no truth in the leaſt to be a plea for
her ſelf, but <hi>I</hi> will haſten and will ship many Circumſtances and well
baited hooks, and turn over many leaves at once, becauſe <hi>I</hi> will not be
tedious, and will relate 2 or 3 paſſages more before <hi>I</hi> come to enter the
ſacrid Liſts of Matrimony with this Saint-like Divel, with whom my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
was above three Weeks before <hi>I</hi> was married to her; for as
<hi>I</hi> told her in ſuch weighty affaires, as to conſent to marry, eſpecially
with a ſtrange or mature deliberation was very requiſite, and not to run
poſt haſt to hazzard ones welfare, But she being ſo highly in love with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42671:14"/>
me as ſhe pretended by her expreſſions, how little reſt her ſoul had in
my abſence, and what raptures of joy and delight in my preſence, and ſo
earneſtly ſolliciting and praying mine integrity, though acquainted with
my quality, huſted me forward to that too late repented action of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony;
for in Love adventures, none are accompliſhed with more
facility and brevity then that which is favoured by the Womans deſire,
and pricked on by her Prayers and teares. About a week before Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
we were contracted, for though ſhe wiſhed her ſelf mine, yet ſhe
would not Marry until <hi>Lent</hi> was out, for her Religion would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that, and till ſhe could demonſtrate her ſelf more by her actions, and
that ſhe had either a return of her Letters to ſee how things ſtood, or
that her Governeſs and her Goods and Moneys were come over which
might ſooneſt happen ſhe could not tell, but ſhe expected all in <hi>Eaſter</hi>
week at the furtheſt. And here I will relate one paſſage that preſently
after Contraction ſhe damnably acted, which was this; She did but
riſe and ſit down in a Couch, and inſtantly ſhe fell into a ſtrange ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fit: (Which trick, many that know her in <hi>London,</hi> ſay, was a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and uſual Cuſtome with her to do when ſhe pleaſed, and they ſay, the
firſt time as ſhe did ever ſo, was when for ſome of her former cheating
actions ſhe was whipt about the ſtreets, and <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe to prevent the
ſtripes ſhe counterfeited that fit) in which ſtrange fit then as it ſeemed
to me, ſhe remained a good while: the Gentleman that was with me,
well underſtanding Phyſick, fought and gave her ſomewhat to drink in a
glaſs, which being put to her mouth, ſhe bit a piece off; that doing her
no good, he went down (leaving me to hold her, which was as much,
nay more then <hi>I</hi> could well do from falling on the floare) to fetch ſome
feathers to burn under her, which being burnt, and ſhe not coming to
her ſelf, he went for more, ſhe ſtrove hard with me in his abſence, ſhe
being ſtill in her fit, though beginning to come to her ſelf, ſhe earneſtly
cryed out <hi>Where is my Governeſs, where is my Woman,</hi> at which time the
Gentlewoman of the Houſe where we were came up into the Room, <hi>I</hi>
ſaid she is here, and opening her eyes, she ſtared at her, but could not, or
would not ſpeak as yet; thus did this Divel incarnate ſtill Counterfeit.
When she was well, a Coach waiting at the door, we rode further to take
the Aire; <hi>I</hi> asked her the reaſon of this Fit, she replyed <hi>ſhe could not tell,</hi>
but thinking what she had done, ſtruck a ſuddain paſſion in her, for ſaid
she, <hi>I</hi> never had any before.</p>
            <p>Sometime after this, and about 3 dayes before my (not then ſo ſoon

each ſide, they fell into diſcourſe; ſhe called her Mother, for ſaid ſhe,
<hi>Nothing but Death ſhall part my Dear and I,</hi> pointing to me: My Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wondring at her affectionate paſſage, asked her the Reaſon of her
fancy to me, of ſo unequal and ſmall Fortune: She replyed <hi>mine is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient;</hi>
you may ſuppoſe Reader I abridge every paſſage. She having
heard of ſome miſtruſts my friends had made and given out, began to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
the Caſe the better to ſatisfie and procure a Credit in my Mother:
For ſaid ſhe, <hi>had I a deſign to Cheat, I ſhould had ſored very high;</hi> my
Mother then replyed, that none were ignorant, that a Marryed life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a plentiful Eſtate was very uncomfortable; <hi>Mother</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>it is
very certain; do you think I am a Iew, a Turk, a Heathen</hi> (theſe were
her words) <hi>that I ſhould think of, much more do ſuch a thing as go about
to enſuare any Gentleman; I would not for a World be found in an untruth,
for what I ſay, is as true as Heaven.</hi> Ah Curſed <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> thus did ſhe
endeavour to ſatisfie her in all her objections, who thought it not a piece
of civility to object further, and was for the preſent ſatisfied from then
further objecting, yet could not be free from miſtruſts when abſent,
and out of her Motherly love &amp; care to me, would ſtill put in a Cave, and
bid me take heed, which I then thought needed not; for I would ſay, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
any one would, that ſhe could not be falſe, ſo much I beleived her:
To be ſhort, the next day being <hi>Good Friday,</hi> ſhe came with me againe
to deſire my Mothers Company to take the Aire, and then ſhe did ſee
that Learned, Judicious and Worthy ancient Gentleman my Father, whom
ſhe after ſalutes paſt termed ſo alſo, and in diſcourſe relared to him,
(he objecting as my Mother did) her great affection to me even from
the firſt minute ſhe ſaw me, and ſhe was ſo free in declaring every thing
to them both, that they did not, nor needed not to ask much, and from
that time (they to whom I owe the duty of a Son, which could I double,
they do nobly deſerve) had a very good opinion of her parts, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
they did acknowledg claimed high; as to the other, they could but
hope the beſt; and by my ſoul, I think and know that in their thoughts
for my ſake and her ſeeming deſerts, they had Adopted her an own
Daughter, but <hi>Optima Corrupta, peſſima.</hi> And though ſhe hath ſince
aſperſed them with cruelty, the world knows there was none acted on
her in the leaſt, nay nothing was done that can come within the terme of
incivility; but what was done to her for that unſpeakable abuſe ſhe act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42671:15"/>
But ſhe cannot detract from their reputation, though ſhe may make here
ſmell more loathſome. The next day ſhe dined there, after dinner we
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od forth to take the aire with my Mother, my Brother (who then I
think had ſeen her four times) and another Gentleman, which afternoon,
had you but heard her diſcourſe tending to her former Narration, and
ſeen her ſo well and nobly act Love paſſages to me, before my friends
you would ſtand amazed to think what she ſaid, and how she hath acted.
Before we returned home, Letters were come for her by the Poſt, as
she had ordered them, (but they were dictated by her ſelf, and writ at a
Scriveners Shop in this City by the ſervant, as he will juſtify now and
well remembers) <hi>By</hi> that time we got to my Fathers, they were brought
her; she opened them and read them with great ſeeming joy for the
good news, and then I took and read them. Theſe Letters upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of her she burned; the contents whereof I can well remember,
and will briefly ſet down. One was from—<hi>Hamond</hi> her Governes
Directed on the Superſcription thus, <hi>A Maddam Maddam Henrietta
Maria de Wolway;</hi> wherein ſhe wrote after her reſpects and ſalutes to
her Ladyship, and joy to hear she was ſafe arrived in <hi>England,</hi> and what
longing deſires they all had to be with her, to wait on her Ladyſhip and
kiſs her hand, <hi>How that the old Count was almoſt mad for her, and the
Emperours Nephew likewiſe: and that they made great ſearch for her.
And that the Emperour had ſent to the</hi> French <hi>Court, and would ſpeedily
ſend to</hi> England, <hi>therefore deſired her Ladyſhip to keep very private:
And how her pretty Page</hi> (which she ſaid was <hi>Mine Heere Breants</hi> Son
the Emperours Privy-Counſellor) <hi>thought it very long, and was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to be with her Ladyſhip to do his Duty.</hi> And ſuch like matter was
contained in her Letter.</p>
            <p>The other Letter was as from <hi>Mine Heere Breant</hi> as ſhe called him,
who was her great friend and Agent in her flight; and as ſhe told us ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her what he was, She ſaid, <hi>He was one of the Emperors Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
and that her Governeſs and ſome of her ſervants lay at his houſe
for privacy, and he could fetch what he would out of her own houſe and not
be miſtruſted being ſo great with the Emperour.</hi> In this Letter, after his
great reſpects and ſervice to her Honour, he informs her, <hi>of the receipt of
her Letter and of her deſire to have the mony returned,</hi> which he ſaith <hi>he
thought not convenient to venter, and the rather becauſe he did intend to
ſet ſaile ſpeedily for he had kept a Ship on purpoſe a whole week, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
a good wind, and then he and his Lady, and her Governeſs, and
her ſervants with her goods, Jewells and moneys, would come over to her.</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42671:15"/>
He informs her alſo, how <hi>that the Emperour mightily checked the holy
Fathers for being too rigid and ſevere, and that he was much troubled for
her:</hi> He informs her alſo, <hi>what things he had got out of her houſe, and
deſired her commands ſpeedily by a Letter what other things ſhe would
have:</hi> And ſo after a long Epiſtle to this purpoſe, he takes leave of her
Ladyſhip, deſiring her <hi>to be ſatisfied that all things ſhall go well by her
Servant his meanes, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Here Gentlemen by him that made me, you have the exact Copy of
this Letter, which you may ſee if you are curious and deſirous to do, of
him to whom it was directed. Pray mind this Letter, and ſee how cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
ſhe indited this and alſo the other two, of which you have the
true contents though ſhort. In the Superſcription of this laſt received
Letter, becauſe (as ſhe told me her ſelf) <hi>it ſhould not be known to her
friends that ſhe lay in a publick houſe, ſhe left out the word Tavern.</hi> In
the Letter pray obſerve thoſe words, <hi>For what obligations you may do
her &amp;c.</hi> That was a Bait for Mr. <hi>King,</hi> if her hooke had not caught me.
In brief, thus you ſee the Devils Policy.</p>
            <p>And now Ladies, I wiſh I could leave her here, for I am even tyred
with going ſo far. I could wiſh her Coach (which ſhe ſaid my Lord <hi>Taff</hi>
bought for her in <hi>England,</hi> and ſent it over to her, made of the new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
with Glaſſe very ſtately, and her Pages and Lacquies were of the
ſame Livery) was come for me, which after the receipt of theſe Letters
ſhe ſent an expreſs order for with other things. I ſhall be ſo out of
breath before I get to Church with her, ſhe being ſo big as you ſee here
she is, that I shall not be able to ſpeak (or at leaſt willing to ſay) <hi>I John</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:42671:16"/>
take thee <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially for bad or for worſe, for good or for better, <hi>I</hi>
could ſtrain my ſelf very much. As she is I dare not promiſe you to
heave at her hole, I meane to have and to hold her; for she may go
when and where she pleaſe. Theſe excellent <hi>Chimaera</hi> Letters have
ſomewhat raiſed my fancy to a private ſmile, and for the preſent have
much diverted my ſerious humor. But, I hope Ladies you will excuſe
this diverſion of my fancy, and pardon theſe Jocks the rather, becauſe
variety hits the humor of every perſon, and the more parts I make the
more pleaſant it is.</p>
            <p>Sometime after this we joyned hands in Matrimony; and my Religion
makes me ſtand amazed, to think of the corrupted and ſinful ſoul of this
miſerable Creature. Firſt in violating the Lawes of holy Matrimony,
which ſignifies and repreſents the Myſtical union between Chriſt and his
Church. How will this defiled member anſwer that dreadful Charge and
Poſition which is uſed in the Ceremony of Matrimony by the Prieſt, in
theſe words, ſaying, <hi>I require and charge you (as you will anſwer at the
daeadful day of judgment, when the ſecreets of all hearts ſhall be diſcloſed)
That if either of you do know any Impediment why you may not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
joyned togather in Matrimony, that ye confeſs it; For be ye well
aſſured, that ſo many as be coupled togather otherwiſe then Gods word
doth allow, are not joyned togather by God, neither is their Matrimony
lawful</hi>—I will not ſtand to apply this, The world is ſenſible how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
hers was; And I am ſatisfyed how clear I am from her, and how
free I am in my Conſcience, as well from the breach of that Charge, as
to enter into that Sacred Order again. But this is between God and my
own Conſcience, and I will ſay no more to it.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Heaven made this match, but did cut off the entaile</l>
               <l>of future comfort, elſe my Judgment failes.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>As to the ſeveral Paſſages after Marriage, my modeſty commands pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy,
to the objections that have been or drollingly can be made, I do
not deſire, nor will I publish, but privately I can ſatisfy any rationable
perſon what an artificial made she was, whoſe ſeeming purity of a true
Maiden Bride, was ſophiſticated and made ſtrict by the power of Druggs
&amp; help of Art. As to the cloths she ſpeaks of, I am certain I left her bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then I found her, as many can juſtify, beſides that which she had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to me made away. I continued and lived with her about a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
after Marriage before ſhe was diſcovered; In which time ſome
perſons of quality that were curious to ſee her, did viſit us at our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and after a conſiderable ſtay and time of ſatisfying their curſoſities
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42671:16"/>
and making a Tryal, departed with great credit and belief of her worth.
She ſtill continued in her former pretences of Birth and Fortune, and
when ſhe was better habited ſhe did better repreſent. After marriage,
during the time <hi>I</hi> remained with her, my expences on her was as high as
her pretences. She, the nobler to entertain thoſe perſons of quality
her friends who ſhe ſaid were coming over, was very willing and earneſt
with me to fit her with a noble Houſe; But for the preſent <hi>I</hi> ſatisfyed
her with handſome Lodgings, Cloaths and ſufficient attendance. But as
to this it concerns my ſelf, and is the leaſt thing <hi>I</hi> care for; it is done,
and what <hi>I</hi> have expended on her, though it be very conſiderable, yet it
is not material to inſert for any ones ſatisfaction. The Counterfeit Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells,
like the reſt of her ſtorys and her ſelf, are ſcarce worth taking off
from a Dunghill. Theſe with other things of value, as ſhe ſaid, <hi>ſhe had
hid about her,</hi> she only told me of for a great while, and ſhe ſaid, <hi>ſhe
would not produce them, that it might be ſaid to her friends when they
came over, and to all the world alſo, that I loved her nobly, and not for
what ſhe had;</hi> This <hi>I</hi> proteſt was her Plea to me. As to Money, <hi>I</hi> here
atteſt I never ſaw 10 <hi>s.</hi> of hers in my life, but ſhe was extraordinary free
of my Pocket. I will not inſiſt here, I thought not to ſpeak of it all, for
I would have ſcorned it, but that ſhe hath given out ſuch curſed reports
of what things ſhe brought to me; And to ſpeak very much within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
I am confident all the counterfeit Rings, Jewels and gilded braſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyre
worked Bracelets, counterfeit Pearls (which the night ſhe was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
ſhe thought to Coxeme with ſtill) as you ſhall read hereafter)
her Cloaths, which was the diſguiſe ſhe came in and no other, nay and
put her ſoul in alſo, if ſhe hath any, for a grain of allowance, are not
worth a Collation of Ten pieces. I am brief in every particular, give me
leave to ſmile at one or two paſſages, which I will contract and inſert
here, before I leap over many tranſactions during the fortnights time,
and come to the diſcovery of this diſguiſed Curtizan. Upon a rumor of
ſome vulgar heads that were talking of the Marriage, who credibly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that ſhe was a Princeſs, and what danger the young Gentleman that
married her was in, I ſometime after I had heard this talk, when it came
in my mind, ſmiling at the conceit began to tell it her for news, which
ſhe ſeemed to ſtart at, as if it had been true. Upon that, Madam ſaid I,
Prethe relate to me the truth of your Birth and Fortune Good or bad;
for I am bound to ſtand to it now. She replyed, <hi>That ſhe deſired me not
preſs her to it, that I might truly atteſt I knew not what ſhe was, but that
I loved her as ſhe was. But,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>this ſatisfaction I will give you, I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42671:17"/>
am nigh related to the Crown of</hi> Denmark, <hi>let that ſuffice with what I
told you before, and I proteſt I ever told you the least of what I am. Had
I been a Boy,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I ſhould have had the Earldom, which was</hi> 24000
<hi>pounds</hi> per annum, <hi>which for lack of Iſſue Male, went to the Emperour
who hath</hi> 6000 li. <hi>of mine in his hands now. But</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>my Father dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without Heir Male, I only enjoy what he purchaſed, which is but</hi>
3000 li. per annum, <hi>as I told you and that is in your Engliſh C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>int</hi>
1500 li. <hi>ſterling, beſides Monys, Goods and Jewells of the Lord my Father
and my Lady Mother of a very great value.</hi> But to be ſhort, the other
paſſage is this, Her Father in Law the Lord Fidler, the morning before
ſhe was diſcovered, (as I have heard but relate it not for a very truth,
though I am apt to believe it by reaſon he told me &amp; others that <hi>he was in
Town at that time and long before</hi>) with ſome other of hs Conſorts, came
early to our lodgings with their muſick to play us up. She roſe, ſlipt on a
morning Gown of mine: and taking mony of me, which ſum I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
it was half a piece beſides what addition I ſuppoſe ſhe made, and
preſently flung it out of the Bellcony, and after a Tune or two they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
I could not miſtruſt any thing then (though I asked her the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of her freeneſs? And indeed in all her expences whilſt with me, ſhe
paſſed the bounds of Liberality, and touched the Confines of Prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
a thing nothing profitable to any condition, eſpecially a married life:
but I then did impute it to the liberality of her diſpoſition and breeding.
(She replyed, <hi>There were</hi> 4 <hi>or</hi> 5 <hi>of them, ſhe could not do leſſe in honour,</hi>
neither did I value it) For it was to be expected in ſome nature, and ſhe
alwaies, both before and after Marriage, when we went forth, was free
to ſervants and very Charitable to the poor, with good admonitions
likewiſe to them. I will not ſtand to relate any further, how many <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-noſters,
Aves ſalves</hi> and <hi>Creeds</hi> ſhe ſaid over, and how ſtrict an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver

I owe my Duty. After ſome ſtay there, She tells me <hi>She would have</hi>
10 li. <hi>to go to Mr.</hi> Kings <hi>and redeem a Diamond Ring of</hi> 80 li. <hi>price
that ſhe left with him before Marriage for</hi> 7 li. <hi>in money, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

wrong, and might carry any thing away with her when ſhe went in her
diſguiſe to recreate her ſelf in the fields,</hi> with which by walking ſometimes
with me and ſome others ſhe became acquainted and knew the way,
<hi>wherefore ſhe left that for ſecurity, with the obligation of privacy; and
therefore deſired me and my friends to take no notice to him of ſuch a
thing.</hi> The money ſhe had, and we went and my Mother with us, to ſee
a friend near Mr. <hi>Kings</hi> houſe; She and I went to Mr. <hi>Kings,</hi> I meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with a friend there, retired into a room to drink a Glaſſe of Wine,
She ſaid, <hi>ſhe would go and ask Mr.</hi> King <hi>for the Ring.</hi> A little after ſhe
came to me again, and told me, <hi>he was ſo buſy he could not give it her now,
but deſired her to come the next morning or any other time.</hi> The next
morning she ſaid she would go. So we departed thence, and went to my
friends houſe where we had left my Mother. And here Reader she is
diſcovered; for Mr. <hi>King</hi> ſends preſently for my Mother to show her
a Letter that came from <hi>Dover,</hi> in anſwer to a Letter ſent at <hi>Rivers</hi> by
a friend of ours to a friend of his, which Lettet they juſt were reading as
we went into the houſe, but told me nothing of it, neither did they give
her any notice of it until my Mother returned again. A true copy of the
Letter I will here inſert.</p>

                  <p>SIr, This morning I received your Letter, dated <hi>May</hi> the 2d. inſtant,
and accordingly have made inquiry; By what I can diſcover, it is
a Gentlewoman that is the greateſt Cheat in the World. She hath now two
Husbands living in this Town, the one a <hi>Shoemaker</hi> named <hi>Thomas
Steadman,</hi> the other a <hi>Chirurgion</hi> named <hi>Thomas Day.</hi> She was borne in
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> her maiden name is <hi>Mary Modders,</hi> her Father was a Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
belonging to <hi>Chriſt-church Canterbury.</hi> She was lately in <hi>Dover-Caſtle</hi>
a Priſoner, taken out of a ſhip bound for the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> where
ſhe cheated the Mr. of 50 <hi>li.</hi> if it be ſhe, I am ſorry for your
friends misfortune. If I ſhall refer you to Mr. <hi>John Williams</hi>
his Wife, who liveth near St. <hi>Saviours Dock New-ſtaires</hi> near <hi>Rederiff,</hi>
ſhe is the Maſters wife of the <hi>Barbadoes</hi> ſhip; and if you can prevaile
with her to go ſee her, ſhe will give you full ſatisfaction whether it be ſhe
or no. I pray you ſend me a line of the appearance of the buſineſs, and
the mans name that is married to her, and his Calling; for it is reported
A Miniſter took her up at <hi>Gravefend.</hi> My reſpects to your ſelf and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

            <p>Mr. <hi>King</hi> having read this to my Mother, and the rumour by one
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42671:18"/>
means or another being ſpread, it happened, there was a Gentlewoman
then in the houſe, that hearing of it, did miſtruſt it was the ſame perſon
that formerly lay at her houſe, at the back-ſide of the <hi>Feathers Taverne</hi>
in <hi>Pauls Church-yard;</hi> where ſhe had like to have married a <hi>Mercer</hi> in
<hi>Pater-noſter-row,</hi> but was diſcovered before it was quite compleated.
The ſame Gentleman I underſtand ſhe hath chea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed of a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſum in Silks and Sattin. This Gentlewoman deſired my Mother to
permit her to go and ſee her. When they came into the room at my
friends houſe wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> we were, as ſoon as ſhe had caſt her eye upon the
Gentlewoman, ſhe put on her Hoods and hid her Face. I wondered who
ſhe was that came up. My Mother asked her, <hi>If ſhe knew this Mary
Moders?</hi> She replyed, <hi>She knew her by her Gate.</hi> Then it was no time
to diſſemble, and my Mother deſired the Gentlewoman to go near her,
and look in her Face; for ſhe hid her Face and turned her back towards
them, and made as if ſhe looked out at the Window. The Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
went, and looking on her ſaid, How do you Madam? She replyed,
<hi>I do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly ſo long at my houſe?
&amp; ſuch like proofs ſhe brought. She ſtill replyed, <hi>I never ſaw you before.</hi>
In brief the Gentlewoman would have ſwore it was the ſame perſon, and
ſhe departed. By and by her husband came, but ſhe would not let any
one come up to ſee her; but he by deſcription knew her alſo, and told
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s ſome other former Cheats. When ſhe was gone they ſhewed me
the former Letter, which I read to her, and asked her if ſhe was ſuch a
perſon? ſhe utterly denyed it, and proteſted ſhe was not. And I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
the imagination of this misfortune gave me ſuch a terrible Charge,
that I could hardly recover my right ſenſe; but to try her the better,
I then bid her give me her Jewels off. She would not conſent to it a
great while, at length ſhe did, I ſent them by two friends to the <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith,</hi>
which when he looked on them, he wondred at their queſtion,
which was to know what they were? She had a Ring likewiſe ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
coſt 50 <hi>li.</hi> which I ſent after the reſt, and they were all falſe, and
worth nothing but the Gold, which will hardly purchaſe a gallon of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ary;
finding things thus, we did believe the aforeſaid Letter and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
So we deſired her to give us ſeven of the ten pounds ſhe had juſt
before, and we would redeem the Ring ſhe ſaid Mr. <hi>King</hi> had: So re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the mony of her (ſhe being unwilling to part from it at firſt till
ſhe ſee we found her out very plainly) we went for the Ring, which made
Mr. <hi>King</hi> amazed at the queſtion, for never any ſuch thing was; But
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay her plot, ſhe the morning before ſaid, <hi>She would go to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42671:18"/>
and it ſeems carryed a great bundle out with her that I knew not
of, to a place I know not where, and after called there where she ſaid
she would; ſo she thought being provided with the 10. <hi>l.</hi> in ſilver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
ſeveral pieces of Gold she had of me the ſame time, the Cloaths <hi>I</hi>
bought, her Ring, Picture and Watch she had of me, and other things;
she imagined her ſelf in a good Equipage for another deſigne and a ſpeedy
flight. After this diſcovery, my Relations and my ſelf preſſed hor to
ſpeak true, whether she had any other Husband, and told her how little
regard we had to her pretended Fortune, and that if she could Vindicate
and prove her honeſty (which upon their atteſtation was juſtly feared)
she should live happily and contentedly with me that loved her nobly
and heartily; and there she preſently (though we could not make her
ſpeak before) fell down on her knees in the preſence of ſeveral perſons,
weeping exceedingly; <hi>wiſhed for a ſuddaine judgment to befall her, and
that her ſoul may eternally hang in Hell, if ever ſhe was Contracted, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
to, or knew any man beſides my ſelf.</hi> Upon this I prevailed with my
Friends (who adviſed me to ſecure her there all night) to let her have
her deſire, and go home with me to our Lodgings; when we came home
she preſently undreſſed her ſelf, and ſlipt on the <hi>Indian</hi> Gown, and
having put on clean Linnen and Gloves, and ſuch things, she pulled off
the Rings from her fingers, and Chriſtals from her ears, and her Bracelets
all Counterfeit, and gave them me, deſiring me when she was dead, not
to let the Rings in her ears be taken out, nor her Gloves off her hands,
and ſuch like foolish deſires: I wondred at her fancy, and asked her why
she talked of dying; Madam ſaid I, do you mean to do your ſelf a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
<hi>No Sir</hi> ſaid she <hi>to do my ſelf good, before to morrow morning you
ſhall ſee me in another Condition;</hi> hearing this and ſuch like diſcourſe,
the Man and Maid ſtanding in the Chamber, I commanded them not to
ſtir thence that night, but to fetch me ſuch and ſuch things, for I would
ſit up my ſelf alſo.</p>
            <p>Then ſhe opened a Paper of Counterfeit Pearl, and gave me a couple,
ſaying, <hi>Theſe my Dear will make you amends for all:</hi> Within halfe an
hour after, my Father and Mother, Siſter, and another Gentlewoman came
with a Shooe-maker that was ſent by the aforeſaid Mrs. <hi>Williams,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Letter to Mr. <hi>Kings</hi> to know the truth of this: When he
came there, my Friends told him ſhe was gone with me to our Lodgings,
and notwithſtanding it was ſo late at Night, and Rained, and he had as
far as <hi>Horſly-Down</hi> to return home, yet he came with my Friends in a
Coach, whom he deſired not to leave me alone with her if they loved me,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42671:19"/>
but to ſtay themſelves all-night. When he came into the Room, he
asked her how ſhe did doe? ſhe replyed as ſhe did before, and alwayes
doth in the like Caſes, that ſhe did not kun-now him; he replyed, you
impudent Woman, do not you know you owe me ſo much money for
Slops and Shooes when you lay at Mrs. <hi>Williamſes,</hi> ſhe will know you to
morrow morning, and I beleive will go neer to tear thee to peices, you
know you owe her 44 <hi>l.</hi> and then began to jeer her and ſaid what a P—makes
you ſo fine in this brave ſilk Gown, I cannot maintaine my Wife
ſo, and I am a Maſter-Shooe-maker, and your Husband <hi>T. S.</hi> a Journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Shooe-make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and ſuch like ſlouts he uſed and ſo departed, earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               </gap>ing us not to leave her alone, or ſtir from her, for ſhe will cheat
the Divel himſelf ſhe hath ſo many tricks. In this Dreſs ſhe ſat all
Night on the Bed-ſide, and would not ſpeak one word, aske her what
you will, and that is her trick upon all diſcoverys; but let any one back
her, and ſhe will ſpeak as boldly as a Divel. About the middle of the
Night my Friends and asked her if ſhe would eat or drink a glaſs of
Wine, or any thing elſe? ſhe replyed to me ſafely, yes, ſhe would eat,
and deſired me to bring her a Knife, vvhich vvhen she had got, I think
she had eat nothing, but she put the Knife in her Pocket; by and by she
pulled out the Dravve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of my Trunk, and took ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> her Letters, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
the Candle of me, ſet them on fire vvithin the Curtaines, &amp; vvhen
they vvere flaming, flung them on the ground. I shall paſs over many
things she did ſay to me, hovv dearly she loved me, and longed to be
vvith me alone, and vvhen I asked her any thing to preſs her to the truth
she vvould, for indeed she could ſay nothing, but ſeemed to deny it ſtill.
In the morning about 4 of the Clock, she took an opportunity vvhen
my Father vvas in the Dineing Room a reading, my Siſter, the other
Gentleman and my ſelf lying on the Bed in a ſlumber, and only my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſitting by her at the fire ſide, she caſt her eye tovvards the Chamber
door, and the light appearing on the Stair-head, my Mother feared she
vvould run <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ovvn and get avvay, and therefore vvent to the Stairs and
ſtood there; she ſeeing this opportunity, drevv out my ſvvord that lay
on the Chimney-piece, and run as faſt up Staires as she could poſſibly,
vvhich being perceived, ſome one cryed out she vvas gone up vvith a
Svvord, and vvith that vvaked me, and I taking the boys ſvvord, follovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her up, calling to her to forbear, vvhich I beleive I need not have
done, for she vvould have been hanged before she vvould have hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t her
ſelf; vvhen I came up I found her leaning as it vvere vvith her breaſt
open on the ſvvords point, took hold of the ſvvord and brought her
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42671:19"/>
dovvn againe; and she told me, <hi>but that ſhee heard my voyce, and deſired
to ſpeak with me, elſe ſhe would have killed her ſelf.</hi> The day grovving
farther on, vve bid her provide and put on her ovvn Cloaths, for Mrs.
<hi>Williams</hi> and the reſt of the Witneſſes vvould come preſently, vvhich
she did though unvvillingly, and cryed very much, and deſired to ſpeak
vvith privatly me in the next room, vvhere she uſed many proteſtations
of her Love to me, &amp; ſorrow for the abuſe ſhe had done me, and begged of
me to let her eſcape, and ſhe would never ſee <hi>England</hi> more; <hi>I</hi> anſwered
her I will, for all this abuſe, ſhow you all the Civility I can, and if I can
be cleared from you and your actions, you ſhall go as you pleaſe; till
then, we muſt proceed according to Law and Juſtice; you ſee what
Witneſſes come againſt you, and how reports encreaſe; and I cannot
with ſafety to my ſelf let you eſcape; and ſaid I, what will the world
think of it, if I ſhould? therefore I muſt publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſee the wrong you have done me, or elſe they will wonder at the reaſon,
and think I have abuſed you. Some time after Mrs. <hi>Williams,</hi> and many
others that knew her came, and were ready to tear the Cloaths off from
her back; and Mrs. <hi>Williams</hi> challenging a Sca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe that ſhe had on,
<hi>Moders</hi> replyed, <hi>Indeed Mrs.</hi> Williams <hi>it is none of yours, for this I
lately bought,</hi> and there are all the words she ſpoke in anſwer to any ones
accuſations, only she cryed very much all the while, and talked to me
privately, and beg'd me to let her eſcape <hi>for Gods ſake,</hi> and she was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
grived ſhe had abuſed me that was ſo lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng and civil, and that ſhe
loved me Cordially, and with all her ſoul which I could hardly beleive;
for if ſhe had, ſhe would not have abuſed me, as I then told her; but
intreat her never ſo earneſtly and much, ſhe would not tell me why ſhe
did ſo, nor ſpeak one word to that, only weep and ſay <hi>that ſhe ſhould dye
if we proſecuted her;</hi> but ſhe would hant ſome bodys Ghoſt, and ſuch
Bugbear ſtorys ſhe would uſe, thinking to terrefie me, and ſo to let her
eſcape. You may imagine Gentlemen and Ladys what a damp it ſtruck
to my ſpirits to ſee this ſuddain alteration; I could not withdraw my
affection, though her actions forced me to do what I did. Preſently
after in a ſtrange manner, the rumour being ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we all (near a ſcore in number) went back to the Juſtices, who after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Examinations, juſtly committed her, ſhe being asked her name,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42671:20"/>
would not declare it, nor nothing elſe. The Glark being about to make

affection not being extirpated, I was willing to perform any civil requeſt
ſtill, though I muſt confeſs I did deſerve, and juſtly was blamed by many
Strangers, that I did ſo much un-man my ſelf; for I am certain, had it
been ſome mens caſe, ſhe had not breathed long after; but it is beſt as
it is, I had more Charity for her, and Civility to her then ſhe did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;
My thinks it ſhould pierce her heart when ſhe ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of her abuſes and diſcourteſie to me, yet my civility always to her.</p>
            <p>But Curteous Reader, I have been pretty long and very plain in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the diſcovery of her, and the rather, by reaſon it was ſo ſtrange,
and becauſe every perſon is very inquiſitive in this point. The reaſon
why ſhe ſo earneſtly entreated me not to let her go to <hi>Newgate,</hi> was
becauſe she hath been there before, and lay in a miſerable Condition
there in the Common <hi>Goale</hi> a great while, and would had been well
known there; For an <hi>Exchange</hi> woman, to whom
this <hi>Moders</hi> oweth ſome money, for which she was in <hi>Newgate,</hi> to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the deſire of the Fore-man of the Jury, Mr. <hi>Rutland,</hi> who would
not beleive but that she was what she pretended her ſelf to be; after her
Tryal, being at the Keeper of <hi>Newgate's</hi> Houſe, went with ſome others
to ſee her, she then ſtanding in the Belcony of the Keepers Houſe, ſeeing
the little Gentleman come into the Yard, run preſently away and locked
her Chamber Door to her, and though they Feed the Keepers, yet could
not procure Admittance; For she told the Keepers through the Door,
that <hi>that little Gentleman ſhould not come in;</hi> then the Fore-man deſired her
to admit him in, who had done her a late great Curteſie as to ſaving her
Life, she anſwered, <hi>he ſhould be admitted</hi> without his Company; the
Jury-man replyed in briefe, Madam I underſtand you owe this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
my Friend ſome moneys, she replyed <hi>Yes,</hi> but he muſt go to her
Husband for it, but which of her Husbands, I cannot tell; For I cannot
imagine whoſe Wife she will be at the Reſurrection, and the debt muſt
remain till then, and there we shall have true Juſtice done without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
or reſpect to any perſon, and therefore we will let that reſt and
ſleep quietly in the U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. But now we will leave her at the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi>
where if any perſon came that knew her as many ſcores did, she will own
none; and to ſtrangers she ſtill carrys on a deſign to procure Friends
and money under her former pretences, and here she remained ſporting
with, and Courted by the young Gallants of this age, who either wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
or ignorantly beleive her ſtill; but the Civilized Gentry (though
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42671:20"/>
Gentility cannot be termed properly without Civility) did after a little
ſatisfaction of their curioſities perceive her Craft and Impudence; nay

<hi>Canterbury,</hi> where unknown to any who I was, upon diſcourſe of ſuch a
perſon I heard of her damnable actions, and wondered to hear the curſed
exclamations that very many perſons made againſt her. Finding things,

<hi>I am yet ſo ill that I dare not venter to go to</hi> London; <hi>yet it will be very

her in Marriage to <hi>Tho. Steadman,</hi> &amp; did anſwer all the objections that

&amp; alſo <hi>that it was a rare thing to ſtate a Wedding at the Church;</hi> As
to a Witneſs he adviſed us to ſend down ſome that could write and read;
There did for better ſecurity two perſons of good repute go on purpoſe,
who did ſpeak with the ſaid <hi>Thomas Steadman,</hi> and one of the aforeſaid
Gentlemen with <hi>James Knot,</hi> whom they carried from <hi>Canterbury</hi> to
<hi>Dover,</hi> to teſtifie that <hi>Steadman</hi> was living, did alſo ſee &amp; accompanied
Mr. <hi>Day</hi> the other husband. They both acknowledged their Marriages, &amp;
the ſaid <hi>Steadman</hi> confeſſed he had two children by her, both dead; and
that <hi>James Knot</hi> (who was then preſent) gave her in Marriage. He would
willingly came againſt her; and when we ſent a Letter for him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
he returned an anſwer, he could not without leave from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
who was then in <hi>London,</hi> or the Enſign of the Caſtle who came
with her to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and lodged with her (as many in <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſaid)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42671:21"/>
To which Governor, I am informed by a Gentleman that knows the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
ſhe ſent a Letter from the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> deſiring mans apparrel
for her eſcape: and that if they let <hi>Steadman</hi> come up, when ſhe was
dead ſhe would haunt them. And thereupon <hi>Steadman</hi> was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to go out of the Caſtle; but was ſecured by ſtrict order from
the Governor, that rod Poſt down or ſent on purpoſe, who proteſted to
ſecure him in chains before he ſhould come up; at this inſtant we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
from <hi>Canterbury</hi> he remained ſo kept up. As to a witneſs that
knew her <hi>Sarah Williams</hi> was ſworne, who atteſted that this woman
was bound for <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> to go along with her Husband, and ſhe deſired
to Lodge at her houſe for a time, and did ſo. And when the Ship was
ready to go, ſhe went into <hi>Kent</hi> to receive her means, and ſaid ſhe
would meet the Ship in the <hi>Downs,</hi> and miſſing the Ship took Boat and
went to it. After ſome days, there came her husband <hi>Thomas Steadman</hi>
with an Order, and fetcht her a ſhore, ſhe ſending him a Letter, that
ſhe was well ſtored with Monys and other things, and therefore deſired
him to fetch her away <hi>per</hi> force, and carried her to <hi>Dover Caſtle.</hi> But I
will be ſhort in this relation, for her favourable Tryal is well known, and
her preamble and altogether imaterial Plea ſhe made at the Bar, and the
Witneſs ſhe was allowed, and the Councel that ſhe had privatly ordered
and provided to prompt her. As to Mr. <hi>Days</hi> Marriage we had 5 or 6
Witneſſes ready; but I know not how, nor why the Indictment was
not took notice of. As to her Marriage with Mr. <hi>Billing</hi> the <hi>Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layer,</hi>
he was in the Court, and did declare it to many ſcores there; the
Parſon that married him, and the Clark that gave her to him, were there
alſo, and this Indictment was thrown away unregarded. His daughter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
who had lodged with this <hi>Mary Monſter alias Moders,</hi> did teſtifie
ſhe was her Fathers Wife, but ſhe utterly hated her. Notwithſtanding
this Indictment was not minded; what the reaſon was I leave to every
Chriſtian to Judg of her; my green years do not afford me Wiſdom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to ſee into it. In proving her Marriage to <hi>Steadman,</hi> the Copy
of the Indictment and the Records were offered to the Court, but were
termed Pamphlets, and not looked on or read.</p>
            <p>It would he to tedious, to recite the full Copy of her examination
and Tryal ſhe had at <hi>Dover;</hi> But in ſhort thus it was, ſhe owned and

of <hi>Canterbury</hi> deceaſed; but called her ſelf, and was Indicted by the
name of <hi>Love Maria Moders.</hi> She acknowledged and confeſſed ſhe

he was troubled no further with her; but did preſently after, and ſtill ſo

am ſatisfyed that the world ſhall know thus much, which is but the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
and abridgment of ſome part of her late acted Cheat on me. I am

Epitomized as I may properly ſay. <hi>I</hi> would had willingly made a brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

to be my own Hiſtoriographer, through my deſire to Allegiance and
Truth) might not prove ſavory; But I hope it will be rather grateful
then diſguſtful to every Chriſtian Spectator. I might recount many
more paſſages, and proceed further with her, and tell you, How after
ſhe removed from <hi>Newgate,</hi> ſhe took Lodgings in <hi>Fullers Rents</hi> in

and retained a grand Counſellor of the Law to be her Tutor, and
ſhe is his Pupil, where ſhe admits of no Vacation; But keeps <hi>Hillary
Term</hi> altogether. And I would adviſe all ſuch as ſhall deſire to try a
Title with her, if their evidence be good and ſound, to ſecure it by all
means, and rather compound then join Iſſue with her and proceed to

<hi>I</hi> will not ſtand to tell you, how this pretty Fidlers brat went to the

was the laſt time I did (and I beleive the laſt time I shall) ever ſee her.
Before which ſight she had ſent me a Letter to Court my love and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

            <p>As the Cloaths and other valuable things that I gave her to ſupply her

I have again, that is, the beſt part of them, and will keep them perhaps

elſe, but to trouble me; get what ſhe can from me, and ſo go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and then ſhe would be fitted for another Cheat. I ſay ſhe told me
ſhe went to his Lordſhips and ſhowed me the very Cloaths and habit
ſhe wore thither, and ſhe makes ſport at the (Impudence) humour,
and ſhe gives out that her buſines was only to return his Lordſhip
thanks for the favour he demonſtrated to the <hi>Germane</hi> Princeſs his
Country-woman, ſhe then repreſented a Man! I admire at her impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
but I am apt to think his Honour is ignorant of her actions? nay
when I told her of the favour ſhe had at the Bench, ſhe laughed at and
made aſcoffe of her Favourites, and told me how confident ſhe was to
eſcape had I ſummoned up a Regiment of Witneſſes. And when I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her how ſhe lived ſo high, ſhe replyed <hi>ſhe was cryed up for a Wit, and

            <p>THeſe ſheets when firſt begun were intended for the Preſs; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>I</hi> had proceeded in one quarter of the Narration, upon ſecond
thoughts <hi>I</hi> put a demur to my former intention, and ſo unperfect they
remained ſcattered and neglected till even now; At length <hi>I</hi> reſolved to
go thorough with it, in any careleſs manner of deſcription, but true mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and leave it to be peruſed by my worthy Friends and acquaintance,
only in the original Coppy of my hand writing; and if they were curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to have it, to tranſcribe it themſelves; but through her much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
and abuſive Prints, not by her compoſed, though by her means;
and by reaſon of the earneſt deſires and entreatys of ſome Friends, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of very great quality that had ſeen, and to whom <hi>I</hi> read this almoſt
abortive and ſcarce reviewed work, at whoſe deſires <hi>I</hi> ſtood ſuſpended
and utterly denyed the permiſſion to print this, until recollecting their
ſatisfactory reaſons, and their friendſhips, <hi>I</hi> thought my ſelf oblidged
and intereſſed to accompliſh their deſires ſince they laid in my power,
in communicating this unliked production to the Treaſury of the world;
and by reaſon of the prolixity of it, <hi>I</hi> would not, nor did <hi>I</hi> give my ſelf
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42671:24"/>
the trouble as to tranſcribe, much more unwilling to dreſs it in any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
language and ſtile then freely and ſpontaneouſly proceeded from my
(at this time diſcompoſed) invention; knowing that Nakedneſs beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
verity, and truth is truth ſtill, though it be ill recounted or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.
And therefore <hi>I</hi> condiſcended to their deſires to publiſh it, and
to my own alſo in not giving my ſelf further trouble in tranſcription or
alteration. But had <hi>I</hi> thought it ſhould have been expoſed to publick
view, it may be expected <hi>I</hi> ſhould have made a handſomer order and
method in the Compoſure of this too true Narration; wherein it ſeems
to me <hi>I</hi> have uſed ſignificant, plain, honeſt, and true expreſſions, though
neither polite, not politick. My misfortune toucheth me ſo neer in
ſome points, that <hi>I</hi> am conſtrained violently to break forth in deſpight of
my diſcretion; and <hi>I</hi> am ſorry that <hi>I</hi> am forced ſo unhappily to change
my ſtile, that inſtead of writing of a Friend, nay a nearer Relation a
(<hi>Quondam</hi>) Wife, <hi>I</hi> muſt (to relate and ſet forth the truth) write as of
an Apoſtate and an Adverſary.</p>
            <p>But <hi>I</hi> am apt to beleive every ingenious Reader will ſo much reſent
as to hold me excuſed, for the feeling affection that attends my expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
can hardly be conceived, much leſs delineated and ſet forth by any.
But it cannot ſure be pleaſing to any to read or hear the diſguſts that my
oppreſſed heart endures; <hi>I</hi> hope it will not be irkſome to liſten a while
to diſaſters, where Nature is ſuch, that they deprive thoſe of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
whom they torment; and if in any part of my aforeſaid Relation <hi>I</hi>
have exceeded, or not obſerved a due <hi>Deco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>um, I</hi> hope you will impute
it to her abuſive writings and the aforeſaid reaſon. <hi>It</hi> is a true ſaying,
<hi>ſecunda cogitationes meliores,</hi> ſecond thoughts prove beſt, for firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not in our hands. And ſince <hi>I</hi> have not time now to recollect,
accept of and abſolve the errors of my firſt motions; and <hi>I</hi> preſume my
Youth may ſerve to excuſe all errors, either in acting this Relation, or
in relating their Actions. And here worthy Reader, <hi>I</hi> would willingly
ſubſcribe to this my intended <hi>Ultimum Vale,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> am encountred again
with another execrable Volumne in <hi>Octavo,</hi> that goeth under her name,
Entituled, <hi>The Caſe of Madam Mary Carleton;</hi> wherein, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her actions are ſo well known to the world, which are the trueſt <hi>Idaea</hi>
of every perſon, yet her unparalell'd confidence hath permitted the
Counterfeit Effigies of her ill-ſhapen painted face to be inſerted as a
Prologue, and for a better gloſs to the book, whereby ſhe endeavours
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42671:25"/>
to make the world beleive her innocence makes her dare to expoſe it to
view, but</p>
            <l>Behold her Impudence, after ſuch diſgrace,</l>
            <l>Dares ſhow a Brazen and ignoble face.</l>
            <p>It ſeems ſtrange to me that ſhe ſhould be ſo preſumptious (conſidor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the world is well ſatisfied, what and who she is) and it is now
generally known that she is the Production of an infamous brood, dropt
from an Ale-tap, and the filthy baſe extraction of a Dunghill; and that
she hath been and is a common and confident Curtizen, a Curſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
a Store-nouſe of untruths, an Armory of falshoods, a Caſtle of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency,
a Treaſury of Vice, an Enemy to all good, a receit and Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
of all Roguery, an inventer of Villany, and Blaſphemous detractor
from all goodneſs good people, nay even from God himſelf; and this <hi>I</hi>
proteſt (with griefe of my ſoul and pitty for her <hi>I</hi> relate) is the perfect
and true Character of her.) <hi>I</hi> ſay I wonder at her preſumption in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating
a book, which only beares the name she now owns, to that thrice
noble and illuſtrious Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> wherein she abuſes (though none
can detract from his renowned fame) the Honour of his Highneſs, by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteing
him with a book, neither beleived or received, and by dedicating
to his Honour a piece containing ſuch and ſo many lyes, only well wrapt
up, and by endeavouring to procure his greatneſs and virtue to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
for her meanneſs and vice, and in ſine by makeing his Honour to
be called in queſtion, and to be the table talk of every Vulgar perſon,
they ſuppoſing, that his Highneſs allows and winks at her Vice; which <hi>I</hi>
here declare, <hi>I</hi> am ſufficiently informed is altogether falſe, though she
profeſſed to me that his Highneſs was daily with her; yet all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
she can uſe, cannot make me beleive she can ſpeak truth; but
it is only her great guilt makes her ſoare ſo high for Protection; and I
am by perſons of Honour made to beleive, you ſhall ſee a juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inflicted on her by his Highneſs for this her unwarrantable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.
But I will not ſtand to arme my reaſon by way of defence to
every loud Alarum ſhe beats up againſt me in that moſt curſed and falſe
Relation written in that book by her dictates; it is better worded then
beleived, as all that read it do paſs their Verdict, and agree with me in
this my ſhort cenſure, <gap reason="foreign">
