                  <note>Attributed to James Bent; cf. BM.  According to Halkett &amp; Laing (v. 9, p. 32), the original work was by John Shirley with contributions by Pitts (i.e. John Tutchin) and probably by Titus Oates and John Dunton. Dunton (Life and errours of John Dunton, 1818, v. 1, p. 184-5) mentions that Mr. Shirley wrote Lord Jeffrey's Life; he adds also that Mr. Pitts was, in part, author of The bloody assizes. S. Parks (John Dunton and the English book trade, 1976, p. 40) states that most writers consider James Bent to be the pseud. of John Dunton. Since Dunton has already attributed the authorship of The bloody assizes to Shirley and Pitts, it is most probable that James Bent (Dunton) and Titus Oates were only minor contributors to this work.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Bloody Aſſizes:</hi> OR, A COMPLEAT HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF <hi>GEORGE</hi> Lord <hi>JEFFERYS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>REader, Think it not ſtrange if I preſent you with the memorable <hi>Life and Actions</hi> of a Perſon, ſo well known in this great Kingdom: And peradventure <hi>Fame</hi> has not been ſilent in other Countreys, eſpecially ſince he has been advanced to be <hi>a Chief Miniſter of State,</hi> and ſate as it were ſteering at the Helm of Government. Various indeed are the Changes of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affairs, and the Actions of Humane Life, which have been more particularly exemplified in the <hi>Riſe and Fall</hi> of the Perſon, the ſubject of this Diſcourſe; who from almoſt a mean obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſoar'd to the lofty <hi>Pyramid</hi> of Honour; where, for a while, like an unfixed Starr, he appeared to the Eyes of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nation, giving an imperfect luſtre; 'till by the ſudden turn and change of unſteady Fortune, he dropt headlong from his <hi>Sphere,</hi> and loſt at once his Grandeur and his Power. To let Mankind ſee how little truſt there is to be given to the ſmiles of <hi>flattering Greatneſs,</hi> eſpecially when attained by violent and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93489:6"/>
motions: I now proceed to <hi>trace</hi> this unfortunate Favourite in the ſundry Capacities and Stations that have hitherto made up the ſeries of his Life.</p>
            <p>He was Born at <hi>Acton,</hi> near <hi>Wrexam,</hi> in <hi>Denbigh-ſhire,</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> about the Year 1648. His Fathers Name was—<hi>Jefferies,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reputed a Gentleman in that Countrey, though of no large Fortune or Eſtate; however he lived very comfortably on what he had, improving his yearly Income by his Induſtry; and gain'd by his plain and honeſt Endeavours a good repute amongſt the Gentry of thoſe Parts; inſomuch that it was not long before he, upon the recommendation of ſome Perſon of Intereſt and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, gain'd a Wife of a good Houſe; and they lived very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably together in their <hi>rural Habitation,</hi> being far from Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſtriving for Court-favour; but contented with what God had bleſſed them with, and the fruits of their own Induſtry, they found a ſolid Happineſs in that Contentment. Nor had they lived together any conſiderable time, but amongſt other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the fruits of Wedlock, God was pleaſed to beſtow on them the Perſon who is intended the <hi>ſubject</hi> of this Diſcourſe, who was in due time Baptized by the Chriſtian Name of <hi>George;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had <hi>God-fathers,</hi> &amp;c. it does not occurr; however he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the care and diligence of his induſtrious Parents grew up, and appear'd to all that ſtudyed him, of a very prompt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Wit, active, and ſtriving for Preeminency, even among his Compeers in his tender Age, which lively demonſtrated that an Air of Ambition was inherent to his Perſon.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was capable to receive Learning, he was put to a Countrey School, where he was furniſhed with ſuch Education as that afforded, which was not extraorninary; yet his natural Parts ſet it off to the beſt Advantage; and growing to Years of ſomewhat a ripe underſtanding, and not very tractable, his Father by the Advice of ſome of his Confidents, cauſed him to be brought to <hi>London;</hi> and finding him not inclinable to any Trade, but rather addicted to Study, he entered him, or by his Procurement he was entred into the Free-School of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where he profited much; ſo that he was by the care of the worthy Maſter thereof ſoon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to underſtand the Languages, or at leaſt ſo many of them as were convenient for the ſtudy of the Law, which above other
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93489:6"/>
things he aimed at; thô his Father ſeemed not very plyable to his deſires; for perceiving in his Soul a more than ordinary <hi>ſpark of Ambition,</hi> fearing it might kindle into a flame, and prove one day his ruine, he laboured to hinder the ways he conceiv'd moſt likely to bring it upon him; and is reported to ſay (when he found he could not diſſwade him from what he purpoſed, gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clapping him on the back,) <hi>Ah</hi> George, George, <hi>I fear thou wilt dye with thy Shooes and Stockings on:</hi> What he meant by that Expreſſion, I determine not, but leave the Reader to Interpret.</p>
            <p>Upon the Coming in of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> and the reſtoring the Face of Affairs in the Kingdom, the Law reviv'd again, and began to flouriſh; the <hi>Practitioners</hi> liv'd in much Credit and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and many of them purchaſed large Eſtates, which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to wing the deſire of this Perſon with Impatience; and ſome ſay he was the rather incited to it by a <hi>Dream</hi> he had whilſt a Schollar at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> School, <hi>viz. That he ſhould be the chief Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in that School, and afterward ſhould enrich himſelf by Study and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and that he ſhould come to be the ſecond Man in the Kingdom; but in concluſion, ſhould fall into great diſgrace and miſery:</hi> This is confidently reported; and ſome ſay himſelf told it to ſundry Perſons, ſince when he found the ſecond part of it was fulfilled, by acquiring the <hi>Chancellourſhip,</hi> and ſtanding high in the Favour of his Prince.</p>
            <p>However, we find the latter part did not deterr him from his purpoſe; for having enter'd himſelf in the <hi>Inner-Temple</hi> Houſe, one of the chief Inns of Court, after his performing ſuch things as are conformable to the Cuſtoms of the Houſe, we find him call'd to the Barr, by the Intereſt he made with the Benchers and Heads of that learned Society, earlier than had been uſual, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Heads of elder Graduates.</p>
            <p>This happening about the twentieth Year of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> and the City of <hi>London</hi> beginning to raiſe her ſelf out of her aſhes, more ſtately and magnificent than before ſhe ſunk in flames, a Sacrifice to the Revenge and Malice of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, as by the late Inſcription on the Monument, and upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it appears: This great City I ſay, regaining her Trade, her Priviledges and Cuſtoms were kept up with great exactneſs, ſo that in the Courts at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> there was much buſineſs; which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93489:7"/>
being conſider'd by this Perſon as more beneficial than that at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its frequency, and being carryed on briefer, and with leſs difficulty; which induced him to give his Attendance, as alſo at <hi>Hixes-Hall,</hi> and other inferiour Courts and Places; inſomuch that he being of a bold Preſence, and having natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a fluent Tongue, an audible Voice, and good Utterance, he had not Pleaded often before he was very much taken Notice of; and gain'd ſo much Credit with the People, that they preferr'd him before any of the younger ſort of <hi>Barriſters;</hi> by which means he found his lucky Starrs begin to ſmile upon him; ſo that he was in a manner Courted to take Fees, and had Breviates thruſt into his Hand frequently in the middle of a Cauſe by Perſons, when they perceived it went ill on their ſides, and was like to go againſt them.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>fluſh'd</hi> with Succeſs, he now thought of nothing <hi>more</hi> than how he might climb; nor did he want an Opportunity, for the next <hi>Station</hi> we find him in, is that of <hi>Common Serjeant,</hi> to the great and honourable City of <hi>London;</hi> and ſo much Fortune favour'd him at this time, that Alderman <hi>Jefferys</hi> the great Smoaker, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving often obſerv'd his Diſcourſe and Actions, took ſuch a liking to him, that being of the ſame Name, though not in the leaſt any <hi>Relation,</hi> he back'd him with his Purſe and Intereſt, which was not inconſiderable; and thereby not only enabled him to carry on his Grandeur, but to purchaſe as he found a convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or advantage, in order to his keeping it up in the World.</p>
            <p>Theſe, I ſay, being the <hi>Degrees</hi> by which he was climbing the ſlippery ſtair of Honour, to contract a firmer alliance, he Addreſſed himſelf to a <hi>brisk</hi> young Widow, Daughter to Sir <hi>Tho. Bloodworth,</hi> then one of the Aldermen of the City; and who in the time of the dreadful Conflagration had the Chair, as being then <hi>Lord Mayor;</hi> and ſo far prevail'd upon the Lady and her Father, that he gain'd both their Conſents, and the Contract was made, the Nuptials ſolemnized; <hi>And ſoon after he had the pleaſure to behold the fruits of his Labour.</hi> Sir <hi>John Howel</hi> the Recorder of <hi>London</hi> giving place, the <hi>Recorderſhip</hi> became vacant, which made this Perſon lay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hold of that Opportunity, to uſe his own and the Intereſt of his Friends, to acquire that Place of Truſt and Honour; nor did his Meaſures fail him, for by the powerful influence he had by this time gain'd over ſundry Perſons, who were beſt able to promote him to what he ſo earneſtly labour'd to arrive at, he was Choſen and Confirm'd <hi>Recorder</hi> of the Honourable City; taking upon him the Charge and Care of the Writings, Papers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that belong to ſo great a Charge and Truſt, as that of a <hi>Recorder</hi> of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this means being become (as himſelf declar'd) <hi>The Mouth of the City,</hi> and as we may term him, Capital Judge in the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> in Controverſies at the Seſſions held there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Power of breathing forth Sentences of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being put into his hands, he found his Ambition enlarg'd, aiming at nothing more than to become a <hi>Court-Favourite:</hi> Nor was it long before an Opportunity offer'd it ſelf, to make him to be taken notice of; for ſo it happened that ſome Perſons had imprinted a <hi>Pſalter,</hi> and Entituled it (the better to ſhadow the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury they had done to the Company of <hi>Stationers,</hi> by invading their Property) <hi>The King's Pſalter,</hi> which occaſioning a Diſpute, it was referred to a Hearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> the King being preſent, and the Company the better to make out their Title and Claim, carryed with them this Perſon as their Councel; who in the opening of the Caſe, and making the Complaint of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Injury done to the Company, in Printing what was really their Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93489:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had this Expreſſion, <hi>viz. They have teem'd with a ſpurious Brat, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clandeſtinely midwiv'd into the World, the better to cover the Impoſture, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ay it at your Majeſties door,</hi> &amp;c. This, though the King might have taken it (for ſundry Reaſons) as a Reflection upon his Royal Perſon, yet he was ſo far from reſenting it that way, that he only turned to one of the Lords that ſat next him, and ſaid, <hi>This is a bold Fellow I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>le warrant him;</hi> and indeed the <hi>Stationers</hi> had the Matt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r declared by the Honourable Board in their Favour.</p>
            <p>About this time the Popiſh Plot being diſcover'd by Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> and others, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was for a while in a Ferment, and matters run extreamly high in Diſputes and Controverſies, and he ſail'd with the Current, declaring with much heat and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt the Prieſts, Jeſuits, and others of the Conſpirators and Romiſh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; as appeared not only by his vehement Expreſſions in pleading againſt them, but the alacrity and little Concern that was viſible in his Countenance, when at any time as Recorder of <hi>London</hi> he paſſed Sentence of Death upon any of them; which he frequently did with more or leſs of Reproach, and became in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Terror of that Party. But no ſooner he perceived the Wind tacking at Court, and that there was ſome miſ-underſtanding between K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. and his Parliament, but he began to fall off and grow cold in Proſecuting the Ends of the Government, being frequently at Court, and labouring as much as in him lay to draw the Magiſtracy of the City after him, as appears more eſpecially by one Paſſage, <hi>viz.</hi> The King being recovered of an Indiſpoſition, that had for ſome time put the Kingdoms in a fear and doubt of his Life, the Lord Mayor and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen went to Congratulate him upon his going abroad; after which, and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Reception, it was propoſed by this Perſon that they ſhould in the like manner wait upon his Royal Highneſs, then Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who was not long before returned from <hi>Flanders;</hi> but perceiving no forwardneſs to be ſeconded, he only with his Father-in-law ſtayed behind to gain that Acceſs: Theſe and other Proceedings created in the City a Jealouſie, that he had eſpouſed an Intereſt to their Prejudice, which wrought ſo ſtrongly in their Conceits, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Council-Chamber at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> that he ſhould reſign his Recorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and accordingly they ſent to him to deliver back the Papers and Writings they had intruſted him with, which accordingly was done, and Sir <hi>George Treby</hi> conſtituted Recorder in his ſtead.</p>
            <p>This ſo nettled him, that he now openly declar'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> himſelf to be what before was only ſuſpected, indulging his thoughts in nothing more than how he might revenge it upon the Diſſenters, to whoſe influence on the Court of Aldermen he attributed his diſmiſſion from the Recorderſhip, and uſed his Endeavours to blacken them as much as he could: Yet all his Honour was not ſunk, for he had prevailed for the Removal of Sir <hi>Job Charleton</hi> from the Chief Juſticeſhip of the County Palatine of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and by the Importunity and Intereſt of his Party at Court, gained it for himſelf; and took the firſt Poſſeſſion of that Charge in much ſplendour, paying at that time his Father a Viſit with a numerous Train, which put the old Gentleman into ſuch a fret, for the drinking up his Cyder, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring his Proviſions, that he charged him with the undertaking to ruine him, by bringing a whole Countrey at his heels, commanding him never to attempt the like Prodigality again with hopes of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Many Petitions being put up upon the Diſſolving the Parliament in 1682. by moſt of the Counties, and Burroughs, and Corporations of <hi>England,</hi> for the ſpeedy Calling another, to redreſs the Grievances of the Nation; and the King ſhewing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93489:8"/>
ſome diſlike of that manner of Proceeding, this Perſon further to endear himſelf to the Intereſt of the Court, declared in his Station as vehemently againſt them, by ſaying, <hi>He abhorred that Petitioning,</hi> &amp;c. from which, and the diſcountenancing the Petitioners as much as in him lay, he gained the Name and Epithite of an <hi>Abhorrer;</hi> and upon the Burning the Pope in Effigies at <hi>Temple-Barr,</hi> upon the Birth-day of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> amongſt other Figures, the Arch-waggs had ſet one on Horſe-back with his Face to the Tail, and a Paper on his back, <hi>viz. I am an Abhorrer.</hi>

            <p>During theſe Tranſactions, the Parliament being called, met at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> and amongſt others this Perſon was called before them, for attempting to infringe upon the Rights and Priviledges of the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and obliged at the Barr of the Commons Houſe (after having been heard what he could ſay in defence of his Proceedings by his Council) to make his Acknowledgment upon his Knees, and receive the Reprimand of the Speaker; whereupon, with ſome ſharp Rebukes, as the Cenſure of the Houſe, he was diſcharged.</p>
            <p>To comfort him in this Affliction, that was not by a Man of his Haughty Spirit a little ſtomacked, this Parliament being Diſſolved, and a Call of Serjeants had at the <hi>Kings-Bench-Bar Weſtminſter,</hi> he was the Firſt in the Roll, and conſequently the Kings Serjeant; and as it is uſual to preſent the King with a Ring on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, the Motto he agreed to was, <hi>A Deo Rex, a Rege Lex,</hi> viz. <hi>The King from God, and the Law from the King.</hi> And now the Popiſh party playing their Cards with more ſecurity, <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris</hi> who had been Impeached by the Commons, and ſtood charged by them of High-Treaſon; being nevertheleſs, upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution Tryed at the Kings Bench-Bar; this Perſon was the principal ſtickler a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and by his Rhetorical and florid expreſſions, wrought ſo powerfully with the Jury, who were ſomewhat in doubt what they ſhould do in this Caſe, that they found him Guilty, and the Impeachment in Parliament ſet aſide, he was Executed as a Traytor at <hi>Tyburn:</hi> and ſoon after this, the Diſſenters loſing of their Eſteem in the eyes of the Court-party, and ſome Juſtices of Peace of <hi>Midleſex</hi> being ſharp upon them, this perſon was choſen Chair-man at the Seſſions of <hi>Hicks's-Hall,</hi> where he had an opportunity to make them as he found his time, ſee the reſentments of his anger, but this place being held too low for a Spirit winged with ſo large an Ambition, he aimed at higher things, reſolving like <hi>Icarus</hi> to be near the Sun, tho' at the hazard of melting his waxen Wings, dropping head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the Sea of inevitable Ruin: whereupon perceiving ſome hot conteſts in the City of <hi>London,</hi> about the Election of Magiſtrates and Officers, he turned the Edge of his Fury that way, inſomuch that a <hi>Quo-warranto</hi> came down againſt the Charter of the Honourable City of <hi>London,</hi> and in fine, after much Pleading and Argument, <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> the Charter was ſurrendered, at leaſt in conſent, by thoſe that were in Power, and the King ſuſpending the Execution of the Judgment obtained, cauſed ſuch orders to be obſerved as he thought moſt convenient, which being ſo well known to the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> it would appear a preſumption in me to enter upon particulars; yet the chiefeſt cavil againſt the City was, taking the Toll of Markets, collecting Money to build <hi>Cheapſide</hi> Conduit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor was it long after this, and the Tryal of ſeveral Perſons for Rioters, who attended the Election of Sheriffs and Mayor, and the Fines paſſing upon many worthy Citizens as Rioters on that occaſion; in promoting which, this Perſon as a Counſellor by his florid Rhetorick was mainly inſtrumental, by giving the Court an account of their reſpective Abilities, the better to ſettle the Fines: but the Lord Chief Juſtice
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93489:8"/>
               <hi>Sannders</hi> dying, he ſucceeded him as Lord Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Kings-Bench;</hi> in which ſtation he was ſcarcely ſettled, but he admitted the Popiſh Lords to Bail, that lay under an impeachment in Parliament, and whoſe Bailing had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by the Judges his Predeceſſors; and now it was that he began more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to remember former affronts, an Example of which take in the Caſe of <hi>Elias Beſt</hi> a Hop-merchant in <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>It ſo happened when this Perſon was Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> that a Jury, of which <hi>Beſt</hi> was one, having contrary to his mind, Acquitted a party Indicted at the Seſſions of Peace in <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> for Printing and Publiſhing a Pamphlet, he in much heat declared that they had gone contrary to their Conſciences, and ſtuck not to upbraid them with Perjury; for which, as a high affront put upon the Juries of <hi>London,</hi> they prayed the Court at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> that they might preferr an Indictment againſt him; and herein Mr. <hi>Beſt</hi> was the moſt active, but the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> then upon the Bench, after it had been a long time Argued and debated, told them that the Seſſions being almoſt at an end, it could not be Tryed, and therefore he would deſire them to defer it to the next Seſſions, for the Recorder being a perſon of Quality, he could not ſuffer him to lie under the imputation of an Indictment ſo long; but in the Interim, he reſigning his Recorderſhip, the buſineſs fell and came to nothing; but ſoon after, it ſeems, Mr. <hi>Beſt</hi> had drank a Health to the pious Memory of <hi>Stephen Colledge</hi> departed, meaning the Joyner that was Executed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> for which he was Indicted upon an Information, and found Guilty; yet he being at large, thought fit to withdraw himſelf to avoid the Rigor of the Fine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when ſo it fell out, that this perſon going the Circuit as Lord Chief Juſtice, accompanied with a great many on Horſeback, Mr. <hi>Beſt</hi> came by, and asked one of the Company what Judge that was, who replyed, the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Jefferys,</hi> and he unadviſedly told that party his name was <hi>Beſt,</hi> and deſired him to remember his Service to his Lordſhip; upon notice of which, he immediately cauſed him to be fetched back, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to <hi>York</hi> Gaol, from whence he was brought by <hi>Habeus Corpas</hi> to the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and Impriſoned for a Fine of 500 <hi>l. &amp;c.</hi> And other inſtances of the Greatneſs of his Stomach, tho' in another nature, is that which ſo remarkably hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> at the <hi>Midſummer</hi> Aſſizes held there for the County of <hi>Surry,</hi> 1679.</p>
            <p>At this Aſſize being Council in a Caſe upon <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> before Sir <hi>Richard Weſton,</hi> one of the Barons of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and deſiring to ingroſſe all the queſtions, without ſuffering thoſe on the other ſide to ask the Witneſs what was convenient in carrying on, and managing the Cauſe; he was deſired by the Judge to hold his Tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon which ſome words paſſing, this Perſon told him he did not uſe him like a Conncellor, curbing him in the managing his <hi>Breviate, &amp;c.</hi> to which the Judge fiercely replyed: Ha! ſince the King has thrown his favours upon you, in making you Chief Juſtice of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> you think to run down every body, if you find your ſelf aggrieved make your complaint, here's no body cares for it: And this Perſon replying, That he had not been uſed to make complaints, but rather ſtopped thoſe that were made; when being again Commanded to hold his Tongue, he ſat down and wept for anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here by the way it will not be amiſs to let the Reader have a taſte of ſome paſſages that happened on the publick Stage of buſineſs, in the Jocular part of this great Mans Life, and the Repartees he met with, of which I ſhall inſtance a few:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:93489:9"/>Once it happened upon a Tryal, that a plain Country fellow giving Evidence in the Court, and preſſing it home, moved this perſon who was Councel on the other ſide, to pick a quarrel with the poor mans Leather Doublet, and amongſt other Interrogations bawl'd out, You fellow in the Leather Doublet, pray what have you for Swearing; the Man upon this, looking ſteadily on him, replyed, Truly Sir, if you have no more for Lying than I have for Swearing, you might wear a Leather Doublet as well as I: This bluntly retorted, moved at that time much laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and filled the Town with the diſcourſe of it.</p>
            <p>Another time it ſo fell out, that ſome Muſitioners brought an Action againſt a perſon, at whoſe Wedding they had play'd, for the Money they were promiſed or expected, when in the midſt of the Evidence, this Perſon called to one of them, <hi>viz.</hi> You Fidler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at which the Man ſeeming to be diſguſted, he again, upon the parties alledging himſelf to be a Muſitioner demanded what difference there was between a Muſitioner and a Fidler; As much, Sir, ſaid he, as there is between a pair Bagpipes and a Recorder; and he then being Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> it was taken as a ſuitable Repartee.</p>
            <p>Being at a Country Aſſize as Judge, an old Man with a great Beard, came to give evidence before him, and not doing it to his mind, he began to cavil with his Beard, and amongſt other expreſſions told him, that if his Conſcience was as large as his Beard, he might well ſwear any thing; This ſo nettled the old blade, that without any reſpect to his greatneſs, he briskly replyed, <hi>My Lord, If you go about to meaſure Conſciences by Beards, your Lordſhip has none:</hi> Many more of this kind might be mentioned, but not being greatly to the purpoſe, they are willingly omitted.</p>
            <p>But to return to the thread of this Diſcourſe; paſſing by his vehement and preſſing Diſcourſe to the Jury againſt <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> on his Tryal at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> which ſome ſay greatly influenced them to find him Guilty; and add, that he did it out of a Pique, in remembrance he was one of the Members of the Parliament before whom he was brought on his Knees. We find him by this time Trying of Dr. <hi>Titus Oats</hi> upon two Informations, upon the account of his Swearing to the <hi>White-Horſe</hi> Conſult, and <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being in Town; and after a long Debate, wherein many ſharp Repartees paſſed, the Jury made a ſhift to find him Guilty; as to the Circucumſtances, I referr you to the Tryal; but the Sentence was ſevere, and of its Effects few are ignorant, wherefore I ſhall paſs it over, as alſo that of Mr. <hi>Tho. Dangerfield,</hi> another of the Evidences in diſcovering the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances and carrying on of the Popiſh Plot, which the Papiſts by theſe manner of Proceedings accounted to be damn'd to the loweſt <hi>Erebus.</hi> And now before any thing remarkably happened, the Kingdom was allarum'd by the landing of the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> at <hi>Lyme</hi> in <hi>Dorſet-ſhire,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but however theſe two unfortunate Gentlemen miſcarrying, and loſing their Lives, left a great many of their miſerable Followers to feel the ſeverity of Puniſhment; and as for the gleanings of the bloody Field in <hi>England,</hi> they came to the ſifting of this Perſon, who with others, going down with a Commiſſion to Try them, all the Indignities the Diſſenters had put upon him came freſh into his remembrance, ſo that he made them find the Laws more cruel than the Sword, and wiſh they had fallen in the Field, rather than have come to his handling; for he breathed Death like a deſtroying Angel, and ſanguined his very Ermins in Blood, a large Account of which you ſhall have in its proper place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93489:9"/>But by the way, for the ſake of the <hi>Weſt-Country Reader,</hi> I ſhall here add a true and impartial Narrative of the late Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s whole Expedition whilſt in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> ſeeing that was the Prologue to that bloody Scene that you'l hear by and by, was acted by <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Jefferies</hi> (the Subject of our preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.)</p>
            <p>To begin then, <hi>May</hi> 24. Old Stile, We left <hi>Amſterdam</hi> about two of the Clock, being <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, and in a Lighter Sail'd for the <hi>Texel,</hi> our Veſſels being ſent before us thither; but meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with extream croſs Winds all the way, we Arrived not till <hi>Saturday</hi> Night, and then went all on Bord. Here our <hi>Man of War</hi> with about 32 Guns (where the Dukes Perſon was) was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Arreſt by order of the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> on the Complaint of our Envoy, they preſuming we had been clear, but we broke through our Arreſt, and <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning at break of Day, ſet Sayl for <hi>England.</hi> We had in all three Ships, that of 32 Guns carried moſt of our Men, the other two were for our <hi>Ammunition.</hi> We met with exceeding croſs Winds, moſt part of the time we ſpent on the Seas, and Arrived not at <hi>Lime</hi> till<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, June</hi> 11. ſo that from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to <hi>Lime,</hi> we wanted but two days of three Weeks.</p>
            <p>We Landed without any the leaſt Oppoſition, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with all Expreſſions of Joy imaginable; the Duke, as ſoon as he Jumpt out of his <hi>Boat</hi> on Land, call'd for ſilence, and then deſired we would joyn with him in returning God Thanks for that wonderful Preſervation we had met with at <hi>Sea,</hi> and accordingly fell on his <hi>Knees</hi> on the Sand, and was the Mouth of us all in a ſhort <hi>Ejaculation,</hi> and then immediately well Armed, as many as we were, entred the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday,</hi> the whole day was ſpent in Liſting of Men, which flock'd to us ſo faſt, that we could ſcarce tend them with Arms.</p>
            <p>The like, <hi>Saturday</hi> alſo; and then about ten of the Clock at Night, 300 of our Men were ſent to <hi>Bridport,</hi> about ſix <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles off, to Storm that Town betimes in the Morning, which we did accordingly, taking many Priſoners out of their Lodgings, and had not our Soldiers been a little too eager of Plunder, we had made a good days work on't; but there lying about a Wood ſome of the Kings Forces, we were forced to Retreat, loſing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93489:10"/>
three or four Men, and killing ſeveral of theirs, and taking Eight Priſoners; this was the firſt Action which he had.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> alſo was ſpent in Liſting, and <hi>Monday</hi> Morning; but in the Afternoon we Marched out of <hi>Lime</hi> for <hi>Axminſter,</hi> a little Town four Mile off, our Party was near 2000 Foot, and 300 Horſe, though we Landed not full a hundred Men, and all theſe in the ſpace of four days: About two Miles from <hi>Lime</hi> we eſpied the Duke of <hi>Albermarle,</hi> with about 4000 Men, deſigning that Night to Quarter in the ſame Town, which we had News of on the Way; yet we March'd on in good Order, and came into the Town, lined all Hedges, Planted our Field-Pieces, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing more than that we ſhould give them Battle, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile from the Town; they made towards us as ſoon as they heard that we were there; but the Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi> finding his Men to be all <hi>MILITIA</hi>-Men of the County of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and that they had no Stomach to fight againſt <hi>MON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TH,</hi> Retreated, when he came within a quarter of an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Mile of the Town. He came from <hi>Exon</hi> with theſe Forces, intending to lay a Siege againſt <hi>Lime,</hi> preſuming we could not be ready in ſo ſhort a time; but finding us ſo well prepared to receive him, he wiſely Retired his Men, being in great Diſorder and Confuſion, ſuppoſing we had purſued them, which was <hi>Deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> but the Duke ſaid, <hi>It was not his buſineſs to fight yet, till his Men had been a little Diſciplin'd, but rather to make up into the Country as faſt as poſſible, to meet his Friends, not queſtioning, but there would have been in ſeveral Parts of the Kingdom ſome</hi> Action, <hi>on the News of his Succeſs;</hi> but this in the end prov'd fatal to us, for had we but followed them, we had had all their Arms, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral more Men, and might have March'd in two days with little or no Oppoſition, to the very Gates of <hi>Exon,</hi> the County-Troops reſolving not to fight us; and ſeveral came to us that Night with their Arms. But miſſing this Opportunity, we March'd on for <hi>Taunton,</hi> Lodging at ſeveral ſmall Towns by the way, which ſtill received us as kindly as poſſible, and all the way met with the loud Acclamations of the Country, Praying God to ſucceed our Arms:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> we came to <hi>Taunton,</hi> about Twenty Mile from <hi>Lime.</hi> To give a particular Account of our Reception here,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93489:10"/>
would be too tedious; the Streets throng'd with People we could ſcarce enter, all endeavouring to manifeſt their Joy at his coming, and their Houſes, Doors, and Streets garniſhed with Green Boughs, Herbs and Flowers, all the Emblems of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity.</p>
            <p>The next day, Twenty-ſix young Gentlewomen, Virgins with Colours ready made at the charge of the <hi>Towns-men,</hi> preſented them to his Grace; the Captain of them went before with a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked-Sword</hi> in one Hand, and a ſmall curious <hi>Bible</hi> in the other, which ſhe preſented alſo, making a ſhort Speech, at which the Duke was extreamly ſatisfied, and he aſſured her, <hi>He came now in the Field, with a Deſign to Defend the Truths contained therein, and to Seal it with his Blood, if there ſhould be any Occaſion for it.</hi> Nothing now could content the Countrey, but he muſt be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed KING, which he ſeemed exceeding averſe to; and really I am of Opinion, from his very Heart.</p>
            <p>They ſaid, <hi>The Reaſon why the Gentry of</hi> England <hi>moved not, was becauſe he came on a Common-Wealth-Principle;</hi> This being the Cry of all the Army, he was forced to yield to it, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning he was Proclaimed; In the Afternoon came out Three PROCLAMATIONS, one ſetting a Sum of Money on the Kings Head, as he had done before by the other. The Second, Declaring the Parliament of <hi>England, A Seditious Aſſembly;</hi> and if they did not ſeparate before the End of <hi>June,</hi> to give Power and Authority to any that would attempt to lay hold of them as Rebels and Traytors. The Third, To De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi> a Traytor, (who now lay within ſix Miles of us, having had time to Rally his Men) if he laid not down his Arms; forthwith a Meſſage alſo was ſent to command him, but he ſent Word, <hi>That he was a Subject to</hi> JAMES <hi>the</hi> Second, <hi>the late King's Brother, and that he knew no other Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We tarried here till <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, and then March'd for <hi>Bridge-Water,</hi> ſeven Miles from thence: We were now between four and five thouſand Men, and had we not wanted Arms, could have made above ten thouſand. We were receiv'd here as in other Places, but did little more than Read our <hi>Declaration,</hi> which we did alſo in all other <hi>Towns,</hi> the Magiſtrates ſtanding
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93489:11"/>
by in their Gowns; and likewiſe our <hi>Proclamations,</hi> and ſo March'd forward for <hi>Glaſsenbury,</hi> from <hi>Glaſſenbury</hi> deſign'd for <hi>Briſtel,</hi> three days March from that place, deſigning to Attacque it: Accordingly we Arrived at <hi>Canſhum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bridge,</hi> a little Town three Miles <hi>Engliſh</hi> from <hi>Briſtol,</hi> intending to enter next Morning, the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> being there with a Garriſon of about <hi>Four Thouſand Men,</hi> being here lodg'd in the Town, we were on a ſudden Alarm'd with the Noiſe of the Approach of the Enemy, being in no ſmall Confuſion on this unſuſpected News: The Duke ſent one up the Tower to ſee whether he could diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them Marching, as ſoon as he came up, he ſaw them at the very Entrance into the Town fighting with our Men. Here we had a ſmall Skirmiſh, our Men being in the Fields Adjoyning to the Town refreſhing themſelves; but it laſted not long, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could bring Word, they were fled, being not above ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Horſe-Men; they did us Miſchief, Killed and Wounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Twenty Men, whereas we killed none of theirs, only took four Priſoners and their Horſes, and Wounded my Lord <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> that it was thought Mortal; they came thither, thinking it had been their own Forces, and had not our Undiſciplin'd Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows been a little too eager, and ſuffer'd them to come a little farther on, they would have entred the Town, and we muſt have had every Man of them; their Infantry was following, but on their Return came not forward. Theſe Forces being ſo near, and <hi>Briſtol</hi> being ſo well Mann'd alſo, the Duke was loth to paſs the Bridge for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> though ſome <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that came over with us, and were Preſcribed upon the Account of the former <hi>Plot,</hi> being <hi>Briſtol</hi>-Men, and knew the Hearts of the <hi>Towns-Men,</hi> begg'd him heartily to proceed towards it, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to go in the Head of them into the Town, by ſome private Ways which they knew, aſſuring him, <hi>They would make no Reſiſtance,</hi> but could not perſwade him; which had we been Poſſeſſors of, we could not have wanted Money nor Arms, the only things needful for us in that Juncture; for had we but had Arms, I am perſwaded we had by this time, had in the leaſt Twenty Thouſand Men; and it would not then have been diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for us to have March'd to <hi>London,</hi> with the Recruit of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the King not being able to make 7000 Men for the gaining of ſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93489:11"/>
many Kingdoms. But God ſaw it not fit for us, and over-ruled our Conſultations to our own Ruine, for this was in the top of our Proſperity; and yet all the while, not a Gentleman more than went over with us came to our Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>So we Marcht on to <hi>Bath,</hi> we lay before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it in the Afternoon, and ſent in our <hi>Trumpeter</hi> to demand the Town, but they refuſed to give us enterance having a ſtrong Garriſon, it being a ſtout People and a ſtrong place. Having no mind to ſpend time in laying Sieges, we marcht on that day to a little Town called <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips-Norton,</hi> and there lay that night, being now <hi>Sunday</hi> the 26th of <hi>June,</hi> Old-Style, Saturday Morning preparing for</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frome,</hi> we were drawing out our baggage for our march, and on a ſuddain were alarmed with the appearance of the Enemy, who had entered the Town and had lined all the Hedges and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Fire on us; here began the briskeſt Rencounter we yet had, and for an hour or more we had a brisk Skirmiſh, but at laſt we beat them back, killing about thirty which lay in the place, and we loſt about ten in all, and a few Wounded; they retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their whole Army, Pitched within a mile of the Town; and we went out alſo and pitched near them, but out of Musket Shot, playing Cannon on one another for ſome hours; they kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us but one Man all the while, but with ours we did great Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, having the advantage of the ground, ſo at laſt they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, and I have been told loſt ſome hundreds of Men in the Battle, both killed and wounded: So we march'd on for <hi>Frome,</hi> a Town where we was as well beloved as at <hi>Taunton,</hi> where we wanted for nothing but Arms, which were by a ſtratagem taken from them a few days before our Entrance. Here came the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected News of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s being Defeated, and likewiſe of the advance of the King's Force from <hi>London</hi> with conſiderable Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and thirty Field-Pieces. This News, together with our want of Money and Arms, not ſeeing which way to avoid theſe Forces, we were at a ſtand, and not a little <hi>non-plus'd.</hi> 'Twas at laſt agreed on, that we that came with the Duke ſhould get good Horſes that Night, and ſo for <hi>Pool,</hi> a little Sea-Port Town not far off, where we were to ſeize a Ship, and ſet forth for <hi>Holland</hi> again, leaving our Infantry to the Mercy of the Country.</p>
            <p>This was much like that Reſolution of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93489:12"/>
time of the Civil War with <hi>Spain,</hi> being as we then were, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of making better Terms, and not daring to enter <hi>Salisbury Plain,</hi> becauſe their Horſe being ſo much better then ours, their Men being all Diſciplin'd, ours not, we could not Face them in ſo plain and open a Country, ſo that we retreated backward, in the mean time reſolving to ſee what <hi>London</hi> would do, having a good an opportunity offered them: The Soldiers being called forth, and not two thouſand Men to be had for their defence if they had but attempted any thing; this diſheartned our Men, and ſeveral of them coming home to their own Country, having felt by experience the hardſhips of War, withdrew from us.</p>
            <p>We came well back again to <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> and were received with wonted Love; we arrived here on Friday the 3d. of <hi>July,</hi> and reſolved here to Fortifie ſo as to hold our ground till we heard from <hi>London.</hi> Saturday in the Afternoon News was brought of the Approach of the Kings Forces within a Mile and a half of the Town where they had Encamped, the Duke went up into the Tower and there took a view of them, and ſeeing them ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and their Horſe at ſome diſtance from the Army, in a little Town, the Infantry being in <hi>Sedge Moore.</hi> He called a Councel on it, and it was concluded on, that we ſhould fall on them in the dead of the Night, accordingly having a Guide to conduct us on in a private way, we Marcht out about Eleven of the Clock in the Night, and about one fell on them in their Tents. There was a Ditch between us, and the Guide promiſed to conduct them over an eaſie formable Place, but our Men ſeeing the Enemy juſt before them, ran furiouſly on and loſt the Guide, ſo that while they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to recover over that place the Enemy got on their Legs, and put themſelves in Order, and now began as fierce a Battle as perhaps ever was fought in <hi>England</hi> in ſo ſhort a time, our Foot fought as well as ever Foot fought, but not a Horſe came up; had our Horſe but aſſiſted, we muſt have beaten them out of the Field. But our Horſes would not ſtand at the noiſe of Drums and Guns, ſo that we ſoon loſt two of our Pieces of Ordinance, and we had but four in all, and then but one more in the Field, our Foot flung moſt of their ſhot over, ſo that the Men for the moſt part was kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Rear, and that run, but the Front ſtood ſtill, and had we done but as much Execution in the Front as we did in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93489:12"/>
Rear, the day had been our own, but God would not have it, their time was not then come: By this time their Horſes came up, and having ſix or eight hundred good diſciplined Men, well Mounted and well Arm'd, ours neither; our Foot having ſhot away all their Ammunition, and our Baggage being not then in the Field, they were forced to Retreat, being all in Confuſion.</p>
            <p>Having no Mony left, and our Party thus unexpectedly repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Duke ſeeing he could not hold it any longer, Fled with my Lord <hi>Gray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dukes Party was ſaid to be about three thouſand Foot, and a thouſand Horſe; we had more, at leaſt five thouſand Men and Horſe, but not well Arm'd, yet in the Field. 'Tis ſaid we loſt not above three hundred, and they Foot; but after when we were routed in our retreat loſt a vaſt many more; tho they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued not in ſome hours after.</p>
            <p>The moſt remarkable Perſons that were taken in this total Rout, were Collonel <hi>Holmes,</hi> Major <hi>Perrot,</hi> the Conſtable of <hi>Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> Servant to the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Field was clear of the Dukes Men, the Earl of <hi>Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham</hi> Marched with five hundred Foot and a Party of Horſe and Dragoons to <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> where he found the Dukes Forces that were left there, fled and diſperſed into ſeveral Places: When his Lordſhip having left theſe Men in the Town, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Collonel <hi>Kirk,</hi> and hearing the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was fled with about fifty Horſe, the greateſt number of the Dukes Men that were left together, he ſent out divers Parties in purſuit of him and others that fled the Field. When on the 7th of <hi>July,</hi> about five in the Morning, ſome of the Lord <hi>Lumly</hi>'s Men ſeized the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and another Perſon near <hi>Holt-Lodge</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> four miles from the Weſt of <hi>Ringwood;</hi> and the ſaid Lord <hi>Lumly</hi> making further inquiry among the Cotts, was informed by one <hi>Anna Ferrant</hi> that two Men went over a Hedge, proving to be the out bounds of many Incloſures, ſome of which were over grown with Fern, others with Peaſe and Oats; but Guards being ſet u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Avenues, after divers attempts to eſcape, the <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> one of the Parties obſerved to enter the Ground, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the 8th day of <hi>July,</hi> about five in the Morning, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing he departed from the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> about one of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93489:13"/>
the Clock that morning in the out-bounds, diligent ſearch was made; when about Eleven of the Clock the ſame morning he was found, by one <hi>Henry Parking,</hi> hid in a Ditch, covered with Fern, who calling others to aſſiſt him, the ſaid late Duke was in the end Taken, and together with the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and the <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi> with a ſtrong Guard brought by eaſie Journeys to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where they arrived on the 13th of <hi>July,</hi> and after ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination were committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> when on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 15th of <hi>July,</hi> the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> purſuant to a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Signed for his Execution, upon his Attaindure of <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> was delivered to the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> about Ten in the morning, and conducted to a Scaffold erected on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> where after about half an hours continuance, he laying down his Head, had it ſtriken off by the Executioner, the which, together with his Body, being put into a Coffin co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Velvet, were carried away in a Velvet-covered Hearſe, in order to his Interment.</p>
            <p>After the Duke was Beheaded, many Priſoners taken, and thoſe that fled by Parcels, taken up and down, were ſecured in divers Goals, in order to their Proſecution, as was ſaid accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law; which was the Occaſion of this great Man's ſhewing his parts at that Degree as he did, no one elſe fit to be made a Tool for ſuch a Bloody Tragedy as he acted.</p>
            <p>The Tryals were deferred (for ſome time after the fatal Blow given to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> which was the 15th of <hi>July</hi> following) becauſe of my Lords being at <hi>Tunbridge;</hi> but the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he with a ſpecial Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> aſſiſted with four other Judges, ſet forward with a Party of Horſe, and made by ſpecial Commiſſion their General. The firſt place he came at was <hi>Winchester,</hi> where were divers Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners on Suſpition; but here began the Tragedy, for the Lady <hi>Liſle</hi> was there Arraigned for <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> in Harboring Mr. <hi>Hicks</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nelphrope,</hi> that had been concerned with the Duke; the Lady being on Tryal, the Jury were diſſatisfied once and again; but my Lords Threats and other Managery, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Jury, that at laſt they brought the Lady in Guilty; on which he pronounced the Sentence of Death on her, as uſual in ſuch Caſes; but ſhe had the favour of being Beheaded; their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93489:13"/>
Priſoners were carried to <hi>Salisbury;</hi> and this was the moſt remarkable thing at that Aſſizes.</p>
            <p>From thence they ſet forward for <hi>Salisbury,</hi> where were many Priſoners that had been pick'd up and down the Countrey, then in the Goal, the which, with thoſe that were brought from <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> were ordered to be carried to <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> there not being Evidence enough to accompliſh what was then deſigned by my Lord; ſo that little of moment paſſed there, but to purſue the Matter proceeds from thence to <hi>Dorchſter,</hi> where he with his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, Gown-Men and Sword-Men, Arrived on the 3d. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> on which day being <hi>Thurſday,</hi> the Commiſſion was Read. <hi>Friday</hi> Morning was an Excellent Sermon Preached before their Lordſhips, by a worthy Divine, Chaplain to a worthy Perſon of that County, much tending to Mercy: It was obſerved, that while my Lord Chief-Juſtice was at Church in Prayers, as well as at Sermon, he was ſeen to laugh, which was ſo unbecoming a Perſon in his Character, that ought in ſo weighty an Affair as he was then entring upon, to have been more ſerious, and have cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Help and Aſſiſtance of God Almighty.</p>
            <p>The Sermon being over, their Lordſhips repaired to the Court, which by Order of the Lord Chief-Juſtice was hung with Red Cloath, a Colour ſuitable to ſuch a ſucceeding bloody Tragedy, being accompanied by a Numerous Company of the Gentry of that County, as well as the Flower of the Neighbouring Counties of <hi>Somerſet</hi> and <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and then proceeded to give his Charge; in which Charge, by reaſon of the Severity of his Sentiments, and Poſitions laid down to make Diſcoveries of all ſuch as were Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Aidors or Aſſiſters to the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> on Pain of <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> which was a great Surprize to all the Auditors, and ſo vehemently Urged, and ſo paſſionately Expreſſed, as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather the Language of a <hi>Romiſh Inquifitor,</hi> than a <hi>Proteſtant Judge;</hi> and then Adjourned until eight of the Clock next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when was a Bill found againſt Thirty Perſons, charged for <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> for Aiding and Aſſiſting the late Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth;</hi> who put themſelves on their Tryals, notwithſtanding my Lord's threatning, <hi>That in Caſe any did put themſelves on Tryal, and the Country found them Guilty, they ſhould have but a little Time to live;</hi> and at the ſame time Inſinuated, <hi>That</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:93489:14"/>
               <hi>it were better to Plead Guilty, if they expected any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Thirty being on Tryal, the Evidences being Sworn and Examined before the <hi>J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RY:</hi> Upon the whole, by the violent Deportment of the <hi>Lord Chief-Juſtice,</hi> and ſharpneſs of the <hi>J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RY,</hi> they found Twenty-nine GUILTY, though ſome of them were very hardly dealt with, and not ſo Criminal as my Lord and their Countrey imagined. Particularly amongſt the Twenty-nine, were Mr. <hi>Matthew Brag</hi> of <hi>Thorncomb,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Speed</hi> of <hi>Culliton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> Conſtable of <hi>Chardſtock,</hi> in the ſaid County; and <hi>George Seward,</hi> of <hi>Culliton</hi> aforeſaid: The Circumſtances of each of theſe, and the ſeverity of their being found Guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be ſhewed in its proper place, before we take leave of this Town, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on in this <hi>Weſtern</hi> Expedition.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Twenty-nine being found (as before) Guilty, my Lord immediately pronounced Sentence of Death on them all, an uſual in Caſes of <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> and did the ſame Night give a Warrant to the Sheriff, for the Execution of thirteen of the twenty-nine on Monday following; which accordingly was done, notwithſtanding great Application was made to the Lord Chif-Juſtice by Gentlemen of the beſt Quality, in this and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries, for a Reprieve of Mr. <hi>Bragg,</hi> to all which he was Deaf, and not to be prevailed upon; though he was aſſured of his Honeſty, and true Conformity to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet it availed nothing. At laſt, it was only requeſted for ten days Reſpite, yet that had no better Effect; but on <hi>Monday,</hi> he with twelve more of that number, were accordingly Executed at <hi>Dorcheſter.</hi> The Chriſtian like Deportment, and other things, relating to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Bragg</hi> and others, ſhall be made out before we leave this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, this Proceeding was deſigned to ſhorten Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and to wheedle the reſt that were to follow, to a Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which without it, the tenth part of them could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Guilty; a Method was alſo taken without Preſident, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap many poor Ignorant People, by a couple of Officers that were ſent into the Goal, to call over, and take the Names of the Priſoners; on Promiſe, if they confeſt, they might expect Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93489:14"/>
otherwiſe not; which many did. And this was Written ſo, that had they pleaded not Guilty, theſe two were deſigned to have been Evidences againſt them from their own Confeſſions, which ſo diſpoſed the remaining great Numbers, that all, except a very few, Pleaded Guilty, which put an end to any further Tryal.</p>
            <p>The only thing remaining<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was the pronouncing of Sentence on them, which were in Number 292. who received Sentence of Death all at once. One Mr. <hi>Laurence</hi> put himſelf in Tryal, but by the Jury found Guilty, whoſe Caſe was ſo hard, his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances being ſo ſmall to be condemned to die; and had actually ſuffered, had not Application been made to my Lords Favourites, and with the payment and ſecuring of 400 <hi>l.</hi> preſerved him from Execution; his Caſe being ſo remarkable, his Defence ſo honeſt, that we cannot paſs it by in Silence: the particulars of which, you ſhall have in its proper Place, with others that are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.</p>
            <p>This Matter being Adjuſted, and Execution Awarded to about Eighty, which were Executed, and their Quarters ſent up and down the Countrey to the dread of their Spectators, as well as the Anoyance of the Travellers; his extraordinary Whippings, though unmerciful, are not to be taken notice of; ſo we leave this place, and proceed towards the City of <hi>Exon:</hi> In their way thither, lying at an Honourable Gentlemans Houſe, divers of the Neighbouring Pariſhes made their Petitous to the <hi>Lord-Chief Juſtice</hi> in behalf of ſome Relations concerned; it hapned that through ſome Diſorder amongſt his Servants, ſome Piſtols were fired in the Night, which gave him a Suſpicion, or at leaſt he took it, of ſome deſign upon him; on which at parting, ſaid, <hi>Not a Man of all thoſe Pariſhes that were of that Vicinitude, if found Guilty, ſhould eſcape.</hi> And ſo we proceed and arrive at <hi>Exon,</hi> where to the number of 243 Priſoners being in Cuſtody for aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the ſaid Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> one amongſt the reſt, Mr. <hi>Fower Acers</hi> Pleading not Guilty, he being found by the Jury, the ſaid Lord Chief Juſtice immediately pronounced the Sentence upon him, and immediate Execution, which was done to terrifie the reſt, who all Pleaded Guilty; ſo that theſe unfortunate People had not time to have the fairneſs of Tryals allowed them, which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93489:15"/>
is a right due by the Laws of God and Man. The remaining num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he all condemned, and here was a little ſparing; not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny order'd Execution as was in the other County, but thoſe that were Executed, were hung up and down in moſt Towns of the County, and then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Quarters and Heads ſcattered up and down their High-ways and publick places. An extraordinary Sentence of ſevere Whipping was pronounced againſt Mr. <hi>Samuel Staple</hi> of <hi>Thorncomb</hi> in the ſaid County, which in its proper place, you ſhall have an account of the Crime; but theſe are Trifles, and we ſhall endeavour to purſue our Deſign and make as quick Diſpatch as we can, that time may not be loſt, the King ſerved, and this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants thirſt quenched with Proteſtant Blood, which is always well pleaſing to Inquiſitors, and ſo proceed to the Town of <hi>Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> At which place being Arrived, it was thought fit by the <hi>Lord Chief-Juſtice</hi> to be as expeditious as might be; ſo that late in the Afternoon the Court ſat, where the Commiſſion being Read, he proceeded to give the Charge, which was ſo very keen and full of ſharp Invectives, as if the Countrey it-ſelf had not been able to make Expiation to his Lordſhip, to quench his Thirſt in the Blood of thoſe that ventur'd their all in Defence of the <hi>Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and here we enter upon the bloodieſt part of the Tragedy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In this Town, and at <hi>Wells</hi> in the ſaid County, were more than 500 Priſoners.</p>
            <p>To begin at <hi>Taunton;</hi> the next Morning after the Charge giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, the Aſſizes began, where ſome few put themſelves on Trial, who were found Guilty, and immediately ordered to be Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; of which number, one Mr. <hi>Simon Hamlin</hi> was one, who was a zealous worthy good Man, and his Caſe no way dangerous; but on the contrary, had he had to do with a Judge of another Stamp; his particular Caſe you ſhall have before we conclude. To proceed to the reſt, this firſt Cruelty cauſed the reſt to Plead Guilty in hopes of Favour, which was only a few days to live, which thoſe that Pleaded had not. Amongſt theſe at <hi>Taunton</hi> were divers eminent Perſons that had been taken in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and carried to <hi>London,</hi> and brought down there to compleat the Bloody Tragedy in thoſe parts: Mr. <hi>Parrot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hewling</hi> the Elder, Mr. <hi>Liſle,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hucker,</hi> and divers others were very Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. To take notice of every particular in this Matter, will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93489:15"/>
alter our Deſign, and ſwell the Book to too great a Bulk, being only deſigned for a Pocket Companion, and uſeful it may be, to ſee the Cruelty of men when in their Power, and how the Devil ſtirreth up his Inſtruments, to purſue thoſe that adventure for the Cauſe of God and Religion. Here were in this County Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted 239. the reſt that were Condemned, were Tranſported, except ſuch as were able to furniſh Coin, and that not a little, for an account was taken of mens Abilities, according to which, the purchaſe for Life muſt be managed by two of his Favourites, who had a ſmall ſhare, the reſt went into his Lordſhips Pocket; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Actions of <hi>Rome,</hi> where Sins of any kind may be pardoned for money. This indeed was a glorious deſign in the Eye of <hi>Mother Church,</hi> to Root out Hereſie by Executions and Tranſportations, to make room for a pack; here Expedition muſt be made to conclude at <hi>Wells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for that a great man being fallen, our great Judge deſigning his Chair, which in ſhort, he had as the Reward of ſo Eminent and extraordinary a piece of Service as he did for Advancement of the <hi>Roman Catholicks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſt, which is cruel always where it prevails.</p>
            <p>Thus we leave the Town of <hi>Taunton,</hi> after awarding Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to many there, and their Quarters to be ſcattered up and down the County; and ſo we proceed to <hi>Wells,</hi> where divers Priſoners that had been carried from Goal to Goal, in Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of Evidence againſt them, were in Carts removed to <hi>Wells;</hi> in which place, to finiſh this Expedition, the ſame Method as was at the former Aſſizes, was alſo taken here by a ſevere Charge, affronting the Gentlemen of this County, as he had done in all the Counties before, terrifying the Juries (when any Pleaded to make them to bring in the Perſons Guilty; ſome of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-awed, and it is doubted, contrary to their Judgments, which if ſo, <hi>the Lord forgive them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here were many Eminent and Worthy Perſons that received the Sentence of Death, but the Executions of the County being put together, as you have before ſeen, we make no particular Diviſion of the Number here, and the number at <hi>Taunton,</hi> the whole being Recited before: We ſhall therefore endeavour to be as brief as we can, to give you what we think Material, and truly matter of Fact; my Lord now being come to conclude
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93489:16"/>
this extraordinary Commiſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; in haſte to be Elevated, maketh all manner of Diſpatch to repair to the King then at <hi>Windſor,</hi> to give an Account of his Tranſactions, and to receive the Reward of his merritorious Service in this Butchering of Proteſtants, which is ſo acceptable to his Holineſs, and his Bigotted Diſciples, as nothing can be more; and indeed if you will believe them, a Work that merits Heaven at laſt, beſides what temporal Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are thought fit in this World. If this cruel Judge were a true Proteſtant, his Caſe is much the more worſe, being made uſe of as a Tool to deſtroy, and carry on <hi>Popiſh Deſigns?</hi> Thus the Affairs being ended, the Country filled with Heads and Quarters of thoſe that were Executed, the reſt that had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to purchaſe their Lives, left in Cuſtody in order to Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation; my Lord being come to the King to give an account of his Affairs in the <hi>West,</hi> the great Seal being to be diſpoſed of by the Death of the late Keeper, he kiſs'd the King's Hand for it, and was made Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> which was only an earneſt of his Deſert for ſo eminent and extraordinary a piece of Service, ſo now that which remains, is to give an Account of divers that had fled, and hid themſelves up and down in Holes and Privacies, whoſe Friends make all Application to ſome great Men or other to procure their Pardons; ſome to this, and others to ſuch as they thought Favourites of the King; but the Rewards muſt be Aſſertained before any Application could be made: Divers Liſts being ſent up, and the Rewards Aſſertained, which amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them put together, did amount to conſiderable, ſo that it was now, who could find a Friend to Relieve his Diſtreſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which were forced to wander up and down in Caves and Deſarts, for fear of being taken; but this Misfortune at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Agents, that unleſs my Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi> were uſed, by his Creatures, that were allowed by him ſo to do; other Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions commonly met with Diſappointments, which cauſed an Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation amongſt the great men; one ſuppoſing to have deſerved the Kings Ear as well as the other, which cauſed other meaſures to be taken, though ſome were whedled out of their Money: At laſt came out a general Pardon, with Exceptions, very few, if any of thoſe that were ſolicited for, not being Excepted, were of courſe Pardoned; but however, divers Sums of Money having
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93489:16"/>
been paid, no Reſtitution to be had, for <hi>from Hell is no Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> A Worthy <hi>Weſtern</hi> Gentleman, his purchaſe came to 15 or 16000 Guineas, which my Lord Chancellour had. Amongſt the Exceptions, were a parcel of <hi>Taunton</hi> Girls, ſome of which were Children of eight or ten years old, however ſomething was to be made of them, if theſe Ladies were Judged Guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for preſenting the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> with Colours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for to preſerve theſe from Trials, they were given to the Maids of Honour to make up their <hi>Chriſtmas Box;</hi> ſo that an Agent of theirs was ſent down into the Country, to compound with their Parents, to preſerve them from what might after follow, if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſo, that ſome according to Ability, gave <hi>100l.</hi> others <hi>50l.</hi> all which, however did not anſwer the Ladies firſt Expectations; yet it did ſatisfie, and they were accordingly Pardoned: Thus we have given you an Account of what hath happened on this occaſion, being in every point Truth: We might have farther Enlarged, but that would have ſpoiled the Deſign, and ſwoln our Pocket Companion to a Volumn too big.</p>
            <p>We ſhall only according to our promiſe, give the particular Caſes of ſome of thoſe that were Condemned and Executed; as alſo of ſome others that were moſt eminent, of their Dying Words, and of their Chriſtian-like behaviour at the place of Execution; which may ſerve as an encouragement to all true Proteſtants to go on in their Chriſtian Profeſſion, and not to waver, God Almighty being able to ſweeten the Bittereſt Sufferings, and will make good his Promiſe, <hi>Never to leave nor forſake thoſe that are his.</hi>

               <p>WE begin with Mr. <hi>Matthew Bragg,</hi> who was a Gentleman, and deſcended from an Antient and Good Family; he was bred an Attorney, in which he practiſed the Law, his Caſe being this; He hapned to be upon the Road Riding Home to his Houſe, being come from a Gentleman's Houſe for whom he kept

               <p>Next Place was <hi>Lime,</hi> where many of Note dyed: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, Coll. <hi>Holmes,</hi> who was the firſt of thoſe there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, near the ſame Place where they Landed, when they came aſhoar with the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>M.</hi> being brought to the Place of Execution after ſome difficulty; for the Horſes that were firſt put into the Sled would not ſtir, which obliged thoſe concerned to get others, which they did from the Coachman, who had that Morning brought them to Town; when they were put into the Seld, they broke it in pieces, which cauſed the Priſoners to go on foot to the Place of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution; where being come, as I told you before, the Coll. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus at the Foot of the Ladder, he ſate down with an Aſpect altogether void of Fear; but on the contrary with a kind of a ſmiling countenance, ſo began to ſpeak to the Spectators, to this purpoſe, That he would give them an Account of his firſt Undertaking in the deſign, which was long before in <hi>London,</hi> for there he agreed to ſtand by and aſſiſt the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>M.</hi> when opportunity offered, in order to which, he went to <hi>Holland</hi> with him, and there continued, until this Expedition, in which God had thought fit to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate his and other good Mens Expectations; He believed, the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> was bleeding, and in a ſtep towards Extirpation, and therefore he with theſe his Brethren, that were to ſuffer with him, and Thouſands more had adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

He with a ſmiling countenance, anſwered, I am ſorry you do not yet underſtand the difference between Speaking and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and having ended his Diſcourſe, he then prepared himſelf by <hi>Prayer</hi> for his Diſſolution, which was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and pious for half an hour; but in it not mentioning the Name of the <hi>King,</hi> was charged as before, to which he replyed, as he was a man, he prayed for him in General, praying for All mankind.</p>
               <p>After having ended his <hi>Prayer,</hi> he took occaſion to ſpeak to his ſuffering Brethren, taking a ſolemn leave of them, incouraging them to hold out to the end, and not to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obſerving that this being a Glorious Sun Shining day, I doubt not though our Breakfaſt be ſharp and bitter, it will prepare us, and make us meet for a comfortable Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, with our God and Saviour, where all Sin and ſorrow ſhall be wiped away, ſo embracing each of them, and kiſſing of them, told, the Sheriff, you ſee I am imperfect only one Arm, I ſhall want Aſſiſtance to help me upon this Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Stage, which was preſently done, and Execution ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly followed, after which followed Mr. <hi>Sampſon Larke,</hi> who was a very eminent pious Man, and had lived in that Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but little before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many Years, he was there well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all People that knew him had a value for him,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93489:21"/>
behaving himſelf with that Humility and Circumſpection as no body could have any other occaſion but, to value him, he deſigned to have ſpoken ſomewhat on a portion of Scripture, and was beginning, having mentioned the place he intended to ſpeak upon, but was interrupted and told, the work of the day being great, they ſhould want time. So then he ſtopt and replyed, he could make application where he ſhould not meet with interuption, and ſo apply'd himſelf to Prayer, which he performed with great Devotion and Zeal, for a quarter of an hour to the great ſatisfaction of the Auditors, and ſo taking leave of his ſuffering Brethren, he mounted the Stage, which was to be the laſt Act he made in this World, being on the Ladder he ſaw ſome of his Friends and Neighbours, weeping and mourning for him, to whom he ſpake, pray weep not for me, I am going to a place of Bliſs and Happineſs, wherefore pray repair to your Houſes, and 'ere you get thither, I doubt not, but I ſhall be happy with my God and Saviour, where all tears ſhall be wiped away, and nothing ſhall remain but Hallelujahs to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>There was alſo Mr. <hi>William Hewling</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> a young Gentleman under twenty, who came over with the D. of M. he ſeemed to be in a calm, and compoſed frame of Spirit, and with a great deal of Courage and Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, he behaved himſelf; there is already ſomething ſaid of his converſe and diſcourſe, which amongſt others is Printed; therefore we ſhall ſay nothing more of him, but that in all manner of Appearance he dyed a good Chriſtian, true Proteſtant, and doubtleſs now enjoys the benefit of it: there were ſeveral worthy Men more there Executed, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr, <hi>Chriſtopher Battiſcombe,</hi> Dr. <hi>Temple,</hi> Captain <hi>Madders,</hi> Captain <hi>Mathews,</hi> Captain <hi>Kid, &amp;c.</hi> in all twelve, who all of them dyed with that Courage and

Reſolution as became Chriſtians, and ſuch who eminently had adventured their Lives and Fortunes, in defence of what was moſt dear to them, and namely our Religion, which though God did not think thoſe fit to defend and ſecure it yet in his infinite wiſdom, we hope it will be in ſome meaſure ſecured by other Inſtruments, the Glory of the ſame being only due to him. So that now leaving this Place, we proceed to other parts of the Country, where with the like Butchery were only five Executed, amongſt which was one M. <hi>Tyler</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who had had Command in the Dukes Army, where he behaved himſelf very ſtoutly to the laſt, after the Army was diſperſed, he amongſt others were taken, received Sentence of Death at <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and here brought for the Completion of the ſame, and from hence we hope was Tranſlated to Heaven;—he ſpent his time between the Sentence and Execution very devoutly, in confirming and ſtrengthening thoſe that were to be his fellow Sufferers. And made it his buſineſs, to bring them to a willingneſs to ſubmit to, and a prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for, Death; The day being come and he brought to the Place of Execution, he thus ſpoke,—my Friends you ſee I am now on the brink of Eternity, and in a few minutes, ſhall be but Clay, you expect I ſhould ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as is uſual in ſuch caſes; as to the matter of fact I dye for, it doth not much trouble me, knowing to my ſelf the ends for which I ingaged with the D. of M. were both good and honourable; here being ſtop'd, and not ſuffered to proceed farther; he then comforted his fellow ſufferers, deſiring them to joyn with him in Singing a Hymn, which he himſelf compoſed for the occaſion as followeth.</p>

Mr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> of <hi>Yeovel,</hi> in the County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary deportment and carriage at the Place of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, was ſo very conſiderable, as gave great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his Friends, and Amazement to his Enemies; he declared to the World, that he dyed a true Proteſtant, and had not ingaged with the D. of M. but Judged it high time to ſtand up for the Defence of the ſame, though God Almighty had thought fit, to fruſtrate his deſigns and to bring him to that Place, to Seal the ſame with his Blood; alſo <hi>John Savage</hi> and <hi>Richard Hall</hi> of <hi>Culliton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> ſuffered at the ſame time and Place in their particular Converſation, they valued moſt thoſe that they ſaw moſt of Piety in, and pittyed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that they ſaw not ſo well prepared, ſaying that the remembrance of our vanity, may cauſe compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch as were in ſuch a Condition, exhorting all to be ſerious and to conſider their latter end, which deſerved the greateſt attention of mind, the way to dye comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly being to prepare for it ſeriouſly, and if God ſhould miraculouſly preſerve us from this Death now before our Eyes; It ſhould be the duty of us all to ſpend the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of our time, in ſuch a manner as now when we ſee death juſt at the Door<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At the hour of Execution, their chearfulneſs and comfort was much increaſed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now the will of God will be done, and he hath moſt certainly choſen that for us which is beſt, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like Chriſtian expreſſions, too tedious here to be inſerted, becauſe we deſign to keep to our firſt intentions, and not to ſwell this Treatiſe too big. Upon the whole, after they had with much earneſtneſs, recommended their Souls to the all wiſe God by Prayer, they all with much content and ſatisfaction, ſubmitted themſelves to the Executioner, not doubting of a happy Tranſlation, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93489:23"/>
accordingly were Executed and quartered; before the reſt of the Executions in this County, as at <hi>Weymouth, Pool<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Shafton, Wimborne, &amp;c.</hi> Not being there, we ſhall paſs over, and only give you particular touches, which we ſaw to our perfect knowledge, and ſo we return to <hi>Culliton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

After Reading a Chapter out of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Pſalm ſuitable to the occaſion, he very vehemently and fervently recommended his Soul to the all-wiſe God by Prayer, for near half an hour to the great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all that heard him; then his Wife and Children
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93489:24"/>
coming to him weeping bitterly, he imbraced them in his Arms, ſaying, weep not for me; but weep for your ſelves and for your Sins, for that he had that quiet ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he was only going to be Tranſlated into a ſtate of Bliſs and Happineſs; where he ſhould ſin and ſorrow no more; but that all Tears ſhould be wiped away, wiſhing them to be diligent in the Service of God, then recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Wife and Children, to the protection of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who had promiſed to be a Husband to the Widdow, and a Father to the Fatherleſs, who was faithful and able to make up their loſs in him, in that which ſhould be better for them, then he could be, deſiring God to be a Refuge for them to fly to for ſecurity, and preſervation from the troubles that ſeemed to threaten this poor Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the which if they did conſcientiouſly perform, though death here made a ſeparation, he doubted not of meeting them in Heaven at laſt, and ſo the Executioner did his Office, during which time his Brother-ſufferer, <hi>William Cleg</hi> was all the time on his Knees, Praying to himſelf, with a ſeeming Zeal, ſuddainly after which his turn being come to follow his Brother, he only told the People that his fellow-ſuffer, had ſpoken vvhat he thought vvas neceſſary, and they were alſo his ſentiments, and ſo ſubmitted to Execution.</p>

               <p>THus having finiſhed what we have to ſay at preſent ſhall only add the Caſe of one Mr. <hi>Simon Hamling</hi> at <hi>Taunton,</hi> to ſhew that ſometimes Innocency will not protect: Mr. <hi>Hamling</hi> was formerly an Inhabitant of the place, but of late years had lived 2 or 3 miles from thence; he was a very honeſt, worthy, good <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but was a <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> and indeed in the Judgment of ſome fiery Men, that might be Crime enough, as did too ſadly appear in divers Caſes; but to our purpoſe; Mr. <hi>Hamling</hi> living in the Country, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>M.</hi> being in Town, he there came to ſpeak with his Son, who lived in that place, where being come he gave him advice, which was that as he expected his Bleſſing and Countenance, he ſhould not at all concern himſelf in the matter, but ſubmit to the Will of God in all things, and having thus adviſed his Son, he returns home, and two days after came again to Town, on a Market day, with his Wife to buy Proviſions for his Family, and returned to his houſe again, and this was all the times he was in Town, whiles the <hi>D.</hi> was there but after the buſineſs was over, he was brought in on ſuſpicion, being a <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> that was Crime enough, except Coin appear'd to a <hi>Juſtice</hi> of that Town, who uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did commit or diſmiſs as that appear'd; this Man was arraign'd at <hi>Taunton,</hi> pleaded not guilty; the matter above

is the Truth of this Caſe, the <hi>Evidences</hi> were two proffligate Raſcals, that had Incouragement from the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> they uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doing what he put them on; the Priſoner had many to prove this Fact and his Honeſty; but this did not avail, the Jury found him guilty, with two more, who were preſently ſentenc'd, and next <hi>Morning</hi> executed for to be <hi>Examples</hi> to others. It is ſaid that the <hi>Juſtice</hi> did make application to our famous <hi>Proteſtant Judge,</hi> and hinted ſome miſtake concerning him; to which as I have been informed, he ſhould Reply, you have brought him on, if he be innocent, his blood be upon you, which was a very fine Reply from a merciful Judge, but nothing elſe could be expected, as the whole Treatiſe evinceth.

                              <hi>Firſt,</hi> As a Dying Man I now Declare, that when I entered my ſelf with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93489:32"/>
be his Chyrurgeon, it was on no other Account but to ſerve him in the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> where I knew no other Deſign whatſoever, but to Poſſeſs himſelf of ſome of thoſe Iſlands, until I had been at Sea two days, wherein one privately told me, we were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely bound for <hi>England,</hi> and I ſhould take it from him it was true; it much ſurprized me, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no way to avoid it, or to get on ſhore, though it was at that time contrary to my Inclinations, if I could have avoided it: I would not let others ſee that I had that diſſatisfaction within me. After our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Lyme,</hi> I knew it was never the near to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt my Eſcape, the Countrey being ſo beſet; on the other hand, if the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did win the day, I might have raiſed my Fortunes as high as I could expect; theſe were the Arguments that Fleſh and Blood did create in my Breaſt for ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. While I was with the ſaid Duke, I did him as much Service as I could, and faithfully: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it pleaſed God to diſperſe that Army under his Command, I endeavoured to ſecure my ſelf, but by Providence was taken at <hi>Honyton,</hi> from thence Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Exon,</hi> and after removed to <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> where I received my Sentence, and am now as you ſee juſt going to Execution; the Lord prevent all of you from ſuch ignominious Deaths; and I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you all, that you never take any great thing in hand, but what you have a warrant for from the Lord: I aſſure you I had not ſatisfaction in this; but this I am ſure, that if I have done any thing amiſs in it, it is Pardoned: I Bleſs God I have that ſatisfaction, I dye a Profeſſor of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                              <pb n="63" facs="tcp:93489:32"/>
I deſire Pardon of all thoſe I have any ways wronged or abuſed, as I freely forgive all thoſe that have wronged or abuſed me; I am in Charity with all men. <hi>Lord have mercy upon me, give me ſtrength to go through theſe pains, and give me full Aſſurance now at this laſt moment: Come, Lord Jeſus, Come quickly.</hi>

               <p>Alſo one <hi>Samuel Robbins</hi> of <hi>Charmouth</hi> in the County of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi> that was Executed, or rather Murthered, at <hi>Warham,</hi> in the ſaid County; I cannot paſs him by in ſilence, his Caſe being ſo extraordinary hard, that to ſpeak moderately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and his Caſe, I do ſay this, that I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve never Man ſuffered innocenter; as I hope you will be ſatisfied in, after you have heard his Crime, and on what ſmall grounds he was Guilty, or ſo ſuppoſed by my Lord Chief Juſtice.</p>
               <p>He uſed generally in the Summer to uſe the Craft of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to get a competent maintenance for his Family, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be out at Sea a Fiſhing before <hi>Lyme,</hi> that day the Duke came in to land, and was commanded on board of one of the Duke's Ships, he not knowing who they were, and they bought his Fiſh of him; after which they told him that was the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> poynting at him, and that he was juſt going to Land; he deſired to go on ſhore, which was refuſed, and told, that as ſoon as the Duke was land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he ſhould have his liberty; ſo accordingly he came on ſhore, and never after was with him, or ever took up Arms under him: I leave the Reader to judge whether this was High Treaſon or no. This was all he was Guilty of, except that he was a good honeſt Man, a zealous Chriſtian, a Man of a very good Life and Converſation, as I think his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours will atteſt it, in moſt Towns and Pariſhes near where he lived; but alas he had a good Book in his Houſe when taken, called, <hi>The ſolemn League and Covenant;</hi> this was the High Treaſon he muſt be Guilty of, which was aggravated to the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93489:33"/>
Lord Chief Juſtice, by one or two hot Spirits his Neighbours. But to be ſhort, he received his Sentence of Death with grea Courage, and not at all diſmay'd; ſaying very often in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before, <q>If it pleaſed God to call him now (to glorifie his Name by this Providence of his) to Death, he ſhould be ready, but (ſaid he) I am as Innocent of any thing I have done againſt any Man that may deſerve this Puniſhment, as the Child now unborn.</q> When he came to the Place of Execution, he very chearfully declared his Innocency to the Spectators, as before, and ſo Praying very devoutly for ſome time, he was Executed: His Prayer I have no exact Copy of.</p>
               <p>Alſo one Mr. <hi>Charles Speake</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> a Gentleman of good Extraction, being Son to the Worſhipful <hi>George Speake</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> near <hi>Ilmister</hi> in the County of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> where he was Executed; his Caſe alſo was extraordinary hard, but there may be Two great Reaſons given why he was Executed; the <hi>Firſt</hi> was, Becauſe he came from that good Pious Family, which always have been oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers to Popery, and ſuffered deeply for their courage that way. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſaid Mr. <hi>Charles Speak</hi> had purchſed ſome great place in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> or <hi>Common-pleas,</hi> which was very profitable to him, ſo that by his fall there being a forfeiture, much Money may be made of it: all interceſſion would not avail with the L. C. J. for his life; he hapened to be at <hi>Ilminſter</hi> at the time of the Dukes being there, which was the greateſt Crime he was guilty of, the validity of his Evidence I leave to thoſe in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> which know how far it was carried that way. He was a fine courteous loving Gentleman, and notwithſtanding his Youth, he acted the part of an old Chriſtian Souldier, at his Death, preparing himſelf before to undergo thoſe pains, ſaying very often, <hi>They were nothing to his deſerts from God Almighty, but as for what I am Accuſed of, and Sentenced for, I hope you will believe I am not ſo Guilty, as my Judge and Accuſers have endeavoured to make me; if it had pleaſed God, I ſhould have been willing to have lived ſome time longer, but Gods time being come, I am willing, I will be contented to drink this bitter Cup</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:93489:33"/>
                  <hi>off.</hi> Being at the place of Execution, the croud was ſo great, that I ſuppoſe he was ſhorter than otherwiſe he would have been; but alas! how could it be? for on every ſide of him, as well as up and down the Town, the Inhabitants weeping and bewailing him: <hi>O 'tis the worſt day that ever we ſaw in this Town! Muſt this good Gentleman dye here? Oh! yet ſave his life, I am ready to dye for him;</hi> and the like. He Prayed very heartily for near an hour, and Sung a Pſalm, and ſo we hope was tranſlated to Heaven, there to Sing everlaſting Praiſes and Hallelujahs. His Father and Mother you may eaſily judge were not a little concerned about him, but their Adverſaries malice ended not here, but Father and Mother muſt be brought in, and how many Thouſands of Pounds it coſt them, I think is too well known in <hi>London,</hi> and moſt parts of the Kingdom have heard in the publick Letters their Names mentioned. Some may think they were concerned with the Duke, but I never heard there was ſo much made appear againſt them, as could have made them been brought in guilty of High Miſdemeanours; had not the good Gentleman and his Lady been virtuous People, abhorring the Debaucheries of the times, and of ſuch a competent Eſtate, able to ſpare ten or twelve thouſand Pounds; the hard uſage this honeſt brave Gentleman and his vertuous Lady had, and their ſufferings, to relate them, would be too large; and beſides, it is ſo well known in moſt places in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> that I ſhall without ſaying any more proceed. And next for Mr. <hi>Parret,</hi> who was Executed at <hi>Taunton;</hi> if I miſtake not, he ſaid he was a <hi>Londoner,</hi> and a Brewer; when he came to the place of Execution, he ſeemed a Man almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned at Death; after ſome time, he began to deliver himſelf ſomewhat low in Voice to the People, and after riſing by degrees, he ſeemed more like a Miniſter in a Pulpit preaching devoutly, than a Priſoner juſt going to Execution; but I being then not well, could not tarry to ſee his end; but the Character I had was, <hi>That he deſired all, not to be faint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hearted becauſe of their fall, and to think that there was no hopes remaining:</hi> He ſaid, <hi>He verily believed God would yet work out deliverance for them, and at the time they were in the greateſt Extremity, that would be God's opportunity; put your whole truſt and confidence, and dependance on the Lord, and he will never leave you nor forſake you:</hi> and much more; but having no more exact Coyy, I ſhall not enlarge, but come to ſome other.</p>

               <head>The Laſt Speech OF HENRY BODDY, Executed at <hi>BATH.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHile he was in Priſon, eſpecially after Sentence, he beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf mighty Humble, Meek, and was much in Meditation, which was obſerved by ſeveral Divines, eſpecially one who attended him to his Laſt, his name Mr. <hi>Simpſon;</hi> his poor Wife coming to ſee him at <hi>Wells,</hi> and to make her Intereſt with ſome Friends, if poſſible to ſave his Life; but finding it loſt Labour, and that ſhe could by no means prevail, ſhe died there for grief, before her Husband was Executed, to his great grief. When he came to the place of Execution, he delivered himſelf to the People in theſe Words:</p>
               <p>Good People, I am come here to pay a Debt due to Nature, which every one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one time or another, muſt pay, though not in this manner, or nature. I am Condemned as a Traytor and Rebel againſt my King, which were things I always hated and abhorred, and therefore give me ſo much time as to Deliver my ſelf to you, and what I ſay, I hope you will believe me at this time, being juſt going to give an account, not only for every Idle word, but for all things I have done ſince I have had a being.</p>
               <p>I was Born in <hi>Lyme-Regis,</hi> in the County of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and bred up a Seaman from my Infancy; I have had the Honour to ſerve His Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, in his Wars with the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> divers times: I always thought it to be the Duty of every true <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> to ſtand up in his Countries quarrel with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, to maintain our Ancient Priviledges and Honour of our
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93489:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nation. I ſerved him faithfully; and as for any undertaking now with the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> for which, I am now come to ſuffer Death; as for my deſigns, I am ſure they were good, for I did believe him to be my Soverign's Son and Heir, but if otherwiſe, I have done amiſs, and am ſorry, and hope the Lord hath pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: While I was in Arms, I am ſure there's none can ſay I have perſonally wronged them: I deſire all your Prayers for me to the laſt. I am no Orator, therefore if you pleaſe, (ſpeaking to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,) do thoſe laſt ſpiritual Services for me, as for to Pray with me, and for me: The Miniſter being much taken with him, deſired leave of the Sheriff to ask him ſome queſtions, which being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Miniſter ſaid unto him, <hi>I muſt make bold with you, but not to hold you too long before I pray, but to ſatisfie my ſelf and the People on what ground you ſtand; I mean, as concerning your Everlaſting ſtate: Now pray reſolve me a few things; Firſt, Whether you do own that Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance, own'd by the Church; That it is not lawful on any account whatſoever, to take up Arms againſt the King?</hi> O Sir! as to that I Anſwer: Could I have been ſatisfied he had been my Lawful Prince, I ſhould not have done it: <hi>But ſaid the Miniſter, He is, and you are not to be judge; except you own thoſe things, ſome People will hardly have Charity for you after you are Dead:</hi> What matters that ſaid he? would you have me, now you put me ſo cloſe to it, to lye? <hi>No I will not.</hi> I ſay, If he was my Lawful King, I was miſſed in my judgment, and have committed a great Error; but Lord, I hope thou haſt waſhed away all my ſins, in and through the Blood of my dear Redeemer, in whoſe alone Merits I hope for Mercy. I deſire to be asked no more Queſtions: Then the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Prayed very devoutly near half an hour; after which, lifting up his Hands and Eyes to Heaven, quietly ſubmitted to Death.</p>
               <p>This Bloody Tragedy in the <hi>Weſt</hi> being over, our <hi>Protestant Judge</hi> returns for <hi>London;</hi> ſoon after which Alderman <hi>Corniſh</hi> felt the anger of ſome body behind the Curtain; for it is to be Noted, that he was Sheriff when <hi>Best</hi> prayed an Indictment might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and was, as well as Sheriff <hi>Bethel,</hi> earneſt in promoting it; in alledging, that it was no ways reaſonable, that the Juries of <hi>London</hi> ſhould lie under ſuch a reproach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But paſſing this over, we now find this Perſon arrived at the Pinacle of Honour; the <hi>Purſe</hi> and <hi>Mace</hi> were reſerved for him, vacant by the Death of the

Lord Keeper <hi>North,</hi> and he advanced to the Lord Chancellourſhip of <hi>England;</hi> rais'd by this means, as one might think, above the envy of the croud; and it might be wiſhed, in ſo dangerous a height he had looked better to his footſteps; for now being Created <hi>Baron of Wem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> we find him in a High Commiſſion, or Eccleſiaſtical Court, Suſpending the Honourable Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> from performing the Epiſcopal Office and Function of that <hi>See,</hi> and for no other default, than not readily complying with the King's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Suſpending Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> Dean of <hi>Norwich,</hi> for Preaching a Sermon in the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Giles</hi> in the Fields, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Pariſhioners, ſhewing the Errors and Fallacies of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion; the better to confirm them in the Faith and Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Nor was it this good Biſhop alone that was aimed at; for ſcarce had the <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge paſſed the Seal, and in that very Mother of Learning, and Chief Seminary of our Church, ſuch alterations made, as ſtartled the Kingdom; by whoſe Counſel I undertake not to determine; but in the midſt of Liberty of Conſcience, as twice declared. The Church of <hi>England</hi> had a Teſt put upon her Sons, which ſeem'd ſuch a Paradox that has been rarely heard of, <hi>viz.</hi> To Read the King's Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience in the Churches, during the time of Divine Service, and a Mark, and Penalties threatned to the refuſers; which was evidently demonſtrated, by the Impriſonment of thoſe Pious Patriots of their Country, and Pillars of the Church: His Grace the Lord Arch biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Bath and Wells, Ely, Peterborough, Chicheſter,</hi> St. <hi>Aſaph,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol;</hi> who for ſhewing their Reaſons, why they could not comply with this Command, by way of Humble Petition; were ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and afterwards Tryed upon Information of High Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, at the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench;</hi> where their Innocency ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in a large manner, they were Acquitted, to the ſcandal of their Accuſers: yet Orders were ſent into all parts of <hi>England,</hi> to return an Account to the Lord Chancellour, of thoſe that refuſed to Read the Declaration, that they might be proceeded againſt, for a contempt of what their Conſciences would not permit them to do, and for a time they were extreamly hot upon it: But the News of the great Preparations in <hi>Holland,</hi> and that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was certainly deſigned for <hi>England,</hi> the determined Councils cooled,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93489:36"/>
and then quite ceaſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that the Church of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men,</hi> whoſe Cauſe the Prince had eſpouſed, were reſtored again to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and Truſts they had (by what Juſtice I know not) been lately deprived; and amongſt other Charters that were on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion reſtored<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was that of the City of <hi>London;</hi> and that which makes it more memorable, was, that it was brought to the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> by this Perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' he was not attended with the Shouts and Acclamations he expected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor ſeemed ſo florid or frolickſome as heretofore, which ſome looked upon as a preſaging Omen; and it's reported, ſoon after he being asked by a Courtier, <hi>What the Heads<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Princes Declaration was?</hi> he ſhould Anſwer, <hi>He was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſure his was one, whatever the reſt was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Court by this time beginning to ſcatter, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> approaching, the King thought fit to withdraw himſelf, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notice of which, the Lord Chancellour betook himſelf to <hi>Wap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> diſguiſed like a Seaman, in order to his Eſcape to <hi>Hamborough,</hi> in a Collier; but being diſcovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was brought before Sir <hi>John Chapman,</hi> Lord Mayor of the City of <hi>London,</hi> in a ſtrange diſguiſe from what he formerly appeared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And by reaſon of the Lord Mayor's Indiſpoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he not being able to Commit him, he offered to go to the <hi>Tower,</hi> to be out of the Hands of the Rabble, who there in great numbers with clubs and ſlaves, threatned him with preſent deſtruction: But having a Guard of the Train bands to conduct him, he got thither ſafe, and ſoon after was charged in Cuſtody by a Warrant of Commitment from the Lords at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where he continued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under much affliction and indiſpoſition; having ſince moved for his <hi>Habeas-Corpus</hi> to be Bailed, but has hitherto not been able to attain it. He had not been in the <hi>Tower</hi> many days, but as 'tis ſaid (whither true or no, I cannot affirm) he had a Barrel of Oyſters ſent him, upon ſight of which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaid to the bearer, Well then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſee I have ſome Friends left ſtill; but upon opening the Barrel, he found them to be only Friends that were impatient till he gave them a proſpect of his future deſtiny, for verily the mighty Preſent was nothing but a good able <hi>Halter.</hi> Now, as I ſaid before, whether this paſſage be true or no, I cannot ſay, but this I am ſure, (if we conſider his Lordſhips Life and Cruelties) the Moral of it is very good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thus Reader<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have briefly ſeen the Riſe and Fall of this now unfortunate Perſon, and ſo (at preſent) we take our <hi>Farewel.</hi>
