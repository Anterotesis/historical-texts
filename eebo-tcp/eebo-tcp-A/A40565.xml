         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Here followeth a true Deſcription or Relation of ſundry ſad and lamentable Collections, taken from the mouths of very credible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and out of Letters ſent from <hi>Ireland</hi> to this City of <hi>London,</hi> of the perfidious out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and barbarous cruelties, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts have committed upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Proteſtants, both Men, Women and Children, in that Kingdom. <hi>Annoque Domini.</hi> 1641.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation is well known to be a people both proud and envious. For the Commonalty (they are for the moſt part) ignorant and illeterate, poor and lazy; and will rather beg or ſtarve than work: and therefore fit ſubjects for the Prieſts and Jeſuits to ſpur on upon ſuch bloudy Actions and murtherous Deſigns. Ignorance is their Mother, which is devoid of mercy: God deliver all good Chriſtians from the Cruelty of ſuch a Mother and Children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101698:3"/>
It is too well known, (the more is the pity and to be lamented) that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have murthered of the Proteſtant party in the Provinces of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter, Lempſter, Connaght</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> of Men, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the number of fifty thouſand, as it is credibly reported by <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> who have been over all parts of the Kingdom, and do proteſt upon their Oaths that there are above five thouſand Families deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath four Provinces, wherein there are contained two and thirty Counties, beſides Cities and County Towns, in all which places the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are planted up and down in all parts, where the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have moſt murtherouſly and traiterouſly ſurprized them upon great advantages, and without reſpect of perſons either of age, youth, or infancy, of young Men or Maids, or of old Men or Babes, ſtript all to their skins, naked as ever they were born into the World, ſo they have gone out of the World, many hundreds having been found ſtarved to death in Ditches for want of food and rayment, where the rebellious <hi>Iriſh</hi> have ſhewed them no more mercy or compaſſion, no not ſo much as they would do to their Dogs. Thus much for the general, now I come to particulars.</p>
            <p>At one Mr. <hi>Atkins</hi>'s houſe, ſeven Papiſts brake in and beat out his brains, then ripped up his Wife with child, after they had raviſhed her, and <hi>Nero</hi> like, view'd Natures bed of conception, they then took the child, and ſacrificed it in the fire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101698:3"/>
They have flead the skin from the bones of others like Butchers: the principles of whoſe Religion is bloud. Witneſs our Books of Martyrs; thoſe Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of bloud. Witneſs thoſe thouſands of butcher'd Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They burned others, firing their Houſes, Towns, Villages, thoſe ſons of the Coal, as if their habitation were in Hell.</p>
            <p>They vowed to root out all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation out of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>They turned all the Proteſtants out of <hi>Kilkeny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Belturbalt,</hi> in the County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> the Popiſh Rebels demanded the Town on promiſe, that if they would ſurrender, they ſhould paſs free with bag and baggage, they back'd their promiſe with Oaths and Execrations, curſing themſelves, if they did not let them go withall. On ſerious conſiderations of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants and the Governour, they were perſuaded to yield it up, which when they had done, and drawing away their goods and moneys, they like treacherous Villians ſent about twenty or thirty to-guard them, when they had guarded them ſeven miles from the Town, they with more of that deſperate forſworn rabble ſeized on them, robbed all the Proteſtants, being between five hundred and a thouſand perſons, Men, Women and Children; who ſubmitting themſelves to their mercy, found no quarter but cruelty: they ſtript them all naked, and turn'd them out of their houſes into the open fields in bitter could weather, in a moſt vile and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101698:4"/>
ſhamefull manner, not affording them one of their lowzy rags to hide thoſe parts which ſhould be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Take notice of the faith of a Papiſt, who for his own advantage, caſts off all bounds of fidelity and common honeſty.</p>
            <p>They are remarkable for perſidiouſneſs and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as you may behold in that Maſter of Miſ-rule, the Arch-rebell Sir <hi>Philem O-Neal,</hi> baſely pretending to be a Suiter to the old Lady <hi>Cawfield,</hi> being a Widow, and made fair promiſes of his reſpects to her, and when he had his advantage of poſſeſſion of her houſe and goods, turned them out of all, and bound them priſoners, and made her whom he intended his neareſt Companion to be his loweſt Vaſſal.</p>
            <p>In the Town of <hi>Lurgon,</hi> in the County of <hi>Armagh,</hi> the <hi>Mac-kans</hi> skirmiſhing with the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> ſlew divers of our men, whereupon they entred parly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Town: Sir <hi>Willian Brunlow</hi> being Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Caſtle, on ſome conſiderations thought good to yield, thereupon they promiſed and backt it with Oaths and great Proteſtations, that they ſhould have fair quarter, and paſs without prejudice to their lives: yet behold the perfidiouſneſs of theſe brutiſh creatures, as men not fearing God, or Devil whoſe practice they imitate, who was a lier from the beginning. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe fair pretences they knew no mercy, killed Men, ſpoiled Women, nay, in their boundleſs rage, ſlew and maſſacared, and ſtript help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Miniſters, whoſe calling might have pleaded pity.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101698:4"/>
But what ſpeak we of pity to men, that have no bowels?</p>
            <p>In <hi>London-Derry,</hi> at the Town of <hi>Belly-hagh</hi> belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the <hi>Londoners.</hi> Sir <hi>Philem O-Neal,</hi> promiſed under hand and ſeal to let the poor Proteſtants to paſs with bag and baggage, onely to part with their Town, which was a fair goodly place: yet this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Rebel? as if it was not enough to make theſe poor ſouls harborleſs, to lay them open to wind and weather, but to add to all their miſery, ſtript Man, Woman and Child, took their cloaths for a prey, and ſent them out naked, without a ſhirt or ſmock to their backs, left them not worth a groat, this was one of their works of mercy, if they ſcaped with their lives: but how many lives might be loſt by this immodeſt and inhumane act, judge. The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</p>
            <p>Will you behold another mercifull Act, and Record it. Captain <hi>Rory Macquire,</hi> at the beginning of the Robellion for the firſt fortnight commands his Soldiers to give quarter to Women and Children, but to maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacare all the Men, to ſpare none. Wo to him that makes the Wife a Widow, and the Children Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but after they began to reſiſt, and to gather into Companies: then hear the Charge of this bloudy man, Gi<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e no quarter, no not to Women, though Tears and Prayers interpoſe, yet know no pity: no not to harmleſs Babes, though it was death enough to kill their Parents, nor ſpare neither Man, Woman, or Child.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:101698:5"/>
It is reported by an ominent Gentleman that had long dwelt among the Rebels, but its thought fit to forbear the names of thoſe that gave intelligence of the barbarous cruelties of theſe ſavage beaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they threaten to be the death of them that ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask them. It is reported by this Gentleman that the <hi>Handlowans</hi> came to <hi>Town-regis,</hi> divers of them aſſaulted the Caſtle, of which Captain <hi>Saint John</hi> was Commander, he with his Son got away with ſome difficulty, leaping over the wall, they fearing they might ſetch ſupplies to recover their loſt Caſtle, moſt inhumanly took the Captain's Wife, (poor Gentlewoman) and ſet her on the wall having ſtript her to her ſmock, who was big with Child (and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an hour of her delivery) that in caſe the Captain and his Son ſhould have aſſaulted the Town, his Wife ſhould have been the white at which he muſt have levelled: Oh extreme and unheard of cruelty!</p>
            <p>As for the Proteſtant Miniſters whom they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, their cruelty is ſuch towards them, at it would make the hardeſt heart to melt into tears. Their manner is firſt to ſtrip them, and after bind them to a tree or ſome poſt where they pleaſe, and then to raviſh their Wives and Daughters before their faces (in ſight of all their mercileſs rabble) with the baſeſt Villains they can pick out, after they hang up their Husbands and Parents before their faces, and then cut them down before they be half dead, then quarter them, after diſmember them, and ſtop their mouths therewith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101698:5"/>
They baſely abuſed one Mr. <hi>Trafford</hi> a Miniſter in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was aſſaulted by theſe bloudy Wolves of <hi>Rome</hi>'s brood, that know not God, nor any bowels of mercy. This poor diſtreſſed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter deſired but ſo much time to bethink himſelf before he took his farewell of the World to call upon God: but theſe mercileſs wretches would admit no time, but inſtantly fell on him, hackt and hewed him to pieces.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Tate</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Belly-Hayes,</hi> they ſtript ſtarke naked, and then wounded him dangerouſly in the head, and then let him go towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> where he lay long ſick.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Patrick Dunſton</hi>'s Wife raviſhed before him, ſlew his Servants ſpurned his Children till they died, bound him with rouls of Match to a board, that his Eyes burſt out, cut off his Ears and Noſe, teared off both his Cheecks, and cut off his Armes and Legs, cut out his Tongue, after run a red hot Iron into him.</p>
            <p>Many Gentlewomen they raviſhed before their Husbands faces, ſtripping them firſt naked to the view of their wicked companions, taunting and mockings. them (after they have ſpoiled them) with bitter and reproachſull words, ſending them away in ſuch a ſhamefull, or rather ſhameleſs manner, that moſt of them have died with pain and grief, or elſe have ſtarved with want and cold. Baſe cruelty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of, exceeding the brute beaſts, and ſo much the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101698:6"/>
worſe becauſe they are reaſonable, which makes them skilfull to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>One Mr. <hi>Luttrell,</hi> dwelling within three miles of the Burrough of <hi>Cavan,</hi> a Gentleman worth by report, two or three hundred pounds a year, with a very great ſtock of Cattel, was baſely betrayed by an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Boy that he had bred up in his houſe. See the baſeneſs of the Popiſh brood, who when he was at Dinner (being upon the thirtieth day of <hi>October</hi> laſt) was ſurprized by threeſcore of thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> unmercifull Villains, with a company of dirty Whores and Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards that followed them, which this Boy let in at a back door, where pulling him and his vertuous Wife from the Table, and four ſmall Children, the eldeſt of them being not ſix years of age, and one ſucking at her breaſt, without pity or humanity, ſtript them naked, notwithſtanding their prayers and tears to have let them kept their cloaths, and then thruſting them in a cruel and violent manner out of doors, threatned to kill them if they went not ſpeedily away. Take notice how uncertain all our outward comforts are. So they departed, (for fear) away, being aſhamed to be ſeen of their ſervants, ſome of them running one way, and ſome another to ſhift for themſelves, but the diſtreſſed Gentleman with his Wife and Children, and a little youth, directed their courſe towards <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> hoping to find ſome of their friends in the way to relieve them, but the farther they came the more miſerable they were, meeting their loving Friends

was known by his name, to one of the ſervants in the Houſe, to be ſometime a ſervant to this Mr. <hi>Davenant,</hi> and lived at the time of this Tragedy not far from <hi>Dunxannon</hi> in the County of <hi>Tir-Oen.</hi> The Servant of the houſe that knew him was born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the City of <hi>Clogher</hi> in the ſaid County, but of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parents, his name is <hi>Thomas Maddin,</hi> but he could ſpeak good <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and ſo eſcaped, being an Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe paſſages enſuing. This <hi>Swillyvane</hi> and his rout broke in forcibly into the Houſe where they found three or four ſervants that made no reſiſtence, in the Kitchin, but going farther into the houſe they found Mr. <hi>Davenant,</hi> ſitting by a fire with his Wife and Children, two young Daughters, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſeized upon him and his Wife, and bound them both faſt to their Chairs, making a very huge and great fire, after they ſtripped the two Children, the eldeſt being not ſeven years old, ſlew them in the ſight of their Parents, and after roaſted them upon ſpits before their faces, ſuch barbarous cruelty was never known. With great patience they were compelled (poor ſouls) to behold that cruelty which they could not help, after they ſtript his Wife, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her moſt uncivilly and unmercifully before his face, and afterward cut her Throat, the diſtreſſed Gentleman being overpreſſed with the lamentable ſight of the death of his Wife and Children, ſtrived and ſtrugled in his Chair where he was bound, and held, hoping they would have killed him, chuſing

rather to dye the death, than to live any longer. So when they had made an end of his Wife and Children in this barbarous manner, they untied him and ſtript him, and afterwards murthered him, when he had confeſt to them where his money was. There was a Letter written about the middle of <hi>November</hi> laſt, from <hi>Stabound</hi> in the ſaid County of <hi>Tir-Oen,</hi> by one Mr. <hi>Birrom,</hi> unto one Mr. <hi>Cuſack</hi> dwelling in High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet in <hi>Dublin,</hi> which Letter I read and took a Copy of: and before I came out of <hi>Ireland</hi> the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Thomas Maddin,</hi> came from the City of <hi>Clogher,</hi> in the County of <hi>Fermanagh</hi> unto <hi>Dublin,</hi> and teſtified the contents of this Letter, being an Eye-witneſs of the certain paſſages thereof, and did give God great thanks that he had eſcaped their hands in my hearing, for he ſaid his Soul could not endure to be any longer amongſt them, they did daily commit ſuch cruelty, murther and outrages, upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants in thoſe parts.</p>

The Maid was ſent with a letter from her Father in <hi>Dublin,</hi> to <hi>Mynhead</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> to her Uncle <hi>William Dyer,</hi> her Mothers Brother, living within three miles

            <p>About the eighth of <hi>Januanry</hi> laſt, a diſtreſſed Miniſter came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> that had left ſome goods with a ſuppoſed friend, ſent for them, the goods could not be delivered, unleſs He or his Wife came for them, he would not go, but ſhe went, and when ſhe came where her goods were (as if that were too little to loſe her eſtate, but her life muſt go alſo) they hanged her up. Was there ever ſuch Barbariſm among the Heathens?</p>
            <p>In the County of <hi>Fermannagh,</hi> in the Province of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> they murthered one Mr. <hi>Champion,</hi> a Juſtice of Peace, and a Burgeſs of the Parliament for the Borrough of <hi>Iniskillin</hi> in the ſaid County, who was betrayed by an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Villain his Tenant, whom he had ſaved himſelf twice before from the Gallows. The Rogue's name was <hi>Patrick Mack-Dermot,</hi> who finding one of his Companions, brings him to Mr. <hi>Champion</hi>'s Houſe, and tells Mr. <hi>Champion</hi> that he found this Thief ſtealing the Cattel, the Gentleman knowing this <hi>Mack-Dermot,</hi> ſaid unto him before one Mr. <hi>Iremonger</hi> an Attorney, I am glad thou art turned from Thief to catch a Thief, whereupon he returned him this peremptory Anſwer, that he was no more Thief than himſelf. No ſooner had he uttered theſe words in the Court before His Houſe, but there ruſhs in upon them a great number of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101698:10"/>
theſe Rebels, who without reſpect of mercy ſtabbed Mr. <hi>Champion,</hi> inſtantly before he could get into his Houſe: ſo that he fell down immediately, but their fury went further than death, for they wounded him with their Skeins in thirty places after he was dead, and then cut off his Head to make ſure work, whlie the reſt ran into the Houſe after Mr. <hi>Iremonger,</hi> whom they followed ſo cloſe that he had not time to lay hold on his Sword to help himſelf, but falling down upon his Knees, and calling upon God for mercy, they fell upon him, and ran him through and through, and ſo he died. One of Mr. <hi>Champion</hi>'s Servants eſcaped to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and reported this in my hearing in <hi>December</hi> laſt. A third was likewiſe ſlain, then the Rebells entred the Houſe and killed more: his Wives Siſter and her Brother-in-law, with two others in the houſe they kept priſoners, taking poſſeſſion of all they had within the houſe and without, his Wife was down upon her Knees to beg a Sheet to put her Husband's dead Body in. And another Gentleman with other Friends that came to viſit him over Night, loſt their lives next Morning.</p>
            <p>In the County of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> within two miles of the Town of <hi>Monaghan,</hi> they murthered one Mr. <hi>George Foord</hi> in his Garden, a great company having gotten into a room or loſt over a Stable (being between him and the houſe) ſurprized him, This was upon the one and twentieth of <hi>November</hi> laſt,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101698:11"/>
being the Lord's day, for when he with his Wife and Family were gone to Church, in that place they hid themſelves till their coming back from Church, and ſo watching their time and opportunity, firſt ſet upon him without any words, and then entred the houſe, for the houſe was ſtrong and not eaſily to be broken, unleſs they were let in at the doors, ſo they bound all the ſervants being ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſome <hi>Iriſh,</hi> till they had found Mrs. <hi>Foord,</hi> whom they ſtript naked and bound, taking from her, her Keys, having alſo with them her Husband's Keys, who lay mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the Garden, and riſled, and opened every Trunk and Box in the Houſe to find their Money, where they found but little to what they looked for, for they knew that Mr. <hi>Foord</hi> was rich and well monyed, wherefore they began with threats to kill her if ſhe did not ſpeedily tell them, but alas! ſhe could not, then they fell to torturing of her, heating a pair of Tongs in the fire, and clapping them to the ſoals of her Feet, and to the palms of her Hands, ſo that with the pain thereof ſhe dyed. After ſhe was dead, they ript her Body to ſee if ſhe had not ſwallowed any Gold into her Guts, and ſo when they had pillaged the houſe, and carried away with the Gentlewomans own Horſes and Carts, all that was worth the carriage, they unbound the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſervants which they before had bound, and murthered ſuch of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as they pleaſed, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. I heard <hi>Affidavit</hi> made of the truth and

            </p>
            <p>They ſet up Gallows five miles diſtant in divers places, on purpoſe to hang up the Proteſtant Spies, which they did accordingly; they likewiſe cruelly ſet Women and Men on red hot Grid irons to make them confeſs where ſuch Coyn, and Money, and Goods as they had, or whether they had hid or ſold any.</p>
            <p>And all theſe cruelties were not done without the advice and animation of the Fryars, Prieſts and Jeſuits, and their religious men, or rather Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands of Hell; who at their Maſſes, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary Sermons, ſtirred up the people to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of theſe Maſſacares, promiſing them pardon for the ſame, and aſſuring them the more merit, by how much the more they exceeded in their villainous Cruelties: they themſelves being ſtill in the firſt of theſe executions. For no ſtratagem of War, nor other horrid Action or Deſſign whatſoever, was there undertaken, without them. They going on with their Soldiers in the head and front of every Battel, and by their miſchievous Advices and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels did make them mad, Tyger-like, with fierceneſs and cruelty, aſſuring them that to imbrue their hands in the Bloud of the Proteſtants (which they term Hereticks) ſhall add to their merits and Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization of Saints, and gain them higher places and reward in Heaven.</p>

Mr. <hi>Jerome</hi> Miniſter, they baſely abuſed who lived near <hi>Dublin</hi> ſometimes; but when he was thus murthered, he lived near the Burrough of <hi>Athie,</hi> in the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> they hanged him, then mangled his Body, cut off his Members, ſtopt his Mouth with them, then quartered him. This is reported a by Citizen of <hi>Dublin,</hi> now in <hi>London,</hi> to bear witneſs of this truth.</p>
            <p>A Proclamation was made that neither <hi>Engliſh</hi> nor <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhould either ſell or keep in their houſes, any Powder upon the loſs of Goods and Life: except with licenſe, and at two ſhillings the pound.</p>
            <p>Miniſters they hate, and breath out cruelty, Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caring their Bodys, burning their Books, and tearing them in pieces, and it is likely where they can light on them they uſe them accordingly.</p>
            <p>They robbed all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, ſtripping them ſtarke naked, and ſo turned them into the open Fields and Mountains in Froſt and Snow, where hundreds periſhed.</p>
            <p>They deſtroyed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> breed of Cattel, out of malice to the Proteſtants, that the poor dumb creatures fared the worſe and were ſpoiled, though one of ours is worth four of theirs.</p>
            <p>They cut off Mens Privy Members and ſtopt their Mouths with them, (like cruel ſavage beaſts) that they might commit ſuch horrid villanies without noiſe, and leſt their pittileſs bowels might be moved with the cries of thoſe ſo cruelly Maſſacared Proteſtants.</p>

At. <hi>Waterford,</hi> ſome poor Proteſtants ready to be ſtarved, came to the Town for relief, and their charity threw them ſome Bread over the wall: it is likely the Dogs ſhould have had the ſame entertainment.</p>
            <p>Theſe bloudy Papiſts forced the Proteſtants to pull off their Cloaths, and then killed them on purpoſe, that they might have their Cloaths without holes.</p>
            <p>After they had knocked a man down dead, they fearing he might counterfeit they doe run their Swords twenty times into his Body leſt he might revive again</p>
            <p>They ſtripped Ladys and Gentlewomen, Virgins both old and young ſtark naked, turning them into the open Fields.</p>
            <p>Many hundreds were ſound dead in Ditches with cold and want of food and rayment, eſteeming them no better than Dogs.</p>
            <p>They laboured what they could to make death appear more dreadfull then it was in it ſelf: they hanged up Husband, Kindred, Children, before the faces of their living Wives, and tender Mothers ready to dye for grief, a death worſe than death it ſelf, and this they do on purpoſe to increaſe their dolorous pain and anguiſh.</p>
            <p>They forced (as is reported) ſome to turn to their curſed bloudy Religion, and then perſuaded them that they were fitteſt to dye, and then trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly murthered them, and ſo did what in them lay to damn their Souls.</p>

Debtours baſely murthering their Creditours.

            <p>Many great Men's Servants, being <hi>Iriſh,</hi> ran away from their Maſters with their beſt Horſes to the Rebels.</p>
            <p>Many of the Proteſtants uſually took into their Houſes, <hi>Iriſh</hi> Boys, as Servants, and thoſe did baſely betray their Maſters, like <hi>Judas,</hi> into the hands of theſe bloudy Wolves. A good Caveat to look to our Servants before we take them, and to inſtruct them in the fear of God when we have them.</p>
            <p>Others they wounded to death, and then left them languiſhing, their Bellys being ripped up and Guts iſſuing out, they poor wretches lying on Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills, (ſee the charity of cruell Papiſts) all this leſt they ſhould be out of their miſery too ſoon.</p>
            <p>It ſeems it was their delight to linger out their cruelties (like men that wanted Bowels) for whereas the primitive Perſecutions were exquiſitely cruell, yet they made a quick Diſpatch of them: but theſe ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> found new ways of perſecution by extreme Cold and Hunger to ſtarve (which aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates their cruelty) tender Women with Child, poor helpleſs Inſants and ſucklings.</p>

            <p>At <hi>Carvagh,</hi> near <hi>Colerane,</hi> the Rebells came to begirt the Town, Mr. <hi>Rowly,</hi> Brother to the worthy Knight Sir <hi>John Clotworthy,</hi> came forth with a ſmall Company, about three hundred men to prevent them, they came upon them with a very great company, and ſlew all but eight of the Proteſtants, baſe cowardiſe where they want courage, they make it up with heaps and multitudes of frighted Hares, and the more fearfull and cowardly, ever the more cruel upon any advantage.</p>
            <p>All their cruelties were uſually on diſarmed Men, in ſmall Villages, where was no ſtrength to reſiſt them, there they have tyrannized over the weaker Sex,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101698:15"/>
Women, and they baſely triumphed over little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, their rage hath been exerciſed. Oh baſe cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe if they ventured ſometimes on our Men, it hath been when they were naked, as they have been flying from thoſe Furies which their party have newly ſtripped naked: by and by they met with more of thoſe white-livered Villains in companies. They would likewiſe abuſe thoſe poor naked Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants like Dogs, adding to their miſery, beating them and bruiſing their naked Bodys with Cudgels, breaking the Heads of ſome and wounding others, that if they had not died, they have been dangerouſly ſick with the inhumane uſage of thoſe mercileſs wretches: nay, rather than they will be (no body) they will ſhew their manhood in abuſing dead Bodys, as this ſtory declares by very credible teſtimony from their own Country-men.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall acquaint you with a remarkable Story, which I received from a Citizen of <hi>Dublin</hi>'s teſtimony, of good repute there and here: wherein you may behold the promiſe made good to the Proteſtant ſide, which the Lord himſelf made to his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that five ſhould chaſe a hundred.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed God by one man and few with him, to out-dare about thirty thouſand of thoſe cowardly Rebells, whoſe cauſe is baſe, whoſe Religion is but a mere pretence for their bloudy deſigns, and thus it was as that Citizen related.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:101698:15"/>
A very great Army of about thirty thouſand Rebels beſieged <hi>Drohedah,</hi> wherein was that valliant and religious Commander Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourn,</hi> with a few of the Proteſtant party with him in compariſon of thoſe multitudes of Rebells, truſting to their great Army, boldly demanded the Town, if they would yield, no queſtion, but they ſhould have fair Quarter: But Sir <hi>Henry</hi> knowing them (its likely) very well how perfidious they were, and the leſs to be believed, the more they ſwore and execrated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, reſolutely replied, and ſent the Rebells this Anſwer. <q>
                  <p>Be it known to you I am a Soldier bred, and will never yield but upon Three Conditions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Before I Surrender I will kill all the Papiſts in the Town.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I will deſtroy all the Nunneries.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I will fire the Town, and march in the light of it, by the help of God, to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, rather than I will give up, I will feed on a piece of a dead Horſe, and if that fail, I will eat the Soulders of an old Popiſh Alderman.</p>
               </q> This Bone he threw among thoſe hungry Dogs, and you may imagine how they reliſhed it.</p>
            <p>And that remarkable inſtance which was publiſhed by order of the Right Honourable the Houſe of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101698:16"/>
Lords, concerning this Noble and Religious Knight, Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourn,</hi> how it pleaſed God to honour him with a ſucceſsfull Victory againſt the Rebells, they being driven in <hi>Drohedah,</hi> to eat Horſe-fleſh for want of other proviſion. The Rebells having chained up the River in hope to keep out proviſion by Sea, that no relief might come from <hi>Dublin,</hi> it pleaſed God to raiſe ſuch a ſtorm that broke the Chain, and ſcattered the Enemies Boats, and opened a free paſſage from <hi>Dublin,</hi> whereby they were relieved, bleſſed be God. Thus the Lord Fought for them by Winds and Seas.</p>
            <p>Pulling them about the Streets by the hair of the Head, daſhing the Childrens Brains againſt the Poſts, ſaying, <hi>Theſe are the Pigs of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Sows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And alſo by Land an Army lying before the City, aſſaulted them in hopes to famiſh them: whereupon this Noble Captain, Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourn,</hi> ſallied out of the Town, but with forty Muſquetiers, and as many Horſe, beat off four hundred of the Enemies, killed above threeſcore of them, recovered fourſcore Cows and Oxen, and two hundred Sheep, burned four Towns and brought home two of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>

Theſe Stories I relate that all true-hearted Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants may take heart, and likewiſe take notice that God is vindicating his own Glory againſt theſe deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Atheiſts that began to inſult, and to ask (as we are credibly informed) what is become of the God of the Proteſtants, and likewiſe what ſpirit and courage God is able to put into the hearts of thoſe that fight for him, and for his cauſe againſt his bloud-thirſty enemies. And therefore be not diſmaid you Proteſtants, 'tis a great honour to fight under the Banner of Chriſt, they fight under the banner of Anti-chriſt, the Lord is with you while ye are with him. See the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and cruelties of theſe bloudy men: it is that their names (as <hi>Amalek)</hi> may be blotted out from under Heaven, for ſurely the day of recompence is comming, that God will make his Arrows drunk in their bloud, they love bloud, and therefore God will give them bloud in great meaſure.</p>
            <p>As for inſtance, I ſhall relate you a bloudy ſtory of one of thoſe cruell beaſts. The Proteſtant Troopers, about the beginning of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1641. marched out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> as they uſed to do, to view the Coaſts, they eſpied a cruell Rebel hewing and mangling a Woman in ſo horrid a manner that it was impoſſible to know her, having acted his Deviliſh part he triumphed over her dead Corpſe, and waſhed his hands in her bloud, whereupon the Troopers apprehended this barbarous Villain in the very act of cruelty, and brought him to <hi>Dublin</hi> with his hands all bloudy, and was adjudged
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101698:18"/>
to be hanged immediately, he aſcended the Ladder, and would not ſtay till the Executioner turned him off, but deſperately leaped off and hanged himſelf. This was in the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> and was credibly reported by a Citizen of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who ſaw him thus hanged with his hands all bloudy.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable to take notice of the riſe of this bloudy act, it was thus. A Fryar and this Villain was drinking together in a Village, the Fryar hearing a poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman there, he commanded this Rebel to murther her, which he did, as you have read, atteſted by a Gentleman of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of good credit.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe poor deluded wretches gull'd with their Jeſuits damnable Doctrine, who aſſure them on their words, that the <hi>more cruel, the more meritorious.</hi> An Article no where to be found, but in the Devil's Creed.</p>
            <p>Would any man believe that theſe Villains ſhould take Children and toſs them with pitch-forks like Dung into Rivers? one was an Eye-witneſs (who loſt a great Eſtate there, but ſince received relief from the Parliament) who ſaw a cruel wretch, throw a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man crying with tears one way, and her Child with a pitch-fork another way.</p>
            <p>They cruelly murthered Women great with Child, and then left them in Ditches, to the fury of their Dogs, who learned to be cruel from their bloudy Maſters, for they eat the Children out of the Bowels of the Mother.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:101698:19"/>
At <hi>Leſgoole</hi> Caſtle, in the County of <hi>Fourmanagh,</hi> they burned fifty <hi>Scots,</hi> Men, Women and Children.</p>
            <p>Sixteen <hi>Scots</hi> more they barbarouſly hanged at <hi>Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> in the County of <hi>Monaghan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirty <hi>Scots</hi> they burned in <hi>Tolagh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is remarkable that they dealt thus cruelly with thoſe Noble <hi>Scots,</hi> who have been renowned through the Chriſtian World, for their zeal againſt that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Rabble, that theſe Rebells would wiſh they had but one neck, that they might cut them off at one blow, but the Proteſtant Cauſe ſhall ſtand in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> when they and their <hi>Babel</hi> ſhall be caſt into the bottomleſs Pit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rory Mack-Quire</hi> at <hi>New-Town,</hi> in the County of <hi>Fourmanagh,</hi> above four hundred poor Proteſtants fled into the Church to ſhrowd themſelves under its roof, for ſafety from the rage of thoſe men of bloud, where they might have been famiſhed, but the mercy of this mercileſs beaſt affords them quarter to go away with their Cloaths to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and vows he will not hurt them: before they got out of the Town, the Soldiers ſtript ſome and killed others like baſe perfidious wretches.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lieutenant pretending they came from the King, perfidiouſly come under favour, pretends to borrow the Arms of the Inhabitants, as they ſaid, to quell the Rebells, then break into their Houſes, and turn their weapons againſt themſelves, made havock, taking their feather-beds, and throwing out their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101698:19"/>
feathers, and in the Ticks, put up what pretious things they could find in the Houſe, and carried all away, and ſo turned them out of doors, the next company taking away their cloaths, and cloathing them with their rags. The next company thinking they may have Money in thoſe rags, take them alſo, ſearch their Mouths, and thoſe parts which modeſty will not admit of an expreſſion: if they can find none, they ſet their Skeins at their Breaſts, to try if they can extort any thing when the poor Proteſtants are naked. Bluſh, O Sun! to behold the inhumane cruelties and beaſtly uſages of theſe unheard of Cannibals.</p>
            <p>They enſlaved the poor Proteſtants under them, making them work like Horſes all day, digging and delving for them, and then ſhut them up all Night, not knowing what wages, whether life or death ſhould be allotted, and ſo every Night lay trembling and praying that they might be delivered from their cruelties.</p>
            <p>Some Miniſters they whipped, others they ſet in the Stocks, and made others to go to Maſs againſt their wills, then told them, now that they had ſaved their Souls, they would hang they Bodies.</p>
            <p>A Miniſter ſeeing his Wife abuſed, and his Children roaſted, and deſiring them to put him out of his extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of anguiſh, which he ſuffered by ſeeing ſuch cruelty committed on thoſe ſo near him, they moſt inhumanely cut his Tongue out of his Head.</p>
            <p>And for a concluſion of this dreadfull Tragedy, it is related from one of the laſt Letters from <hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:101698:20"/>
that ſeventeen of thoſe barbarous monſters came to a Miniſter's houſe, where they violently fell on him and his Wife, ſtript them naked, bound them back to back, then cut off the Miniſters privy members, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward raviſhed his Wife on his back, and then inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely cut their Throats: tranſcendent cruelty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Pagans and Atheiſts.</p>
