            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now as for the shifting about our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is the cheif ground of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said publick instrument before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that wholy tendeth (supposing our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif, and practise to be according) to the disgrace of those who are in that cours of prayer, and to affright those who come after from following their aduise in any thing.

of coming to Religion, and if we do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with our obligation in this kind we shal liue quietly and dy confidently; for the <hi>Humility</hi> that is in this practise wil carry vs through al things. <hi>This way of true Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and subiection to <hi>God</hi> in al things, is a way which though we walk as it were vpon thorns by reason of the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onss, temptations, pains, and afflictions with which those are tried that must be <hi>his</hi> true friends: yet the regard that the soul in al hath of <hi>him,</hi> and the <hi>loue</hi> which by al increaseth in her, maketh it seem to her that she walketh vpon Roses in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the difficulties she suffered when she sought her own wil, by following it, and seeking her own ease, and honour.</p>
            <p>This is that Obedience which Fa. Baker so much commends, and wishes souls to make right vse of in there Obedienco to Superiors which is so immediate a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to it, and so great a help to strenthen, and perfect it: and which if we neglect in vain do we pretend to practife that towards <hi>God.</hi> For their ordinances, and orders are a most certain argument of <hi>his wil</hi>: And nothing wil <hi>he</hi> bid a soul do contrary to them.</p>

til <hi>he</hi> altered their minds, which <hi>he</hi> always doth, if it be according to <hi>his wil,</hi> and necessary for <hi>his</hi> honour that) the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior condescend. This I am confident he doth teach, and hold; and neuer other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin did I euer hear him affirme, and what might be construed in a contrary sense was but to condescend to the imperfection of beginners: who if they had been held to such precise Obedience, as some would exact of them, they would haue been in great danger neuer to haue obeyed rightly at al. For by exacting vertue and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise thereof aboue the Grace and ability of a simple beginner; they make Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and other vertues seeme to be by practise an intollerable burthen, and they by this means also faint in their way e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in their first beginning. VVhereas if they had been to do things with discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they vould haue been able to go faster on euery day then other. And this one point is of sueh moment that for want of the true practise thereof, it commeth many times that the burthens of Religion seem so heauy to good and wel meaning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But yet I must needs say that of al in this howse I could neuer see, but one who could discourse, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish his points in, and of Obedience, and draw out of them a setled quiet, and satisfactory course, but that when he is gone they be as far to seeke as they were before in the vnderstanding of it.

            <p>This therefor was that which made me so affect F.

And God doth send,<note place="margin">☜</note> and giue a soul that seeketh nothing but sincearly to <hi>loue,</hi> and please <hi>him</hi>) such occasions to humble her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (which to none can be seene; becaus the knowledge, and cause is wholy within herself) that it is of more force to humble her then her being neglected of al the world would be; though that be also a great help and a great fauour of <hi>God.</hi> For her soul can neuer be pure, and free for the ascending to the praise of <hi>God,</hi> til it be very humble, which the more a sonl endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to be, the more <hi>Peace</hi> doth she enioy, and the freer accesse doth she find to <hi>God,</hi> and the lesse impediments between <hi>him</hi> and her soul.</p>
            <p>For this true <hi>Humility,</hi> and <hi>Obedieuce</hi> to <hi>God</hi> which Fa.
