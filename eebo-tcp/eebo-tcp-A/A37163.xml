            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <salute>My LORD,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOUR Lordſhip was pleaſed, the other Day, to intimate, That You would willingly know my Opinion in General of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is Hurtful, or Beneficial to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98621:3"/>
And my Thoughts, concerning the Bill, for Prohibiting the Wearing all <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> Wrought Silks, Bengalls, and Dy'd, Printed, or Stain'd Callicoes. What has occurr'd to my Obſervation in theſe Two Points, I ſhall Offer with great Sincerity, having no Intereſt, or Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſway me, in the Queſtions, one way, or other.</p>
               <p>But, before I begin, I muſt beg leave to ſay, I am very glad to ſee Your Lordſhip bend Your Excellent Wit, and Right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to Inquiries of this Nature.</p>
               <p>For nothing can be more Important to a Noble Man, than A True Knowledge of the Manufactures, Trade, Wealth, and Strength of his Country: Nor, can Your Eloquence be any way more Uſefully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, than in Diſcourſing Skilfully upon this Subject, in that Great Aſſembly of which You are ſo much an Ornament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richlieu</hi> has left behind Him an Evidence how much He made theſe Matters His Care and Study: Which, however Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected by the Miniſters of the Preſent Age, are notwithſtanding the only Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a Solid and Laſting Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>For who can give a Prince ſound Advice, and under Him ſteer the People Rightly and Well, either in Peace, or in War, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98621:3"/>
is Ignorant of the Poſture, Condition, and Intereſt of the Country where he lives? Is there any thing in the World, that ſhould be more thought a Matter of State than Trade, eſpecially in an Iſland, and ſhould not that which is the Common Concern of All, be the Principal Care of ſuch as Govern?</p>
               <p>Can a Nation be Safe without Strength? And is Power to be Compaſs'd and Secur'd but by Riches? And can a Country become Rich any way, but by the Help of a well Managed and Extended Traffick?</p>
               <p>What has enabled <hi>England</hi> to Support this Expenſive War ſo long, but the great Wealth which for Thirty Years, has been flowing into us from Our Commerce A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad?</p>
               <p>The Soil of no Country is Rich enough to attain a great Maſs of Wealth, meerly by the Exchange and Exportation of its Own Natural Product.</p>
               <p>The Staple Commodities that <hi>England</hi> Exports, are the Woollen Manufactures, Tin, Lead, Hides, and ſometimes Corn.</p>
               <p>But, conſidering Our Luxury, and our great Expence of Foreign Wares here at Home, we could not have grown Rich, without Other Dealings in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98621:4"/>
For ſet our Own Exported Product in the Ballance with the Imported Product from <hi>France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and the two <hi>Northern</hi> Kingdoms; At the Foot of the Accompt it will be found, that, but a fourth part of Our Riches, ariſes from the vent of Our own Commodities.</p>
               <p>Whoever looks Strictly and Nicely into Our Affairs, will find, that the Wealth <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had once, did ariſe chiefly from Two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: Firſt, Our Plantation Trade. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Traffick.</p>
               <p>The Plantation Trade gives Employment to many Thouſand Artificers here at home, and takes off a great quantity of our Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Manufactures, The Returns of all which are made in Tobacco, Cotton, Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Sugars, Indico, &amp;c. by which we were not onely ſupply'd for Our Own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, but we had formerly where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to ſend to <hi>France, Flanders, Hambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt-Countrey</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> for 500,000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> beſides what we Ship'd for <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Streights,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Since we were Supplanted in the Spice Trade by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and ſince great part of the Pepper Trade is gone by the Loſs of <hi>Bantam,</hi> Our Chief Inveſtments, or Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> have been in Callicoes, Wrought Silks, Drugs, Salt-Petre,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98621:4"/>
Raw Silk, Cottons, and Cotton Yarn, Goats Wooll, or Carmania Wooll, and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of thoſe Countries. Part of which Commodities are for our own Uſe, but a much greater part in times of Peace were bought up here for the Conſumption of <hi>France, Germany, Holland, Spain, Italy</hi> and Our Plantations.</p>
               <p>So that by the Means of our <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade, though we might loſe by our dealings to ſome Parts, yet We were Gainers by the whole, and in the General Ballance.</p>
               <p>The Woollen Manufacture, Tin, Lead, &amp;c. are indeed the Baſis of all Our Traffick, and the firſt Spring of our dealings Abroad, But if by Careleſneſs or Falſe Meaſures, we ſhould come to be confin'd onely to deal in Our own Product, we muſt think no longer to preſerve the Dominion of the Sea.</p>
               <p>As Bread is call'd the Staff of Life, ſo the Woollen Manufacture is truly the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Nouriſhment of Our Body Politick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as a Man might poſſibly live onely upon Bread, yet his Life would be ill Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd, Feeble, and Unpleaſant; So though <hi>England</hi> could probably ſubſiſt barely upon the Exportation of its own Product, yet to enjoy a more florid Health, to be Rich, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98621:5"/>
and Strong, we muſt have a more extended Traffick than Our Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities can afford us.</p>
               <p>The Woollen Manufacture is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly by Laws, and all poſſible Care, to be Encouraged; but 'tis its Exportation A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and not the Conſumption of it at Home, that muſt bring Profit to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>Some of Our Gentry have been for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years of Opinion, That the Intire Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of <hi>England</hi> depends upon the High Price of Wooll, as thinking thereby to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their Rents, but this proceeds from the Narrow Mind, and Short View of ſuch, who have all along more regarded the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt of Land, than the Concerns of Trade, which are full as Important, and without which, Land will ſoon be of little Value.</p>
               <p>Men in their Private Capacities may be allowed to prefer their Single Profit, but ſhould Conſult only the General Good in Public Councils.</p>
               <p>In a Trading Nation, the Bent of all the Laws ſhould tend to the Encouragement of Commerce, and all Meaſures ſhould be there taken, with a due regard to its Intereſt and Advancement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98621:5"/>
Inſtead of this, in many Particulars, our former Laws bring Incumbrance and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to it, and ſome ſeem Calculated for its utter Ruine; ſo little has it been of late Years the Common Care.</p>
               <p>And yet 'twill be found at laſt, when all Things come to be Rightly Conſider'd, that no Plenty at Home, Victory Abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the People, nor no Conduct, or Wiſdom, in other things, can give the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic effectual help, till we can mend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Poſture of Trade.</p>
               <p>In Our Great Aſſemblies, it has never been ſufficiently thought a Matter of State, but Managed, rather as a Conveniency, or an Accidental Ornament, than the chief Strength and Support of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And as it has never been greatly the Care of Our Miniſters of State, ſo it has not been enough the Study of Our Nobility and Gentry, Who, (give me leave to ſay) for want of a Right Knowledge in the General Notions of it, have been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Impoſed upon, by Particular Merchants, and other Intereſted Perſons, to Enact Laws ſo much to the Prejudice of Trade in General.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Lord,</hi> I ſhall be very free to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the few Lights I have gather'd
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98621:6"/>
from Obſervation, and Inquiry into theſe Matters, and ſhall be very glad if my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours can give Your Lordſhip any hints, which I am certain will be improv'd, by Your deep Judgment, and Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I am clearly convinc'd in General, that the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade is greatly Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I am of Opinion (with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to better Judgments) that the Bill now propos'd to Prohibit the wearing <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> Wrought Silks, Bengals, &amp;c. will be abſolutely diſtructive to the Trade, and very prejudicial to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Which two Points ſhall be impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially handled in the Sequel of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade in General; If all <hi>Europe</hi> by common Conſent would agree to have no further dealings to thoſe Parts, This ſide of the World, by ſuch a Reſolution, would certainly ſave a great and Continual Expence of Treaſure.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Europe</hi> draws from thence nothing of Solid Uſe; Materials to ſupply Luxury, and onely, periſhable Commodities, and ſends thither, Gold, and Silver, which is there bury'd and never returns.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98621:6"/>
I have good Grounds to think That the Silver and Gold brought from <hi>America,</hi> the Gold Duſt brought from <hi>Africk,</hi> and the Silver produc'd from the <hi>European</hi> Mines, in the Two Hundred Years laſt paſt, has not amounted to leſs, in the whole, than Eight Hundred Millions.</p>
               <p>There is no appearance of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Sum in any Country of <hi>Europe.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, there is Yearly a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of theſe Metals, By the wear of Gold and Silver Coin, waſte in Coinage, waſte in working Plate, The wear of wrought Plate, The wear of things made of Gold and Silver Thread, and Wire (a high Article), Leaf and Shell Gold and Silver, Liquid Gold and Silver. There is alſo much loſt in Caſualties by Sea, Fires, and Inundations, and by being privately bury'd and never found.</p>
               <p>But, having computed what may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd for the Yearly Conſumption of Gold and Silver, on all the foregoing Heads, and what quantity of thoſe Metals may be now remaining in <hi>Europe,</hi> I cannot find what is become of the Eight Hundred Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions dug out of the Earth, unleſs a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Fifty Millions of it, be carry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and Sunk in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:98621:7"/>
From whence I have reaſon to conclude, That the <hi>European</hi> Nations in General, had been Richer by a full Third, than they now are, if that Trade had never been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd and undertaken.</p>
               <p>But ſince <hi>Europe</hi> has taſted of this Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, Since the Cuſtom of a Hundred Years, has made their Spices neceſſary to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of all Degrees of People, Since their Silks are pleaſing every where to the better Sort, And ſince their Callicoes are a uſeful wear at Home, and in our own Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> It can never be adviſeable for <hi>England</hi> to quit this Trade, and leave it to any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Burthen which this Commerce lays upon the Collective Body of <hi>Europe,</hi> does bear hard only upon thoſe Countries which Conſume the <hi>Indian</hi> Commodities, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any Share of the Traffick, and therefore <hi>France</hi> did about Twelve Years ago very wiſely prohibit the wearing Callicoes, that were not of their own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> which together are not a Tenth part of <hi>Europe,</hi> enjoy this Traffick almoſt without any Rivalſhip; and if it be a Burthen, it lyes not upon the one, but on the other Nine parts, So that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98621:7"/>
if the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade carry out the Gold and Silver from this ſide of the World, 'tis truly, and properly, at the Coſt, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, of <hi>France, Germany, Spain,</hi> and the Northern Kingdoms, who have little, or no Opportunities of Trading thither.</p>
               <p>To imagine all <hi>Europe</hi> will come to an Agreement of Dealing no more to thoſe Parts, is an abſurd and wild Notion; Since therefore the Weſtern Nations are content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be deceiv'd, and for a Hundred Years have been accuſtom'd to bear this deceit, 'twould be Egregious Folly in us, to quit this Advantage, and leave it intirely to the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the beſt account I can have, and from Impartial Hands, <hi>England</hi> before the War for ſome time, one Year with another has Exported for this Traffick, either in Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, or our Manufactures (of which the Manufactures might be near an Eighth part) about <hi>per Annum</hi>—400,000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe we Conſume at home the Returns of—200,000</p>
               <p>But, by the way, I muſt take Notice here, that the Company, of late Years, have carry'd out the value of 100,000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in our home Manufactures.</p>
               <p>If the Company Export to other Nations the Returns of the other Two Hundred
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98621:8"/>
Thouſand Pounds (which I may ſafely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm they did, and will do in time of Peace) <hi>England</hi> muſt certainly be a great Gainer by this Traffick.</p>
               <p>For no one vers'd in Merchandize will deny, but that the Returns from <hi>India</hi> of 200,000 <hi>l.</hi> when Exported to other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries muſt Increaſe the firſt Sum at leaſt Four-fold, and produce 800,000.</p>
               <p>So that the Accompt of <hi>England</hi> with the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the <hi>European</hi> Nations, may be thus Ballanc'd.</p>

               <p>The Inſpection I have made upon other Occaſions, into the general State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this Kingdom, has led me upon very good Grounds to think, that the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade did annually add to the groſs Stock of <hi>England</hi> at leaſt 600,000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in times of Peace.</p>
               <p>For I have many Cogent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reaſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Me to believe, That from about <hi>Anno</hi> 1656. to <hi>Anno</hi> 1688. this Nation has every Year gradually increas'd in Riches; By what degrees, is needleſs here to incert, but upon mature Conſideration, I may ſafely ſtate, that about <hi>Anno</hi> 1688. the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or Addition to the Wealth and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Stock of <hi>England,</hi> ariſing from Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Trade, and home Manufactures, was at leaſt Two Millions yearly.</p>
               <p>And after much Thought, and Study on this Subject, and by conſulting Others vers'd in Speculations of the like Nature, I find that this Increaſe to the Nations General Stock, did probably ariſe from the Three following Articles, <hi>Viz.</hi>

               <p>If the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade did in Peaceful Times, bring ſo great an Increaſe to the Annual Income of the Kingdom (and I think the contrary is capable of no clear Demonſtration) the Legiſlative Power ought to proceed with much Caution, in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter relating to it.</p>
               <p>Whatever Country can be in the full and undiſputed Poſſeſſion of it, will give Law to all the Commercial World.</p>
               <p>Should we quit the Hold we have in <hi>India,</hi> and abandon the Traffick, Our Neighbours the <hi>Dutch</hi> will undoubtedly engroſs the whole: And if to their Naval Strength in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſuch a Foreign Strength
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98621:9"/>
and Wealth be added, <hi>England</hi> muſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be contented to Trade by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and under their Banners.</p>
               <p>As War does vary all the Circumſtances of Trade, alter its Channel, give it to one People, and take it from another, So in ſeaſons of War, 'tis by no means proper, nor adviſeable, to embrace New Councils in relation to it: Nor can we then take any True Meaſures, or make any Right, and Sound Judgment about it.</p>
               <p>The Scarcity of Money in a long War, makes any Exportation of Bullion thought a great Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>evance; of which, in Quiet Times, we ſhould not be ſenſible.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner, the Interruption of any Manufacture, though never ſo Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Kingdom, is grievous in a Time of War, when Buſineſs is ſcarce, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dull, But in a Time of Peace, and full Employment, theſe Hands can ſhift from one Work, to another, without any great Prejudice to themſelves, or the Public.</p>
               <p>There having been for Three Years laſt paſt, a great want of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods, and there happening of late a great Call for the Woollen Manufactures, and indeed for all the Product of <hi>England,</hi> ſome unthinking Perſons, grew preſently to imagine that the want of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods (and no other
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98621:10"/>
Reaſon) had brought the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture into Requeſt, and increaſed its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, from whence very many have began to argue, and infer, That the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade is, and alwayes was, prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But the ſudden Call which was then for all kind of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commodities, as well as the Woollen Manufacture, <hi>viz.</hi> Lead, Tin, Leather, Butter, Cheeſe, Tallow, &amp;c. did not proceed from the want of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods, but indeed from the Poſture of the Exchange Abroad, the Ill Condition of our Silver Coyn, and the High Price Guineas were brought to: For we plainly ſee this great Demand, both Abroad, and at Home, for our Goods does ceaſe, now Guineas are lower'd, and the Coyn is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Lord,</hi> It has been too often the Fault of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Councils, to determine Raſhly of the moſt Important Matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>And (with Submiſſion to better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) I doubt it may be of very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſequence at this Time, to meddle with, or give any Diſturbance to a Settled Traffick.</p>
               <p>The Concern of Wooll is, without doubt, to be taken care of, but not ſo as upon that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98621:10"/>
account to ſlight all our Foreign Intereſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company has been for a long time look'd upon with an Evil Eye, by ſome People, becauſe there has formerly been Ill Management in their Affairs; and for that ſome of their Goods were thought to hinder the Conſumption of our own Manufactures; and becauſe it was ſeen what Silver they really carried out, and not enough Conſider'd what Bullion their Effects brought hither in Return.</p>
               <p>Some Perſons (without Doors) either Bribed by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or to flatter that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, profeſs themſelves Open Enemies to the Traffick in General; Others through Inadvertency, and for want of Examining the bottom of Things, give into their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and others joyn with them out of Immoderate Zeal to promote the Woollen Manufacture: So that any diſcerning Man may ſee, that the utter Ruin of this Trade, and its intire Loſs to <hi>England</hi> will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, unleſs the King, aſſiſted by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power, out of His Fatherly Love to His People, interpoſe, with His Wiſdom, in the matter.</p>
               <p>One of the principal Dangers now, of taking New Councils about it, is, That in a time of War, if by any falſe Steps and Meaſures, we ſhould loſe Ground in <hi>India,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:98621:11"/>
neither our Condition, nor the Nature of our Preſent Alliance with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> will permit us to aſſert our Right in thoſe Parts by Force of Arms.</p>
               <p>And if we ſhould come ſo to loſe our Hold in <hi>India,</hi> as not to Trade thither at all, or but weakly and precariouſly, I will venture to affirm (and I hope Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will remember hereafter this Prediction of mine) that <hi>England</hi> will thereby loſe half its Foreign Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>For all Trades have a Mutual Dependance one upon the other, and one begets another, and the loſs of one, frequently loſes half the reſt. By carrying to other Places the Commodities brought from <hi>India,</hi> We every where inlarg'd our Commerce, and brought Home a great over-ballance, either in Foreign Goods, or in Bullion. In <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> we Exchanged our Wrought Silks, Callicoes, &amp;c. for their Spices: By <hi>Indian</hi> Goods, we could Purchaſe at a better Rate, in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Linnens of <hi>Sileſia, Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Bohemia.</hi> In times of Peace we did, and may again Traffick with <hi>France,</hi> for our <hi>India</hi> Goods againſt the things of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, which will alwayes be brought from thence; and thereby we may bring the Ballance more of our ſide, between us and that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:98621:11"/>
And, My <hi>Lord,</hi> there being a Peace now in agitation between Us and <hi>France,</hi> the Wiſdom of the State perhaps may think fit to inſiſt, as an Article, that the Prohibition of our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods may be taken off in <hi>France,</hi> and if that can be obtain'd, it will put the Trade of <hi>England</hi> with that Kingdom, upon much a more equal Foot.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Streights,</hi> and Parts within the <hi>Streights,</hi> &amp;c. 'tis apparent that a large Share of the Bullion return'd hither, from thence, did proceed from the Sale there, of Callicoes, Pepper, and other <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods conſum'd in thoſe Parts, and alſo bought up by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for their own, and the Conſumption of their Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis hop'd, My <hi>Lord,</hi> the foregoing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments have ſufficiently prov'd, That this Traffick in General is beneficial to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed to deliver my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning the Bill for Prohibiting the Wearing all <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> Wrought Silks, Bengals, and Dyed, Printed, or Stained Callicoes, which was the Second Point I propos'd to handle.</p>

               <p>TRade is the General Concern of this Nation, but every diſtinct Trade has a diſtinct Intereſt. The Wiſdom of the Legiſlative Power conſiſts, in keeping an even hand, to promote all, and chiefly to Encourage ſuch Trades, as increaſe the Publick Stock, and add to the Kingdoms Wealth, conſider d as a Collective Body.</p>
               <p>Trade is in its Nature Free, finds its own Channel, and beſt directeth its own Courſe: and all Laws to give it Rules, and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to Limit, and Circumſcribe it, may ſerve the Particular Ends of Private Men, but are ſeldom Advantagious to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p>Governments, in Relation to it, are to take a Providential Care of the Whole, but generally to let Second Cauſes work their own way; And conſidering all the Links, and Chains, by which they hang together, peradventure it may be affirm'd, That, in the Main, all Trafficks whatſoever are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to a Country.</p>
               <p>They ſay few Laws in a State are an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98621:13"/>
of Wiſdom in a People, but it may be more truly ſaid, that few Laws relating to Trade, are the Mark of a Nation that thrives by Traffick.</p>
               <p>Laws to Compel the Conſumption of ſome Commodities, and prohibit the uſe of others, may do well enough, where Trade is forc'd, and onely Artificial, as in <hi>France;</hi> But in Countries inclin'd by Genius, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to it by Situation, ſuch Laws are needleſs, unnatural, and can have no Effect conducive to the Publick Good.</p>
               <p>I have often wonder'd upon what Grounds the Parliament proceeded in the Act for Burying in Woollen: It Occaſions indeed a Conſumption of Wooll, but ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as produces no advantage to the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>For were it not plainly better, that this Wooll made into Cloth, were Exported, paid for, and worn by the Living abroad, than laid in the Earth here at home.</p>
               <p>And were it not better, That the Common People (who make up the Bulk and are the great Conſumers) ſhould be bury'd in an Old Sheet, fit for nothing elſe, as formerly, than in ſo much New Wooll, which is thereby utterly loſt.</p>
               <p>The Natural Way of promoting the Woollen Manufacture, is not to force its
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98621:13"/>
Conſumption at home, but by wholſome Laws to contrive, That it may be wrought cheaply in <hi>England,</hi> which conſequently will enable us to command the Markets abroad.</p>
               <p>The onely Beneficial way to <hi>England,</hi> of making Wooll yield a good Price, is to have it Manufactur'd cheaply.</p>
               <p>No Country in <hi>Europe,</hi> Manufactures all kind of Goods ſo dearly as this Kingdom; And the <hi>Dutch</hi> at this very day buy up Our Cloaths here, which they carry home, and Nap and Dye ſo Cheaply, that by this means they are able to under-ſell us, in our own Native Commodity.</p>
               <p>The Act for maintenance of the Poor, is the true Bane, and Deſtruction to all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures in General. For it apparently Encourages Sloth, and Beggery; Whereas if the Legiſlative Power would make ſome good Proviſion, that Work-Houſes might in every Pariſh be Erected, and the Poor, ſuch as are Able, compell'd to Work, So many new Hands might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be brought in, as would indeed make the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures Flouriſh.</p>
               <p>I have reaſon to think, that the People receiving Alms in this Kingdom, are Twelve Hundred Thouſand; if but half could be brought to Work, beſides their own Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, their Labour one with another
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98621:14"/>
might produce to the Publick at 20 <hi>s. per</hi> Head, at leaſt <hi>per Annum</hi> 600,000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this could be compaſs'd, the Woollen Manufacture would advance without any Unnatural Driving or Compulſion. For we want Hands, not Manufactures in <hi>England,</hi> and Laws to Compel the Poor to Work, not Work wherewithal to give them Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>To make <hi>England</hi> a true Gainer by the Woollen Manufacture, we ſhould be able to work the Commodity ſo Cheap, as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ſell all Comers to the Markets abroad.</p>
               <p>I ſhall, My <hi>Lord,</hi> advance Two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions which may ſound very ſtrangely, and yet perhaps will be thought very right, and true, upon a Mature Examination.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That 'tis not the Benefit, nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>England</hi> in General, that Wooll ſhould bear a high Price in Our Markets at home.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That by a great Conſumption of the VVoollen Manufactures within this Kingdom, the Publick will not reap ſuch an advantage as ſome imagine.</p>
               <p>Fine broad Cloth, was the Antient Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery of <hi>England,</hi> and which firſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this Manufacture to the Uſe of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98621:14"/>
Countries, This is the Natural Iſſue and Product of the Kingdom, inimitable abroad, and it muſt be very great Careleſsneſs, and want of Conduct, that can make us loſe this Trade ſo Beneficial to the Nation.</p>
               <p>But tho' the VVooll of Other Places is not ſo fit for workmanſhip as Ours, yet the Commodity is abounding almoſt in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Europe;</hi> and if the Cloth of <hi>England</hi> be brought any way to bear too high a Price, it may put ſome of Our Neighbours either upon the Induſtry of Manufacturing their own better: Or upon the Frugality to content themſelves with what they can make at home; And it may reduce other Parts, to ſet up new Manufactures in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which will be very detrimental to the Vent, eſpecially, of Our Narrow and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Cloaths.</p>
               <p>Nothing can make this Commodity Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, ſo as to Enrich <hi>England,</hi> but to have the VVoollen Manufacture ſo Cheap, as that great quantities of our Cloath may be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and at ſuch a Rate, as that we may be able to under-ſell all Nations, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all People from ſetting it up.</p>
               <p>But this can never be, if by Arts, and Inventions, we endeavour to give VVooll an Unnatural Price here at Home, Upon which Score, I have advanc'd the Second
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98621:15"/>
Propoſition, That <hi>England</hi> reaps no ſuch Advantage by a large Conſumption of the Woollen Manufacture within this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>For it is the Intereſt of all Trading Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whatſoever, that their Home Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption ſhould be little, of a Cheap and Foreign Growth, and that their own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, ſhould be Sold, at the higheſt Markets, and ſpent Abroad; Since by what is Conſum'd at Home, one loſeth only what another gets, and the Nation in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is not at all the Richer; But all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Conſumption is a Clear, and Certain Profit. So that in the Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, <hi>England</hi> does not get by what is Spent here by the People, but by what is Sold Abroad in other Countries.</p>
               <p>If the People of <hi>England</hi> are willing, and pleaſed to Wear <hi>Indian</hi> Silks, and Stuffs, of which the Prime Coſt in <hi>India,</hi> is not above a Fourth part of what their own Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities would ſtand them in here; and if they are thereby thus enabled to Export ſo much of their own Product, whatever is ſo ſav'd, is clear Gain to the Kingdom in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. But to ſet this Matter in a clearer Light.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe 200,000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> of the Prime Sum ſent to <hi>India,</hi> is return'd in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities

               <p>Now this muſt be Clear Profit to the Kingdom, Becauſe this Sum would be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes laid out and Conſum'd in our own Product; which Product we are by this Means enabled to Export. For when we come to Examine into the True Reaſon of the Great Wealth of <hi>Holland,</hi> we ſhall find it chiefly to ariſe from this Frugality of Conſuming at Home what is Cheap, or comes Cheaply, and carrying Abroad what is Rich, and will yield moſt Money.</p>
               <p>'Tis granted That Bengals and Stain'd Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licoes, and other <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods, do hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conſumption of <hi>Norwich</hi> Stuffs, Crapes, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ratines, Shaloons, Sayes, Perpetuanas, and Antherines: But the ſame Objection will lye againſt the Uſe of any
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98621:16"/>
thing that is of Foreign Growth; For the Importation of Wine, undoubtedly hinders the Conſumption of Barly; and <hi>England</hi> could ſubſiſt, and the Poor perhaps would have fuller Employment, if Foreign Trade were quite laid aſide; But this would ill Conſiſt with our being Great at Sea, upon which (under the Preſent Poſture of Affairs in <hi>Europe)</hi> all our Safety does certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods do ſomething interfere with the Woollen Manufacture, muſt undoubtedly be granted, but the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Matter to be Conſider'd, is, Which way the Nation in General is more Cheaply ſupply'd.</p>
               <p>If 100,000 <hi>l.</hi> Prime Coſt to <hi>India,</hi> brings Home ſo many Goods as ſtand in the ſtead, and ſupply the room of 400,000 <hi>l.</hi> of our own Manufactures, It muſt certainly be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable not to Prohibit ſuch a Trade, but rather to divert the Wooll uſed in theſe our Home Manufactures, and the Craft, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Induſtry employ'd about 'em, to the Making Fine Broad Cloth, Courſe and Narrow Cloths, Stuffs and other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, fit for Sale in Foreign Markets; Since 'tis an undoubted Truth, that 400,000 <hi>l.</hi> worth of our Native Goods Sold Abroad, does add more to the Nations General Stock,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98621:16"/>
and Wealth, than Four Millions worth of our Home Product Conſum'd within the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But, beſides, ſuppoſe the Wearing <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Wrought Silks, &amp;c. in <hi>England</hi> were Prohibited, and that their whole Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were Interdicted, I do not ſee how ſuch Prohibitions would at all Advance the Vent of our Home Product. For in one Caſe, If they hinder the Conſumption of the Woollen Manufacture at Home, will they not when Exported, hinder its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and the Sale of Cloaths in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Parts? And in the other Caſe, If the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were forbid to bring <hi>Indian</hi> Goods into <hi>Europe,</hi> will not the <hi>Dutch</hi> Import them, and thereby in the ſame manner, hurt Abroad, the Vent and Conſumption of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloths?</p>
               <p>Upon the whole Matter, My <hi>Lord,</hi> it is my Opinion, (which I ſubmit to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Judgments) That the Importation of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> Wrought Silks, Stain'd Callicoes, &amp;c. though it may ſomewhat interfere with the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of <hi>Norwich, Briſtol,</hi> and other particular Places; yet, that ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation adds to the Kingdoms main Stock, and Wealth, and is not prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the General Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>England.</hi>

               <head>And Secondly as to the Silk and Linnen Manufactures.</head>
               <p>WIſdom is moſt commonly in the Wrong, when it pretends to direct Nature. The various Products of different Soiles, and Countries, is an Indication, that Providence intended they ſhould be helpful to each other, and mutually ſupply the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of one another.</p>
               <p>And as it is great Folly to Compel a Youth to that ſort of Study, to which he is not adapted by Genius, and Inclination: So it can never be Wiſe, to endeavour the introducing into a Country, either the Growth of any Commodity, or any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, for which, nor the Soil, nor the General Bent of the People is proper: And as forc'd Fruits (though they may look fair to the Eye) are notwithſtanding Taſtleſs, and Unwholſome; So a Trade forc'd in this manner, brings no National Profit, but is Prejudicial to the Publick.</p>
               <p>We have ſuch Advantages by Situation, and in ſeveral Commodities, and Materials, Natural, and almoſt peculiar to us, that if the Improvement of them were ſufficiently
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98621:17"/>
look'd after, and encourag'd by the State, we might increaſe in Wealth, Greatneſs, and Power, peradventure beyond all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is our Fault, if we do not enjoy the Woollen Manufacture without any Rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but undoubtedly it might be very much advanced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If Work-Houſes were ſet up, If the Laws did Provide, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy in the Execution did take Care, to ſet the Poor to work.</p>
               <p>Such an Increaſe of Hands would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe produce more Tin, and Lead, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to afford Leather Cheaper: And it is a large Exportation, and being able to underſell all others, in Foreign Markets, that brings National Profit.</p>
               <p>More Hands would quicken Induſtry, and improve waſte Ground, which would enable us to carry out Corn, at a Cheap Rate.</p>
               <p>And generally ſpeaking all Laws reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Idleneſs, and that will invite People hither, muſt better the Manufactures, and make 'em more gainful to the Nation.</p>
               <p>There is no Trade ſo Advantageous, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to an Iſland, as that of Buying Goods in one Country, to ſell them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and it is the Original and chief Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Great Wealth in <hi>Holland.</hi> There
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98621:18"/>
is Gain by the Freight: It occaſions Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of our Home Product: It breeds Seamen, Increaſes Shipping, and improves Navigation: And any Home Manufacture that hinders this kind of Traffick, or that indeed interferes with it, is pernicious, and ought in Wiſdom, and by all Rules of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, to be diſcouraged by the Publick. This kind of Commerce <hi>England</hi> was formerly in a large poſſeſſion of, and it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triev'd, and in the beſt of Times was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of great Improvement.</p>
               <p>Our Plantations (if we take Care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from Foreign Inſults and Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) as they Increaſe in People, will Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume more of our Home Manufactures than we have Hands to make: They produce Commodities indiſpenſably neceſſary to this part of the World, and not to be produced elſewhere, and with Induſtry and Conduct, may be made an inexhauſtible Mine of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to their Mother Kingdom.</p>
               <p>If there be ſuch a Multitude of Hands that want VVork in <hi>England,</hi> the Herring Fiſhery would employ many Thouſands of Men, and one Million of Money; and, the Advantages our Situation gives us for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, we might at leaſt come in for a Share, with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in that Trade, which brings them ſo immenſe a Profit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:98621:18"/>
Some of the foregoing Materials are Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Gifts and Bleſſings to this Soil; Our Inclinations to the Sea, fit us as well as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for the Traffick of carrying Goods from one Countrey to another (the moſt certain Gain a Nation can make) Our Ports are ſafer and fitter than theirs for this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Our Plantation Trade, to carry it on to its Height, would require a greater Stock than we are Maſters of at preſent, and would Conſume more of Our Manufactures, and home Product, than we can make and furniſh at Reaſonable Rates. As to the Fiſhery, if we are not intirely in Poſſeſſion of it, and if other Nations have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to make ſuch a Profit upon Our Coaſt, it has proceeded from want of Induſtry in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> People, and through the Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of former Governments.</p>
               <p>In the foremention'd Particulars, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd and a Natural Improvement may be made in our VVealth and Subſtance, and 'tis here the Legiſlative Power may, to good effect, interpoſe with its Care and VViſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>Moſt Countries have a certain Number of their People, who addict themſelves to Trade and Manufactures, and moſt Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have limited Stock to be employ'd in thoſe Uſes, which they cannot well exceed;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98621:19"/>
And 'tis the Prudence of a State, to ſee, that this Induſtry, and Stock, be not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from things profitable to the whole, and turn'd upon Objects unprofitable, and perhaps dangerous to the Publick.</p>
               <p>The Stock <hi>England</hi> formerly had run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Trade and Manufactures, was very conſiderable, and I am ſorry, upon a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Inquiry, to find it ſo much decreas'd: What remains, and more than can be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd in many Years of Peace, will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently employ'd in that Buſineſs, where the Nation is a certain and known Gainer; and therefore ſhould not be diverted upon uncertain Objects, and turn'd upon new Inventions, in which it cannot be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, in many Years, whither we get or looſe, and how the Ballance ſtands: And of this nature, and kind, are the Silk, and Linnen Manufactures in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Silk is a Manufacture of a Foreign Extract, and not the Genuine Product of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; It Employs indeed the Poor, but is not compos'd from a Material of our own Growth. Whatever Encouragement it meets with, it cannot thrive with us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not Calculated for our Meridian: 'Tis fit onely for frugal Nations, where Parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony renders Craft and Workmanſhip not dear, upon which ſcore the <hi>French, Italians,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:98621:19"/>
and <hi>Dutch,</hi> will always be able to under-ſell us in that Commodity, and hinder any Succeſs we can propoſe. And as an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this, Did not the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> lately, bring hither <hi>French</hi> Luſtring, under their Seal, which they could afford ſo Cheap, as to under-ſell the Projectors of it here, tho' they were at the Charge of Freight and Cuſtom.</p>
               <p>The Stock and Induſtry laid out on the Silk Manufacture, would be more uſefully employ'd, in ſuch as are made from Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of Our own Growth.</p>
               <p>If the Luxury of wearing Silk could be quite Aboliſh'd, ſuch a Reformation would undoubtedly be beneficial to the Kingdom; but ſince this is not eaſily to be Compaſs'd, a wiſe State muſt conſider which Way the Folly of their People can be ſupply'd at the cheapeſt rate, For, Frugality of this Nature, as certainly enriches the whole, as it does any private Perſon.</p>
               <p>There are brought from <hi>India</hi> Two ſorts of Silks.</p>
               <p>The one is of ſuch a ſort as is not made in <hi>England,</hi> and conſequently onely hinders the Importation of the like kind, at a dearer Rate, from <hi>Holland, Italy, France, Turkey</hi> and other Places.</p>
               <p>The other is of the like ſort with thoſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98621:20"/>
made here, notwithſtanding which, it muſt certainly be prejudicial to the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> to forbid their Importation from <hi>India,</hi> unleſs thoſe, and all other kinds of Silk applicable to the ſame Uſes, could be Prohibited to be brought from Foreign Countries: ſince by ſuch Prohibition (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the vanity it ſelf can be cured) we onely enrich the Neighbouring Nations at Our Expence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods ſince they were in uſe, have apparently lower'd the Price of Silks from <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> at leaſt 25 <hi>per Cent:</hi> and if their Importation ſhould be prohibited, will it not follow Naturally that the <hi>European</hi> Countries will again ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance upon us?</p>
               <p>And the <hi>French, Italians,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who upon ſeveral Accounts are able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work us, will undoubtedly fall to making and ſending hither ſuch Commodities, as may ſtand in the Room here of <hi>Indian</hi> Goods, and at the low Rates they can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford 'em, they will quickly ruin Our Silk Manufactures: And when the Fabrick is diſtroy'd, and the Stock and Hands em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in it, are diverted to other Uſes, they may put what Fine they pleaſe upon our Vanity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:98621:20"/>
The <hi>Dutch</hi> have ſuch a Silk Manufacture in their Country, that by Computation, there is Imported hither, from thence, more of that Commodity, one Year with another than we bring from <hi>India.</hi> Moſt of the Velvets us'd here, come from thence, and are purchas'd by us at a dearer rate, than could be afford'd from <hi>India,</hi> or made here at home, if we were skill'd in the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding the <hi>Dutch</hi> have ſo conſiderable a Silk Manufacture of their own, inſtead of Prohibiting, they encourage the Importation of all <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Silks: well knowing, That 'tis the Intereſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Nation, to go to their own, or Foreign Markets, with Goods as cheap as they can, thereby to beat out all others. And that the Cheapneſs of any Commodity, will force a way into thoſe Countries where it is prohibited, if any of the like ſort and kind is indulg'd and permitted to be worn there; Nothing being able to render the Prohibition of Goods intirely Effectual in any Nation, but a Capacity in the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of ſuch Country, to afford them at Cheaper Rates, which can hardly be the Caſe of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:98621:21"/>
As to the Linnen Manufacture, it is no more the Genuine Offspring of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than that of Silk.</p>
               <p>'Tis true that ſome of the Materials for it, may be had from our own Soil, but not enough to ſupply our whole Conſumption, and we can never pretend to make the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſort.</p>
               <p>And if the now intended Prohibition ſhould ſo Operate, as utterly to loſe us the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade (which peradventure may be the Caſe) the <hi>Dutch</hi> may put what rate they pleaſe upon their Callicoes; And the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and other Nations, will Impoſe any Price upon their Fine Linnens (which Our Callicoes for ſome Years have kept down) So that, Our neceſſary Conſumption in this Commodity, will ſtand us in above 40 <hi>per Cent.</hi> more than it does at preſent.</p>
               <p>This Manufacture is proper onely for Countries where they can have Flax and Hemp Cheap, and where the Common People work at very eaſie Rates.</p>
               <p>But tho' with forcing Nature, and by Art, and Induſtry, we could bring it to greater Perfection, yet upon other Accounts 'tis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not adviſeable, nor for the Nations Intereſt, to promote it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Our Soil and the Labour of the People may be employ'd about Materials
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98621:21"/>
more Advantageous, and wherein we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſold by other Countries.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The growth of this Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture would obſtruct Trade, and other Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs more Important to the Nation: For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Noble Staple of Wooll is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly capable of a great Improvement, to which the Increaſe of Wages (that muſt happen upon an Increaſe in the Linnen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture) will be a conſiderable hindrance. And one cannot riſe, but to the prejudice of the other, Becauſe we really want People and Hands to carry on both to their full perfection. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is more the General Intereſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to Export Woollen Manufacture in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change Abroad for Linnen, than to make it here at Home; which Trade has been ſet afoot, and proſper'd very much, to the great Benefit of this Kingdom, ſince the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of <hi>French</hi> Goods during this War.</p>
               <p>But if we provide our ſelves at Home with Linnen ſufficient for our Conſumption, and do not want that which is brought from <hi>Sileſia, Saxony, Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> this Trade muſt ceaſe; For theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries have neither Money, nor other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; and if we deal with them, we muſt be contented, in a manner, to barter our Cloaths, for their Linnen; And 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious

               <p>In Proceſs of Time, when <hi>England</hi> ſhall come to be more Peopled; And when a long Peace ſhall have increaſed our Wealth and Stock, perhaps we may be able not only to carry on our old Manufactures to their full height, but to embrace new Ones, Such as are that of Silk and Linnen; but as our Caſe ſtands, it ſeems ſufficient to let them take their own Natural Courſe, and not to drive them on; For too many ſorts of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes may be as well hurtful in the Publick, as they are often to Private Perſons.</p>
               <p>If the Nation finds a General Profit from them, their own Weight will bear them on; but in the mean while, it cannot be Adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in their Favour, to exerciſe any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Act of Power; and for their ſake, by Prohibitions, to diſtreſs, embroil, and diſturb any ſettled Trade, by which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Contradiction, the Nation, before the War, was ſo great a Gainer.</p>

               <head>And Thirdly, As to the Effect ſuch a Prohibition will have upon the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade in General.</head>
               <p>IN all Argumentations, 'tis requiſite to ſettle, and agree upon Principles; for which Reaſon, in the beginning of this Diſcourſe, I did endeavour to prove, That in general the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade was Profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this Kingdom. And I dwelt the longer upon that Head, becauſe ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are quite of a Contrary Opinion, and believe it hurtful to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I am ſatisfied that many (without Doors) promote the Bill in Queſtion, in hopes thereby utterly to deſtroy the Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick.</p>
               <p>And, truly My <hi>Lord,</hi> it ſeems plain to me, that the intended Prohibitions muſt prove, though not a ſudden, yet a certain deſtruction to it. And that 'tis a lopping from this Trade, the Branches, and taking away ſome of the Bark, and part of the Root: The Trunk indeed is left, but ſo maim'd, and injur'd, that it can never ſpread and flouriſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:98621:23"/>
If it can be made appear this Prohibition is no ways to be render'd effectual: And if it can be ſhown, that the ſaid Prohibitions will utterly diſable the Preſent <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, or any other, to be hereafter Erected, from Supporting, and Carrying on the Trade, to the Advantage of <hi>England,</hi> Your Lordſhip will certainly think the Bill, now a foot, of dangerous Conſequence, and not fit to receive a Sanction in the Houſe of Peers.</p>
               <p>No Prohibitions of a Foreign or Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Commodity, can have any Effect, without Sumptuary Laws ſtrictly penn'd, and rigorouſly put in Execution.</p>
               <p>For, the Importation of <hi>French</hi> Wines, and Linnen, has been forbidden under high Penalties during this War, yet the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of thoſe ſort of Commodities, is not much leſſen'd, and they are brought in upon us, from other Countries, at much a dearer Rate. For theſe Three Years laſt paſt, <hi>French</hi> Wines have been convey'd hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the way of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Silks, and Linnens, have been all along ſecretly brought, and ſmuggled upon our own Coaſt.</p>
               <p>Perhaps if ſevere Sumptuary Laws had Impos'd a High Duty, or Penalty, upon the Conſumers of <hi>French</hi> Wine, Silks, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98621:24"/>
Linnen, the Prohibition might have had its deſigned Effect: But how ſuch Laws could have been made Practicable, I ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to determine.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner, if a ſevere Mulct, or a High Duty, can be laid on ſuch as ſhall Wear or Uſe any <hi>India,</hi> or <hi>Perſia</hi> Wrought Silks, Bengals, &amp;c. and if this were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the Prohibition, peradventure it might be render'd Effectual.</p>
               <p>But, otherwiſe, notwithſtanding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, of Wearing ſuch Goods, and the Penalties upon the Retailers that ſhall vend them, their Conſumption will be little leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened in this Kingdom, for they will be brought in upon us from other Countries, <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> more eſpecially.</p>
               <p>However, though ſuch a Method is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure the only way of keeping down this Luxury, I am very far, My <hi>Lord,</hi> from thinking it Adviſeable.</p>
               <p>For the Laws of all Countries muſt be ſuited to the Bent and Inclinations of the People: And (which I am loath to ſay) there is ſometimes a Neceſſity, they ſhould be a little accommodated to their deprav'd Manners, and Corruptions.</p>
               <p>The People of <hi>England,</hi> who have been long accuſtom'd to Mild Laws, and a looſe Adminiſtration, can never indure that Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98621:24"/>
which is needful to make ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition have Effect: Nor can they ſuffer High Duties, or Penalties to be impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Pleaſures, or bear a ſtrict Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into their Furniture and Apparel.</p>
               <p>There is no Country without a multitude of Sumptuary Laws, but hardly a Place can be inſtanc'd, where they are Obſerv'd, or produce any Publick Good. They were ſomewhat regarded in the Infancy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth, before Riches and Pomp, had baniſh'd Vertue, and Obedience: But their chiefeſt Strength was alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the Sanctity, and Veneration, in which was held the Office of <hi>Cenſor.</hi> And in <hi>England,</hi> they would be immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd, and derided; and any Magiſtrate muſt become the Publick Scorn, that ſhould think to put them in Execution.</p>
               <p>And yet without Strict Sumptuary Laws, well Obſerv'd, the Wiſdom of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will find it ſelf eluded, when it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to baniſh Foreign Vanities and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in favour of our own Product and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures.</p>
               <p>For in all probability, the Conſequence of ſuch a Prohibition will be, That Goods of the ſame kind, or Goods applicable to the like uſe, inſtead of thoſe Imported from <hi>India,</hi> will be brought hither from Abroad;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98621:25"/>
and the Conſumption will not be leſs, but at a much dearer Rate. It may indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better our Manufactures, but will more Advance thoſe of <hi>France, Italy</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> who can afford to work Cheaper: And, in all appearance, will thereby prove ſuch a drein of this Kingdoms Treaſure, as may bring utter deſtruction upon us.</p>
               <p>But the principal Queſtion is, Whether, under ſuch Prohibitions, any Body of Men can find their Accompt in carrying on this Trade?</p>
               <p>To make this Traffick an Addition of Strength, as well as Riches to the Kingdom, Encouragement ſhould be given to ſend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Large, and Strong Ships, which will be Expenſive to the Undertakers.</p>
               <p>Their Buſineſs in <hi>India</hi> cannot be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd without frequent Gifts and Preſents, to the Rajahs and Governours, according to the Practice in all the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries.</p>
               <p>Forts, and Caſtles, with good Garriſons, are there indiſpenſably neceſſary, for the preſervation of the Pepper Trade, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, needful upon many other Accompts, As Magazines for Naval Proviſion, and as Store Houſes, in which to lay Goods, bought in the Country, at proper Seaſons: Beſides they are a Safety to Our People, from any Inſults of the Natives, And a Refuge, upon
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98621:25"/>
any Diſorder, Revolution, or other Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency in the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s State and Empire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>A Trade Limited and Circumſcrib'd in the Manner propos'd, cannot well undergo theſe Expences, which notwithſtanding are neceſſary for its Preſervation.</p>

               <p>But we muſt take Notice, that the 1,200,000 <hi>l.</hi> Profit, ſuppos'd in time of Peace to ariſe from this Trade, did not, all of it, accrue to the Adventurers in the Company, but was National, and divided among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thouſands of the People. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who at the Companies Sales bought Goods for Exportation, had their Share, and the Retailers here had their Proportion, in the Gain, which this Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98621:26"/>
in the whole, might be Computed to produce.</p>
               <p>And particularly for their Share in the 600,000 <hi>l.</hi> ſuppoſed to be gained by our own Conſumption, in time of Peace, by this Traffick: There came in, The King for His Cuſtoms; Owners of Ships; Such as got by Victualling them; Seamen for Wages: And, laſtly, Factors and Servants, both Abroad, and at Home.</p>
               <p>The Gain made Abſtractedly by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, has never been Invidious: For if their whole Stock be Computed from their Beginning, to this Day, it will be found, by their Dividends, That they have not one Year, with another, divided 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> which, conſidering the Length and Hazard of their Voyages, is not a Profit to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied.</p>
               <p>But ſince this War, the Company have without doubt been great Loſers, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Invincible Courage, which has been alwayes obſerv'd in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, could have hindered the Trade from being intirely Loſt.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all the Companies late Loſſes at Sea, and their former Ill Conduct in <hi>India,</hi> they have not loſt footing there, but have, hitherto, preſerv'd the Trade, indeed at their own Expence.</p>

However, if any thing ſhould be done that will Interrupt any great part of their Commerce, they muſt apparently give it over, or ſink under the Burthen; For the Charge and Expence Abroad muſt be full as much to ſupport a Little, as a more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Traffick.</p>

               <p>According to the beſt and moſt Impartial Accounts I can receive, the Bill in Agitation, muſt loſe <hi>England</hi> half the Trade to <hi>India</hi> in General, all the Traffick to the Coaſt and Bay of <hi>Bengal,</hi> and half the Buſineſs to <hi>Surrat.</hi>

And, particularly, as to the <hi>Coaſt</hi> and <hi>Bay,</hi> The Company did uſually ſend thither Yearly Five or Six Ships, of between Six and Seven Hundred Tons each: The Fifth part of which, returns Freighted with Salt-Petre; One other Fifth part with Fine Muſlins, Floretta Yarn, and Raw Silks; The other Three parts, with Goods by the Bill Prohibited: The Conſequence of which muſt be, That the Trade to the <hi>Coaſt</hi> and <hi>Bay,</hi> will prove ſo inconſiderable, that it muſt be abandon'd, and <hi>England</hi> reduc'd to buy all its Salt-Petre from the <hi>Scots, Danes</hi> or <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I take Our home Conſumption, which is half of the returns of the Prime Coſt ſent to <hi>India,</hi> to be the main Foundation upon which the Trade ſtands, eſpecially, in a Time of War.</p>
               <p>'Tis that alone can bear the Incident Charges at home, and Expences abroad, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Support of ſo large a Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick; And 'tis that onely, can enable any Company to indure Loſſes at Sea, by Storm, or a Foreign Enemy.</p>
               <p>What Encouragement can there be to go on with ſo vaſt a Buſineſs, if our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants muſt ſingly depend upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets abroad? One Country, to advance their Own Manufactures, may prohibit Our
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98621:27"/>
Goods, The <hi>Hollanders</hi> will buy 'em up at their own Rates, when their Uſe is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den here, And they will be a Drug, and blown upon, all Over <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is great difference between a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants having a Choice, or a Neceſſity to ſell his Ware. In one Caſe he may in ſome Meaſure make his own Price, In the Other he muſt take what is offer'd.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak generally, the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade is profitable to the Adventurers in time of Peace; but rarely ſo in ſeaſons of War and Trouble. In time of Peace They enrich their Country by a Foreign Vent and Exportation of their Goods, and in time of War, the home Conſumption chiefly enables 'em to ſupport and carry on their Traffick.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhips may ſee all along in this Diſcourſe, that 'tis my Opinion, They do not interfere with ſuch Manufactures as 'tis the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to promote and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage: But though the prohibited <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods did greatly prejudice our own Product and Manufacture; yet I do not think a Prohibition of 'em at all adviſeable, during the War, for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Our Condition is ſo weak, that we cannot ſtruggle with any the bad Events, with which a new Council may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98621:28"/>
Secondly, If to their Loſſes at Sea, their Misfortunes in <hi>India</hi> on the Score of <hi>Every</hi>'s Pyracy, and their want of Money, ariſing from the general Want of Species in the Nation, A Prohibition of the Conſumption of ſo many of their Goods be likewiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; 'Tis to be apprehended, That upon ſuch a diſcouragement, the Traders to thoſe Parts, will by degrees withdraw from thence, their Effects, and Stock, and quite abandon the whole Traffick.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If this ſhould happen, and, that either through Sullenneſs, Or becauſe the Prohibition does really bring inſuperable difficulties, Our Merchants ſhould actually quit the Trade; The <hi>Dutch,</hi> Our Rivals in all other Traffick, will certainly ſeize the Derelict. And ſuch an Addition to their Riches and Power at Sea, can by no means be conſiſtent with the Welfare, and Safety of this Nation.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Lord,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Diſcourſe (which proves much longer than I intended) I have endeavour'd to ſhow your Lordſhip, Firſt, That this Trade is Beneficial to the Kingdom. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That 'tis not prejudicial to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Woollen Manufacture of <hi>England.</hi> Thirdly, That it does not ſo interfere with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98621:28"/>
Our Silk and Linnen Manufactures, as to hurt the Publick. Fourthly, That the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Prohibitions may probably occaſion an utter Loſs of the whole Traffick.</p>
               <p>No Alteration in ſo conſiderable a Branch of our Foreign Commerce ſhould be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs the whole matter had been for many Months conſider'd maturely, by a Council of Trade, compoſed of the ableſt Men in the Kingdom. And I will venture to affirm, That no ſound Judgment can be made in things of this Nature, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the univerſal Poſture and Buſineſs of the Nation: And when ſo important Deliberations are a-foot, the Number of the People ſhould be examin'd, Their annual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption both of Home and Foreign Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials ſhould be well ſtated, The ready Money and other Stock of the Kingdom ſhould be inquired into, The Sum of Money and Hands employ'd in every diſtinct Trade, ſhould be duly contemplated; And upon ſuch a general Inſpection and View of the whole, we might be Ripe to deliberate on any ſingle Point.</p>
               <p>Any falſe Meaſures and raſh Councils in Affairs ſo important, are hardly capable of a future Remedy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have in their Poſſeſſion all the Spice Iſlands, which they have ſtrongly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98621:29"/>
fortified, and by this means they lay a kind of Exciſe upon thoſe neceſſary Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which all <hi>Europe</hi> is forced to pay.</p>
               <p>By the ſeizing of <hi>Bantam</hi> they have got almoſt Three Parts in Four of the Pepper-Trade.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> at this time are very Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful in <hi>India:</hi> They have many Good Forts and Caſtles well provided, and large Colonies of Men; And They can, upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Occaſion, call together there 40 ſtrong Frigates: So that if it agreed with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Circumſtances of their Affairs in <hi>Europe,</hi> or with the Nature of the Alliance they are engag'd in, 'Tis undoubtedly in their Power, to Engroſs this rich Traffick wholly to themſelves, and to expel us for ever from thoſe Countreys.</p>

Perhaps they may not think it a ſafe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to attempt doing this by Force, but we ſhall have no reaſon to complain, If they take in hand, what we give over and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe they ſhould drive us from thence by force of Arms, Or that we ſhould quit the Trade to them through Negligence and Folly, It will be worth while to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what addition of Wealth and Strength, an intire Monopoly of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods may prove to that Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>And, My <hi>Lord,</hi> if I am not much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in Political Arithmetick, It would bring Yearly a much greater Maſs of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the United Provinces than is brought into <hi>Europe</hi> from the Mines of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſide of the World is ſo fond of thoſe Vanities, that if they could be had but at One Market, ſuch a Market might, by their Means, draw from the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <hi>per Annum,</hi> at leaſt Six Millions.</p>
               <p>To prove this Aſſertion, will take up more time than conſiſts with the Brevity intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Diſcourſe, I ſhall therefore onely give one Inſtance, and that is of Pepper, by which ſome Judgment may be made of all the other Commodities.</p>

Conſidering their Naval Force, and their Competition with us in Trade, Such an addition of Wealth muſt make them a very Formidable People.</p>

               <p>And I muſt here take Notice, That (as I am inform'd) all the Salt-Petre, produc'd in this ſide of the World, is not ſufficient to take ſuch a Place of Strength as <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> If the Fact be ſo, as War is made now, muſt not whatever Country can obtain the ſole Trade to <hi>India,</hi> and the Monopoly of that Commodity, give Laws to the reſt of <hi>Europe?</hi>
