            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>§. 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He date of Midſummer 1640. was birth-day to the manuſcript whereof the Preſſe is now deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 1644. Shortly after the iſſue of it from my hand, my Countrey having put upon me the honour of their truſt unto this Parliament, time was then no more mine own, nor any reſt of mind or body ſince. I have unhappily travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; but now at laſt being returned into the Parliament quarters, and by their clemency ſuffered to draw breath here, where (unto me) it is the ſweeteſt air in the land, I find both liberty and leiſure: and have therefore yielded to their loving importunity, who wiſh a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that, which is not dreſſed forth with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry as I would have uſed, if at firſt I had intended ſo publick expoſure.</p>
            <p>§. 2. Upon my preſent re-peruſall of it, ſome alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in ſome expreſſions I would willingly make, not varying the ſenſe and ſcope between the prieſt and me: but he hath a copy, and this muſt therefore be <hi>verbatim,</hi> leſt he take advantage to quarrell at circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb facs="tcp:155184:6"/>
who will not (it ſeems) reply to the ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>§. 3. The occaſion of this diſcourſe was thus: From the illuding fallacies of Romiſh ſuperſtition, God with mercy was working the deliverance of a friend and neighbour of mine, who by a divine bleſſing upon my weak endeavours was in time wonne home from the ſhadows and the darkneſſe of Romane idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, into the bright ſunſhine of the Goſpel of Chriſt: and with him his eldeſt ſonne, a ſober, hopefull young man was converted alſo. Before this work was effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, my friend with caution and good diſcretion, did deſire to heare a conference between one whom then he highly truſted and my ſelf, to which end he brought unto my houſe two ſtrangers, indeed ſtout champions for Babel. But God by the inward motions of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did gently (yet powerfully) out-work all their art. The Jeſuite ſtill pretended great confidence, and did undertake upon two ſeverall points in controverſie (1. <hi>Proper Sacrifice. 2. Papall Supremacy</hi>) to maintain the Romiſh aſſertion; wherein he promiſed to confine his pen within three ſheets for each point, but borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one fortnight and taking ſix moneths, he ſent at laſt ſix ſheets of one, and not one line of the other Theam. His Argument and my Anſwer are both ſubjoyned, word for word.</p>
            <p>§. 4. But ſome will intercept me with a queſtion: What? have you been ſo long in the Court and in the Camp, now in ſtead of ſome great Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, to diſcloſe a ſtale conteſt with a Jeſuite? Is this a work for theſe times, whilſt two ſides do bloudily ſtrive in the rage and fury of a civill Warre? Is Church and State almoſt gaſping, and can a leiſure be found
<pb facs="tcp:155184:6"/>
for pen-work? I anſwer: Firſt, it is indeed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent iſſue of thunder and tempeſt, but was begotten in a quiet ſerene. Next, it is a part of the preſent work in hand, for all our difficulties are created, or enlarged, or both, by the <hi>Servitours of Rome:</hi> and then to ſtrike with a pen is as neceſſary as with the pike. Here is a ſad breach between a good King, and good people, and a ſad curſe will be upon their hearts who have contrived, and who do foment it: But the crafty Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, at this time, is wiſe enough to take his own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt into conſideration; and who can ſhew any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to induce me to think, that a Papiſt (<hi>quà Papiſt</hi>) can contribute aſſiſtance, but to enlarge this breach, and to mature our ruine? All the Romane party in the world doth look upon this Parliament, and upon Scotland, as upon ſuch oppoſites to them, ſo contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriall, ſo deadly, that one muſt fall; both cannot ſtand and thrive together: The Religion of Rome, and the Reformation of England, can never hence-forward dwell together in this Iſland. And now our wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath diſcovered, that our wiſe complying Clergy have been but fooliſh builders. They who thought to tie all together have failed of their project; and (poore inconſiderate men) with pains and care have made the breach farre wider.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Theſe men will (as formerly) murmure at my honeſt endeavours: for many there are among them who do really diſtaſt that any mans pen ſhould travell abroad, unleſſe it be one of their own wing. What makes a lay man to ſtep within their ſevenfold <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>This was made plain unto me when I went to chuſe a Colledge and a Tutour for my eldeſt ſonne: There wanted not ſome in the Univerſitie, kindly, but with a covert meaning to forewarn me of the charge; more plainly they expreſſed themſelves, that ſcholarſhip is a detriment to elder Brothers. Indeed the <hi>Piety of the times</hi> did then work high, and I do confidently believe, that a part of the myſtery then in working was to draw us all into an indiſputed blind obedience: but firſt into ignorance as the ſure way thereto. <hi>If</hi> (ſaid a Pariſh-Miniſter) <hi>the Gentry were ignorant enough, then the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie would be rich enough.</hi> Another, <hi>Let us get the Laitie to Confeſsion, &amp; the Clergy power will then be great enough.</hi> As for ſoul-feeding (the leaſt part of their care) my once neighbour-Vicar ſhall ſpeak for himſelf, and I hope there are no more of ſo reprobate a badneſſe: in a diſpute upon the allotting of ſome number of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners which he claimed, it was argued that his Pariſh-church could not contain half the ſouls which he demanded: <hi>Why</hi> (ſaid the Vicar) <hi>what is that to you? Let them be laid to my pariſh, let them pay me their tithes, and then let them go to the devil to Church if they will.</hi> This was made known to Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> (whoſe Curate the Vicar was) but yet the Vicar was thought honeſt enough, becauſe he would read the book of ſports, and would yield to all that came upon him in the name of authority:</p>

Theſe things, and many other of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, made me heartily endeavour to put that fatall Archbiſhop on toward his triall: which (as the great affairs give time) will ſhortly have it's deſerved iſſue: and I doubt not but as Juſtice is ſacred, ſo alſo will the care of his great Judges be. I forbear to ſay in how dear eſteem I was with many thouſands upon that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of mine: I remember (and I feel ſome bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mind to remember) how I loſt that eſteem.

            <p>§. 7. In May, 1642. the publick affairs did ſeem every day to grow into danger: I began ſadly with my ſelf to weigh whither we were going. I ſaw the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> would ſhortly draw out into parties. I lay private in a moſt happy obſcurity, and then by ſome of my moſt inward friends did try if I could begge peace and protection of the Parliament: ſo unwilling was I to have been oppoſite to the great Senate of the land, that I had nothing in my thoughts before a readmiſſion to their favour, as ſome ſpeciall friends can teſtifie: but for an active concurrent aſſiſtance, for entering into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſervice with either of them, truth to confeſſe, I did not then like one ſide or the other ſo well, as to joyn my ſelf with either. A compoſing third way was my wiſh, and my prayer. Thus in my weak underſtanding, I was bold in frequent argument to oppoſe either ſide whilſt I reſolved to aſſiſt neither. All my care was,
<pb facs="tcp:155184:8"/>
not to treſpaſſe againſt my inward thoughts, and I hope I have in no one action been guilty thereof. Yet even he that watcheth the light of reaſon to be ruled by it, and is carefull to obſerve and follow the inward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of his conſcience, ſhall to others ſeem changed, when being conſtant and the ſame man, he ſtill follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one and the ſame warrantable guide. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with the good Emperour, I ſay, <note n="c" place="margin">

               </gap>e I am come into the Parliaments prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; ſince when my thoughts have often inſiſted upon the ſtrangeneſſe of the quarrell between the King and the two Houſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Profeſsions, Declarations,</hi> and <hi>Proteſts,</hi> are on both ſides the ſame, or ſo neare that reaſon can hardly find the point in quarrell: <hi>Proteſtant Religion, Laws, Liberty, Priviledges,</hi> &amp;c. Why do they differ? Why are they not agreed? may not a great part of the cauſe be, that the King divideth from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament? Oh but he had great cauſe ſo to do. But what if one ſhould ſay, the King had mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e cauſe to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way then he hath now to ſtay away? If it be admitted, that the King went away upon great cauſe, may it not be argued, that there is now greater cauſe to return? perhaps it will be granted, but withall replied, that his perſonall danger, will make the advice of his return a ſinnefull counſel. If I did not love his perſon well, I durſt not thus expreſſe my ſelf. But upon that ground I ſay, that he may be perſonally as ſafe or ſafer at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> then at <hi>Oxford.</hi> That he may have the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:155184:8"/>
ample ſplendor of a Court, or greater: That he may have all the ſame Officers, or ſome of them better. I know that at <hi>Oxford</hi> they ſay, if the King come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his life (which God preſerve) is like to be the forfeiture of that raſhneſſe, or elſe, as <hi>Damaſcen</hi> relateth that the <hi>Moſyni</hi> do in Aſia, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>§. 9. The firſt Regicide among Chriſtians allowed, was that of the Emperour <hi>Mauritius.</hi> This was ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inveighed againſt and that publickly by the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of Conſtantinople. But pride and covetouſneſſe (the Saints which the Biſhop of Rome then ſerved) taught the crafty murderer <hi>Phocas</hi> to pleaſe the Pope in both his luſts: for his pride he gives him the title of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Biſhop,</hi> and feeds his covetouſneſſe with rich bribes: ſo the bloudy parricide is bleſt by a holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Maurice</hi> had before given the oecumenicall title to <hi>John</hi> of Conſtantinople, &amp; now <hi>Phocas</hi> withdraws it thence, and placeth it upon <hi>Boniface</hi> of Rome. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Hiſtorians that both theſe Emperours, ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verforward to grace Biſhops, with unallowable &amp; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi> titles, died miſerably: <note n="d" place="margin">Wolflus.</note> 
               <hi>quod &amp; myſterio non caret,</hi> as one ſayes.</p>
            <p>§. 10. The laſt of maſſacred Kings were the famous <hi>Henries</hi> of France. <hi>Henry</hi> the third ſtabbed in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a Jacobin frier, encouraged by the Prior of his covent, and by <hi>Commolet</hi> and other <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> In leſſe then 4. years after this, <hi>Peter Barrier</hi> of Orleance came
<pb facs="tcp:155184:9"/>
to <hi>Melun</hi> (where our Queens father then was) with a ſharpe two-edged knife purpoſely reſolved to have killed the King, as he had formerly confeſſed to one <hi>Aubrey</hi> a prieſt, and to father <hi>Varade</hi> then rectour of the <hi>Jeſuits:</hi> who confirmed him in his purpoſe, and aſſured him that if he died for it he ſhould have a Martyrs crown in heaven for reward. Within foure moneths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this in the Kings chamber at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> a young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (<hi>John Chaſtel</hi>) a Novice of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> encouraged by them, did aim the ſtabbe of his knife into the Kings belly, but (by Gods providence) the King at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtooping down to receive the Lords of <hi>Ragny</hi> and <hi>Montiguy</hi> the knife ranne into his upper lippe and mouth, and breaking out a tooth miſſed his life, the villain had his deſerved execution, and the order of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> thereupon baniſhed out of France.</p>
            <p>§. 11. But unhappy <hi>Henry</hi> readmitted them, and founded a Colledge for the bloud-ſuckers, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his heart to be buried with them; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique they longed for with ſuch impatiency that they would not ſtay till it was cold, but ſent the devill <hi>Ravillack</hi> to take out life and all. <hi>Ravillack</hi> confeſſed his intended parricide to father <hi>Aubigny</hi> of that Order, and ſhewed him the knife prepared, and at execution he confeſſed that the book of <hi>Mariana</hi> the Spaniſh <hi>Jeſuite</hi> was the motive to his villany, onely giving this reaſon of the fact, <hi>becauſe the King did tolerate two religions in France.</hi> And thus by two <hi>Jeſuited</hi> knives, the laſt of the line of <hi>Valois,</hi> and the firſt of <hi>Burbon</hi> were both brought to their bloudy winding-ſheets. But I muſt not forget to note one <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>§ 12. And now, my ſacrificing <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> ſtand forth and let us occaſionally here try a veny. Good Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, what ſay you to your bloudy brethren of the black robe? Kings have been murdered before, but where was the doctrine of King-killing before there were Jeſuites? Where may we find the commendatory O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for parricides but among Popes, Papiſts, and Jeſuites? <note place="margin">

               <hi>No ſect of hereticks, no Turk, Jew, or Pagan, no, nor even thoſe of Calicute, who adore the devil, did ever maintain by the grounds of their religion, that it was lawfull to murther Prince or people, for quarrell of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>

But becauſe you have not made good your undertaking in the ſecond point (<hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>Papall Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi>) you ſee I have courteouſly argued it for you, by confeſſing that 1000. years ſince (good preſcription) <hi>Phocas</hi> gave your great Maſter the Pope that great title of <hi>

I know not what to ſay or wiſh, nor how the miſtake may be removed.

               <hi>Lawrence,</hi> who in his Sermon 1637. preſſing with too much learning and too little ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument the ſeverall partitions in a Church, the ſeverall poſtures, and the ſeverall degrees of ſanctity in ſeverall places, makes a voucher out of <hi>Sands relat: pag.</hi> 173. (I find it <hi>pag.</hi> 238.) ſaying, <hi>The very Grecians themſelves have their tables incloſed with</hi> GREAT MYSTERY <hi>from the people at this day:</hi> But why is not the Doctour as candid as the Relatour in expreſſing the GREAT MY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STERY? would the Doctour have it ſo, or not ſo? the reaſon given by the Relatour is, <hi>That the</hi> ARCANA <hi>of their ineffable croſsings and convertings may not be proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and polluted by unſanctified view.</hi> I hope the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour would not have the encloſure made for ſuch a Myſtery.</p>
            <p>Speaking of the B. Sacrament of the Lords ſupper, he tells us, that Chriſt, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, all ſay that his body is there: and that (ſaith he) <hi>truly and ſubſtantially,</hi> &amp;c. At this word <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> I do ſtick, and cannot well make it into an Orthodox ſenſe. I remember the Archbiſhop profeſſeth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>true ſubstantiall preſence of Chriſt.</hi> This muſt be taken with great caution, becauſe the words will bear the ſenſe of our adverſaries, and why delight we to walk upon the edge of a knife? Is it good Divinity to ſay, that Chriſts body is there? yes it is: but where? in the holy communion: true, but in what part? in the whole action, or in the ſymboles, and elements? Take heed, you will be at Rome before you are aware. How then ſhall I take the Doctours <hi>ſubſtantially?</hi> and the Biſhops <hi>ſubſtantiall preſence?</hi> They make myſteries or rather riddles: and why ſhould they preſſe my faith
<pb facs="tcp:155184:18"/>
with ſuch expreſſions, as without a deal of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are unſound? I can find no <hi>ſubſtantiall preſence</hi> but by Faith, and ſo (by Faith) I receive the very Deity of Chriſt, and of God the Father. So then Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is there, and Chriſts body is not there; in different acceptations. The <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of his naturall body is not there at all: but a reall communication of the ſubſtance of Chriſt both body and ſoul is there ſolemnly ſigned and ſealed unto us. This my Faith diſcerns, and the not diſcerning of this, makes the wicked guilty of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking unworthily.

Is it all one to have Communion with the body of Chriſt really and truly, and to have his body in the Euchariſt really and truly? If it may be qualified and excuſed into a ſound ſenſe, yet it can never be conſtrued into a ſafe ſenſe. And therefore when you will uſe any dark, doubtfull, dangerous term, let it not be a trouble to

            <p>In a word, the body of Chriſt <hi>is there,</hi> and the body of Chriſt <hi>is not there:</hi> it is there by ſpirituall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is not there in any other conſtruction: for repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and commemoration (though reall) are ſtill ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wayes of his being there. Much of this Myſtery is cleared by this expreſſion: <hi>Chriſt is repreſented and really offered unto all the Receivers, but Chriſt is really exhibited onely to the true believers.</hi> And thus much occaſionally upon the adventerous expreſſions of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lawrence.</hi>

            <p>There is a ſermon forth by one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Wats,</hi> licenſed<note place="margin">XII.</note> by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Baker,</hi> 1637.

            <p>There are two Treatiſes, and a Sermon ſet forth<note place="margin">XIV.</note> by <hi>John Swan,</hi> I will (at this time) onely look into the firſt: <hi>Profano-maſtix</hi> licenſed by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Wykes:</hi> and print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 1639. wherein I reade a diſtinguiſhment of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices from the Jewiſh, but none at all from the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh.

               <hi>Altar, then alſo a Prieſt to officiate, both in and at the ſame: but with a difference ſtill from both Sacrifices and Prieſts of Old. For as they were bloudy ſacrifices and looked at Chriſt to come: ſo this is an unbloudy one, and looketh at Chriſt already come: and as their Prieſts were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order of Aaron: ſo are our Prieſts according to that Order which Chriſt himſelf is, a Prieſt for ever: to wit, according to the order of Melchiſedec.</hi> What Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Writer did ever admit the term of <hi>unbloudy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice?</hi> as well for the word ſake, as becauſe it is the

known diſtinctive expreſſion, whereby the Papiſt have and do excuſe and palliate their corporall preſence. Engliſhmen have been ſcoffed at enough for apiſh imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of forein faſhions, but will our Divines be dangerous imitatours in the dreſſes of our Religion?

               <p>True it is, that among many Writers in matter of Controverſie, ſome for ill purpoſes, ſome for good and weighty cauſes, have ſilenced their names. But in this late free age for pen and preſſe, few have ſent forth ſo blanck a piece as not to adde two letters either for their own, or for a borrowed name: That at leaſt, when we cannot name you right, we may yet miſcall you to your own liking; but you ſubſcribe not ſo much as a letter. What freedome, and what distance may this be? Your ſelf in perſon have ſlept in my houſe, and yet two letters (inſtead of a name) may not come in the bottome of your Treatiſe. You will ſay you fear danger: what, in

                  <p>§. 3. Upon requeſt of a friend of mine (but then a diſciple of your own) you came unto me, not as was at firſt expected and deſired, to a fore-deſigned confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but rather like an occaſionall traveller. Being with me, you made choice rather to write then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with an able ſcholar whom I ſhould name. And you demanded on what Theam. I gave you then the ſame two points which had troubled your follower (<hi>Mr</hi>. <hi>Edward Beuin</hi>) and which were by him (as being indeed very materiall) preſented unto me: Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Proper Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>Papall Supremacy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confeſſe you took them not in writing, wherefore I cannot ſo much (as then I might) blame you, for ſending me my queſtions back in a different ſtate from that which you received from me. Mine were thus:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>I. The Pope by Divine right hath a Supremacie of power in matters Spirituall, which ought to be univerſally believed and obeyed as of faith.</p>

                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:155184:29"/>II. The Romiſh Maſſe is a Sacrifice both proper and propitiatory: for the preſent and abſent, for the quick and the dead.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This is the true ſtate of your <hi>Romiſh</hi> tenet, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you have drawn the difference into a narrower compaſſe, yet will you not be able to fill the circle you have made. Concerning the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> you have reſpited that Theam, and in three times the time expected have finiſhed but half your work. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> leaving out the point of <hi>propitiation</hi> for the abſent, and for the dead, you ſay but this;</p>
                  <p>

In which offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be found a <hi>ſenſible change</hi> of the thing offered. 4.

                  <p>§. 6. Secondly, in this very Epiſtle by you cited he ſaith, <hi>Sanguis Chriſti non aqua eſt utique, ſed vinum, the bloud of Christ is not water verily, but wine:</hi> Is our Saviours bloud wine? very true it is ſo, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> there voucheth, <hi>vitis vera, a true vine:</hi> But this is true in a comfortable metaphor, not by converſion of ſubſtances: for the bloud of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is not really tranſubſtantiated into wine: no man ever thought ſo. And why then ſhould you obtrude, that becauſe the ſacramentall wine is called his bloud, it is therefore, without all figure and metaphor, his very bloud by the converſion of the very ſubſtance of wine into the ſubſtance of his bloud. <hi>Nec poteſt videri ſanguis ejus (quo redempti &amp; vivificati ſumus) eſſe in calice, quando vinum deſit calici quo Chriſti ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis oſtenditur: neither can his bloud (wherewith we are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:155184:35"/>
redeemed and quickened) be ſeen to be in the Chalice, when wine is not in the chalice whereby the bloud of Chriſt is ſhewen.</hi> From hence I argue, that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> knew not your Tranſubſtantiation. For allowing the Sacramentall wine to be the bloud of Chriſt (and ſo we confeſſe it) he ſaith, <hi>There is no bloud to be ſeen, when the wine is gone:</hi> but with you there is no bloud at all, untill the wine be gone. If you ſay, that indeed the ſubſtance of wine is gone, but the ſpecies or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of colour, &amp;c. are there; I reply, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> would no more call thoſe accidents <hi>wine,</hi> then you do now, had he been either a Philoſopher of your ſchools, or a Divine of your Religion. But mark the laſt words, <hi>quo Chriſti ſanguis oſtenditur: By the wine Chriſt his bloud is ſhewen.</hi> He ſaith not, that the wine is bloud, or turned into bloud, but the <hi>bloud is ſhewen by the wine:</hi> yet the bloud with you is ſeen without wine.

Are you a rich and wealthy matrone who come into the Lords houſe without a ſacrifice? who take part of that ſacrifice which ſome poore body hath offered?</hi> Here is <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and that before conſecration, and that offered by the poore, and expected from a woman.</p>
                  <p>Theſe places do evidently conclude, that figurative and metaphoricall ſacrifices were all that were known unto S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in whom your ſelf cannot find one paſſage whereby to evince your <hi>proper ſacrifice.</hi>

                  <p>The place needs no variety of readings: it is plain enough except for your interpretation wherewith you do obſcure it, by inferring more then you have ground for. You conclude for your advantage, but you want proof for your Concluſion. You ſay our Saviour did offer a <hi>proper ſacrifice:</hi> Who ever denied it? You ſay this Sacrifice was himſelf: It is confeſſed. But this, that the Sacramentall bread and wine, being converted into our Saviours body and bloud, was ſacrificed (which I ſee you intend in the laſt words, <hi>He offered bread and wine</hi>) when will you prove it? or rather why do you diſprove it? For whileſt you ſay he <hi>offered bread and wine,</hi> you do (againſt your will) conclude, that he did not as your Prieſts do, who have nor <hi>bread</hi> nor <hi>wine</hi> in your Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>But you argue out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who ſaith, that <hi>in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſi per Melchiſedec—Imago ſacrificii Christi in pane &amp; vino constituta, &amp;c. The bread and wine of Melchiſedec wherewith he refreſhed Abraham, was an image of that bread and wine, wherewith our Saviour refreſheth the faithfull.</hi> Be it ſo: but you will ſay that <hi>Cyprian</hi> calleth here the Sacramentall bread and wine <hi>Sacrificium Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti, Chriſts ſacrifice,</hi> that is no news: you have it confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and allowed before, that the Euchariſt may be ſaid<note place="margin">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:155184:38"/>
that his intendment is to prove that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be celebrated in wine, not in water alone, this is his whole intention through this Epiſtle, without dream or thought of your then unknown and unheard of <hi>Tranſubstantiated</hi> preſence.

                  <p>WHich point of the time when our Saviour did ſo offer, as alſo of his offering of bread &amp; wine as aforeſaid in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is expreſſely averred by S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in the words following, to wit, that the holy Ghoſt did by <hi>Solomon</hi> foreſhew a type of our Lords Sacrifice (<hi>Typum Dominici Sacrificii</hi>) making mention of an immolated hoſt (or Sacrifice) and of bread and of wine, and alſo of an altar, and of the Apoſtles. They are all S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> words, who citing the place of the 9. of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi> taketh hold of the laſt words (<hi>Bibite vinum quod miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cui vobis, Drink the wine which I have mingled for you</hi>) thus, he declareth the wine to be mingled, that is, he doth foretell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically that our Saviours chalice was to be mingled with water and wine, that it may appear that that was done in the paſſion of our Lord (that is, at the time, or beginning of our Saviours paſſion) which was foretold. Here you ſee again a clear proof of our Saviours ſacrifice, whereof <hi>Solomons</hi> bread and wine was a type or figure, and likewiſe of the practice of the Church in offering both water and wine in the Chalice.</p>

ANd to make it manifeſt that this ſacrifice which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſo often ſpeaks of, is a true, viſible, and <hi>proper ſacrifice,</hi> and not an inviſible, ſpirituall, or meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall ſacrifice, I will here alledge his diſcourſe in his tenth book, <hi>De civit. Dei, cap.</hi> 19, &amp; 20. where diſtinguiſhing theſe two kinds of ſacrifice, he ſaith, That as in prayers and praiſe we direct ſignifying words to him to whom we offer the things themſelves in our hearts which we ſignifie; ſo in ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing we are not to offer viſible ſacrifice to any, but to him to whom in our hearts we our ſelves muſt be the inviſible ſacrifice. And <hi>chap.</hi> 20. having ſaid, that though <hi>Chriſt</hi> as God did with his Father receive ſacrifice, yet as man he did rather chooſe to be a ſacrifice, then to receive ſacrifice, leſt by that occaſion any man might think that ſacrifice might be offered to a creature, he concludeth thus, <hi>Per hoc &amp; Sacerdos eſt ipſe offerens, &amp; ipſe oblatio, cujus rei ſacramentum quotidianum eſſe voluit Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae ſacrificium, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>By this he is both Prieſt offering, and alſo the oblation or thing offered, whereof he would have the ſacrifice of the Church to be a daily Sacrament</hi> (or ſimilitude) <hi>ſeeing he is the head of her the body, and ſhe the body of him the head. She is wont to be offered by him, as well as he by her.</hi> And then he concludeth, That all the ancient ſacrifices were ſignes of this true ſacrifice. So as here you ſee a viſible ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice diſtinguiſhed not onely from prayer and praiſe, both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward; but alſo from the inviſible ſacrifice whereby we are to offer our ſelves as a ſacrifice in our hearts to God, the outward ſacrifice being a ſigne of the inward, as words are of our inward thoughts and affections. You ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Prieſt and the ſacrifice: that there is a viſible ſacrifice in the Church, as a daily ſacrament, ſigne, or memory of that which <hi>Christ</hi> offered upon the Croſſe: that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is wont to offer his

Church as ſhe doth him, that is, he being there inviſibly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her inviſibly, and the offering him viſibly by ſacrifice doth alſo offer her ſelf by him: And laſtly, you ſee he calleth this a true ſacrifice, adding, To this moſt high and true ſacrifice all the falſe ſacrifices have given place.</p>

But becauſe a man that is unwilling to ſee this truth may catch at two little words by the by in this diſcourſe, to wit, that the <hi>Martyrs are not invocated,</hi> and that <hi>they are the body of Chriſt,</hi> I muſt explain his meaning; which is nothing in the former place, but that the prieſt in offering Sacrifice doth not ſay, I offer ſacrifice to thee <hi>Peter, Paul, Cyprian</hi> (as he ſaith in many places) but that they may be prayed unto, is inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even here, and expreſſed plainly by him in <hi>Joh. tract.</hi> 84. where ſpeaking of this ſacrifice he ſaith, that we do commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Martyrs or name them, not as we do others who reſt in peace, ſo as to pray for them, but rather that they may pray for us, that we may follow their footſteps. His meaning in the latter word is nothing but by way of alluſion from the true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

                     <hi>Ipſum Sacrificium corpus eſt Chriſti, quod non offertur ipſis, quia hoc ſunt &amp; ipſi: The Sacrifice it ſelf is the body of Christ:</hi> This you make much of, but take the whole period: <hi>which body</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine) is not offered to the Martyrs, becauſe even they are this bodie.</hi> So then it is evident that the body of <hi>Christ</hi> in this place is (as you find it) his myſticall body, that is, the Church Univerſall: which being part militant, part triumphant (as the martyrs are) is honoured with the title of <hi>Chriſts</hi> body: Juſt as S. <hi>Paul</hi> (to the faithfull at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth) <note n="b" place="margin">1.

For though the latter be the plainer by reaſon of the very words <hi>Corpus Chriſti, the body of Chriſt;</hi> yet becauſe a Proteſtant will except againſt it for that very reaſon, though we ſhould bring never ſo good authority for that reading, as they do in a like caſe of a place of S. <hi>Cyprians,</hi> for the authority of <hi>Peters</hi> chair, to take away all exception I will wave it, and follow the former read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being the very ſame in ſenſe, and clear enough. For there it is ſaid, that by conſecration, and conſequently not by ſaith, the bread and cup becomes myſtical, that is, it is made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is not ſeen, and that the nature thereof is changed, <hi>ſit non naſcitur, it is made</hi> another thing by conſecration then it was by nature; and this conſecration is certain, that is, a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall conſecration, different, and of greater force and efficacy then the ordinary bleſſing and thanksgiving uſed in other bread and wine; and that which is ſo conſecrated is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of religion, not corporall food: all which doth clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate what we teach of Chriſts preſence in this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. But the diſcourſe it ſelf makes it yet more evident; for <hi>Fauſtus</hi> ſaying, that <hi>Christ</hi> is in every creature growing out of the earth, as we acknowledge him in our bread and chalice,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:155184:64"/>
(whereby it is manifeſt by his very teſtimony, that Catholicks did then believe the reality of Chriſts preſence in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as we do now) S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> firſt confuting and deriding that vanity of Chriſts preſence in all things which <hi>Fauſtus</hi> ſpoke of, acknowledgeth it of ſuch bread and wine as is duely conſecrated, and explicateth how it comes, to wit, by conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not according to the vain imagination of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> were tied and bound up in all their meats: <hi>Vobis per fabulam vestram,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in eſcis omnibus Chriſtus liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus apponitur: Chriſt by your fable is ſet before you tied up in all your meats;</hi> and thereupon he denieth our belief to be the ſame with theirs, and addeth, that in ſo ſaying he ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more fooliſh then ſome, <hi>qui nos propter panem &amp; calicem Cererem &amp; Liberum colere exiſtimant, who in regard of the bread and chalice think that we worſhip Ceres</hi> (the goddeſſe of corn) <hi>and Bacchus</hi> (the god of wine;) which is a proof no leſſe pregnant for the truth and property of our Sacrifice, then that of the <hi>Manichees</hi> for the reall preſence: the practiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being ſuch in S. <hi>Augustines</hi> time, as that the very Pagans took notice thereof: For ſacrifice was the worſhip which they gave to their gods: and unleſſe they had known that we did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer bread and wine in ſacrifice, they could have no ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to imagine how we ſhould thereby worſhip <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus.</hi>

Now for that <hi>Fauſtus</hi> ſpeaks againſt the altars and ſacrifices of the Pagans, and in commendation of his own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and improper temple, altar, &amp;c. and his onely Sacrifice of prayers; S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> having confuted him, and ſhewed the falſhood of what he ſaid of his being the temple of God, his mind the altar, his prayers pure and ſimple or ſincere, he convinceth him of abſurdity in acknowledging theſe things and denying a true ſacrifice, asking this queſtion, <hi>Volo mihi dica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, I would have you tell me from whence you have the names of theſe things which you praiſe in your ſelves,</hi> as <hi>temple, altar, Sacrifice?</hi> for if unto the true God theſe true things (that is, a true and proper temple, altar and Sacrifice be not due, why
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:155184:65"/>
are they laudably ſpoken of in a true Religion? But if to the true God a true Sacrifice be due (from whence alſo they are rightly termed divine honours?) other things which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sacrifices are done after the ſimilitude of a certain true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Lo here S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> counteth it an abſurdity in the <hi>Manichees</hi> to acknowledge theſe things metaphorically and denie a true proper Sacrifice. And why may not we ſay the ſame to Proteſtants? But to go on with S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> he ſheweth that all the ſacrifices of the Gentiles and Jews had ſome relation to the true ſacrifice, which is due to the true God onely, and wherewith <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone did fill his altar. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Gentiles were the imitations of falſe and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gods, that is to ſay, of the devils, proudly chalenging from ſuch as they deceived that honour which was due to God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſacrifice being not to be blamed but the offering of it to the devil. The Jews by their ſacrifices of beaſts did by way of prophecy foreſhew the future ſacrifice which <hi>Chriſt</hi> offered. Wherefore <hi>Christians</hi> do now celebrate the memory of the ſame ſacrifice, as being paſſed by the moſt holy oblation and participation of the body and bloud of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheans</hi> not knowing what was to be condemned in the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Gentiles, nor what to be underſtood in the ſacrifices of the Jews, nor what to be believed or obſerved in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> do offer their own vanity in ſacrifice to the devils. S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Latine words of the latter part of this diſcourſe in which the chief force conſiſteth are theſe, ſpeaking of Chriſts ſacrifice of the Croſſe: <hi>Unde jam Chriſtiani per acti ejusdem Sacrificii memoriam celebrant Sacroſanctâ oblatione &amp; participatione corporis &amp; ſanguinis Christi.

The ſecond is that of the Jews, and their ſacrifices many and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall, were figures of the third ſort of ſacrifice, which was that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf offered. The fourth is the ſacrifice of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the ſingular number alſo, as that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, which they offer in remembrance of his ſacrifice, and this they do by the oblation and participation of the body and bloud of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Who can now ſay that the body and bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not truely and properly offered in ſacrifice in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church?</p>

Sometime that which is in ſubſtance little you dreſſe and trim forth into a pretty ſhew: ſometime that which is clear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you (either to ſhew your art, or for want of better helps) you take, and then with a colourable flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of your own, you ſtrive to winne upon the eaſie belief of others; whenas (for my part) I cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo much of my ſelf by all that you produce, as to think that you are ſo partiall, as not to ſee that you have proved (in ſome of your choice authorities)

plain truth againſt your ſelf. Thus—<hi>Quos perdere vult Jupiter hos dementat.</hi>

                  <p>You help me in the laſt inference with a moſt fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unto you.

To him we ſacrifice a ſacrifice of humility and praiſe, in the altar of our heart, by the fire of fervent chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> Whereby it appears that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> either did not believe, or elſe (in his very Chapter intitled <hi>Of ſacrifice to God</hi>) he did forget the higheſt myſterie of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: for here is no more materiall <hi>proper ſacrifice,</hi> then that fire (here ſpoken of) is materiall proper fire.</p>
