         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>HAving no Foundation whereon to raiſe an Ambition of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Notice, my Pen was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver touched with the Itch of Writing. That this once I venture abroad, is to ſhew another, not my ſelf. I am under more than a common obligation to this pious Office, to pay due Honour to the dead; to build a Prophets Tomb, or erect a Pillar upon his Grave, that he may not be Buried in utter oblivion with men, who hath the promiſe of everlaſting remembrance with God. When worthy and deſirable perſons are removed out of ourſight, it is ſome ſatisfaction to have their
<pb facs="tcp:94116:3"/>
Pictures before our eyes. This is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of theſe ſheets. And had the Pencils Art born proportion to the Subjects worth, I had almoſt ſaid, here had been expreſſed as rare a piece in Grace as was <hi>Abſalom</hi> in Nature. But the defects to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of in the Face, and pardoned, are abundantly recompenſed with the true Portraicture of the inward Vitals, the very heart and Soul drawn to the Life by his own hand, that only could. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if ſome ſhall ſay, they ſee nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and ſhall deſpiſe, others, I doubt not, will be able to reply, as he in a like Caſe; If you ſaw with my eyes, you would commend. That this Dead is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to publick view is to gratifie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and to contribute to the inſtruction (that I ſay not the reproof) of the Living. Happy are many Souls who have enjoyed the Priviledge of the lively voice of this great Inſtrument of God. He is not to be numbred among thoſe of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Let them be ſilent in the Grave.</hi> Who then knoweth, but that <hi>being dead he</hi> may <hi>yet ſpeak</hi> effectually, whoſe Living <hi>Tongue was as choice Silver, and whoſe Lips fed many.</hi> The Spiritual workings
<pb facs="tcp:94116:3"/>
of his heart, and Converſe of his Soul with God, was a ſecret between God and himſelf, wherewith a <hi>ſtranger did not intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;</hi> which he no more than others in like Caſe had the freedom generally to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate. That God put it into his heart to Record it, is no improbable Argument, that God, as well as himſelf, intended its uſefulneſs not only to himſelf, but others alſo, when once Death ſhould give a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the <hi>Secrets of his heart to be made manifeſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madam, The great Reſpect and Honour which your Ladyſhip hath always Cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had, and freely expreſſed to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters of Chriſt, hath at once both obliged and encouraged me to prefix your worthy Name to the Memorial of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Prophet. Of whom I am not at all ſuſpicious leſt your Ladyſhip ſhould be aſhamed. He who hath been a more than ordinary burning and ſhining Light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt his Generation, and is now a Star of the greater Magnitude amidſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt men made perfect, can caſt no dark Reflections upon that true Honour your Ladyſhip obtains with all that know you; which in your own great Judgment
<pb facs="tcp:94116:4"/>
is valued as it is <hi>of God,</hi> and <hi>not of men.</hi> I ſhall not wonder, if thoſe, who are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Holy Spirit, ſhall find no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſatisfaction in reading theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual exerciſes and experiences; or who are Enemies, ſhall cenſure them as Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick fancies: which indeed can never be well underſtood without ſome meaſure of that Diviner Learning, whoſe method is <hi>Taſt and ſee.</hi> I have therefore choſen humbly to offer this to your Ladyſhip, who is of full Age, and by reaſon of uſe, have ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both Good and Evil; in whoſe hands it will be ſecure and fear no Contempt. I have reaſon to believe, that in reading the practice of the Life and workings of the heart of this now Glorified Saint, your Ladyſhip reflecting on your ſelf will find cauſe to ſay, <hi>Face anſwereth to Face, and Heart to Heart.</hi> Which I hope may contribute ſomewhat to your joy, and Confidence before him who faſhioneth his Childrens hearts alike, in ſtamping the ſame his Image upon them all.</p>
                  <p>It hath pleaſed God in his holy and wiſe Providence to make your Ladyſhip an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of many, and ſharp Trials, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of much Grace, by the power whereof
<pb facs="tcp:94116:4"/>
you have endured with moſt Chriſtian and Exemplary Faith and Patience. The laſt Enemy is yet before you, to be expected, and Encountred, which, conſidering your Ladyſhips years, ſeemeth to be approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But, behold, it is here preſented, as Diſarmed, and Conquered, and ſo leſs formidable. And I doubt not but your Ladyſhip liveth in the Comfortable proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of that Bleſſed day, when all your Conflicts ſhall be Crowned with Victory, and Triumph over Death, in Communion with the Prince of Life.</p>
                  <p>Madam, I have yet to add, that I have gladly taken this occaſion to make my publick acknowledgments, of the inviolable obligations which your Ladyſhip hath laid upon me by your ſingular Bounty, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed as well to my Honoured Father now with God, as to my ſelf, in our ſtate of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation. And here I muſt joyn with your Ladyſhip, your only ſurviving Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the many hopeful Children, which God had graciouſly given your Ladyſhip, <hi>Madam Mary Brook,</hi> the true Heireſs of your Ladyſhips great Vertue and Grace. As my Pen cannot be ſilent, leſt ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; ſo it dares not be fluent, leſt offenſive

to that Liberality which would not have the left hand know what the right hand doth. I am bound to ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be ye of the Lord, who have not left off your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Living and to the Dead.</hi> That this may be <hi>fruit abounding to your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, an Odor of a ſweet ſmell, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice acceptable, and well pleaſing to God, recompenſed at the Reſurrection of the Juſt;</hi> That your days may yet be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and the Conſolations of God be the ſupport and ſtrength of your Age; That the Bleſſings of the Everlaſting Covenant may deſcend, and remain to your Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from Generation to Generation is, and ſhall be the Prayer of,</p>

                  <p>IT hath been the vain-glorious practice of ſome men for the perpetuating of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories beyond Death and Time to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt poſterity, to engrave their Names in Braſs or Marble, or to write them upon their Houſes and Lands, which yet Death and Time have wholly obliterated. But it is the Honour of many ſaints to be recorded in ſacred Scripture beyond all danger of Oblivion, as great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Piety and Holineſs towards God, and of ſervice to the Church of God in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And God hath ſince by his providence in all ages ſecured to his more eminent ſaints and ſervants the like Honour, ſtirring up ſome ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to embalm their precious Name and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, by recording and reporting the dead to poſterity in more laſting monuments, as great Inſtances of the Grace of God, ſpecial matter of his praiſe, and approved patterns as well for the encouragement as the imitation of the Living. How diſpiſed ſoever this excellent ſervant of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb facs="tcp:94116:6"/>
Chriſt, the ſubject we have to write of, hath been in the eyes of ſome of his Generation; yet I am perſuaded none of the worthies in the Church of God, that are gone before him, will count it any diſparagement to their Honour, that he be added to their number, whoſe precious Names ſurvive their death. The Records which have been made, and publiſhed of the Lives of many Excellent, and holy perſons, conſiſt for the moſt part only of Such paſſages, as have fallen under the obſervation of thoſe, who have more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, and frequently converſed with them; &amp; many hands have Contributed to the collecting of ſome more remarkable words, and actions, which an Ingenious pen, in juſt honour to the Subject, improveth as <hi>Indices</hi> of thoſe ſingular accompliſhments of mind and heart, which are beyond the reach of the moſt obſervant Eye. And were there nothing elſe to be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Concerning the ſubject before us, but what might be ſo collected, from the hands of thoſe, who had the happy advantage to <hi>know fully his Doctrine, manner of Life, Purpoſe, Faith, long Suffering, Charity, patience</hi> &amp;c. I doubt not, but, if managed by a skillful pen, it would juſtly amount to ſuch a character of him, as might worthily render him, a more than Ordinary example of Faith, and Holineſs, of Scripturall knowledge and practice, as well to the preachers, as profeſſors of the Goſpel, of Chriſt, to the praiſe of the Glory, of the Grace of God. But their is leſs need of this in reference,
<pb facs="tcp:94116:6"/>
to our ſubject. Himſelf having not only, in great meaſure prevented, and ſaved his friends that labour, and ſervice, but moreover diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the inmoſt ſecrets of his heart, towards God, beyond all that could be known of him, by the Stricteſt obſervation of others. What hath been the advantagious practice, ſometimes (though very rare) of ſome eminent Servants of God, who have made Religion their buſineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> to write, <hi>Curriculum vita,</hi> the manner and courſe of their own life, appears to have been his. He not only kept a ſtrict Eye upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and took ſpecial notice of his own heart, and wayes, and the manner of his ſpiritual living unto God, but leſt he ſhould forget, and render it uſeleſs, committed the ſame to paper, recording the dealings of God towards him, the workings of corruption, and grace, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, and Temptations the ſecret Intercourſe, and Communion between God and his Soul, the approaches, and withdrawings of the Holy Spirit, his liftings up and caſtings down, the actings of Faith and Love, Divine aſſiſtance in Duty, return of prayers, the clearneſs of his evidences, and rejoycings of his hopes &amp;c. Wherein the life and power of true Religion, doth more conſiſt than in all open and viſibel acts. Out of this Treaſury, which is enough to Supply a far larger volume, hath been fetched the greateſt part of that furniture which filleth theſe pages, and that moſtly in his own words.

Prophet, beſpeaking you in the words of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophet, <hi>Come and</hi> read <hi>all ye that fear God, and I will tell you what he hath done for my ſoul.</hi> My own experience aſſureth me, that to thoſe who are engaged in the Spiritual War, and running the Chriſtian race, and have ſet their faces towards God, It will be uſeful, encouraging, delightful, and ſatisfactory to read ſo much of the ſenſe and feeling of their own hearts, in the experiences of this Bleſſed Saint. The greateſt part of whom, yet I believe will find cauſe to be aſhamed before God, ſeeing themſelves ſo far caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and may be provoked to mend their pace, in preſſing forward towards the mark, to which he hath attained. As for ſuch as reſt in their negative goodneſs, and commendable moralls, their form of Godlineſs and bodily exerciſe in religion, without the life and power thereof, who knows but they may be convinced, of the vanity of their hopes, and the ſandy foundation, whereon they have built them, and that yet they lack ſomething, while they read the thoughts, affections, and workings of his holy heart, his underſtanding improvement of the Holy Scriptures, and his Spiritual communion, with the Holy God, to which themſelves are altogether ſtrangers. But ſuch is the enmity, and contradiction of the carnal mind to the ſpirit, and grace of God that I cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out jealouſie, that much of what is true written will be matter of ſcorn, and deriſion to the
<pb facs="tcp:94116:7"/>
profane Generation. However as the word of God delivered in the Scriptures, and diſpenſed in the Miniſtry thereof, hath its divers and contrary effects, upon diverſe &amp; contrary ſubjects, whereon yet God knows how to raiſe his own Glory, ſo ſhall the ſame word Exemplified in the life of this now glorified ſaint, have the like effects on them that read it. To the humble and teachable it ſhall be <hi>in adjutorium,</hi> but to the ſcorners and deſpiſers <hi>in Teſtimonium.</hi>

THE RELATION.</head>
                  <p>MR. <hi>Owen Stockton</hi> was born in the City of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> in the County of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> the laſt week of May, 1630. was the fourth Son of his Father <hi>Mr. Owen Stockton,</hi> a worthy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary of that Cathedral, who was a younger brother of that ancient family of the <hi>Stocktons,</hi> of <hi>Kiddington Green</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> About the ſeventh year of his age, his Father dyed and left the care of him, and his other Children, to their Mother, a pious Gentlewoman of the family of the <hi>Tilees,</hi> in <hi>Cambridgeſhire.</hi> She being a Widdow and ſtranger in <hi>Chicheſter;</hi> ſoon after the death of her Husband, returned to her native Country, and ſetled her ſelf at <hi>Ely,</hi> where was a very good Grammar School, under the Government of <hi>Mr. William Hitches,</hi> to whoſe care ſhe committed this her Son, for his education.</p>
                  <p>From a Child he was of great hopes, while yet a little Grammar Schollar, his inclination was ſuch as preſaged more than ordinary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94116:9"/>
Looking once accidentally into <hi>Mr.</hi> Fox <hi>his Acts, and Monuments Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> in one of the pariſh Churches of that Town, and reading ſome little part thereof, he was ſo affected, with the knowledge of that Hiſtory, that he never ceaſed to ſupplicate his friends, till he had obtained one part of them, for his uſe. Wherein (declining the puerile recreations, to which his School-fellows addicted themſelves) for ſome years he ſpent, moſt of that time which he had vacant, and could redeem from his obliged attendance upon the School.</p>
                  <p>His judicious Maſter diſcerning in him a ready natural capacity, for learning and deſire after it, with induſtrious diligence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſtudy, (for though he ſpent, ſo great a part of his time out of School, in reading Hiſtory, yet withal he ſo performed his part and offices, in the School, as he never gave occaſion of correction or rebuke) and obſerving more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over his Conſtant daily attendance on the worſhip of God, according to the rules of the Schools. He earneſtly Commended him to his Mother, and perſuaded her to think of no other courſe or trade of life for him, but that he be prepared and ſent to the Univerſity; in order to the Office, and Work of the Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly not without his own inclination and choice being ſufficiently inſtructed, with Grammar Learning for Academical ſtudies,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94116:9"/>
he was in the ſixteenth year of his age, <hi>viz. Jan.</hi> 2. 1645. admitted into <hi>Chriſts Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> under the Tuition of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Dr. Henry Moore.</hi> His years were not many, but his ſtature leſs, Inſomuch that for ſome time he could not paſs the ſtreets without ſpecial notice taken of him, and expreſſed on that account.</p>
                  <p>Nor was this only a vulgar obſervation, but ſuch alſo as fell under the Remark, of the late <hi>King Charles the firſt,</hi> who being brought to a Gentlemans houſe, by the Army night to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and many Schollars coming thither in their habits, to ſee his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, was pleaſed to order that they ſhould be admitted to his Royall preſence, and kiſs his hand. Among whom this Coming in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, His Majeſty made ſpecial obſervation of of him, and gave him his gracious benediction, ſaying, <hi>Here's a little Schollar indeed, God bleſs him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His reſidence in the <hi>Colledge,</hi> was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, that during the whole time of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graduacy, he was not abſent <hi>Communibus annis Conjunctim &amp; diviſim,</hi> one month in a year. And his ſobriety ſuch that he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained not only from publick Houſes, but in other Company, and places from Wines, and and ſtrong Drink, as judging Nature in his age, to ſtand in no need of ſuch kind of helps.</p>
                  <p>After he had taken his degree of <hi>Batchelor,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94116:10"/>
of Arts he reſided ſtill in the <hi>Colledge,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelf ſeriouſly to the Study of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which he alwayes deſigned.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance whereof, whether by his own or others advice, I cannot ſay, he went to <hi>London,</hi> and ſpent ſome months there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting, himſelf with the principal Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, from whom he took an account, of the beſt writers in Divinity, of that time, frequenting the Library of <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi> and the Lectures at <hi>Greſham Colledge,</hi> applying himſelf to ſeveral Worthy Miniſters of the City, and attending on their exerciſes which were daily, that he might obſerve the variety, of mens Gifts and their ſeveral methods of Preaching. By which he made ſo great an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of himſelf, that he hath often ſaid ſince, that if it ſhould pleaſe God to give him a Son of his own diſpoſed to the Miniſtery, He ſhould give it him as his particular advice, before he entred upon the work of preaching, to ſpend ſome months in <hi>London,</hi> in attending on thoſe learned Divines, which excelled in the Gift of preaching, wherewith that City is alwayes furniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Being much affected and pleaſed with this ſtudy, Reſolving to purſue it earneſtly, and prepare himſelf for the Work of the Miniſtry, He did privately, yet in a very ſolemn manner by faſting and prayer, make as it were a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, of himſelf to God for that ſervice.</p>
                  <p>When he was middle <hi>Batchelor,</hi> he was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94116:10"/>
removed from <hi>Chriſts Colledge,</hi> and made <hi>Iunior</hi> Fellow, of <hi>Gonvile and Caius Colledge,</hi> about the beginning of the year, 1651. where after a years continuance, and probation of of his worth, he was tranſlated from that to a, <hi>Senior</hi> Fellowſhip, which he enjoyed during the ſpace of ſix years and upward. In which time he diſcharged the office of <hi>Steward</hi> to the Temporal, of <hi>Catechiſt</hi> and <hi>Conduct,</hi> to the Spiritual advantage of that Society.</p>
                  <p>Here it was that the Lord Trained up this his Diſciple to be a <hi>Scribe inſtructed for the Kingdom of God,</hi> furniſhing him ſo plentifully with Divine, and Spiritual knowledg (which he gained as well by experience, and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods dealing with him, and the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Spirit upon his heart, as by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Study, and Meditation) that he could readily <hi>bring forth out of his Treaſure things new and old:</hi> Was able to ſpeak perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, ſutably, and ſeaſonably to the various Capacities, Conditions, and Caſes of Saints, and Sinners, and became an happy, powerful Inſtrument in the hand of God for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, Edification, Conſolation, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of many Souls.</p>
                  <p>His deſign and deſire being to ſerve the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the Office and work of the Miniſtry, he directed the courſe of his Studies with ſpecial reſpect to that Service. And though his place and exerciſes in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity obliged him to the Study of Philoſophy,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94116:11"/>
wherein he was equal to moſt; yet the Study of Divinity was his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Not ſatisfying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the reading of the elaborate Writings of the moſt learned Divines, wherewith he furniſhed his Library at the Expence of ſome hundreds of pounds, he eſpecially addicted himſelf to the reading, and ſtudy of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> as containing the whole Counſel of God which, as his Miniſter, he was to declare to men. Which courſe of his ſtudy God ſo ſucceeded with his Bleſſing, that it may be truly ſaid of him what St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, Act.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>He was mighty in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> his Head, Memory, Heart, and Tongue, were full of the Scriptures, whereof he hath given abundant Evidence by his <hi>Scriptural Catechiſm.</hi> In the opening, and applying whereof his Gift was excellent and peculiar. All that knew him and were acquainted with his Diſcourſe, Miniſtry, or Pen, muſt bear him that Teſtimony, with the holy Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> he preferred the Learning gotten at the feet of Chriſt, above all he had got at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and though he had the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable accompliſhments of other learning, yet he <hi>determined not to know any thing ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> In which knowledge he was like <hi>Saul</hi> higher than moſt of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren from the ſhoulders and upwards. I know none I can better compare him with, than that Eminent, and Powerful ſervant and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Jeſus Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Arthur Hilderſhaw</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94116:11"/>
whom I am prone to believe he propounded to himſelf as a Pattern for imitation.</p>
                  <p>But knowledge alone is not ſufficient inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for a Miniſter of the Goſpel. It is no rare thing to find ſome great Schollars in the Theory of Scripture, who yet are but very ordinary Chriſtians, whoſe light like that of the Moon hath very cold influences. He is beſt accompliſhed whoſe knowing head effects his heart, and governs his life; who knows re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truth as well by Spiritual ſenſe and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, as by Speculation. The Spirit of God is a Spirit of truth and of life too, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth both grace and Gifts, and teacheth as well <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Both which conſiſted together in this excellent perſon. The word of God dwelt both in his Head and Heart and was effectually the Law of his Life. He was a <hi>Burning</hi> as well as <hi>Shinning Light:</hi> A man more than ordinarily mortified to the pleaſures of the Fleſh and vanities of the World; freely and reſolvedly devoted to the fear of God. His Converſation was in Heaven, his Communion with God, his Delight in the Saints, his Buſineſs Religion, his Zeal for Holineſs, his main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the glorifying of God, and the Salvation of his own and others Souls. Whereof the following Pages will, I doubt not, be an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Evidence not only to the Charitable, but Rational judgment of the Chriſtian Reader.</p>
                  <p>As for his practice of Mortification, I ſhall not otherwiſe expreſs it than in his own words,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94116:12"/>
as I read it in the records of the remarkable paſſages of his life by his own hand, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had a family, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Having been foiled by the luſts of my own Heart ſeveral times, and conſidering what I ſhould do to get rid of thoſe luſts, which, had ſo often prevailed over me, God directed me to three ſeveral means. The one was ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to me as I was walking in my garden and meditating on the affairs of my Soul, and that was to be more frequent in Eyeing, applying, and meditating on the promiſes; and the Scripture, which the Holy Spirit of God ſet before me for this end was 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>By the precious promiſes given to us, we eſcape the pollution that is in the world, through luſt.</hi> The other was ſuggeſted to me as I was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sermon, and that was to be daily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> to my ſoul, grounded on <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. 14. where the Apoſtle adviſeth to <hi>put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as an help againſt <hi>chambering and wantonneſs, ſtrife and envying.</hi> The third was ſuggeſted to me as I was riding abroad, and diſcourſing of the things of God, which was <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Walk in the Spirit and ye ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In purſuance of theſe means for the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the luſts of the fleſh, I determined with my ſelf, to Eye the promiſes of God, more frequently then I had done, and to that end, I choſe out ſome promiſes of daily and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94116:12"/>
uſe, and determined by the help of God, to ſalute and embrace them once a day, and not only to take a view of them my ſelf, but in my meditations, and ſoliloquies to ſpread them before God, and to put the Lord in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them. For ſupplying all the wants of the day, I choſe that promiſe <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. for growth in grace, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5. for ſubduing my ſins. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. for ſucceſs in my undertakings, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1. 3. for turning all the events of the day for good to me. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. for the converſion and ſanctification of my children. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 3. for my yoke-fellow and ſervants, and all others in my family that they might get good from me, and return to God, and grow in grace, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 7. for ſanctifying of my afflictions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 9. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 9. for audience of my prayers, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13. 14. for grace and ſtrength to manage all the works of the day, to the glory of God. <hi>Zech.</hi> 10. 12. for protection from dangers and caſualties. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 1. for giving me eternal life, in caſe the day ſhould bring death to me. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. for counſel and direction in all caſes of difficulty, and unexpected emergencies. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 11. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 32. 8.</p>
                     <p>I judged it alſo very conducible, to the Glory of God and my own ſoul's good, to manage all my employments, as much as may be with an eye to the promiſes, and as to my calling, when I am ſtudying to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94116:13"/>
Sermons, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 8. when I go to preach, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. 20. for ſucceſs in my preaching, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 56. 8.—65. 23.</p>
                     <p>I was the more confirmed in this frequent, and familiar converſe with the promiſes, not only as it helps on our participation of the Divine nature, and our eſcaping the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in the world through luſt, but becauſe the Lord commands us to be alwaies mindful of his covenant, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 15. and it pleaſeth God to ſee us taking hold of his Covenant. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 4. and it is for the Glory of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
                     <p>I determined alſo when I ſhould feel the workings of any luſt, preſently to look up to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It being the remedy which the Holy Ghoſt, preſcribes againſt ſuch ſins as do moſt eaſily beſet us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. 2. I have often been encouraged and helped in this practice, of looking unto <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to ſubdue my ſins from <hi>Act.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> God ſent his Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to bleſs us in turning us every one from his iniquities. <hi>Beza</hi>'s note upon that text is very good, and hath been of uſe to me, <hi>viz.</hi> that the great word for inquities, ſignifies the roots and habits of Sin. I ſaw it was my duty, and concernment every day, to be more frequent in applying my ſoul to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> his benefits to my ſoul.</p>
                     <p>In purſuance of the, 3d means of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>viz.</hi> walking in the ſpirit, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to endeavour to do my works, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94116:13"/>
both to God and men, more ſpiritually, and in order hereunto, to reduce my actings to ſome word, and as oft as I could, to eye ſome word of God, as I was entring on them; as for inſtance, If I be called out by others or ſtirred up in my own Spirit to viſit the ſick, or any afflicted perſon, to have my thoughts on <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 36. <hi>or Jam.</hi> 1. 27. when any poor people come to me for relief, or any object of charity is preſented to me to eye. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. or <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 16. or <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 10. or <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. 1. or <hi>prov.</hi> 19. 17. when a poor man cometh to borrow, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 7. 8. 10.

                     <p>This was the wiſe and holy method, which this faithful Servant and Souldier of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> preſcribed to himſelf by Divine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, whereby to manage the Spiritual War, with the ſin that dwelt in him, that he might not be overcome with it. According to which he moreover charged himſelf with,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94116:14"/>
the practice of univerſal poſitive Holineſs, which he thus records.</p>
                     <p>Being under the rebukes of Gods chaſtiſing providence, I ſet apart a day to humble my Soul with faſting and prayer, that I might obtain from God, a Sanctified uſe of my afflictions. I ſought God to pardon my ſins, which were the cauſes thereof, and to make them work for my good. I ſpent a good part of the day in meditating, how I ſhould make a right improvement of theſe correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>I Conſidered that one main end of all Chaſtiſements was, that God might make us partakers of his holineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 9. I reſolved in the ſtrength, and by the help of God to follow after holineſs more vigorouſly than I had done, and I engaged in this reſolution becauſe I ſaw from, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 21. that by my being holy, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God ſhould be glorified.</p>
                     <p>And ſeeing the nature of holineſs lieth in our bearing Gods image, in our being like to God, or in our conformity to the Divine Nature, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10.

                  <p>Thus did this man of God gird himſelf with the Sword of the Spirit, which he faithfully and ſucceſsfully managed againſt his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, temptations and tranſgreſſions. Thus did he put on the breſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, holding the myſtery of Faith in a pure Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, applying the word of God, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Law and rule to his heart, and life Sincerely aiming at the Glory of God, and the, obtaining that Bleſſedneſs, which by the Covenant of God is ſecured to <hi>the undefiled in the way, who walk in the Law of the Lord.</hi> How fit was he to be the mouth of God, and Ambaſſador of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſinners, who, when with greateſt importunity he called them to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94116:15"/>
Repentance and Reformation of heart and life, and the Mortification of the moſt beloved luſts; and moſt earneſtly preſſed upon them Faith, and Holineſs, and univerſal Conformity to the will of God, was not reproached by his own heart, as if he <hi>laid heavy burdens upon others, which himſelf would not touch with one of his fingers:</hi> But with deliberate choice and conſtant reſolution impoſed them upon himſelf, and obviated all objections, by demonſtrating the ſtricteſt holineſs to be practicable, eligible, and delectable by his own example.</p>
                  <p>But though he was very liberally inſtructed by Nature, Art, and Grace for the Office and work of the Miniſtry, yet ſuch low and mean thoughts had he of himſelf, both of his Gifts and Grace: And ſuch deep and affecting appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the difficulty, and weight of the Miniſterial Service, which as it is in it ſelf, ſo was to him, <hi>Onus tremendum,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>Who is ſufficient?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, that though it was his deſign and deſire to ſerve God, and his Church in that great work, yet he was ſo diſcouraged, that he would not as too many do, haſtily adventure and engage himſelf in that Office by ſolemn Ordination, but would firſt prove himſelf well, ask Counſel of God and his Word, and attend to the Call of God by his Spirit and Providence.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly being Maſter of Arts, he did ſometimes exerciſe his Gifts in ſome Countrey Villages nigh the Univerſity. Where his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94116:16"/>
was at firſt privately to enquire out what ſmall Pariſhes within ten or fifteen Miles of <hi>Cambridge</hi> were deſtitute of Miniſters. Unto theſe he went and Preached, and that with ſuch privacy, as for ſome while none knew of it but himſelf, and the Pariſhioners to whom he went; and to many of them it was a long time unknown, either who he was, or from whence he came.</p>
                  <p>This Service he perform'd <hi>Gratis,</hi> neither expecting nor according any worldly Reward, yea, it was a Charge to him. Among theſe Countrey-people God bleſſed him, and gave him the <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> of his Miniſtry, making him inſtrumental and ſucceſsful to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and Edification of many. Whereby he was ſo endeared to them, and they to him, that after he was called to Preach at one certain place in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he would yet often go amongſt them on the Week-days, Preaching ſometimes at one place, and ſometimes at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the people laying aſide their Country-buſineſs, and readily Travelling ſeveral Miles to attend upon his Miniſtry. And after his remove from <hi>Cambridge</hi> to a conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> his manner was for the moſt part ſo long as he lived, once a year to viſit thoſe people, Preaching to them, and Converſing with them.</p>
                  <p>After he had a while thus exerciſed his Gifts among the Country Villages. He obſerved three things eſpecially, which did much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94116:16"/>
him to give himſelf up to the Miniſtry of the Word.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The benefiting of his own Soul in his Meditations for Preaching; for whilſt he was ſtudying for others, the Lord made it a word of Inſtruction to himſelf: And he found it the beſt means of growth to be watering others. Yet herein he perceived (he ſaid) great need of Watchfulneſs, and much care leſt his heart ſhould put away that Word from himſelf which he was preſſing upon others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He found his heart much diverted from other ſtudies. Philoſophy ſeemed tedious to him, he found not that ſatisfaction in ſtudying meer human Authors as in meditating on Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things. Yea he thought he diſreliſhed all other Studies, and they were unſavory to him, and he knew not but that this might be of the Lord, thus to turn his heart from the one, and encline it to the other Study.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord had been pleaſed to bleſs his labours in ſome meaſure, and ordered ſo by his Providence that it came to his knowledge. As particularly at <hi>Burwell,</hi> at <hi>Swafham,</hi> at <hi>Soham,</hi> at <hi>Land-Beech,</hi> at <hi>Cheſterton</hi> in <hi>Cambridgſhire,</hi> at <hi>Debenham</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> at <hi>Wethersfield</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> This was an eſpecial encouragement to him, as it might well be, to purſue the Miniſtry</p>
                  <p>In the year 1654 he was choſen <hi>Catechiſt</hi> for that year in the <hi>Colledge.</hi> In which choice he obſerved the ſpecial Providence of God, for whereas formerly the Maſters uſed to nominate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94116:17"/>
the fellows for ſuch Offices as they ſhould bear, he this year bad the fellows agree, and chooſe among themſelves which they did according to Seniority. His buſineſs detained him from being preſent at the meeting of the fellows, and every one having choſen what they liked beſt, they caſt the <hi>Catechiſts</hi> place upon him, judging him fitteſt for it, which he accepted, and accordingly began to diſcharge it in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmaſs</hi> Term. This was the firſt place where he ſetled himſelf to a conſtant courſe of Preaching. Wherein God did greatly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and honour him; for the very firſt night he Exerciſed, one of the Fellows came to him, and told him he had felt the power of God in that Ordinance upon his heart.</p>
                  <p>The Statutes of the Colledge obliging him to theſe Divinity Exerciſes as <hi>Catechiſt</hi> in the Chapel only in Term time, towards the end of the Term he began to conſider whether he ſhould continue, and proceed in the ſame Exerciſes as well out of Term, as in Term, his Conſcience towards God as well as the local Statute, and his zeal to improve all opportunities to do good prompting him thereto; being doubtful what to do, he was determined to the Affirmative, by hearing a Sermon Preached at St. <hi>Maries</hi> by the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Tuckury</hi> then Profeſſor of Divinity there, the ſcope whereof was to ſhew what a Bleſſed and deſireable thing it was to have the Church of God multiplied and encreaſed, and in the Application he did
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94116:17"/>
in an eſpecial manner direct his words to the Univerſity, and did in the name of God ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſeech every one in their places, to endeavour the encreaſe and multiplying of the Church of God, both by adding themſelves to it, and labouring to add others to it. His Soul was much warmed at this Sermon, and conſidering the ſeaſonableneſs of it, he looked upon this word as directed ſpecially to himſelf, and took encouragement from it to proceed in his Work.</p>
                  <p>This practice of his being a proof not only of his abilities, but of his willingneſs alſo, and that laboriouſly to ſerve God in the work of the Miniſtry; About <hi>Eaſter</hi> following, a motion was made to him by one of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Pariſh in <hi>Cambridge</hi> in the Name of the reſt, to ſupply that place, which he declined, promiſing only to give them one Sermon. Afterward the motion being more importunately renewed to him, he adviſed them to ſeek God to direct them in a buſineſs of that concern, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them others of greater Abilities and Grace than himſelf to make choice of; telling them he would at that time, neither deny nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe any thing. About ſix weeks after, 8 or 9 of the Pariſh came to him in the name of the whole, and ſignified to him that it was their joynt Requeſt, that he would Preach with them on the Lords days in the Forenoon.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon after a Fortnights conſideration, and ſeeking of God, and Conſulting friends,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94116:18"/>
he complied with their deſire, and undertook that Service.</p>
                  <p>Here God ſo bleſſed his Miniſtry both to the Students in the Univerſity, and people of the Town, that his Encouragement was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, for which he always bleſſed God. In the Colledge he ſo well diſcharged his Office, that the year now expiring he was again choſen into the ſame Office next year. And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied that God did call him to this Work and Office, by the ſucceſs which God gave to his labours, and the acceptance he had in the Church, he reſolved thoroughly to devote, and give up himſelf to it by ſolemn Ordination. For which end he repaired to <hi>London,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there proved, and well approved of, was <hi>Feb.</hi> 13. 1655, ſolemnly ſet apart to this Office, and Work, by Faſting, and Prayer, and laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery. To which God ſeemed to ſet his Seal both du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Action, by very gracious influences of his Spirit upon his heart beyond his preparations, for which he hath Recorded thanks to God, and on the Lords day following, <hi>viz. Feb.</hi> 17. When being deſired to Preach at the <hi>Charter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi> both parts of the day: In the Afternoon one put up a Bill to him, wherein the perſon that put it up acknowledged, that he had long lain under the guilt of a known Sin, and was convinced of it by the morning Sermon, and deſired Prayers to God for help againſt it. Others alſo in that Congregation he obſerved
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94116:18"/>
to be affected at that his firſt Sermon after his Ordination.</p>
                  <p>In his returning from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> upon the way he experienced a very good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence with which his heart was much affected, and which he thankfully Recorded as an inſtance of Gods ſpecial care of him. The night over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking him ere he could reach to <hi>Haſting Mills,</hi> where the Waters were very high by reaſon of a flood, juſt as he came almoſt to the Water, a man met him, who knowing the danger of the Water, and the ſafeſt paſſage through it, offered him his Service, and very kindly lent him his own taller and ſtronger Horſe, and riding back again on his Horſe before him led him ſafely through, which elſe he perceived he could not have paſſed without the hazard of his Life.</p>
                  <p>Being now return'd to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to the Charge he had undertaken, with what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Faithfulneſs, Zeal, and Induſtry, he applied himſelf to the Work to which he had devoted himſelf, and was now ſolemnly ſet apart, I leave to the Pious Reader to judge by what follows in his own words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> 7<hi>th.</hi> 1656. I ſet apart that day for Faſting and Prayer to ſeek the Lord for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, whether I ſhould Preach in the Afternoon at St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> I had ſome thoughts of it, and motions thereto ſome time ſince. But now my time for Chapel exerciſe being expired, I took<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it into ſerious thoughts, and having
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94116:19"/>
humbled my Soul for my ſins, and begged of God that he would ſettle my mind in this thing, and teach me what was his mind therein, after pains and ſearching the Scripture I came to this reſolution, I was fully perſuaded that it was the mind of the Lord that I ſhould alſo Preach in the Afternoons, and that from theſe Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. 2. <hi>I charge the before God,—be inſtant in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon.</hi> As we will anſwer it to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> at the day of Judgment, we are to take all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to preach his Word. I conſider here is a fair opportunity put into my hands, and therefore I am bound in Conſcience not to neglect it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as much as in you lieth, <hi>feed thy flock,</hi> So <hi>Calvin</hi> renders the word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>9. 16. 17.</hi> Neceſſity is laid upon me, yea woe is unto me, if I preach not the goſpel. Though I preach the goſpel I have nothing to glory of, If I do this willingly I have a reward.</p>
                  <p>Eccl. <hi>11 6.</hi> in the morning ſow thy ſeed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand: For thou knoweſt not what ſhall proſper this or that, <hi>this ſeems a clear reſolution of the queſtion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>15. 58.</hi>—always abounding in the work of the Lord.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94116:19"/>
I know not, and therefore hold it my duty to lay hold on it.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon I reſolved to preach once a fortnight, in the Afternoons alſo; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering my weakneſs for ſuch a work, I was encouraged from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 10. <hi>and Math.</hi> 28. <hi>ult. Go teach and lo I am with you,</hi> with you to help and aſſiſt you; with you to bleſs your labours, and make your work proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous under your hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jul.</hi> 13. 1656. I began my Afternoons Exerciſe, and entred upon the Doctrine of Repentance. I have found God very much with me, aſſiſting and enlarging me, and bleſſing my labours to ſome of my hearers. I bleſs his Name for putting it into my heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nov:</hi> 16 I had not ſo much of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening preſence of God in the afternoon as I was wont to have: Yet God bleſſed his word. One of the Pariſh told <hi>Mr. J.</hi> He thought their Miniſter knew their hearts, and added he was reſolved to amend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Apr.</hi> 21. 1657. I ſet apart this day to ſeek God by faſting, and prayer, to ſhew me my way, and to direct me in a buſineſs that had been upon my Spirit nigh half a year, which was to preach once a fortnight, on the week day, at the church where I am placed. I engaged the prayers of others alſo for me in this particular. And when I went to the Sacrament, I laid the promiſe before God, that he would guide me continually, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94116:20"/>
teach me in the way that I ſhould chooſe, as that which I deſire might among others be Sealed up to me.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I was thus deliberating with my ſelf what to do, I met with this providence: Being at <hi>Soham</hi> to preach the Lecture there, I ſlept that night very diſturbedly, towards the morning me thought I ſaw the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in his glory, who ſpake comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to me, and encouraged me in my work, but ſpake very ſad words to another, <hi>Mr. of Arts</hi> that was with me, (whom I dreamed to be a godly man, yet one who was noted for his unwillingneſs to preach in Town) When I awoke I conſidered with my ſelf, what this ſhould mean. I conſidered it was but a dream, and ſo not much to be heeded, and again I conſidered that ſometimes God ſpeaks to us in dreams, and ſlumbering upon our beds, <hi>Job.</hi> 33. 13. 14. 15. whence I gathered it might be ſomething of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to me. In the morning when I was up, It fell out in my ordinary courſe of reading, the Scripture, to read, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. and when I had read, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. 10., and pondered what had befell me in the night, I could not but wonder at the Providence of God, to cauſe this Scripture, to fall in with my former dream, which made me ponder the more upon it. I ſaw God did ſometimes ſpeak to his people in a viſion. I ſaw the ſame reaſon why <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould Preach, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe there was much people
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94116:20"/>
belonging to the Lord there, might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to prevail with me, for he enclines a great multitude of people to attend upon me. When I had conſidered of it, I reſolved to lay this up in my heart, and not to ſlight it, though I could not build on it any ground of my undertaking my work.</p>
                  <p>Conſulting the Scriptures theſe came into my mind <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>we will give our ſelves continually to Prayer, and to the Miniſtry of the word,</hi> where I ſaw that ſuch as were called of God to preach the word, ought to make it their buſineſs, and give up themſelves to it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1. 14. 15. here I ſaw that one ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was a debter, bound, and ſhould be ready as much as in him lieth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 9. O thou that bringeſt good tidings to <hi>Zion,</hi> get the up into the high mountains, lift up thy voice with ſtrength, lift it up, be not afraid. Reading this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in my ordinary courſe, I found it ſet home with life, and power in reference to my preſent doubt, Get the up, lift up thy voice, It removed the great obſtacle of fear; What would men ſay and think of my forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Be not afraid; I was the more confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by conſidering this Scripture, is mainly directed to ſuch as God hath ſent to preach the goſpel, by comparing this Scripture with, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 7. <hi>and Rom.</hi> 10. 15.</p>
                  <p>And the Scripture did the more affect me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was in this manner ſet home after pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94116:21"/>
when I had been ſeeking God in reference to this doubt. <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 5. <hi>Paul was preſſed in Spirit and teſtified,</hi> hence I ſaw the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, may take encouragement, to preach the word from inward preſſures of Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Having theſe inducements to preach on the week day, I ſet apart as before the 21th of <hi>April,</hi> to ſeek God by faſting and prayer, to direct me what to do. Having put up my requeſt to him, in the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider what motives I have to it, and what diſſuaſives from it, and judge of both according to the Scriptures, and do therein as the Lord ſhall direct me, by his word and Spirit.</p>
                  <p>'The Arguments moving to it are theſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I Find God much enlarging my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, ſo as I am a long while ere I can diſpatch the Subject I enter upon, whereby I foreſee I ſhall go over but few heads in Divinity, while I ſtay unleſs I preach oftener. And I know not what the meaning of God herein ſhould be, that he watereth me ſo much, but that I ſhould water others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I have found God owning me when I cloſed with the like motions, at other times, particularly in the Afternoon Exerciſe, I have found God wonderfully gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious beyond expreſſion, and I heartily bleſs God that put it into my heart to undertake
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94116:21"/>
that work, and ſeeing when I followed God formerly he was with me, why ſhould I not be obedient to his call in this alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is the work I have been ſet apart to, and ſolemnly given up my ſelf to, in the face of the Congregation at <hi>Black-Friers,</hi> and therefore now there is a neceſſity lying upon me to preach the Goſpel, yea a woe if I preach not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God hath made my ſervice here accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Saints, and therefore it is likely my Miniſtry may be more effectual, It may be elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where my Miniſtry may be as much deſpiſed, as here tis embraced, and therefore it is good to take the preſent ſeaſon, and to ſtrike where, and when the Iron is hot.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The time is ſhort that I have to live, how ſoon God many take me hence, I know not. And there being no working in the grave, I am commanded to do what my hand findeth to do, with my might, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 10. the night cometh when no man can work, and therefore as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me, while it is day;</hi> So muſt I do, learn this wiſdom of him, to do my work as faſt as I can, ſeeing I know not how ſhort my day may be.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The times are evil, and I know not how ſoon we may be cut ſhort of theſe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities; and it's an expreſs Command that we ſhould be wiſe and redeem time, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 15. 16. And God commands as we have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94116:22"/>
to do good to all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel is doing good, and here is an opportunity, I muſt not let it ſlip.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If I ſhould preach once a fortnight on the week-day it will but be equivalent to preaching twice every Lords day, (Seeing now I preach but once every other Sabbath) which muſt be my work, when I come into the Country, and yet my work here is far lighter than it will be there, for here I am free from worldly cares, family diſtractions, and a paſtoral charge.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. One Soul is more worth than the whole world, and the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is the power of God to Salvation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould not think any pains too great to preach the word, ſeeing we may through God be a mean to convert and ſave ſouls thereby.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Chriſt chargeth <hi>Peter</hi> as he loveth him, to feed his ſheep, and lambs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17. His repeating this 3 times argues, 1. that he would have him very diligent in doing it. 2. that he takes it as a real demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of love to him, to feed his ſheep. Now I have wonderful cauſe to love Chriſt, and good reaſon to demonſtrate it that way which he would have me.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If I enter upon preaching on week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day too, I ſee it will make for the Glory of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 8. God is glorified when we bear much fruit, and for the good, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of others; for the body of Chriſt is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94116:22"/>
Edified by the Miniſtry of the Word. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12. and why ſhould I ſtand diſputing that which may make for the glory of God, and the good of thoſe among whom I live.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. God would have every man obſerve his proper gifts and improve them, and attend his proper work that he is called to with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8, 11.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. I have Naturally a ſlothful Spirit, and one good way to Maſter it, is to take up much imployment.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. God would have us alway to abound in his Work and be ſtedfaſt, and he tells us our labour ſhall not be in vain. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. No excuſe muſt hinder us now from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, but what will ſerve turn at the day of judgment.</p>
                  <p>I conſider further that the Word of God is to be the Rule by which we muſt walk. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 105. that is the light of our paths. What the Word requires of us, God requires of us; What work the Word calls us to, that God calls us to. Now conſidering with my ſelf the aforeſaid particulars according to the Word of God, I gather, it is the mind of God I ſhould cloſe with this motion, and that he calleth me to further work, and ſo accordingly I am to obey his voice.</p>
                  <p>Now in regard that it is Gods preſence with me, his owning, accepting, and aſſiſting me, that muſt bear me up againſt all difficulties that I ſhall meet with; I conſulted further
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94116:23"/>
with the Word to ſee what grounds I had to expect that God would be with me in my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and I ſaw great encouragement from theſe Scriptures,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Go teach—lo, I am with you alway.</hi> Chriſt will not withdraw his preſence at any time when we go about to teach in obedience to his Command, but will be always with us.</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 10, 20. compared. Whence I obſerve, when God calls a man out to any work, he would have him be ſtrong and do it, and not to fear or be diſmayed, for God will be with him and not fail him or forſake him, till he hath finiſhed it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Have not I Commanded thee?—The Lord thy God is with thee whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou goeſt.</hi> The ſame preſence and aſſiſtance may we expect from God when ever he calls us out to any Service, which I gather from the Apoſtles applying to all Chriſtians what God ſpake in particularto <hi>Joſh. Heb.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 6. <hi>I the Lord have called thee, I will hold thy hand.</hi> It is ſpoken to Chriſt, and ſhall be made good to all Chriſtians, when called by God to any work, he will uphold them in it, and he whom God upholds ſhall not fail, or be diſcouraged till his work be done. <hi>v.</hi> 1. 4</p>

                     <hi>Judg.</hi> 6. 12. 14. <hi>The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man. Go in this thy might, thou ſhalt ſave</hi> Iſrael—<hi>Have not I ſent thee?</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:94116:23"/>
                     <hi>In this thy might,</hi> i. e. either in the ſtrength of the promiſe. <hi>The Lord is with thee,</hi> or in the ſtrength of thy Commiſſion, <hi>I have ſent thee.</hi> Doeſt thou doubt whether I will be with thee, ſeeing I have ſent thee? Doeſt thou doubt whether thou ſhalt ſave <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have ſent thee?

                  <p>'Diſcouragements removed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Reproach of men. What will men ſay or think that I am ſo forward. They will impute it to Pride, it &amp;c. and ſay I am impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and will, may be, laugh and jear at me.</p>
                  <p>Reply 1. I am not to be aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. No not in an Adulterous generation. <hi>Mar.</hi> 8. 38. If I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer ſhame for Chriſt, how ſhall I ſuffer greater perſecutions?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God can if he will, hide me from the ſtrife of Tongues, yea he promiſeth to do ſo for them that truſt in him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 19, 20. he can make a mans Enemies to be at Peace with him, and will if our ways pleaſe him. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 7. However I ſhall not be ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of mans judgment in this matter, but commit my way and Cauſe to the Lord, and if I be reproached he will one day clear me. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 37. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If I do meet with ſhame and reproach
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94116:24"/>
for my diligence in Preaching the Word, 'tis no more than the Apoſtles met with. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 13. yea, I, Chriſt ſuffered great contradiction in his Preaching, they ſaid he was Mad, and had a Devil, and I am bidden to remember it, as that which will keep me from fainting. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If I Serve Chriſt, the Lord will honour me, and that is infinitely above the honour of the world. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 26. I ſhall deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſeek the praiſe that is of God, and no matter what men ſay.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p>Reply 1. The hearts of all men are in Gods hand, if he touch their hearts, they ſhall come. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 26. I will leave that to the

Lord, whether he will encline many, or but few to attend upon his Word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Angels thoſe glorious Creatures did not diſdain to Preach Chriſt to a few poor Shepherds, and therefore I ſhould not think much to Preach Chriſt, though to never ſuch a thin Congregation. Jeſus Chriſt himſelf Preached the Goſpel to one hearer only, and that a poor ſinful woman of <hi>Samaria. Joh.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Gods preſence is not tied to a multitude; if but two or three be gathered together in his Name, he is in the midſt of them, and if God will bleſs his Word for the Converſion of but one Soul, it is worth all our labour and pains. <hi>Mark.</hi> 8. 37. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I ſhall deſire to do my work to God and not to men, becauſe God Commands me, though men may ſlight my pains, and do not gather together to hear the Word, yet my work is before the Lord, and my reward with him, and I ſhall be glorious in his eyes, however I appear before men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 5. However men reckon of my labours, though the more I love them and labour for them, the leſs I beloved, yet this ſhould not be any hindrance to me in the work of God, but I ſhould gladly ſpend my ſelf and be ſpent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13.</p>
                  <p>Having Conſulted God, and ſeeing ſuch good ground for my undertaking, I ſet up a Lecture once a Fortnight on <hi>Thurſday</hi> in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94116:25"/>
the Afternoon at three of the Clock. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it on the firſt <hi>Thurſday</hi> in <hi>June.</hi> 1657.</p>
                  <p>With ſuch mature Deliberation, ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Conſcience, ſuch a willing mind, ſuch a zealous Spirit, ſuch a laborious head and hand did this worthy Servant of God apply himſelf to the great Work wherein he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. Thus did he fortifie his heart with ſtrongeſt Arguments againſt all temptations to ſloth and negligence. Thus ſearched he the Scriptures that he might fully know his Lords will. Thus yielded he obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and acted Faith in the promiſes of God. In this his might he went forth in the Name of the Lord, to the work of the Lord, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Lord did proſper in his hand.</p>
                  <p>Though his conſtant weekly work at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Church were enough to exerciſe more than ordinary ſtrength both of mind and body, yet he had many other occaſions of Service which he attended, not only in the Colledge as his place required, eſpecially as a Tutor, which relation and truſt he diligently and faithfully diſcharged towards his Pupils, both as to Learning and Religion, but in the Town, as Preaching frequently Funeral Sermons, and Trinity Lecture, and in the Country alſo at ſeveral Lectures, both in <hi>Cambridgeſhire</hi> and <hi>Huntingdonſhire.</hi> For his Abilities and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs were ſo well known as encouraged many invitations to be made to him from abroad. All which he performed not after an extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94116:25"/>
rate, as the manner of ſome is, haſtily to utter <hi>quicquid in buccam venerit,</hi> but as a workman that needed not to be aſhamed. On which account the Ears of ſo many hanged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and he never wanted a full Auditory as well of <hi>Schollars,</hi> as Town-people. His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were well ſtudied and digeſted, his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Subſtantial and Spiritual, his Arguments ſtrong and convincing, his utterance full, clear, deliberate, and grave. His words apt and natural to expreſs the Conceptions of his mind, he neither affected a ſtrain of words, which mans wiſdom teacheth, nor allowed himſelf a liberty of words which mans indiſcretion poureth out; but his Phraſe was ſuch as ſpake him to have an holy Reverence for the plainneſs, and ſimplicity of the Goſpel of Chriſt, a due care that he expoſed not the Miniſtry of the word to Contempt, a Religious fear of that God in whoſe Name he ſpake, and a ſerious regard to the Concernment of the Souls of men. And in all his Applications to God by Prayer both in publick and private, his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, words, and manner of utterance were ſuch as ſpake his ſolemn, and affecting appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the Majeſty, and Holineſs of God whom he Worſhipped. So as conſidering his years, the multiplicity of his Miniſterial work, his manner of performing it, and the holineſs of his life wherewith he did adorn and commend it; it may be truly ſaid of him, that however he was excelled by others in other reſpects, yet in this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94116:26"/>
he was <hi>Nulli ſecundus,</hi> if not a <hi>None ſuch</hi> in the Univerſity in his day.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Cambridge</hi> is not a place for long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. The Univerſity is the Church's Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery from whence God is wont to remove, and tranſplant his trees of Righteouſneſs when once grown up to the Stature of Fruit-bearing, that the various Congregations of his people may eat of the fruit thereof and live. God having here trained up his Servant to his hand, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him with excellent Gifts, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Grace, called him ſolemnly to the Office of the Miniſtry, proved him an able and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Inſtrument before many Witneſſes, and enlarged his heart not only to a willingneſs, but zeal to diſcharge his Office with all his might, quickly ſhewed him the place where, with this reſolved Induſtry, and Integrity he ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his Talents. Scarce two Months were expired after he had begun his Week-day Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, when the Mayor and one of the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Colcheſter</hi> in <hi>Eſſex</hi> (whither his fame reached) applied themſelves to him at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> deſiring him to accept their Lecturers place then void. With which motion he ſo far only then complied as to promiſe to come over to them, and Preach a Sermon or two among them; which he performed about three weeks after.</p>
                  <p>After his Preaching, the Houſe of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Common Council met, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agreed to chooſe him to be their Town-Lecturer,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94116:26"/>
to Preach on Lords days Afternoon, and on the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> every Week. Which choice had alſo the general Suffrage of the Sober and Godly people in Town, and Country thereabout.</p>
                  <p>Which being ſignified to him by ſome of the Aldermen and Common Council, after ſix weeks deliberation (for ſo long time he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to give his Anſwer) ſeeking God for direction, as his conſtant manner was, having no objections before him as to Conſcience in the caſe, nor any obligation to ſtay at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> ſave only the peoples deſire, which he Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 42. 43. and <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 20. and conſidering the joynt unanimous agreement of perſons different in Judgment (for it was a divided place) in calling him, he conſented to their Choice, and undertook that Charge.</p>
                  <p>As he had experienced Gods owning and Sealing of his Miniſtry in his firſt Catechiſtical Exerciſe in the Colledge, and his firſt Sermon after his Ordination, with much happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs alſo in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> ſo here he had the ſame encouragement, God making his firſt Sermon effectual upon the heart of a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> and his ſecond or third upon another perſon noted for a Sinner, who came out of Novelty to hear him. Concerning whom he might ſay as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>They ſhew of us, what manner of entring we had to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it fared with him here at <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> as it did at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he thought he did not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94116:27"/>
work enough, and therefore asked leave, and freely offered himſelf to preach alſo on the Lords day Mornings at St. <hi>James</hi>'s Church, not deſiring any outward reward for it, which was granted and accepted.</p>
                  <p>He was to this place a very great Bleſſing, not only as to their Spiritual, but Temporal concerns alſo. It was obſerved that during his abode, and the liberty of his Miniſtry there, the Town proſpered and exceedingly flouriſhed in Trade. For even the good things of this life doth the Goſpel carry with it.</p>
                  <p>Here he laboured in the Word and Doctrine, till by the <hi>Act of Uniformity</hi> he was with the reſt of his Brethren debarred from the publick Exerciſe of his Miniſtry. Yet not thinking himſelf bound to be his own Executioner, and there being mutual obligations by Contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Town and him, that the one ſhould not eject, nor the other deſert without ſo long warning, he did after the fatal <hi>Bartholomew</hi> continue his publick Preaching ſome time till, having occaſion to take a Journey into <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeſhire,</hi> in his abſence another was put into his place by the B. of <hi>L.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From thenceforth with St. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 28. 30, 31. <hi>he dwelt</hi> three <hi>whole years in his own hired houſe, and received all that came in unto him, Preaching the Kingdom of God with all confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> till God ſent the raging Peſtilence into the Town <hi>An.</hi> 1665. at which Providence he was greatly affected, and while he ſaw many,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94116:27"/>
and even the Shepherds of the flock, haſtening their flight from the peſtilence that walked in darkneſs, and the Deſtruction that waſted at noon day, and others ſmitten with the Arrows of the Almighty, daily paſſing into eternity, Such compaſſion he had for periſhing ſouls, and Such Zealous deſire of their ſalvation, and Such hope that the word might be more effectuall in that day of Gods ſore Judgment, that he ſent to the Magiſtrates, and freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, if they would indulge him the liberty of a publick Church, to ſtay and preach to that poor diſtreſſed people, till either God ſhould take him away by death, or cauſe the peſtilence to ceaſe. Which being denied him, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thoughts of removing out of Town. And having <hi>ſought of God a right way for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his little ones, and his ſubſtance.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Satisfaction concerning the lawfulneſs of removing, in time of Peſtilence, from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 20. <hi>Hide thy ſelf for a little moment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Indignation be over paſt,</hi> and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hope that the preſence of God ſhould go with him, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 15. <hi>I am with thee and will keep thee in all places, whither thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> &amp;c. adding thereto <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7, 9. where he obſerved that all Believers have right to the promiſes made to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> Accordingly, <hi>Aug.</hi> 25. 1665.

Though we ſhould think there is no more hopes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, to them, to whom we preach, than there is by ſpeaking to the wind, or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dead mens bones, yet we ſhould go on with our work. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Propheſies to dry and dead bones, (concerning which when he was asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they could live, he replied, that he could not tell, God only knew. <hi>v.</hi> 3.) And they have the Spirit of life breathed into them. He Propheſieth to the wind and that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>v.</hi> 9. 10. This Scripture being ſo ſuited to ſome reaſonings, and doubts that I had upon my mind, and coming ſo ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, at my firſt fixing at <hi>Chattiſham</hi> I was much affected with it, and looked upon it as a token for good, that I ſhould have Gods preſence with me, and the teachings of his Spirit, at <hi>Chattiſham,</hi> as I have had them at <hi>Colcheſter.</hi>

                  <p>The encouragement which he thus took was not vain and empty, God <hi>remembred his word unto his Servant, wherein he had cauſed him to hope.</hi> For he not only enclined the hearts of the people among whom he lived,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94116:29"/>
though ſtrangers to him, to pay him that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Honour, which was due to him; and indulged him the liberty of private Preaching, as he had before enjoyed, but moreover open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in this place a door for the frequent publick exerciſe of his Miniſtry, which was ſhut againſt him at <hi>Colcheſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Miniſter of the Pariſh having another cure, by reaſon whereof he could attend this at <hi>Chattiſham</hi> but once a fortnight, did in his abſence not only willingly but thankfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge to <hi>Mr. Stockton</hi> the liberty of his Pulpit. And having a very ſmall maintenance, and ſome burdens lying heavy upon him, which after a few years, made his reſidence there very uneaſie to him, he deſerted his charge, and left this flock to ſhift for themſelves. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon at the requeſt of the people <hi>Mr. Stockton</hi> frequently ſupplyed that vacancy. And his Zeal provoked and encouraged others alſo, both Miniſters and People. For other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Pariſhes being deſtitute of Miniſters, for want of maintenance called in the help of <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> who in theſe places, ſo much below envye, have enjoyed the liberty of their publick Preaching for the moſt part to this day, So as not only the Pariſh where he lived, but the neighbouring Vllages have abundant cauſe to bleſs God for ſending, to them ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py an Inſtrument, ſo willing and Zealous, ſo able and induſtrious to ſerve their Souls in the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>

When it pleaſed his Majeſty to ſet forth his moſt Gracious Declaration for Indulgence, he was choſen both by a Congregation in <hi>Ipſwhich</hi> and another in <hi>Colcheſter</hi> to preach to them, And both being very deſirous of him, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with their deſires as far as he could, and undertook half the Service of either, and ſo with others divided his labours between them, during his life, to their great Satisfaction and edification.</p>
                  <p>His labours were abundant. His Miniſtry was his whole buſineſs: Beſides his Lords days ſervice, wherein he not only preached twice, but oft expounded the Scriptures, and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed the younger ſort, and many times diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed particular Chriſtians that applyed, themſelves to him for Counſel and inſtruction about their Spiritual caſes; He moreover preached a Lecture at <hi>Ipſwich</hi> on the weekday once a fort-night, and ſcarce a week paſſed but he preached at ſome other Lecture or fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral beſides keeping of private faſts which he frequently practiſed both at home and abroad.</p>
                  <p>The providence of God over him, while he was thus Zealouſly, and conſtantly imployed in his work, in ſo many places was ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it muſt not be paſſed over without ſpecial obſervation. Notwithſtanding the Severity of the Laws, the malice, watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and endeavours of Adverſaries, yet God Suffered not an hair to fall from his head, though Complaints, Informations, Indictments,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94116:30"/>
Convictions, Warrant, Preſentments, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications were made againſt him, yet was he never impriſoned, apprehended, diſtrained or brought before any Court or Magiſtrate. He was much affected with this care of God over him, and thankfully accepted, and recorded it as the inſtance of Gods faithfulneſs, and performance of his promiſe, as the anſwer of his own faith and Prayer, and as the reward of his love and Zeal, and courage for God and his Church by the power whereof he lived above fears and dangers; for thus he writes.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Dec.</hi> 25. 65. As I was reading in my courſe <hi>Luke</hi> 6. I obſerved from <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. from Chriſts practice who in thoſe days when his Enemies <hi>were filled with madneſs</hi> againſt him, and <hi>Communed one with another what they might do unto him, went out into a Mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</hi> I obſerved, I ſay, hence that it was my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to give my ſelf much unto prayer, at ſuch
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94116:31"/>
times as I had any Enemies that laid wait for me to do me hurt.</p>
                     <p>Within a day or two after one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables came to me, and told me that his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Conſtable when he had drunk ſomewhat liberally, opened his heart to him, and told him that there had been ſome Communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him, and one of the Deputy Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants about preſenting me at the Seſſions, and about my Meetings. I thought upon that place in <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 11, 12. after he was gone, and went up into my Chamber to pray. And as I was meditating on this matter that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 12. was brought to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. <hi>The beloved of the Lord ſhall dwell in ſafety by him,</hi> &amp;c. I was ſtrengthened in my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to this promiſe, becauſe God had lately made out his love to my Soul, as I was pleading this promiſe in prayer, that paſſage was ſet home, <hi>He ſhall cover thee all the day long.</hi> Whence I did hope that the Lord who had helped me hitherto, would ſtill cover me under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his wings. After I had been at prayer I conſidered <hi>Jacobs</hi> carriage, when he was in danger of ſuffering by his brother <hi>Eſau:</hi> After he had been wreſtling with God in prayer, and pleading the promiſe, he betook himſelfto the uſe of the moſt probable means for appeaſing <hi>Eſau.</hi> I alſo uſed the moſt probable means to prevent trouble at the enſuing Seſſions, and it pleaſed God ſo to order things at the Seſſions that I met with no trouble. Bleſſed be God

                        <hi>Jun.</hi> 22. As I was exerciſing in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in the Afternoon ſeveral of my friends being with me, I had word ſent me that the Mayor and Juſtices would come down to my houſe; whereupon being near the end of my Exerciſe, I quickly concluded. After I had done and diſmiſſed the people, one of the Conſtables came to me, and told me he was ſent to diſſolve my Meeting, but had a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling upon him when he ſpake to me. He added, that he bleſſed God that had given him an heart to come ſome times himſelf, and his Wife to my Meetings; ſo that inſtead of doing me any hurt he gave glory to God that inclined him to come to hear me.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Octob.</hi> 1670. I was preſented in the Eccleſiaſtical Court for Preaching. But God ſtood by me, and encouraged me with that word, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103. 31. And though my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries proceeded ſo far as to get out an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication againſt me, yet the Lord raiſed up deliverance for me, that the Court took off my Excommunication, without appearing before them or paying any Fees.</p>
                     <p>Yea, ſo far was he from declining the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his Miniſtry for fear of ſuffering, that when he had been perſuaded thereto by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of friends, he was much diſſatisfied, concerning which thus he records.</p>
                     <p>I promiſed Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to Preach at <hi>White Colne</hi> on <hi>Octob.</hi> 23. accordingly on <hi>Saturday</hi> I was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94116:32"/>
prepared to go. <hi>H. P.</hi> came in and told us that the Soldiers had ſeized Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned him, and that it would not be ſafe for me to go at that ſeaſon; all my friends and Relations diſſuaded me, but notwithſtanding my mind ſtood to go. But being importuned to ſtay, and having been very lately ſought after by name by the Soldiers in thoſe parts, and weighing the Providence in ſending <hi>H. P.</hi> to my houſe with this Intelligence as I was about to take Horſe, I determined to caſt my ſelf on my Brother <hi>Cole</hi>'s determination, who was then at my houſe, and he determining that I ſhould not go, I ſtayed at home. But that night and the next day I was under much deſpondency of Spirit, for miſſing ſuch an opportunity of Service; yet God was gracious to me, and revived me. It was ſome ſtay to my mind what I read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 20. Where I obſerved, that the divulging of the moſt neceſſary truths was at ſome ſeaſons, and in ſome places prohibited by Jeſus Chriſt. I was further ſatisfied from <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 6, 7. whence I obſerved, that the fruſtrating of our Attempts and deſigns to Preach the Goſpel to particular places that we purpoſed to go to, did ſometimes ariſe from the Holy Ghoſt. And from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. 9. I had a damp upon my Spirit, and was hindred from praiſing God for my deliverance from my Enemies hands, becauſe I had miſſed an opportunity of Service. But this Scripture convinced
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94116:33"/>
me that I ought to praiſe God for this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, though attended with ſome afflicting Circumſtances. By theſe Scriptures and Prayer I obtained ſatisfaction, and the Lord Anſwered my deſire and fully quieted my mind.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Once a very zealous and active Proſecutor of the Non-conformiſts, obtained a Warrant againſt him upon the <hi>Oxford Act,</hi> directed to all the Chief Conſtables, and petty-Conſtables in the County, to apprehend him. Accordingly an Officer a ſtranger came to Execute it, and when he was nigh the houſe, he eſpied two perſons, whom by their habit he judged to be Miniſters, walking in a field, the one was Mr. <hi>Stockton,</hi> the other Mr. <hi>Senior</hi> of <hi>Hackney</hi> (whom God hath alſo lately taken away) He haſteneth to them, and told them he had a Warrant againſt one of them, but he knew neither, Mr. <hi>Senior</hi> asked which of them. He Anſwered Mr. <hi>Stockton.</hi> Let me ſee your Warrant ſaid Mr. <hi>Senior,</hi> he ſhewed it him, verily concluding from thence that he was the man. Some Little Girls were there walking with them, who did induſtriouſly cling to Mr. <hi>Senior</hi> as if he had been their Father, which further confirmed him in his Error. While Mr. <hi>Senior</hi> read the Warrant, and the Officer was intent upon him, Mr. <hi>Stockton</hi> walked aſide, and when Mr. <hi>Senior</hi> ſaw him beyond his reach, he convinced the Officer of his Error, who thereby was diſappointed of his prey.</p>

Being thus ſecured by the Providence of God through Faith and Prayer from the danger of Adverſaries, he thankfully acknowledged the whole glory thereof to God, thus,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>In reading 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 30. <hi>The Realm of</hi> Jehoſhaphat <hi>was quiet, for his God gave him reſt round about.</hi> God cauſed me to take notice, that my living in reſt and quietneſs, being free from the moleſtation of my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies was the gift of God, and came to paſs by his Providence, not from the privacy of the place where I lived, or from the peaceable diſpoſition of my Neighbours. I was alſo inſtructed what I ſhould return unto the Lord, for keeping me from the hands of mine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and giving me reſt and peace, from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 1. <hi>I will extol 'thee, O Lord, for thou haſt lifted me up, and haſt not made my foes to rejoyce over me,</hi> and from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 7, 8.

His firſt born a daughter attained to the age of 19 years and died, who had been ſo inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her Father, that before ſhe was 8 years old, ſhe under ſtood the method of a Sermon, and if Preached by her Father would give him an account of the moſt conſiderable heads and paſſages therein, and before ſhe was full 9 years of age ſhe would pen down a Sermon after him, and miſs but few or none of the heads, with ſome conſiderable enlargement alſo.</p>

And as ſhe grew up ſhe quickly gave evidence of the truth of Grace and power of Godlineſs, making progreſs therein beyond her years, having a great and Zealous love to the Ordinances, Miniſters, and Servants of Chriſt, Diſſembling the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and infirmities of her body, that ſhe might have liberty to attend the Ordinances of God for her Soul, walking cloſely with God in daily ſecret duty, ſtrictly keeping the Sabbaths, taking ſpeciall notice, of the workings of Grace, and Sin, and, Gods providential dealings with her, recording them in her diary, and under a long and mortal ſickneſs, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a moſt chriſtian Patience and Submiſſion, to the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>As to his Servants, ſo ſoon as they came into his family, he inſtructed them firſt in their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94116:36"/>
duty towards God, next in the duty of their places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giving them the evidence and authority of Scripture for that which he inſtructed them in, and expected from them, enjoyning them to get thoſe Scriptures by heart which they were to keep in memory and repeat to him, as he called for them.</p>
                  <p>As to his family together, after his own perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſecret retirement and devotion, in reading the Holy Scriptures in courſe, and Prayer, which was his firſt and laſt exerciſe, after his upriſing, and before his downlying, His manner was in the morning ſeeking God, firſt by a ſhort Prayer for a bleſſing to read ſome portion of Scripture, which he often alſo Expounded, and then to proceed to Prayer; and at night after the like reading of the Scripture, he required every Child that was capable, and Servant, to repeat one verſe of that Chapter or ſome other Scripture which they had a deſire might be explained to them, and of every ſuch verſe ſo repeated he gave the ſenſe, and ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it before Prayer, often exhorting his family to a reverend demeanor of themſelves in the worſhip of God, and would be much troubled when he underſtood, or diſcerned any thing to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Once a week for the moſt part he did cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe, both Children and ſervants either out of the Aſſemblies, or his own Scriptural Catechiſm and explained it to them: And once a fortnight if not diverted by urgent occaſion, he went
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94116:36"/>
over ſome principle of Religion, opening and explaining it in a Catiehiſtical way, which his Children and Servants were to give him an account of the next fortnight, and when they had ſo done, he proceeded to another principle, and thus he did from time to time. What ſermons the Youth of the family heard upon the Lords day, or at any other time, they gave an account thereof to him as they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. He kept private days of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his family, as often as he could gain opportunity for it, on which days he would if not prevented, deal particularly with every one, or as many as he had time for, that was under his charge, about the matters of their Souls. And took care that all in his family ſhould call upon God and Pray to him in ſecret, as well as be preſent at family duty. And when any of his Brethren came to vſit him. He was not willing to let them depart without Prayer. His Family was an houſe of Prayer. Theſe his labours in his family God bleſſed and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Spiritual good of ſeveral that came under his roof.</p>
                  <p>He was moſt tenderly conſcientious in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy the Sabbath day, whereof he was a ſtrict obſerver, and took care that all under his roof ſhould do the ſame. He kept a very ſevere watch not only over his words, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but his very thoughts alſo. Quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting thereon not only when vain and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but when impertinent to the holineſs, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94116:37"/>
duty of the day, whereof he hath left the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing teſtimonies.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>April.</hi> 29. 1666. My heart was much out of frame upon the Lords day, full of vain and Sinful thoughts. As I was going to prayer in the Afternoon alone, God brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 40. 12, 17. <hi>Innumerable evils have Compaſſed me about, mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up—yet the Lord thinketh upon me.</hi> This was a ſtay to me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Apr.</hi> 4. I went forth on ſeveral occaſions, None of them ſucceeded. The firſt Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of that journey was caſt into my thoughts on the Lords day in a time of prayer, I laid it aſide till Monday, and then conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed further of it, and ſaw it convenient for the beſt ordering of my affairs. But not humbling my ſoul for thoſe contrivances ſo unſeaſonably ariſing in my mind, I was croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them. Hereupon I determined for time to come, when any thoughts or contrivances about ordering my affairs were caſt into my mind on Lords days or on other days in time of holy duties, to lay them aſide till a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time; and if upon deliberation, that way of ordering my affairs ſeems beſt which was caſt into my mind in time of holy duties, I would not hereupon neglect that way leſt Satan ſhould get advantage of me, but I would firſt humble my Soul for its wanderings and ſuffering ſuch thoughts to ariſe ſo unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94116:37"/>
and took to Chriſt for pardon of the irregularities of my heart, and then not fear to order my affairs in that way, that ſeems moſt agreeable to reaſon, and neereſt the rule of Gods word, though the Contrivance was firſt caſt into my mind, at an unſeaſonable time.</p>
                     <p>Having a letter of Spiritual advice and Counſel to write to a friend, and having no ſpare time but on the Lords day, to do it, I was doubtful whether I might ſpend ſome part of that day on ſuch imployment. As I was muſing on my bed what I had beſt do, that Scripture came to my mind, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10, 11. <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lords day, and I heard a Voice ſaying, what thou ſeeſt Write in a Book, and ſend it to the ſeven Churches.</hi> Whence I Concluded it to be Lawful to write, as well as read, hear, meditate, and diſcourſe of ſpirital matters on the Lords day.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>His Charity had no leſs meaſure than the reſt of his Graces, which he accounted one of the beſt characters of a Chriſtian. Lamenting ſometimes the diviſions among Profeſſors of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he would ſay, He did not value a Chriſtian by his great knowledg and eminent parts, but by his great Charity and Love to his Brethren.</p>
                  <p>This he extended to various Sorts of objects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as,</p>
                  <p>Towards thoſe who were at difference one with another. He was an induſtrious peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, offering himſelf to interpoſe, to make up the breach, taking journeys when at diſtance in order to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:94116:38"/>
Towards thoſe that had difference with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about worldly concernes, from which he was not altogether free, though altogether innocent, when he ſuffered wrong by any, his care was, that they ſhould ſuffer none by him, or his, either in word or deed, always practiſing himſelf, and counſelling others to do good, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt evil. He would make the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that was poſſible, of the words, and actions of his adverſaries, often making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Charity thinketh no evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Towards his Friends, his Friendſhip was hearty, ingenuous, faithful and open. He received them into his houſe gladly, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them liberally, converſed with them cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ſympathiſed with them in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons affectionately, and ſerved them, as he had occaſion, induſtriouſly.</p>
                  <p>Towards thoſe that perſecuted him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for Conſcience, and Religions ſake, he obſerved the command of Chriſt <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 44. He affcctionately pitied them, and prayed for them daily. And when he heard any paſſionate expreſſions againſt them for their violence, and unrighteouſneſs, he would be offended, and charge people to pray more earneſtly for them, and ſeek opportunities to do them good.</p>
                  <p>Towards thoſe that diſſented from him in the matters of God, he had a Spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and forbearance, embracing all with Chriſtian Love, whoſe practice did not deſtroy
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94116:38"/>
their profeſſion of Chriſtianity. <hi>Colcheſter</hi> was a very divided place, when he was called thither, upon the account of diverſe perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet he ſo behaved himſelf with all humility, modiration, tenderneſs, Brotherly kindneſs, aad Charitable judgment, that they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally united in their reſpects, and eſteem for him. And though he could not with Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his Conſcience, conform to all that the Law required, yet he judged many that did, to be very Good men, and had a real Honour for them.</p>
                  <p>Towards the poor, and ſuch as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſtreights and difficulties in this world, he was pitiful and bountiful, He deviſed libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, and drew out his Soul to the hungry. In the exerciſe whereof he obſerved our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours rule <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3. This indeed was one of his ſecrets which he always induſtriouſly, concealed as much as he could. Yet variety of objects bare witneſs to him.</p>
                  <p>The Widow, the Fatherleſs, the Stranger, the Sick, the Sufferers, have all been refreſhed from his compaſſions. Though he offered to Preach freely at St, <hi>James's</hi> Church in <hi>Colcheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> on Lords day Mornings (as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned) not deſiring or expecting any reward, yet the civility of the people did gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him for his pains. The greateſt part of which (I am aſſured from an hand privy to it) he diſtributed to charitable uſes.</p>
                  <p>And this I read under his own hand.</p>

                        <hi>Nov.</hi> 1. 1665. I made a Vow to God to give him the tenth of all that he ſhould give unto me the enſuing year. That which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned me to vow this Vow, was the reading, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. which fell out that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my ordinary courſe; where I obſerved that moſt of thoſe bleſſings, which <hi>Jacob</hi> mentions as his inducement to his Vow, God had given me. He had vouchſafed me his preſence, he had graciouſly preſerved and kept me from my Enemies, and the noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome peſtilence, he had given me bread and Raiment, I added <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy Subſtance, and with the firſt fruits of all thine encreaſe.</hi> I Conſidered alſo that what I gave to God ſhould be fruit abounding to my account. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 34, 35, 36.</p>
                     <p>I conſidered which way I ſhould give it to God, and I ſaw from, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 17. that what was given to the poor was given to God: Eſpecially what was given to the poor Saints and members of Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 35, 40. And as to the Suffering Miniſters of Chriſt. I determined to beſtow part of what I had dedicated to God, on them, and that though they were not brought to ſuch extremities, as not to know how to Subſiſt. I was moved thereunto by, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 10, 11, 14, 18.

Though God hath opened a Fountain for ſin and for uncleanneſs to waſh in, and I find my Soul exceedingly polluted, yet I am not able to ſtep into this Fountain that I may be healed.

O my Soul, the Lord ſeeth thy weakneſs, and that thou haſt been now a long time in this caſe, wait thou on God. Who can tell but that as the Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt did yearn towards the poor man, ſo may his Compaſſions be great towards thee, and he may heal thee alſo.

                                 <p>Having at ſeveral times found diverſe workings upon my heart as Convictions, and thereupon ſome pantings and breathings after God, but as yet nothing come to perfection, I thought of and found that I had cauſe to take up the complaint of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in another caſe, <hi>It is a day of trouble and rebuke, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are come to the Birth, and there is no ſtrength to bring forth.

Shall I cauſe to bring forth and ſhut the Womb, ſaith thy God?</hi> O my Soul wait thou on God, who will perfect his own work in thee.

                                    <hi>I have oftimes</hi> ſeen a Law in my Members warring againſt the Law of my mind, and leading me into Captivity to the Law of ſin and death.</p>
                                 <p>So powerful and mighty have been the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94116:43"/>
Actings of ſome inward corruptions, that I have not been able to overcome them, but have been hurried Captive by them. Hereby I come to ſee that truth, the heart of man is deſperately wicked, who can know it? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fathom the depth of iniquity which is in my heart. Hereupon I am made to cry out with St. <hi>Paul, O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of Death? O Lord be not thou far from me, but make haſt to help me, Let the ſighing of the Priſoner come before thee, proclaim liberty to thy Captive, and the opening of the Priſon door to him that is bound</hi> with the Chain of ſin. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1.</p>

                                    <hi>Mar.</hi> 26. 1654. I find that though in my judgment and Profeſſion I acknowledge Chriſt to be my Righteouſneſs and Peace, yet upon Examination I obſerve that my heart hath done quite another thing, and that ſecretly I have gone about to Eſtabliſh my own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and have derived my Comfort and Peace from my own Actings. For when I have been diſquieted by the Actings of my ſin, that which hath recovered me to my former Peace, hath not been (that I could find) God ſpeaking Peace through the blood of Chriſt, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the intermiſſion of temptation and the ceſſation of thoſe ſins; when I have been troubled at an evil frame of heart, I do not find that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt hath been my Conſolation, but that which hath relieved me, as far as I can find, was that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94116:43"/>
afterward I found my ſelf in a better temper. Having been in trouble and perplexity I have read the Scripture, gone to Prayer, and in doing theſe I have been relieved, yet I do not find that at ſuch times I had real, true, living Communion with God in ſuch duties, or that the Spirit of God did in thoſe duties reveal to me my intereſt in Chriſt, and ſo quiet my Conſcience. Hence I come to ſee what great need I have, and that it is of ſingular uſe to watch over my Soul in all its ways, both in reference to ſin, that I fall not into it, and when fallen, what the Carriage and Actings of my Soul are at ſuch a time; Whether I flee for relief to God in Chriſt, or to my own works: And in reference to my duties, to take heed leſt thoſe means which God hath appointed to be the conveyances of himſelf, his Son and Spirit, and all Spiritual bleſſings, ſhould prove to me a mean of Death and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from God, by my formal uſe of them and reſting in them. For as Satan keeps ſome alienated from God by the groſs pollutions of the world; So others from Chriſt by their Eſtabliſhing a Righteouſneſs of their own. O Lord, break thou this ſnare for me, and let my Soul eſcape as a bird from the Net, that I may flee to thee, and be at reſt.</p>
                                 <p>I have obſerved in my ſelf, that when God at any time is pleaſed to work any thing in my Soul, I ſoon loſe it; if he quicken me, I ſoon grow dead hearted again; if he enliven my
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94116:44"/>
affections, they ſoon grow cold and flat, and my old hardneſs returns upon me. Hence I come to ſee that it is infinite Wiſdom, and Goodneſs in God, that he hath not put the ſtock of grace into our own hands, but hath treaſured it up in Chriſt, that our life is now hid with Chriſt in God, for ſo it becomes ſure. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. hereby alſo I come to ſee that I have need of continual recourſe to Jeſus Chriſt, for new ſupplies of grace and ſtrength.</p>
                                 <p>The Lord God in his wiſdom, was pleaſed when he delivered his people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> before he brought them to <hi>Canaan,</hi> to lead them 40 years in the wilderneſs, when as he could have led them a nearer way to <hi>Canaan, Exod.</hi> 13. 17. He choſe rather to lead them through the great and terrible Wilderneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 6. where were fiery Serpents and Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, and drought, where there was no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where he brought them forth water out of the Rock of Flint, and fed them with Manna, for this end that he might humble them, prove them, and do them good in the latter end, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 15, 16. Doeſt thou find it ſo, O my Soul, in thy travail towards the Heavenly <hi>Canaan:</hi> Doeſt thou walk through much Spiritual drought, a land of deſerts, and of the ſhadow of death: Doſt meet with a flinty heart, and fiery temptations? Know that the Lord doth this to humble thee. (which through his grace thou haſt ſometimes found,) and to prove thee, <hi>i. e,</hi> to diſcover thee to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94116:44"/>
thy ſelf (for he himſelf knows thy thoughts afar off) and this way of God through grace hath been a means of diſcovering much of thy corrupt heart to thee) and that he may doe thee good in the latter end. Therefore take heed O my Soul of <hi>Iſrael's</hi> ſins, of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring againſt God, under thy wants, of unbeleif, and tempting God, &amp;c. Read oft and weight well the 78th <hi>Pſalm.</hi>

Henceforth I deſire to wait on thee, as for the teachings of thy Spirit, ſo for the writing of thy Law in my heart by thy Spirit. I found a lothneſs in my Spirit, to go to here this Sermon, whereby I perceive Satan would have hindred me. Be encouraged hence, O my Soul, to break through all difficulties thou meeteſt with in doing thy duty.

This day the Lord did, in the hear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of his word, revive ſome convictions which have formerly been upon my Spirit, though in a very languid manner. I ſtood convinced before the Lord of unbelief, and that I was a loſt creature becauſe thereof, from the words of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth not is Condemned already.</hi> Conſcience tells me that I am yet in unbelief, that I want that faith which is accompanied with the new birth <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12, 13. that faith which ſhould purge me from Atheiſm, formality, and reſting in duties, from hypocriſie and deadneſs, from unclean affections, and inordinate Love of the world, from a vain mind, and a light Spirit; that faith which ſhould purifie my heart, from theſe and the like evils, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. that faith which ſhould make Chriſt a greater Reality, and more precious to me than any thing in the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. that faith which brings peace with God, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, unſpeakable and full of Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8.

                                 <p>Lord lay this conviction upon my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for I find my heart would put it off, yea it hath already deſperately hardned it ſelf
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94116:45"/>
againſt thee. I fear I ſhall out-grow this Conviction of thy word, as at other times, I feel a careleſs Spirit, that would make light of Eternity, and of Jeſus Chriſt. Lord, break my heart under thy word for my unbelief, and neglect of Chriſt. Let me not heal my ſelf, but wait till thou ſhalt heal me.</p>
                                 <p>Thou didſt help the unbelief of thy Servant <hi>Thomas,</hi> Oh that thou wouldeſt help mine alſo.</p>
                                 <p>The Lord hath ſhewn me that I am dead in ſin not only from the teſtimony of his word, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13. but by inward experience. For I feel my ſelf alienated from the life of God, cut off from communion with the Lord Jeſus, ſeparate from God and his bleſſed Spirit. My deceitful heart hath often gone about to repel this conviction, and hath cauſed me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to miſtake, a life of morality for Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, and at other times a life of formality. But now I find the Scripture ſpeaks of dead works, and calls for repentance from them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. and purging our conſciences from them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. By dead works I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, not only the groſs pollutions of the World, but all works whatever, that are done by a man, void of the quickning Spirit of God. Without Union to Chriſt there is no Spiritual life, for as the natural life reſults from the Union of the Soul with the body, and the State of death, is nothing but the diſunion and Separation of the Soul from the body; ſo our ſpiritual life reſults from the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94116:46"/>
Souls Union with Chriſt, and ſpiritual death is our ſeparation from him. Now I feel my ſelf as a poor withered branch cut off from this Vine, unacquainted with the actings of this Spiritual life, as living by faith, Serving God in Spirit, Mortifying Sin by the Spirit, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Spirit, loving God above all things, and ſeeking his Glory in all things. I have ſometimes Prayed againſt ſin, reſolving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, ſtriven with it, avoided occaſions thereto (all which a natural man may do) but ſin hath returned upon me, and overcome me. How to fetch power from Chriſts death to mortifie ſin, how to believe in God for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing it, how to do it by the Spirit, theſe have been myſteries to me. Lord, When ſhall the day dawn, and the Day-Star ariſe in my heart? When ſhall the Day-ſpring from on high, viſit my Soul, to give light to him that ſits in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death? Come Lord Jeſus thou light of life, Come quickly.</p>
                                 <p>That which kept me a long time from reſolving to give up my whole heart to God in Covenant, was a fear that I ſhould break my Covenant and ſo double my ſin. But I perceive ſince that this was but Satans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to keep my heart from God, and the true ground of my not doing this was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſneſs of ſin, as Satan once made me believe, but a loathneſs to part with all ſin, and to ſerve God with all my heart.</p>
                                 <p>A Strong encouragement thou haſt O my

                                 <p>Since my Covenanting with God I come to ſee more fully the truth of that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> For I find a Loathneſs to walk cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with God, yea under a profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, my carnal heart hath been at enmity to the power and life of it, and this enmity hath lyen hid under, and been covered with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſome duties, which have not been deſtructive to that evil principle that hath lived in me. Yea, I find my carnal heart is hungring after the fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> after its old delights and ſinful pleaſures, is ready to murmur againſt God in the wilderneſs and ſpeaks of returning into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and being impatient of the croſs it revolts from God many a time, and ſeeks relief and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment from the creature.</p>
                                 <p>Since my Covenanting with God I ſee more of thee treachery and hypocriſie of my heart, I found my Soul for a while more tender of Sin, and my heart ſeemingly engaged to ſerve the Lord. but I ſoon forgot the covenant that I had made, and in a ſhort ſpace I did not find
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94116:47"/>
that my Covenanting had any influence on my heart or life. So that I ſee I did but flatter the Lord with my mouth, and lyed unto him with my tongue, for my heart was not right with him, neither was I ſtedfaſt in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78. 36, 37. My unſtedfaſtneſs in my Covenant with the Lord, did ariſe as far as I perceive from theſe two grounds, 1. My heart was not right with God when I made it, there was not that inward, cordial, full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to part with all Sin, and that for ever, from an antipathy to it, and diſlike of it, neither that inward reſolution of cleaving to God, to have him my All in All, to take all my contentment and joy in him, and to ſeek it in nothing elſe, which ſhould have been. 2. I neglected my watch, and did not (as I ſhould) renew my Covenant often, and engage my heart to walk with God, and while I was ſlothful, and negligent, my heart was ſtolen away by the Devil, and the World, and is now in league again with Sin. Lord, make me upright, and clear up to me my Sincerity, Search me and try me, and let me know the bottom of my heart. Keep me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my watch and guard, that I may keep my Covenant.</p>

ſentence of death, lying in my blood and pollution.

But I ſoon found an accurſed hard heart, in a little time I did not tremble at the wrath of God.

Having found much forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in my duties on the Sabbath, and ſeeing my ſelf loſt in them, I put the queſtion to my Soul, what if thou die this night? What is thy hope? How wilt thou appear before God? Righteouſneſs of thine own thou haſt none to truſt to, thou ſeeſt how thou ſinneſt every day, and how full of ſin thy beſt duties are. Upon this enquiry the good Spirit of God brought to my remembrance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>God hath made Chriſt Righteouſneſs to us,</hi> and <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6. <hi>This is the Name by which he ſhall be called.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94116:50"/>
Bed. And my Soul was much refreſhed with Mr. <hi>Simond</hi>'s Sermon.

To correct our deafneſs to his voice. 2. To put us upon more earneſt ſeeking of him. 3. To exerciſe and try our graces. God proportions mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies according to his delays, they are the greater when given in. <hi>Sarah</hi> tarried long for a Son, and then had an <hi>Iſaac.</hi> So did <hi>Hanna,</hi> but then had a <hi>Samuel.</hi> So <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> but then had a <hi>John,</hi> my heart rejoyced at this, hoping that God would give an high degree of brokenneſs of heart in his own due time, though at preſent my heart were hard. And I remembred how hard Mr. <hi>Bradfords</hi> heart was once as to his own ſenſe, and how eminent he was afterward for tenderneſs, as M. <hi>Fox</hi> Relates. God was very good this day. But Oh! how vile and ſinful was I! I felt a very proud vain-glorious heart both in hearing, and after Sermon was done. But the Lord chaſtiſed me for it. For at night when I Preached in the Chappel the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook me, I found no aſſiſtance of his Spirit, either in Prayer or Preaching, but was much confounded in both, having little or no ſenſe of the things I ſpake of, or prayed for.</p>
                                 <p>We read of <hi>Naaman</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 11. that he expected a Miraculous way of cure. <hi>I</hi>

At night when I walked in my Chamber, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what I had done, I was ſad, and ſaid to God, Lord I have Rebelled againſt thee.

                                    <hi>Sept.</hi> 28. In meditation I found the Lord drawing forth my heart to cloſe with Chriſt. I was convinced that God was willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his Son upon me, becauſe he did not only invite me <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. and Command me 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23. but even beſeech and entreat me to receive Chriſt. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.

Now whence is all this but from the Love and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God that he ſhould be thus willing to have me take his Son? Now who am I that I ſhould withſtand God? Why ſhould I forſake my own Mercies? Lord thou haſt ſhewn me that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94116:52"/>
my former revoltings ſhall not hinder this thy mercy, if I will acknowledge my ſin, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my ſelf, return unto thee and embrace thy Son. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 12, 13. O Lord, I thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept thy offer of Grace, I come unto thee, Oh give me thy Son; behold, I give thee my ſelf. Let me be Eſpouſed to the Lord Jeſus, I am willing through grace to take up my Croſs, to deny my ſelf, and to follow thee.</p>

Having ſet apart that day to ſeek the Lord, and to humble my Soul before him, I could not get my heart to be afflicted and mourn under ſin, but found much lightneſs in Prayer, the Lord hid his face, and did not come in to my poor Soul with his quickning preſence. So that I lay in a poor deſolate, forſaken condition under much confuſion, yet in the evening a little before going to bed, ſeeking the Lord again I was revived in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. eſpecially <hi>v.</hi> 17. I am poor and needy yet the Lord thinketh upon me, &amp;c. and next morning in reading <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 10. 18. <hi>Thou Lord haſt not forſaken them that ſeek thee; The needy ſhall not alway be forgotten, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the poor ſhall not periſh for ever.</hi> I was thereby encouraged ſtill to wait and hope. O Lord, I have ſought thee, withhold not thou thy tender Mercies from me. How long wilt thou hide thy face from me! O when wilt thou come unto me! Make haſt to help me O my God. I am poor and needy, O
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94116:52"/>
let me not be forgotten for ever, let not my expectation periſh for ever, and now O Lord, what is my expectation? It is even this, the giving in of mercy and grace through the Lord Jeſus, pardoning mercy and renewing grace. It is the pouring out of thy Spirit, the taking away the heart of Stone, and giving an heart of fleſh, it is an heart to know thee, to fear thee, to love thee, and obey thee, &amp;c.</p>

                                    <hi>Dec.</hi> 6. Being in trouble and diſtreſs of Spirit, becauſe the Lord hid his face, and withdrew himſelf from me, I went in the poverty of my Spirit to <hi>Trinity</hi> Lecture, and with ſome expectation to meet with God in his own Ordinance. The Lord was gracious to me, and ſpake Comfort to me from his Word. I ſee it is good to wait upon God, though he ſend the Rich empty away, yet he filleth the hungry with good things. My Soul was glad and rejoyced for a ſeaſon. But going into the Country the ſame day, among friends and variety of worldly Affairs, I loſt ſomething of the ſavour and reliſh which the good Word of God left upon me. And I found palpably my Soul reſting in thoſe Comforts which I had received, and growing ſecure and careleſs; from whence the Lord gave me this Inſtruction, That I am a poor ſilly wretch, knowing neither how to want nor how to abound, apt to murmur and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine in Straits, and to be lifted up and grow ſecure in Enlargements. O Lord! in every
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94116:53"/>
Condition I need thy grace to teach me how to behave my ſelf. O ſhew me thy way, and lead me therein for thy Name-ſake. Alſo the Lord taught me hence, that I ought to be patient under his hand when he hideth his Face, and to reſign up my will to his Will, inaſmuch as I do not know what is good for my ſelf. The Lord ſeeth I ſhould be worſe it may be, if I enjoyed more than I do, and therefore in wiſdom and mercy he keeps me in a low Condition.</p>
                                 <p>My confuſion ſometimes hath been ſo great, that I have been ſo unſetled, and at ſuch a loſs in my Soul that I knew not what to do; all former workings have been queſtioned and judged as nothing.

it might not prove ſome ſcandal to go; but conſidering alſo ſhe was a Member of Chriſt, and therefore I ought to Adminiſter to her Soul, I reſolved to commit the taking care of my Name to the Lord, and to do my duty.

                                 <p>This ſtroak coming ſoon after my removal from <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> I communed with my heart, whether I had ſinned in removing from that place, and my conſcience did not at that time charge me with ſin, in removing my habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I was Comforted in calling to mind Gods dealing with <hi>Jacob,</hi> who met with many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in thoſe removes, which he made at the command of God, He was purſued by his Uncle, put into great fear by his Brother, loſeth <hi>Deborah</hi> his Mothers nurſe, and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> his beloved Wife, His Sons <hi>Reuben, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> fell into foul ſins, &amp;c.

In my ſickneſs before the danger was probably paſt, in the night ſeaſon I had very clear and awful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the Majeſty of God, as though I

My Treatiſe of Family Inſtruction being finiſhed and Publiſhed, I reſolved after ſeveral times ſeeking God, and Conſulting with my own Soul, to ſet upon compoſing a Treatiſe of glorifying God. The grounds or reaſons inducing me hereunto were,</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. The Command given to all perſons in all Nations to declare the glory of God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 23, 24. I ſaw here I might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, yea it was my duty, to do what I could
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94116:66"/>
to ſet forth the glory of God: And ſeeing I was taken off from my publick Preaching, I might do it more beneficially by Writing and Printing.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. My Spirit hath been for ſeveral years put upon, and ſtirred up to write on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. I made a little beginning in the year 1664. but laid it aſide, and in times of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I have found a lothneſs to die till that work were done, and have met with many croſs Providences as if ſent with a tacit reproof for neglecting this work. Now the ſtirring up the Spirit to a good work is of God, and part of Gods call to the work. <hi>Exod.</hi> 36. 2. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Hagg.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. I was under many Engagements to glorifie God, as 1<hi>ſt.</hi> The many and great mercies I have received for my Soul, by the Teachings and Conſolations of his Spirit, and many outward mercies above my other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which are engagements to glorifie God. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 86. 12, 13. 2<hi>ly,</hi> The eminent deliverances I have had from ſickneſs, the Peſtilence and other troubles. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15. 3<hi>ly,</hi> The wonderful preſervation I have had from mine Enemies, notwithſtanding all the hazards I have run of falling into their hands, by Preaching the Goſpel at home and abroad, which ſhould engage me to extol and glorifie God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 1.</p>
                                 <p n="4">4. I did hope for benefit to my own Soul, both by being further enlightened into the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94116:67"/>

                  <p>Theſe are many of thoſe judicious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, which this holy perſon made, and thoſe ſpiritual experiences he found and recorded for his own uſe; that he might always have at hand before him the manner and method of Gods dealing with his Soul, the workings of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and grace, his lapſes and recoveries, his combates and victories over world, ſin and Satan, his perſeverance and progreſs in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the ſecret intercourſe between God and his ſoul, the withdrawings and Returns of the Holy Spirit, the faithfulneſs of Gods Covenant the truth of his word ſenſibly felt in his heart, food for his faith, encouragement to walk with God, with experimental inſtruction, how to comfort troubled Conſciences.

                  <p>We have hitherto ſeen ſomethings of his Conſcience of Sin and duty, his induſtry and zeal for the Service and glory of God, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates with the fleſh and Satan, his Love to Chriſt and his Church, his Spirituality in Religion, His longings and breathings after God, His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring God upon his bed, and meditating on him in the night watches, his wiſe improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Holy Scriptures, his due fulfilling of all Relations, his Holy manner of Living to God: From whence we may rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that ſurely he gave this diligence unto the full aſſurance of hope; that he taſted the Conſolation of God, and received the earneſt of Glory; that he walked upon the top of <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gah</hi> in the light of Gods countenance, and in the ſight of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> Which priviledge indeed the God of peace and comfort
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94116:70"/>
did not deny him. He was a man as of much grace, ſo of much peace; an inſtance of that word, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 165. <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law.</hi> He received the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is of God, and knew the things that were freely given to him of God and rejoyced therein, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                  <p>As to his Converſion (which to ſome that have lived long in ignorance, ſecurity, ſenſuality, prophaneſs, and forgetfulneſs of God, is very Senſible) He being from tender years reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and well inclined, It was not ſo remarkable to him. The moſt diſcernible part thereof was when he was a young Scollar in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Nor did he then experience very notable work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit of bondage. Which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ſome trouble to his mind, and he feared his humiliation was not deep enough; but he received full ſatisfaction from a paſſage in a ſermon which he heard preached by that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Excellent Servant of Jeſus Chriſt Mr. <hi>Richard Vines,</hi> then Maſter of <hi>Pembrooke Hall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hath ſometimes ſaid to his Friend that he was not much acquainted with thoſe raviſhing joys which ſome have felt, but yet had that comfort and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, which gave him ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>His method and manner was to derive his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance and comfort from the written word. Of the truth whereof he would ſay he had ſuch a full perſuaſion, as being the ſure word of God, that he did more firmly believe it, than if an
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94116:70"/>
Angel ſhould ſpeak to him from Heaven, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. He could not ſatisfie himſelf with the expectation, or apprehenſion of the immediate, ſole teſtimony of the Spirit, without the word. But would compare himſelf with the word, frequently practiſing the duty of ſelf examination, Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thoſe graces, diſpoſitions and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his heart, which are promiſed in the word, and to which the promiſes are made. Which the Spirit of God enlightned him to diſcern, and enabled him in a way of argumentation to infer thence his intereſt in Chriſt, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God for his ſatisfaction and Spiritual Conſolation. And the Aſſurance which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this method, and by theſe means he thus Recordeth.</p>

                  <p>Thus have we given the Reader ſome account of this Eminent Saint and Servant of Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch was his holy and heavenly life; Thus walked he both in the fear of God, and in the Comfort of the Holy Ghoſt: Thus la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured he to approve himſelf to God, to others and to his own Conſcience: Thus anſwered he his profeſſion, ran his race, and preſſed forward to the mark. Upon the equal and impartial view whereof, though the deſign of theſe pages be only <hi>Oſtendere,</hi> and not <hi>Oſtentare virum,</hi> yet I can ſcarce forbear to ſay, He hath left ſuch a Name and character behind him as may worthily commend him, both as a Chriſtian and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94116:80"/>
a Miniſter to the obſervation, Honour and Imitation of moſt, if not All that read him.</p>
                  <p>What remains is only to apply him to the following funeral Text as a more than ordinary Inſtance of the truth thereof. And whoſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the manner of his life may with little doubt conclude his Victory over death, It was before mentioned that he hath left behind him ſome Manuſcripts worthy of the preſs: ſome of which he entitles, The beſt Intereſt; A Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Glorifying God: The cure of the fear of Death. All which he well underſtood, not only by Speculation but by Experience. He who had gained the beſt Intereſt, and could upon good ground ſay, <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his;</hi> He who aimed at the beſt End and induſtriouſly purſued it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Glory of God, was doubtleſs ſo fortified with the grace, Conſolation and Covenant of God, as to triumph over the King of Terrors. Having the teſtimony of his Conſcience that in Integrity and Sincerity of heart he had fulfilled his general and particular calling, and ſerved his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the will of God, and having the aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Gods Holy Word, for his reward in a better World, It was no difficulty to him to die. He was ſo far above the fear of Death, that he ſeemed altogether unconcerned at it, as to the terror of it or danger after it, both in ſickneſs and in health. In his perfect health, Conſidering the evil of the day he lived in, he would often ſay, <hi>It is a good time to die. I am content to live,</hi>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:94116:81"/>
                     <hi>and willing to die. To me to live is Chriſt; I have no other deſign of life then to ſerve Chriſt.</hi> He breathed out with <hi>Greg: Turon. Domine, ſiad huc Populo tuo ſim neceſſarius, fiat Voluntas tua. Deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro quietem, non recuſo laborem. If God hath further Service for me to do. I am content to live, elſe I rather chooſe to die.</hi> Such clear apprehenſions he had of the Glory of Heaven, and ſuch full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of hope thereof, that, as he expreſſed himſelf to his Friend, he looked upon all that this world can afford as droſs and dung compared with it.</p>
                  <p>As death was not terrible ſo neither was it unexpected to him. He preſaged it long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came. He told his Friend, converſing with him more than a year before he died, that he had apprehenſions that he ſhould not long live; and that for ſome time paſt, God had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined his heart to ſtudy how a Chriſtian might get above the fear of death: And what he found to be his ſtrength and Conſolation againſt that laſt enemy, he had digeſted into method, and for his own and others uſe Committed it to writing, and had almoſt finiſhed it, and did then lay an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon his friend in caſe he did Survive him to perform the laſt office for him, and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him for his Subject 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 57. as the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his affectionate and hearty thankſgiving unto God who gave him the Victory over the fear of Death, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
                  <p>This was no vain preſage; though yet he had a Strong conſtitution of body, which he had uſed with all temporance and Sobriety, and was then
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94116:81"/>
in his full ſtrength, and the maturity of his age, Scarce declining from his ſtate of Conſiſtency. His natural temper did ſomewhat incline him to feaveriſh diſeaſes.

This Viſitation of God (as all former) he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with all Patience and Submiſſion, Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf on the care, and reſigning himſelf up to the will of his Heavenly Father. His diſeaſe encreaſing and ſtrength declining, he told ſome about him, that he had ſome appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions he ſhould, and deſires alſo if God pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to have died a Martyr, but now he thought he ſhould not. Adding withal, God is wiſer than I, and knoweth my weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>Diſcharging his dying office by grave exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and encouragement to Serious Religion and Suffering for it, which he eſpecially applied to his only Child; Owning and profeſſing his Nonconformity to the laſt, as judging himſelf obliged thereto in Conſcience towards God; Bleſſing God for his invaluable Gift of Jeſus Chriſt to the children of men; Bleſſing God who had called him to the honourable employment of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and had enabled him to be faithful therein, and encouraged him with his preſence and bleſſing under all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties thereof; Bleſſing God who had lifted him up above the fear of Death; Rejoycing in the peace and teſtimony of a good Conſcience and hope of the Glory of God, after 10 or 11 days conflict with his diſeaſe (which after ſome
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:94116:82"/>
hope of recovery very ſuddenly and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſeiſed his head,) He quietly ſlept in the Lord, <hi>Sept.</hi> 10. 1680. in the one and fiftieth year of his age.</p>
                  <p>This being the bleſſed exit of this Eminent Saint, methinks I hear him ſay to thoſe he left behind, as his dying Saviour to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Weep not for me, I have died in peace, am entred into peace, am at reſt in my bed, have paſſed through <hi>Jordan</hi> and am come to <hi>Canaan.</hi> I am beyond ſin, and ſorrow, and trouble and labour, am come to the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to an innumerable company of Angels, and the ſpirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, to that Eternal Sabbath that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the people of God. Weep not for me.</p>
                  <p>And doth he not alſo add, weep for your ſelves? You ſhall ſee my face no more, you ſhall enjoy communion with me no more, you ſhall hear my voice no more, I ſhall deſpenſe the Goſpel to you no more. Ye ſhall come to me but I ſhall return to you no more. O what is the meaning of this dark providence, that in ſuch a day as this, God ſhould call from his work one ſo fully inſtructed, ſo willingly zealous to ſerve him and his Church in the Goſpel of his Son. Whether God hath done this in his juſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for the unprofitableneſs, unthankfulneſs, and itching ears of thoſe that enjoyed ſo precious a bleſſing: Or whether to warn us of ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94116:82"/>
dreadful judgment from which he hath hid this and other his holy Servants in their graves: or whether both; it concerns us ſeriouſly to conſider, and upon either account he may ſay to us, Weep for your ſelves.</p>

                  <p>SO ſoon as Sin entred into the world, Death the King of terrors, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Armed, began its Reign; and hath Reigned not only from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> over the race of Mankind, but even to this day.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94116:85"/>
And as a Mercileſs, Cruel, inſatiable Tyrant affrights the world, making horrible Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not at the rate of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> who ſlew their Thouſands and their ten Thouſands; but Death ſlayeth Univerſally beyond number, from the Infant to the Aged, from the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil to the Throne; ſparing neither Age nor Sex, neither baſe nor Honourable, neither great nor ſmall, neither Sacred nor Prophane.</p>
                  <p>The Cry of this miſery of man being very loud reached up to Heaven, and entred into the Ears of God that made him: who heard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and pitied; and in infinite mercy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and Commiſſioned his own, and Only Son the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be a <hi>Prince of Life,</hi> and <hi>Captain of Salvation</hi> to miſerable men, to Redeem a remnant from the Terror, Power, and Tyranny of this All-devouring, All-deſtroying Enemy. The Son of God readily accepts this honourable Office, and accordingly cometh down from Heaven, and becometh Incarnate among the Sons of men to diſcharge it. And <hi>girding his Sword upon his thigh in his Majeſty he rode proſperouſly, and his right hand taught him terrible things.</hi> Having firſt trampled under his feet the forlorn hope of the Enemy, Poverty, Hunger, Thirſt, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Wearineſs, Griefs, Perſecutions, Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Buffetings, Scourging, and acuteſt Pains; he forthwith enters into the very Region of Death, the Land of Darkneſs Encounters, Diſarmeth, Overcometh, and Deſtroyeth the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94116:85"/>
King of Terrors in his own Territory, the Grave; leading Captivity Captive; and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing in a powerful and glorious Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The vertue and benefit of which Victory he Communicates to all his followers, the noble Army of Conflicting Saints liſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his exalted Banner. In token whereof <hi>the Graves were opened, and many bodies of Saints which ſlept aroſe, and came out of their Graves after his Reſurrection.</hi> Mat. 27. 52, 53.</p>
                  <p>This glorious Conqueſt is the Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Argument throughout this Chapter.

In the Faith and Contemplation whereof he cannot contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but breaketh forth into this triumphant <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>But thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In which laſt words (the Subject to be diſcourſed on) there are four things obſervable; The <hi>Enemy,</hi> The <hi>Victory,</hi> The <hi>Victors,</hi> and the <hi>Triumph.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Victory over this Enemy, that is, The deſtruction of Death as to its terror and power.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Victors, who are Chriſt firſt, and with him all that are Chriſt's. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>Every</hi> of whom <hi>ſhall be made alive in his own order, Chriſt firſt, afterward they that are Chriſts.</hi> All that Harveſt whereof Chriſt is the Firſt-fruits. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.</p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Repreſent to you the Enemy over which the Victory is gotten, <hi>viz.</hi> Death. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral death, for as is the Reſurrection ſuch muſt be the Death.

                     <p n="1">1. It is a ſpoiling Enemy. That deveſts a man of all his wordly Enjoyments, Houſes and Lands, Gold and Silver, the fruits of the Earth, the encreaſe of Corn and Wine, the pleaſures of the fleſh, ſenſual delights, the light of the Sun, Society with men, Converſation with friends, the Comfort of Relations, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Wife, Father, Mother, Sons and Daughters, Brethren and Siſters, How ſweet, near and dear are theſe to the Living? But when Death cometh it ſpoils him of all, and puts an utter, and everlaſting end to his uſe and enjoyment of them, and turneth him naked out of the world. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 16, 17. <hi>Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the Glory of his houſe is encreaſed. For when he dieth he ſhall carry nothing away: his glory ſhall not deſcend after him,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>They ſhall never ſee light.</hi> Which our Saviour exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in a Parable <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 16. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. The rich mans ground brought forth plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, till he ſaid to his Soul, <hi>Soul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years, take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry.</hi> But the ſad tidings of Death are next brought him, <hi>This night ſhall thy Soul be required.</hi> And what is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94116:87"/>
the Conſequence? <hi>Whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt provided?</hi> Not thine, be ſure. All thy intereſt in them is loſt for ever. It was <hi>Hezekia</hi>'s Lamentation when it was told him. that he ſhould die, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 11. <hi>I ſhall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</hi> And as Death ſpoils a man of all his poſſeſſions, ſo alſo of his projects before him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 146. 4. <hi>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his Earth; in that very day his thoughts periſh:</hi> And of all his hopes too. <hi>Job.</hi> 27. 8. <hi>What is the hope of the hyprocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul?</hi> Death is a ſpoiling Enemy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is a Surpriſing enemy. It cometh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man as a thief in the night, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 2. when he little dreameth of it, and taketh him as a ſnare, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>Man knoweth not his time—As the birds are caught in the ſnare; ſo are the Sons of men ſnared</hi> by death <hi>in an evil time when it falleth ſuddenly upon them.</hi> Every one may ſay as <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 27. 2. <hi>I know not the day of my death. At an hour when ye think not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt <hi>the Son of man cometh, Luk.</hi> 12. 40.

If a man were Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed and ſpoiled of all that he had without him, and ſhould yet eſcape with his life, though naked, it were a ſore evil, yet ſuch as might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; a great loſs, but ſuch as might be repaired.

                     <p n="4">4. It is a certain, unavoidable Enemy. There is no defence to be made againſt it, no humane power can withſtand it, no fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body by utmoſt art can prevent its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance; either by ſome violent ſtorming, or Succeſſive batteries, or longer ſeige it wil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt the Stouteſt defendants. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 48. <hi>What man is he that liveth and ſhall not ſee death? ſhall he deliver his Soul from the hand of the grave?</hi> The young, the ſtrong, the healthful, the wiſe, the rich, the honourable; All have fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and ſhall fall under the power of this irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemy.

                     <p n="5">5. It is an abhorred Enemy.

At this</hi> the King <hi>(Belſhazzars)</hi> Countenance was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and his thoughts troubled him, ſo that the joynts of his loins were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another, Dan. <hi>5. 6. And who that is but a natural man, doth not experience trembl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aſtoniſhment at the approach and ſight of Death? yea many times at the very thoughts. of it? The world of men doth generally bear witneſs to that which is written,</hi> Heb. <hi>2. 15.</hi> that through fear of Death, they are all their life time Subject to bondage.</p>
                     <p>There are two things, (both in the context) which make Death ſo terrible. 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Sin, which the Apoſtle calleth the <hi>Sting of Death.</hi> It was by ſin that death entred in the world, and it is by Sin that death reigneth in the world. The poiſon of the Serpent is in his ſting, and the power of the Serpent is in his ſting. So the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Death is in ſin, and the power of Death lieth in ſin; without which though it killeth it cannot hurt. This is the only weapon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Death is Armed againſt the Children of men, but it is a deadly one. That is a dreadful threatning indeed which our Saviour denounceth againſt the Jews, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>Ye ſhall die in your ſins.</hi> According to what the Lord had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken by his Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>In his treſpaſs that he hath treſpaſſed, and in the ſin that he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he die.</hi> It is our ſad caſe that we are born in ſin, and worſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94116:89"/>
that we live in ſin, but Oh! how dreadful and miſerable to die in ſin, in a ſtate of ſin, in the guilt of ſin, under the reign and power of ſin, in the arms and embraces of ſin.</p>
                     <p>Sin being the tranſgreſſion of a righteous Law, the violation of infinite Holineſs and Juſtice, and rebellion againſt Divine Majeſty and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it always hath demerit and guilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent upon it, which obligeth and bindeth the ſinner to undergoe that puniſhment which is naturally due to it. Which pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment is Death, <hi>Rom</hi> 1. 32.—<hi>they which Commit ſuch things are worthy of death.</hi> Thus ſin becomes the weapon or ſting of Death, by which it hath power to deſtroy. Death cometh upon the Sinner as a bailiff or Sergeant from the Judge with warrant to apprehend and bring the Sinner to give account; or as an executioner to take vengeance, to pay the Sinner the juſt wages of his ſin, for the reparation of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Law, for the ſatisfaction of offended Juſtice, for the Declaration of Divine hatred, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt ſin, and for the manifeſtation of Gods Glorious power and wrath againſt the guilty. And what a terror muſt Death needs be when it appears in this ſhape, and armed with this ſting! Know O preſumptuous and ſecure Sinner; Though wickedneſs be now ſweet in thy mouth and thou hideſt it under thy tongue: Though thou ſwalloweſt down de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly thy forbidden morſells of ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and worldly gain, yet this meat will ſoon
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94116:90"/>
be turned in thy bowels, and become the gall of aſps within thee. At laſt, at death, it will bite as a ſerpent, and ſting like an adder. What horrour will fill thy ſoul when approaching Death ſhall awaken thy ſleepy Conſcience, as oft times it doth, and thy awakened Conſcience ſhall charge thee with thy inexcuſable tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a Righteous Law, thy groſs neglect of Commanded duty, thy induſterious provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſatisfie the fleſh, thy ready compliance with the call of temptations, thy irreparable loſs of precious time. Thy hypocritical deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God in Covenant, the Stopping of thine eares at the voice of Conſcience, the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of thine eyes againſt the light of Scripture, the hardening of thy heart againſt the motions of the Spirit, thy unbelieving refuſals of an offered Saviour, thy unprofitable miſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of means of Grace, thy unthankful abuſe of the mercies of God, and obſtinate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibleneſs under his Judgments, with many other inſtances of multiplyed and aggravated ſins through a long life. Whence will ariſe diſmal apprehenſions of the wrath of an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, a certain fearful expectation of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, and a pre-occupation of eternal torments and everlaſting burnings. This is that ſting of Death, the weapon wherewith it is armed againſt thee, wherein Conſiſts its power, and by which it is ſo terrible.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Add to this the ſtrength which this ſting hath from the Law. For ſaith the Apoſtle.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94116:90"/>
                        <hi>The ſtrength of ſin is the Law,</hi> and that two ways. 1<hi>ſt.</hi> As the Law diſcovers and convinceth of ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>Sin is not imputed where there is no Law.</hi> Men are not prone to charge themſelves with ſin, where there is no Law, therefore, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>the Law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions,</hi> that is, to make tranſgreſſions appear. Hence we read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>By the Law is the knowledge of ſin,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9, 13. <hi>I was alive without the Law once,</hi> in my own opinion, <hi>but when the Commandment came, Sin revived and I died</hi> I was convinced I was in a ſtate of Sin and death. and <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Sin by the Commandement becomes exceeding ſinful.</hi> Thus ſin as the ſting of Death is ſtrengthned by the Law, while men thereby are more cleerly and fully convinced of it, and the greater the conviction is, the ſharper is the ſting. 2<hi>ly.</hi> As the Law Curſeth and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſinner. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are written in the book of the Law to do them.</hi> hence as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>When the Commandment Came. I died.</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. The Law is called <hi>the Miniſtration of death.</hi> The Law binds the ſinner over to the Judgment of the great day. It holds him faſt under his guilt without hope of pardon, paſſeth ſentence of Condemnation upon him, and begins the execution by wounding the Spirit, terrifying the Soul with pre-apprehenſions and foretaſts of the wrath to come.</p>

The ſum of the terror of Death, is this. Approaching death awakeneth the ſecure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; Awakened Conſcience charged with the guilt of ſin; This ſin is ſtrengthened with a Convincing curſing Law; The dying wretch ſeeth his day of ſenſual delights and pleaſures, his day of worldly gains and purchaſes, his day of Carnal fellowſhip with men, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his day of Grace and mercy with God, paſſing away; finds his Spirit fainting, his heart and fleſh failing, anguiſh and pangs taking hold of him, and his ſoul forthwith to be Requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Apprehended, Arreſted, Summoned and haled out of his body, from all freinds, means helps and hopes, to appear naked before God the Judge of all men, to give an account of a ſinful life, and to receive a righteous doom, <hi>viz.</hi> Depart from me ye Curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels and; then to go away into everlaſting puniſhment.

                     <p n="1">1. Death is diſarmed to believers, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſting them. When death cometh it finds no ſin in them unpardoned, no guilt remaining as an obligation unto puniſhment. He is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come whoſe armour is taken from him wherein he truſted, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 22. Thus it is with Death. Where Sin hath no dominion, Death hath none; for Death reigneth by Sin. Now as for the ſins of believers, God (to whom belongeth the forgiveneſs of ſins) ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 22. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick cloud, thy tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as a cloud, thy ſins. Jer.</hi> 31. 34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſin no more. Numb.</hi> 23. 21. <hi>He hath not beheld iniquity in</hi> Jacob, <hi>neither hath he ſeen perverſneſs in</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 18, 19. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee? that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage?

This indeed is in effect the whole victory over death. This is the fatal mortal wound given to Death, and will in time be the very Death of Death; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94116:92"/>
the Apoſtle triumpheth over it on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>verſ.</hi> 55. <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting?</hi> What <hi>Luther</hi> ſometimes ſaid to God, that may every Believer ſay to Death, <hi>Feri Domine,</hi> ſaid he; Strike Lord. <hi>Feri, mors, feri,</hi> may they ſay, <hi>Nam a peccatis abſolutus ſum.</hi> Strike, Death, ſtrike, for my ſins are pardoned. Thou mayeſt kill me, but thou canſt not hurt me.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Death is overcome to Believers in that it cannot amaze them with deſpairing terrors. However it be to others, it is not to them the King of Terrors. Believers are freed from the bondage of the tormenting fear of Death. <hi>Heb.</hi>

                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is a Natural fear of death, as it is the diſſolution of the <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Soul and Body which are ſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately united, which is not ſinful. Believers are not free from this. Grace doth not deſtroy Nature. Nature will be Nature, and act its part even in the beſt of Saints. They who have the ſureſt hope of Eternal life, and cleareſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94116:93"/>
Evidences of their Salvation, yea, and have an unfained longing and deſire after the Heavenly ſtate, have yet a natural averſneſs unto Death, and do rather endure than deſire it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith for himſelf and other Believers, that though they knew, that if their Earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, they had a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, an houſe not made with hands eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the Heavens; and groaned earneſtly, deſiring to be clothed upon with their houſe which is from Heaven; yet they had a natural Love of life, and abhorrence of death, and their groaning was not that they would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothed. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 4. yea, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf in whom was no ſin, being found in faſhion as a man, when he humbled himſelf and became obedient unto death, experienced this fear as the proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his humane Nature. When his hour was come <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 33, 34. <hi>He taketh with him</hi> Peter, <hi>and</hi> James, <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>and began to be ſore amazed, and to be very heavy, and ſaith, my Soul is exceeding ſorrowful unto death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a ſlaviſh, inordinate, ſinful fear of death, which Believers overcome, and from which they are freed. It was one end of Chriſts death, that he might deliver his redeemed from fear of death, to which they were holden in bondage. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. To which yet ſome Believers are ſubject, yea, it may be All at ſometimes, more or leſs. This ariſeth from weakneſs of Faith, from want of aſſurance, from
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94116:94"/>
Conſcience of lapſes and contracted guilt, from neglecting to ſearch their own hearts, from miſapprehending and miſ-judging their Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtate, from inordinate love to this life, and world, &amp;c. for which they muſt blame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Believers as ſuch, ſo far as they are Believers, are victorious. Did they walk cloſe with God, improve grace received, examine their own ſtate wiſely, and judge thereof rightly; Did they take hold of the Covenant of God, live by Faith, meditate on the Promiſes, and apply them as their Portion, (which becometh Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers) they might and would get above the ſlaviſh fears of Death. In this method they might be ready to die, and fear no evil. When the Chriſtian can ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 23. <hi>The Lord is my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; he maketh me to lie down in green paſtures; he leadeth me beſides the ſtill waters, he reſtoreth my Soul, he leadeth me in the paths of righteouſneſs;</hi> He will then add alſo, <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death I will fear no evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is a deſpairing fear; The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions of Hell, the pre-occupation of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the fore-taſts of the wrath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, the ſcorchings of the Lake that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with fire and Brimſtone, that driveth the ſinner paſt all hope, and overwhelms the Soul in hideous darkneſs, and horrible Confuſions. Have there not been inſtances of ſome wretched guilty Souls going out of the body as the Devil out of the Demoniack <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. renting, and taring, and wallowing, and foming, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94116:94"/>
and roaring again. And were it not for the Atheiſm, ignorance, infidelity, blindneſs, hardneſs, ſearedneſs, flattery, and deluſions that are in the hearts of ſinners, ſuch inſtances would not be rare; but it would be a wonder how any ſinner could die in his ſin, and in his wits too, from ſuch a fear as this Believers are delivered. Though they may and do experience ſome meaſure of fears, yet God doth always ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with ſome degree of hope, that they let not go all their hold of the Covenant of God. In a word, Believers are ſo far victorious over the fear of death, that if they underſtand their caſe aright they have no cauſe to be afraid of death, &amp; when they are, they are more afraid than hurt. The <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> having loſt its ſting, may threaten with its humming noiſe, but cannot prick the fleſh: ſo death, where ſin is pardoned, which is itsſting, may afright with its horrid aſpect, but cannot hurt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Death is overcome to Believers in that it cannot hold them by its power. It is indeed the unalterable Law of Heaven that all muſt die: And accordingly <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the Patriarchs; <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and all the Prophets; <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and all the Apoſtles; yea, all the Saints from <hi>Adam</hi> to this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are fallen aſleep, and ſhut up in their Graves. But ſhall the Grave always contain them? Are they there kept in an everlaſting Priſon under locks, and bars that cannot be opened? Did making the Sepulchre ſure, Sealing the ſtone,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94116:95"/>
and ſetting a Watch forbid Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection? No, ſurely. <hi>I went down</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jonah,</hi> a Type of the Reſurrection.) <hi>to the bottoms of the Mountains the Earth with her bars was about me for ever; yet haſt thou brought up my life from corruption, O Lord my God.</hi> Jon. 2. 6. <hi>And though after my skin worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God: whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and mine eyes ſhall behold, and not another, though my reins be conſumed within me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job. ch.</hi> 19. 26, 27. Though the Saints be deſcended to the depths of the ſea, and hid in the bowels of the Earth, and their bodies reſolved into the fartheſt duſt, and that duſt diſperſed to the four Winds, yet ſhall they be recovered and riſe again. The Sea ſhall not contain the dead that are in it, nor the Graves the dead that are in them. Their ſcattered atoms ſhall be recollected and reared up again to a goodly body. Behold, there ſhall be a ſhaking, and their dry bones ſhall come together, bone to his bone, and lo, the ſinews and the fleſh ſhall come up upon them, and the skin ſhall cover them above; And thus ſhall the Lord God ſay, Come from the four Winds, O breath, and breath upon theſe ſlain that they may live; and the breath ſhall come into them, and they ſhall live, and ſtand up upon their feet. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 7, 8, 10. This is it which the Apoſtle aſſerts here throughout the Chapter, concluding that <hi>then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is written, Death is ſwallowed up in victory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:94116:95"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But what more victory is this, than what unbelievers ſhall have, for they alſo ſhall riſe again?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, it is more beyond all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28, 29. <hi>All that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth, they that have done good unto the Reſurrection of life; and they that have done evil to the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of damnation.</hi> The wicked ſhall riſe, but from death Temporal to death Eternal, to die the ſecond death. This is Death's Victory over them. The Godly ſhall riſe from Death temporal to Life eternal, to die no more. This is the Saints Victory over Death.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Death is ſo overcome to Believers as to be made ſerviceable, and advantageous to them. And this is the fulneſs, and perfection of Victory, when the Enemy is brought in Subjection to ſerve the Conquerour. The Apoſtle in this Epiſtle reckons Death to be part of the Saints Inventory. <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 21, 22. <hi>All things are yours, whether</hi> Paul <hi>or</hi> Apollos—<hi>or Life, or Death.</hi> And elſewhere he calleth it gain, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>to die is gain.</hi> What gain? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.

It is no light bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of works that is upon a Chriſtians hand; no ſmall labour to diſcharge the duties of his general and particular Calling. What ſaith the Scripture?

Luk.</hi> 23. 43. St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſires to depart that

he might be with Chriſt which is far better. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. 2<hi>ly.</hi> As for the body, Death ſerves to refine it, for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50. <hi>This I ſay, that Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God: neither doth corruption inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit incorruption.</hi> Theſe bodies which we now carry are ſo groſs and corruptible, they are not meet for an heavenly ſtate. They die that they may be changed. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. They are ſown in corruption to be raiſed in incorruption; ſown in diſhonour to be raiſed in Glory; ſown in weakneſs, to be raiſed in power; ſown Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bodies, to be raiſed Spiritual. The old decayed houſe is taken down to be built anew; and theſe weak craſie bodies are laid in the Earth to riſe afreſh. This corruptible is corrupted, that it may put on incorruption, and this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal dieth that it may put on Immortality. Thus is this Enemy overcome, and made to ſerve as a mean and advantage to the Believers happineſs.</p>
                     <p>This indeed is a glorious Victory over a very mighty, and formidable Enemy: So great and wonderful, that it far exceeds the hope of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Fleſh and Blood cannot believe the report thereof. <hi>Paul</hi>'s diſcourſe of the Reſurrection from the dead ſeemed no other than babling to the Learned Philoſophers at <hi>Athens. Act.</hi> 17. 18. And was thought incredible by <hi>Feſtus,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and the Captains, and Principal men of <hi>Caeſarea. Act.</hi> 26. 8. Yea, the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſeemed as an idle Tale at firſt to the very Apoſtles. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 11. and they believed it not.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94116:97"/>
So great is the Glory of this victory over Death, that even Angels come down from Heaven to make report of it, and to Celebrate the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. Tell no more then of the mighty Acts of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> or <hi>Chedor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laomer,</hi> of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> or <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> or of all the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> or the reſt of thoſe great Names that have filled the world with their Fame, who have ſubdued Kingdoms, and led Nations Captive, and made many glorious Triumphs. Yea, let no mention be made of the Victories of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> or <hi>Baruk,</hi> or <hi>Gideon,</hi> or <hi>Jephtha,</hi> or <hi>Samſon,</hi> or <hi>Saul,</hi> or <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> or of all his worthies, who have Victoriouſly fought the Battles of the Lord againſt the Arms of fleſh, and whoſe Sword re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned not empty from the blood of the ſlain. Behold, the greater Glory of this Victory in the Text, which darkneth the luſtre of all their Triumphs. Their Acts were <hi>mira,</hi> but this <hi>miraculum.</hi> Their Victories were wonders, but this a Miracle. The Gates of Hell, the power of Darkneſs, the King of Terrors (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom all theſe Triumphing Victors at laſt fell) fallen at the feet of the Saints.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. This Victory becomes the Believers by participation and communion with him.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt diſarms Death by his Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. The ſting of Death is ſin, ſaith the context, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law, Sin being the Tranſgreſſion of a Righteous Law hath in it a fundamentall demerit and natural obligation to puniſhment, which is moreover Confirmed by the Laws threatning, Thou ſhalt die the Death. This is the ſting of Death wherewith it is armed; from the poyſon, power, and pain whereof none can be delivered, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the obligation be voided by making ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. This being impoſſible to meer man, Jeſus Chriſt undertook it. To which purpoſe our ſins were tranſlated on him by imputation <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. <hi>All we like Sheep have gone aſtray, we have turned every on to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</hi> He was made a Prieſt that he might offer Sacrifice to expiate this guilt and to Satisfie the Law. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4, 5, 6. <hi>And no man taketh this honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God as was</hi> Aaron. <hi>So alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf to be made an high Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> and again. <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever,</hi> &amp;c. The Sacrifice to be offered up by this Prieſt for this purpoſe muſt be an humane Soul and body; for the Subjection of mans Soul and body, to the curſe of the Law was the puniſhment
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94116:98"/>
which the Law exacted for mans ſin, and wherewith only it would be ſatisfied. This Soul and body did Chriſt aſſume. <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>The word was made fleſh. Hebs.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>When he cometh into the World he ſaieth. Sacrifice and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me.</hi> For the Sanctification of this Sacrifice to be offered up to God, there muſt be an Altar. <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 19. <hi>The Altar Sanctifieth the gift</hi> which Altar was his divine nature. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>Througth the eternal Spirit he offered himſelf.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 19. <hi>I ſanctifie my ſelf.</hi> I, as God, ſanctifie my ſelf as man. And being thus inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he actually offered up himſelf to God <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Chriſt hath given himſelf for us an offering and a ſacrifice to God. He humbled himſelf and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the croſs. Phil.</hi> 2. 8. and ſo was made a Curſe for us, as it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree. Gal.</hi> 3. 13. By this did Chriſt ſatisfie the Law, expiate guilt, cancelled the hand writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the obligation to puniſhment, appeaſed the wrath of God and obtained remiſſion of ſins. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. Thus did he finiſh tranſgreſſion, &amp; make an end of ſins, thus he made reconciliation for ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, &amp; brought in Everlaſting Righteouſneſs. Thus he diſarmed death by making ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He deſtroyeth Death by his reſurrection. By his ſatisfaction he took away the power and efficacy of Death, but by his reſurrection he deſtroyed the very Being of death, actually as to himſelf, virtually as to believers. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94116:99"/>
9. <hi>Chriſt being raiſed from the dead dieth no more, Death hath no more dominion over him,</hi> and v. 10. <hi>For in that he died, he died unto ſin once. Ad delendum peccatum, ut ſemel in nihilum redigat peccatum in nobis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> he died once for all utterly to blot out ſin in us <hi>but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God, Apud Deum</hi> or <hi>ſecundum Deum, vita caeleſti et immortali,</hi> a life worthy of God, an heavenly and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life. We read <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 44. concerning <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that he that was dead came forth. There the power of Death was ſuſpended at preſent that it could not hold him, but the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Death remained, for he roſe to die again, and therefore he came forth bound hand and foot, with Grave-Clothes, and his face was bound about with a Napkin. But when Chriſt roſe, both the Power and the Being of Death ceaſed as to him, and therefore he left his Grave-Clothes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and carryed nothing belonging to Death with him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 6. 7. The riſing body of Chriſt was not only not dead, but not mortal. His body roſe a glorious body, a ſpiritual body, an heavenly body. Not only Death but mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſwallowed up by the reſurrection of Chriſt. And as by the reſurrection of Chriſt the Being of Death was deſtroyed actually as to himſelf; ſo vertually to believers, for even as to them he hath aboliſhed Death, and brought life and immortality to light. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. Saith Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore,</hi>

Amen, <hi>and have the keyes of Hell and Death.</hi> The keyes are the Enſign of power. Chriſt by his reſurrection hath obtained authority over Death, to quicken whom he pleaſeth, to ſhut and open the grave. And his promiſe is to exerciſe this power for his people. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. <hi>I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.

The Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, hath a ſecret generating influence upon the Reſurrection of the Saints, who are therefore called by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. <hi>Luke.</hi> 20. 36. <hi>The Children of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> which leadeth to,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This Victory becomes the believers by participation, and Communion with Him. They communicate with him in the value of his ſatisfaction, and they communicate with him in the vertue of his Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="182" facs="tcp:94116:100"/>
1. They communicate with him in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of his Satisfaction, whereby the ſting of Death is taken out as to them, to wit, the guilt of ſin done away. By the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption between the Father and Chriſt, it was eternally agreed that Chriſt ſhould be their Surrogate, Subſtitute and Surety to undertake for them in their nature <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 18. <hi>No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf;</hi> there is Chriſts Conſent. <hi>This Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have I received of my Father;</hi> there's the Fathers Conſent. So <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he became man and our ſurety, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one with us in the Senſe of the Law, as the principal debtor and Surety are looked upon as one perſon in Law. Thus our debt became his debt, he was bound for us, and ſaith to his Father on our behalf as <hi>Judah</hi> to <hi>Joſeph</hi> on the behalf of <hi>Benjamin. Gen.</hi> 44. 32. 33. <hi>Thy Servant became Surety for the lad unto my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy Servant abide in ſtead of the lad a bondman to my Lord,</hi> And the puniſhment due to us became his. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 4, 5. <hi>Surely he hath born our greifs. and carried our Sorrows—He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. And thus by vertue of the ſame Suretyſhip, when he had undergone the puniſhment and Satisfied the Law, and taken his diſcharge which was teſtified by his Reſurrection, His Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on becomes our Satisfaction and his diſcharge, our
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94116:100"/>
diſcharge. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6. <hi>He is the Lord our Righteouſneſs. Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the Curſe of the Law being made a Curſe for us. Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? Who is he that Condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again.</hi> No Law doth demand both of the principal and the Surety too. They are bound to pay disjunctively one or the other. Therefore when Chriſt was apprehended he ſaid to the Officers that took him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 8. <hi>If ye ſeek me, let theſe</hi> (my diſciples) <hi>go their way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. They communicate with him in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Reſurrection. Chriſt roſe from the dead not only as a ſurety diſcharged from priſon when he had paid the debt and thereby cancelling the obligation of the principal; but alſo as a vital head to quicken and raiſe all his body, the Church. For the ſame Spirit of life which is in Chriſt and quickened his dead body, is alſo in the church and in every particular member thereof, and will certainly quicken their dead bodies. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you; he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies by,</hi> or becauſe of <hi>his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> He ſaith not your <hi>dead</hi> bodies, but your <hi>mortal</hi> bodies, to denote this quickening to be not only from death to life but from mortality to immortality, as was the reſurrection of Chriſt. <hi>He that eateth me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 5, 7.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94116:101"/>
that is, by faith, there is union with Chriſt, <hi>even he ſhall live by me,</hi> there is communion with Chriſt as neceſſarily conſequent. And what that life is, he expreſſeth four times in that chap. <hi>ver.</hi> 39, 40, 44, 54. <hi>I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Hence Chriſt is ſaid to be our life. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. and we are ſaid to be quickened with Chriſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13. and riſen with Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 6. It is from the vertue of Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that <hi>Job</hi> argueth to his own, <hi>Job.</hi> 19. 25, 26. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, &amp;c. And though after my skin worms deſtroy this body yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God.</hi> And this is the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which the Apoſtles ſo induſtriouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves throughout this <hi>Chapter,</hi> aſſuring the Reſurrection of believers by the Reſurrection of Chriſt. Chriſt roſe as the firſt-fruits of them that ſleep, which ſanctifieth and aſſureth the whole harveſt. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. If the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> dying deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Death to all his natural ſeed, much more ſhall the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> riſing communicate life to all his Spiritual ſeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>ver.</hi> 22. yea ſuch intimate and neceſſary connexion is there between the Reſurrection of Chriſt and the Reſurrection of believers, that the Apoſtle argueth both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and backward from the one to the other. <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, 16. The Saints then ſhall one day feel the quickening influences of their vital head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their dead bodies, and experimentally know the power of his Reſurrection Recovering them from the power of the grave to riſe and live with him for ever. Which is ſo certain that the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94116:101"/>
Apoſtle ſpeakes of it as already done. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. <hi>He hath raiſed us up.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Applicat.</hi> 1. How ſad and woful is the Caſe of unbelievers! who have no ſhare in this Glorious and Bleſſed Victory, no intereſt in the ſatisfaction and Reſurrection of this Prince of life; but are left to ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone, all forlornly expoſed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Aſſaults of the King of Terrors. Do they not tremble at a diſtance, at the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of that dark and diſmal hour, when this ſpoiling, deſtroying, abhorred and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Enemy ſhall ſurprize them, and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily require their precious life beyond all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, or reſiſtance? But how much greater will their horror and amazement be at the near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and preſent appearance of this deadly Foe; when their eyes ſhall be awakened, and enlightned more clearly, and convincingly to ſee its power and Terror, and their heart more tender and ſenſible to feel the pain, and poyſon of its Mortal Sting! Can thine heart endure, or can thy hands be ſtrong in the day when thy Fleſh ſhall waſt, thy Spirits faint, thy Strength fail, the Sorrows of Death compaſs thee about, the pains of Hell take hold on thee, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty wrath be renting thee in pieces like a Lion, and there is none to deliver thee? Surely, a guilty Conſcience, a curſing Law, an aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtice, and preſent Death are a weight more inſupportable than Talents of Lead, than Rocks and Mountains, enough to break the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94116:102"/>
ſtouteſt heart, and will certainly damp the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the moſt daring Sinner. Where ever dwelt the man, and what was his Name, who was ſo hardy and confident as not to be moved, yea, not to be ſtruck to the very heart at the ſight of the Pale Horſe coming amain upon him, the Name of whoſe Rider is Death, with Hell at his heels? What thinkeſt thou? O guilty Sinner! Is thy ſtate of ſin ſo little dangerous, that thou mayeſt ſecurely reſt in it? Is Death ſo weakly Armed, and art thou ſo ſtrongly fortified, that thou mayeſt bid defiance to its Aſſaults? Wilt thou ſin, and laugh, and ſleep, and drive away the Melancholy thoughts of thy approaching Terror by diverting to the Mirth, and Follies, and Vanities, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a preſent Tranſitory and helpleſs World? Reflect upon thy heart and ways, review the number and Nature of thy multiplied and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated Tranſgreſſions throughout a long life, have patience to hear the Charge of thy veracious and faithful Conſcience, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider with what a ſharp and poiſonous ſting thou haſt Armed Death againſt thine own Soul. Run not the deſperate hazard of being killed with Death. Who ever hardened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt this Terror of the Lord, and fell not under it? The ſtouteſt hearted are ſpoiled, they have ſlept their ſleep, and none of the men of Might have found their hands. Wert thou <hi>Behemoth</hi> or <hi>Leviathan</hi> for ſtrength and Courage, were thy bones as ſtrong pieces of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94116:102"/>
Braſs, or like Bars of Iron, were thy heart as firm as a ſtone, yea, as heart as a piece of the nether Milſtone, and thou a King among all the Children of pride, yet ſhall this ſword of the Lord approach thee and break thy bones; and this arrow of the Almighty, pierce thy heart, and the poyſon thereof ſhall Drink up thy ſpirit. Flatter not thy ſelf with vain hopes founded upon preſumption or infidelity. Think not the Lion to be painted fiercer then he is. When thou heareſt the menaces of Death, the words of the Curſe, bleſs not thy ſelf ſaying, I ſhall have peace.</p>
                     <p>Make no Covenant with Death, nor be at agreement with Hell: Leſt thou make lies thy refuge, and under falſhood hide thy ſelf; for thy Covenant with Death ſhall be diſannulled, and thy agreement with Hell ſhall not ſtand. Thou haſt but one method of ſafety, one courſe to take. Venture not alone in thy own ſtrength to meet and encounter with thy mortal foe. But Turn thee, Turn thee to the tents of the Conquerour, make haſt to liſt thy ſelf under the ſtandard, of the Prince of life. Thou haſt been told what is the ſting of Death, and where its ſtrength lieth. Do to it as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> did to <hi>Sampſon.</hi> Cut off its locks, Pluck out its ſting. Break off thy ſins by repentance, and work away thy guilt by faith in the blood of the Lamb, that God may give thee Victory through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How bleſſed and comfortable is the caſe of all true believers. There are but two evils can
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94116:103"/>
make a man miſerable, Sin and Death. The believer is freed from the Law of both. It is indeed the irreverſible Law and ordination of God, that Believers die as well as others, but withal It is their unſpeakable diſtinguiſhing priviledge, that their Death hath no ſting, no Curſe, no Victory over them. Their Lord Jeſus, the Captain of their Salvation who died for them, hath overcome Death, diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Death, Sanctified Death, Sweetened Death, Subjected Death to them, and turned it to their advantage. Death indeed cometh after the ſame viſible manner upon the body of the Saint and of the ſinner, by Sword, or Famine, or Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Conſumption and burning Feaver, with aches and pains, whereby the earthly houſe of their tabernacle is diſſolved—<hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> were not divided in their Death. <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> fall alike in the battle by the hand of the Archers. <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Achan</hi> are both ſtoned. The good and bad thief give up the Ghoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon their Croſs. But as to their Souls how vaſtly different are their Deaths in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God! The one is Curſed, the other bleſſed in his Death: On dieth in his Sin, the other in the Lord: One departs under wrath, the other in peace: The Spirit of one is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Satan, the Spirit of the other commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the hands of God: The Soul of one carried by Devils into the place of torment, The Soul of the other carried by Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome: The one paſſeth from death
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94116:103"/>
to death; The other paſſeth though death to Life. This is the bleſſedneſs of the dead which die in the Lord. This is the happy Victory of the Saint over Death, even in dying. Of which difference of the death of Saint and ſinner, the ſinner is ſometimes ſo convinced, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wiſh with <hi>Balaam, Let me die the Death of the Righteous, and let my laſt end be like his.</hi> It is the Saints happineſs here, both living and dying, to have the Victory over death by faith, which is to them the evidence and preſenting of the future Reſurrection, not yet ſeen. But it will be much more their happineſs to have this Victory by ſenſe, as they ſhall in their glorious Reſurrection. Two things commend it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is the Victory over the laſt enemy. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. and ſo implieth Victory over all enemies: For if any remained, this were not the laſt. Sin, and world, and Devil, are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered when Death is conquered. Hold out then, O believing Soul, in thy Spiritual conflict. Be thou faithful unto Death, maintain thy Chriſtian Courage againſt Death, take hold of the ſtrength of Chriſt and overcome it, Thou ſhalt fight no mor, but there remains thee Everlaſting reſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is the Victory of Chriſt, which the Saints have in communion with him, and ſo it is a Sure Victory. He that got it by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power will by the ſame power keep it, that it ſhall never be loſt, Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more, and till Death can prevail over Chriſt it ſhall not prevail over
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94116:104"/>
the Chriſtian. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 19. <hi>Becauſe I live,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ye ſhall live alſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let Believers live and die as becomes thoſe that have the Victory, even above and beyond the fears of Death. If we have the ſame precious faith which this Apoſtle had, let us put on alſo the ſame confidence and courage, and in aſſurance of the Victory that Chriſt hath gotten for us, bid an holy defiance to this enemy. <hi>O Death where is thy ſting? O Grave where is thy Victory?</hi> Was it not the end of Chriſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to deliver his Saints, not only from the hurt, but from the fear of Death? Would it not then be either a denial or a diſparagement of Chriſts Victory, for a Saint to live in bondage to the fear of Death? That Souldier muſt either be very ignorant, or very much a Coward who is afraid to meet his diſarmed, and conquered Enemy. Such is the weakneſs and Cowardiſe, and ought to be the ſhame of too many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtians. How far do we deſire to remove death from us? How ſad and damping are the very thoughts thereof to us? What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance have we againſt the very Name of Death? What trembling at the approach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of! How do we ſay as they, <hi>Jer.</hi> 41. 8. <hi>Slay us not; for we have treaſures in the field, of wheat and of barley, and of Oil and of Honey.</hi> And with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> turn to the wall and weep ſore. But whence is all this? Is it not becauſe we look upon death only with an eye of nature, and not with the eye of faith? and that we look
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94116:104"/>
at our diſſolution more than at our reſurrection? Is it not becauſe of the darkneſs of our Evidence, and careleſſneſs of gaining better aſſurance of life eternal? Is it not from our inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to our worldly intereſt, our Carnal enjoyments and relations? Or is it not from the Conſcience of ſome indulged ſin, which we have not effectually mortified? Surely our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences will tell the guilty, that ſome or all of theſe, are the cauſe of our averſeneſs, lothneſs and fears to die. But are theſe becoming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtians, and worthy of the faith of the Reſurrection? Oh for the honour of Chriſts Victory, for the commendation of Religion, for the Conviction of Sinners, for the comfort of our own ſouls, let us ſhake of theſe clogs, lay aſide theſe weights, and get above theſe ſlaviſh fears! Improve and encourage faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſenſe and carnal reaſon. Mortifie thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affections, hold a good Conſcience, Clear up thy intereſt in Chriſt, and in the Covenant of God, Have thy converſation in Heaven, and from thence look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change thy vile body that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body, and fear not. Art thou to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter death, haſt thou apprehenſions of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches towards thee? And doth thy heart fail for fear hereof? Hear Chriſt rebuking thee as ſometimes he rebuked his diſciples, <hi>Why art thou fearful, thou of little faith?</hi> Let me ſay to thee for thy encouragement, if thou beeſt a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94116:105"/>
Chriſtian indeed, as <hi>Deborah</hi> to <hi>Barak</hi> when he was to Encounter <hi>Siſera. Judg.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Up, Is not the Lord gone out before thee?</hi> Hath not Chriſt diſarmed thy Enemy? and taken out its ſting? Hath not he overcome death, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the doors of the grave, and given thee the Victory? yea Doth not the Lord go out with thee, and ſtand by thee in this thy laſt conflict? And is not the preſence and aſſiſtance of Chriſt enough to encourage thee againſt fear? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 1. 2. <hi>ſaith God to</hi> Jacob, <hi>Fear not, when thou paſſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee;</hi> and v. 5. <hi>Fear not, for I am with thee.</hi> In the ſtrength of which promiſe, ſay with <hi>David, Dſ.</hi> 23. 4. <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of Death, I will fear none evill, for thou art with me.</hi> Verily there is a power in faith. It is a Victorious grace. It engaged the ſtrength of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead. Live then by faith, and thou ſhalt die by faith, and overcome death by faith. Many witneſſes can ſet their ſeal to this as a certain truth, that a Chriſtian by the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grace may, if not <hi>triumphanter</hi> yet, at leaſt <hi>patienter mori,</hi> may be content, if not rejoyce to die.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Add for a concluſion the Apoſtles appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the text, <hi>Thanks be to God.</hi> The Victory being gotten, being given, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph is to be made. We read (whether they be the words of God to the Church, or of the Church to God, the ſenſe is the ſame) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 19. <hi>Thy</hi>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:94116:105"/>
                        <hi>dead men ſhall live, together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs;</hi> which revives them in the ſpring, after a Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling winter, <hi>and the Earth ſhall caſt out the Dead,</hi> There's the Victory. What then? <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and ſing, ye that dwell in the duſt,</hi> There is the triumph. Thus, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 30. 3. <hi>O Lord, thou haſt brought up my Soul from the grave.</hi> then, ver. 12. <hi>To the end that my glory may ſing priſe to thee and not be ſilent: O Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee for ever.</hi> Thus again the Pſalmiſts ſings. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 118. 14, 15, 17. <hi>The The Lord is my ſtrength and Song: And is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my Salvation. The voice of rejoycing and Salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the Lord doth valiantly &amp;c. Why? I ſhall not die but live, and declare the works of the Lord.</hi> Victory is always matter of rejoycing, and ſhould reflect honour upon the Conquerour. We read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. <hi>Goliah</hi> of <hi>Gath,</hi> that monſtrous and terrible Giant, cometh forth before his camp of <hi>Philiſtins</hi> and defieth the armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who fled from him and were ſore afraid, when behold, <hi>David</hi> goeth out to meet him, and encounters him all alone, and with the Giants own ſword cuts off his head and diſcomfits all his hoſt. Did they not then come out of all cities of <hi>Iſrael. Chap.</hi> 18. 6, 7. ſinging and dancing with, <hi>Tabrets</hi> and joy and inſtruments of muſick, anſwering one another as they played, and ſaying, Saul <hi>hath ſlain his thouſands, and</hi> David <hi>his ten thouſands?</hi> What
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94116:106"/>
is it that we ſee? Is it the Viſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 8. Behold, a pale horſe, and the Name of him that ſits on him is Death, and Hell followeth with him, and power is given unto him to kill. And at this are we ſore afraid? Why? Look again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 11. &amp;c. I ſaw Heaven opened and behold a white horſe, and he that ſate upon him doth judge and make war in righteouſneſs, and he is clothed with a Veſture dipt in blood, and his Name is called The Word of God, He goeth forth Conquering and to Conquer. He takes Death and Hell and caſteth them into the lake of fire. Come then, let us Sing the Song of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and Song; He is my God I will exalt him. The Lord is a man of war; The Lord is his Name I will ſing unto the Lord; for he hath triumphed gloriouſly, the Horſe and his Rider hath he caſt into the fire.</hi> This Victory was won by Chriſt tis worn by us; It was dear to Chriſt, tis cheap to us; It coſt him labour. and pain, and ſorrow, and ſweat, and blood, but it is given to us; we overcome not by expence of our own blood, but by the blood of the Lamb. What then ſhall we render to the Lord? Shall we give him leſs than a Song, a Song of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving? eſpecially when we can give no more. O ye that are the redeemed of the Lord, whom he hath ranſomed from the power of the grave, ſend out your thoughts a while into the Land of Darkneſs, and take a more exact view of the triumphs and trophies of Death, which it hath
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94116:106"/>
erected over the Vanquiſhed Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men, that have fallen under its power: Look into the priſon of the Grave where the bodies of the ſlain are holden under Chains of Darkneſs, reſerved to the execution of the Great day. Conſider the poyſon, venom, ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and power of the deadly ſting that is entred into their Souls, ſtrengthened with all the plagues and Curſes that are writtten in the book of the Law of a righteous, avenging, and Almighty Judge; the worm of Conſcience gnawing the Soul as well as the worm of Corruption feeding on the body. Hark, what are the hideous Cryes, and woes, and wailings, the roarings and yellings, the gnaſhing of teeth, and bitter lamentations of the wretched priſoners captivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the inſulting Enemy; and then recall your thoughts to the ſolemn meditation of this happy word, the glad tidings of the Glorious conqueſt and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, in fellowſhip with whom you are reſcued from the curſed power of this Death and Hell, and made heirs of the grace of life, of life eternal. And if you have any ſenſe of the Infinite love of God, and his compaſſions towards you; of the incomparable labours, and ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt for you; of the unſpeakable miſery from whence you are redeemed, and the glorious Immortality to which you are intituled, and whereof you ſhall be poſſeſſed. Your meditations (methinks) cannot but iſſue with the Apoſtle's in this greatful,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94116:107"/>
pathetick, and triumphant doxologie. <hi>Thanks be to God, who giveth us the Victory through our Lord Jeſu Chriſt.</hi>
