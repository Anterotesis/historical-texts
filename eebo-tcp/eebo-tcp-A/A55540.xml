            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS Play, the Conception of a few loose hours, being committed by the Author to my Hand to Dispose in the World, I cannot Discharge the Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have taken of it better, than by making a Present of it here. And truly, <hi>SIR,</hi> for a Worthy Patron, You stand my Noblest Choice. Ev'n the proudest Greatness and Nobility are but Poorer Shrines to Offer at: For that Great Lord, and this Noble Lady, may Patronize a Play, and Cherish an Author: But You, <hi>SIR,</hi> in Your Higher Province, are the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Playing it Self. And if the Diversion of the Stage makes so considerable a part of the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Age; without Flattery, I may tell You, That Your Self is one of the Greatest Founders of that Feast. For no Man has pusht Fairer, or ventured Franklier, to carry on the Muses Cause, even in their Mourning Days, and most Declining Circumstances; and with that Unmurmuring Cheerfulness, that You never Repined at Your Profusest Favours in their Protection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65510:3"/>
As You stand thus Extraordinary Qualified for this Humble Address; so I avow to the World, That I intend, in this Offering, a Piece of Devotion above that of a Common Dedication. For I do not so much Dedicate the Play to You, as I do my Self. You are so much the Gentleman (a Name that includes all Titles) in Your Candour and Goodness, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Your whole Administration amongst us, that nothing but the highest ingratitude can play the Infidel with You.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, You have Unhappily met with too many Barbarous Returns from Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
               </gap>murers and Mutineers, whilst the Popular Outcry of Oppression, the too Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, though never so False, Pretence for Rebellion, has not been wanting, to too many Renegadoes to fall from You: But as the fairest Standard and the Best Cause will sometimes have Deserters; their Revolt is their Shame, not Yours. For Your True Worth, when throughly known, will be found to stand above the Reach of their false Calumny and Detraction.</p>
            <p>And against all such poor Apostacy, I here enter my publick Protestation and Abhorrence; and here, like an Honest Subscription to a Loyal Association, declare my self,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am not ignorant, that Criticks (like <hi>London</hi> Iuries) are ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> the same Circumstances; and the same Thing shall be Condemned as an Inexcuseable Fault in one, and Appla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¦</desc>
               </gap>ded as a Beauty in another. This Reflection made me at first unwilling to expose this Play to the publick View; but when I considered how many Young Criminals have found Favour, for no other Reason, (that I could find) but that it was their first Fault, I resolved to let it stand its Tryal, where I shall leave it to take its Fate according to its Deserts.</p>
            <p>This Play was written for my own private Diversion in the Country where the Scene is laid, and brought on the Stage for the Diversion of others: If it has had the good Fortune to please, I have my end; If not, yet I hope my good Natur'd Intention will be so far from being Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me as a Fault, that it will Atone (at least) for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Errors I have committed.</p>
            <p>There is one Objection, made by Persons of that strange Antipathy to any thing that is Obscene, that the least tincture of it strangely Disorders them, that is laid to its Charge,
<pb facs="tcp:65510:4"/>
which, after the Plays I have seen crowded and admired, did not a little surprize me; for I was so far from being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to my self, of having intrenched on Decency more than ordinary, that my greatest fear was, that it would prove too Modest for this Age: But I hope this is only a piece of Female Hypocrisie, and that which is condemned in publick will become Matter of private Diversion. <hi>But, Reader, I will stay thee no longer at the Door, go in, and see what the Nice Humour of this Age takes Offence at, and with me Congratulate the happy Change.</hi>

               <p>And pray, Why not to morrow, as well as to morrow twelvemonth? What have young Maids to do but to obey their Father's commands? I will defer the matter no longer.</p>

               <p>Consent, Sir, Cannot her Father tell what is fittest for her to consent to?â€”But Sons think it their greatest glory if they can contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict or teach their Fathers.

               <p>As I expected, the Father no sooner speaks, but the Son thinks his breath too good to be spent in such company.</p>

               <speaker>Gri.</speaker>
               <p>So are all young Women until they are temptedâ€”a Woman's Chastity is not from her vertuous will or inclination, but because she hath not the power or opportunity to be otherwise; give her her wing, fancy will work a pace, and the first Gay Modish Spark, with long Beau Peruke and gawdy Snuff-box, may manage her at pleasure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Per.</speaker>
               <p>By Nature all things covet liberty, but you compare your Childrento the Beasts, and because some of each Sex are brutal, condemn the whole, as if there were none but a compelled Chastity: You make the Jewel Vertue, a privation; who e're she grant a Wedlock, first causes a liking, then the noble passion Love, which once ingrafted in the Soul, the Marriage proves for ever comfortable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gri.</speaker>
               <p>If it be once ingrafted in the Soul, 'twill not be long e're it get into the Body; Under what circumstances is your Vertue then Boy? Let the most transported Lover have but one quarter of an hour with the charming Fair, the Passion is over, and the crackt Venice-Glass returns to its first owner; once more, I tell you, I will maintain no Bastards.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Per.</speaker>
               <p>Remark abroad, what you may dread at home; tell me of one forced Marriage that was not exemplarily miserable: The Persons are the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; the Portion, Jointure, and the Settlement, are Cyphers; if the first be good, the latter amplify, or of themselves are nothing. Oh! do not rashly tye the knot which you'l too late repent! When Bodies join without Affection, despair commences, and she will hate the Riches for the Owners sake; besides, you know her Promise made to <hi>Manley.</hi>

               <p>Promises,â€”never stir! hast thou lived to this age, and yet igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that Promises are no longer obliging than they serve the interest of him that made them?

Yet, when the worst hath happened, we have joyned forces to make it out that what you did was in execution of your Office, justly in your own defence; and at last have Bribed the Petty Jury perhaps to acquit you.</p>

When I first set up here in the Country, I Marry'd a handsom Girl, who according to expectation, proved a compleat, tempting, hypocritical Jilt; I the necessary Perquisite, a good-natur'd Landlord, otherwise call'd a spunging, insinuating, contented Cuckold. We are both Cheats; so far 'tis right and well. According to the Quality of my Function, my Wife takes all upon her. Any Man would think such Dealings would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie her; but I vow she's grown very obstreperous and ungrateful; for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65510:21"/>
even now going to the Barr to see how the Reckoning stood, I met our Servant-Maid; the Spirit being willing, the Flesh and the Devil prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I was very loving; the poor innocent Creature blushing, cry'd, <hi>Nay, pish!â€”Nay, fye!â€”Mistress is comingâ€”I'll vow I'll cry out!</hi> yet all the while kiss'd as close as any Cockle: In the nick of time comes the Devil of a Wife, and disturb'd us: My little Magpye squeak'd, and thrust me from her, but whisper'd I should meet her in the Summer-House at Nine this Evening; which certainly I'll do, for all your Frumps, Mrs <hi>Sus.â€”</hi>Ay, there she is coming; I must march, or woe to my Bones!</p>

                  <p>You are very nimble with your Attendance; you were not so an Hour since: The Gentlemen knock'd and call'd, and no Landlord to be found, till uncivilly I was forc'd to rise from my Cushion, and leave their Company to fetch Liquor.</p>

                  <p>Consider, Sirrah, who I am, and whence I came; my Father, a good Farmer, bred me the next Degree to a Gentlewoman, else I could ne'er ha' made so good a Landlady: 'Tis for the love of me there's such resort; 'tis I who keep the Door open, Sirrah! How oft have I been forc'd to watch whole Nights to give my Guests content and satisfaction, and all to make thee rich; whilst thou keepest Wenches Company, and cheatest me of that Love is only due to me.</p>

                  <p>Pray, Madam, if I increase in Duty by deputation an hundred-fold, you are no loser: How many times have I, with the Eye of Judgment, seen things which shall be nameless, touching my Freehold; yet putting on the Mask of charitable Unbelief, have quietly sate down in the Chair of Contentment, and said nothing?</p>
