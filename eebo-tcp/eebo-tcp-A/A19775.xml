            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9712:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which conceit is the better warranted, because <hi>le Rhosne</hi> is a very swift and furious Riuer, which well agreeth with the nature and condition of the man; and <hi>la Sona,</hi> a still and sweet water, which rightly symbolizeth with the quality of a woman.</p>

French rekoning, calling euery <hi>Ville,</hi> a City, which is not eyther a Burgade, or a Village, we shall finde that their number is infinite, and indeed vncertaine, as is also the number of the townes in generall. Some say, there bee one million and seuen hundred thousand: but they are of all wise men reprooued. Others say, sixe hundred thousand; but this is also too great to be true.

            <p>By the reckoning before set downe of two hundred leagues square (which France almost yeeldeth) we must compute, that here is in all forty thousand leagues in square, and in euery league, fiue thousand Arpens of ground, which in all amounteth to two hundred milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Arpens: which summe being deuided by the number of the Parishes, sheweth, that one with another, eche Village hath one thousand, fiue hundred and fifteene Arpens, which measure is bigger then our Acre.</p>
            <p>Wee may, if wee will, abstract a third, because <hi>Bodin</hi> will not admit France to be square, but as a Lozenge: For in matter of such generality as this, men doe alwayes set downe suppositions, not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynties.</p>

            <p>Onely I must adde, that since his time, which is now aboue twenty yeeres, many Townes also haue bettered their maner of fortifying: amongst which, none more (by report) then that of <hi>Rochell</hi>: and lately, that of <hi>Amiens,</hi> of which wee might last yeere, while the Spanyard held it, say (as is sayd of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celea,</hi> in the Territory of <hi>Athens</hi>) which <hi>Alcibiades</hi> counselled the Lacedemonians, to take and fortify, namely,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>But as the losse of this Towne wounded the whole body of France, so the regayning of it, was not onely the healing of the hurt receyued (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was better then the <hi>Pelias Hasta</hi>) but also the ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it to these happy tearmes, wherein it now stands.</p>
            <p>This Towne would giue mee good occasion to speake of the last yeeres siege, the Cardinalles comming, and the Cittyes yeelding, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other accidents very memorable and worthy the recounting; wherein I had rather spend an howres

            <p>After that, I will breefly relate of the Castles in France, and of some reasons why it is preiudiciall to the quiet of a State, to haue many of them, except they all belong to the Prince, who ought to haue of them in his frontier places, and Lymitrophes (as they call them) and vpon Cities which are strong to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in awe, not else; and as that of S. <hi>Katherines,</hi> which you sawe at <hi>Rouen,</hi> now rased: and then I will end the first branch of this Relation, namely, of the Topography of this Countrey.</p>

At the entry, is a Lion cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, with his tayle betweene his legges, to signify, that all persons, how high soeuer, are subiect to that Court.</p>
            <p>The Chamber also of Comptes, built by this <hi>Lewes,</hi> is a very fayre roome; at the entry whereof are fiue por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treicts with their Mots.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To speake particularly of all other the buildings and Courts of this Palace, as the Chamber of the Treasurer, the Table of Marble, the Courtes of Aides, and such like, were to be too tedious.</p>
            <p>The buildings of this Citie are of stone, very fayre, high, and vniforme, throughout the towne, onely vpon the Port <hi>N. Dame,</hi> Our Ladies Bridge, which is, as it were, their Cheapeside: their building is of brickbat, all alike notwithstanding; the fayrest Fabricke in the towne (and worthily) is the Kings Castle or Palace of the <hi>Louure</hi> at the west: It is in forme quadrangulare, the south and west quarters are new and Princelike, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two very antique and prisonlike. They were puld downe by <hi>Francis.</hi> 1. and begun to be rebuilt, but fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by <hi>Henry the second,</hi> with this inscription, <hi>Henricus</hi> 2. <hi>Rex Christianissimus, vetustate collapsum aedificium refigere coepit.</hi> The most Christian King <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. began to repaire this time-ruined edifice.</p>
            <p>From this Palace, the King is building a Galery, which runnes along the riuer East and West, and his purpose is, it shall passe ouer the towne ditch with an Arch, and so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue to the <hi>Twilleries,</hi> which is at least sixe hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred paces, and so both these buildings shall bee vnited into one: which, if euer it be done, will bee the greatest and
<pb facs="tcp:9712:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
goodliest Palace of <hi>Europe</hi>: This Gallery is very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously wrought with Flowers de luce, curious knots, branches, and such like deuice, cut in stone; and in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place this word of the Kings, <hi>Duo protegit vnus.</hi> Which I suppose, implyeth, One God maintaynes the two Kingdomes of France and Nauarre.</p>
            <p>The building of the <hi>Twilleries,</hi> begun by the <hi>Q. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (which is also a stately work) is now in the finishing: for this <hi>Queene Mother</hi> began many things, but fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed none (except mischiefes) witnesse this present house of the <hi>Twilleries,</hi> and that other at S. <hi>Maur</hi> some two leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> whither, ye remember, we went to kisse the young Prince of <hi>Condies</hi> hand, which then tolde vs was morgaged to her <hi>creanciers</hi> (creditors) for 25. thousand Crownes, and now stands vnperfited.</p>
            <p>The next house in state, both for the beautie of the building, and deuice in the Gardens, is that of <hi>Monsieur Gondy,</hi> an Italian, whose father came into France with <hi>Katherine de Medices,</hi> and was here by her aduanced. There be other very many and very stately buildings, as that of <hi>Mons. Sansuë, Mons. de Monpensier, de Neuers,</hi> and infinite others, whereof especially towardes the East end this towne is full, in so much as ye may say of the French Noblesse, as is elsewhere said of the <hi>Agrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, They build, as if they should liue euer, and feede,</hi>

whose friends comming on a time to see him at his new house, began exceedingly to commend it, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it deserued, as well for the rarenesse of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, as the goodnesse of the Stone, Timber, Marble, and such like. No (quoth he) ye mistake the stuffe whereof it is made: this house is onely built, <hi>de testes des fols:</hi> of fooles heads.

            <p>Ye must note, it is not yet one hundred yeeres since this stately kind of building (or I should rather say, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull; for still the most stately is the most ancient) came first in request.<note place="margin">

            <p>And lastly now, in her old age she grew wise, erected Courts for iustice, made lawes and ordinances, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne her inhabitants, wherein no Countrey in Europe hath excelled her: for so sayth my Author, <hi>Il n'y a contré au monde ou la iustice soit mieux establit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

in their greatnesse, and forced the King to stand in need of them, whereas the peace might be much preiudiciall to them, and bring them to their accounts, for many matters ill carried in their charges. Hereupon the <hi>Count</hi> set on his King, to enbarke himselfe in a warre, against so great an enemy, as the Duke of <hi>Burgogne</hi>: and these euen forced their Master, to war vpon his owne Subiects, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst so good a cause as true Religion. And as he desired nothing lesse, then that the Duke should condescend to his Maiestie, and so make a peace: so did these only wish, that they of the Religion might still stand stiffe in their profession.

               </hi>: I wish better to the Kingdom then you imagine, for one King that there is nowe, I would there were halfe a dozen. All these, forsooth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that the Common-wealth was sicke and out of temper, &amp; ech one pretended with his Phisicke to cure her. The D. of <hi>Guise,</hi> to ease the paine which was at the hart, ment (as he doth, that giues the best remedy for the tooth-ake, to pull them all out) to strike off the head: To which purpose, at the Barucadoes of <hi>Paris,</hi> hee had the King fast in the Castle of the <hi>Louure,</hi> but yet most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wisely, hauing the bird in the cage, let him flye away.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall,</hi> that should by his calling haue mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred the most gentle and lenitiue kind of Phisicke, and if it had beene possible, haue cured France with good counsell, &amp; prescribing a good diet, ministred nothing, but corrasiues, and bitter pilles of disdaine among the Nobles.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> like a Doctor of good practise, brings with him a whole shop ful of Phisicke, inough to purge all France, hee applieth his receipt of the Low-Countrey Souldiers, to ease her of her malady: but the weake stomacke of this Countrey could not brooke so
<pb facs="tcp:9712:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
strong an <hi>ingrediens,</hi> and therefore shee vomited them out againe, before they had done the deed. The Duke <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> like a desperate young Doctor, that would get credit in his trade, vpon his first patient, by putting all to the hazard, without vsing any preparatiues, or obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of criticke dayes, giues the potion, before <hi>Monsieur Matignon</hi> could come at him, who came with other good phisicke to assist him in this practise: but at that time, they say, that <hi>Mars,</hi> a maleuolent Planet, was retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade in <hi>Aries,</hi> or entring into <hi>Taurus</hi>: and so it should seeme: for one of the King of <hi>Nauarres</hi> troupes, called <hi>Monsr. Taurin</hi> (as they say) gaue him a Pistolade in the head. <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> was not so precipitate, to breake the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postume before it was ripe, but the Duke <hi>de Mayenne</hi> was as much a dreamer to forslow the occasion: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his brother <hi>Guise</hi> was stabbed, and all the great Cities reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him (Ioe, then was she sicke at the hart) he should then haue plyed, to haue applyed his medicines: but then had he his Phisicke to seeke: And after, when the party was pretily recouered, &amp; began to refuse Phisick, (hauing a little relished the wholesome diet of good counsell) then comes he in such haste, that hee brake his bottels by the way, and so was a loser by the bargayne.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Monsieur de Mercaeure,</hi> hee playd the good Kitchin Doctor, of whome <hi>Rablais</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rabl. l.</hi> 2.</note> who gaue his patient the necke and bones to tyre vpon, and kept the wings himselfe: for he left them all France, tyred and tewed, as bare as a birdes bone, and kept Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne, one of the fattest wings of the Countrey, to himselfe, purposing to haue entituled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Duke thereof. But these were all pretended Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians: the poore King <hi>Henry</hi> the third ment wel indeed,
<pb facs="tcp:9712:24"/>
but wanted skill, who found by experience, after hee had slaine the <hi>Guise,</hi> and left the rest of his house (that were then in action) how dangerous a thing it is, in matter of execution to doe it to the halfe, and that in ministring phisicke, a violent potion is not so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as one that is too weake, which onely stirreth the humors, and is not able to expell them. Among so many Phisicians, we must needes haue one woman to looke to the patient: this was the <hi>Queene Mother,</hi> of whom and her Sonne <hi>Charles</hi> 9. that consented to the Massacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> we may say with the Poet:

These were they that left France in such pitifull taking, vnder a false pretext of reformation of the State; as we might well say of it, as is said of the abandoned French <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable</hi> in <hi>Lewes</hi> 11. his time,<note place="margin">

            <p>That diuision was the onely cause, why we not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost all we had in France, but also the meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer all which wee ought to haue had: for in those times France her selfe also was miserably distracted, &amp; brought to so lowe an ebbe,<note place="margin">

            <p>But it is a thing euer obserued in great States and Kingdomes, that they neuer rise to any greatnesse, except in their rising they meet with many lets, and are sometimes euen brought to such lowe tearmes, as they are thought past all hope; as <hi>Athens,</hi> by the <hi>Persians</hi>; and <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Gaules:</hi> the like is to be said of great Princes; as of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

               </note> but we may call this King both the one and the other to <hi>France</hi>: to one, to cut off all disturbers of the State; the other, to defend his Subiects in the libertie of their conscience, and enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of peace. This office he now executes in his quiet reigne; that other he vsed in time of the ciuill warres, when as alwayes they of the Kings part sent for his aide to the suppression of the Leaguers, though after that done, they cared not for him. So saith <hi>Plutarch</hi> of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles, Les Atheniens n'y honoroyent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            <p>This King then, of whom now by course I am to relate, is about 48. yeeres of age, his stature small, his haire almost all white, or rather grisled, his colour fresh and youthfull, his nature stirring and full of life,
<pb facs="tcp:9712:26"/>
like a true French man. One of his owne people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth him thus,<note place="margin">

               <hi>De son naturel il est si extremement vif et actif qu' à quoy qu'-il s' adonne, il s' y met tout entier ne fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant tamais gueres qu' vne seule chose à la fois. Deioindre vne longue deliberation auec vn faict presse cela luy est malaise. Le faire et le deliberet se rencontrent en mesme temps. Mais aux conseils qui ont traict de temps à la verité, il a besoigne d' estre soulage. Vne promptitude admirable d' esprit. Aux affaires de la Iustice, des finances, aux negotiations estrangeres, aux depes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, à la policie d' estat il croit les autres, il ne s' en mesle point:</hi> He is of such an extremely liuely, and actiue dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that to whatsoeuer he applyes himselfe, to that hee entirely employes all his powers, seldome doing aboue one thing at once. To ioyne a tedious deliberation with an earnest and pressing affayre, he cannot endure: Hee executes and deliberates both together. But in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels that require tract of time, to say the truth, hee hath neede of helpe. He hath an admirable sharpnesse of wit. In affayres of Iustice, of his Reuenues, forrayne Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations, Dispatches, and gouernment of the State, hee credites others, and meddles little himselfe.</p>
            <p>He sayth there farther, that though by his Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, his fashion &amp; maner of behauiour, ye would iudge him leger and inconstant, yet is no man more firmely constant then he. He confesseth it were hard for him, not to be sparing, considering the profuse and lauish spoyle that his predecessor made before him: yet to salue the matter, he makes this difference, <hi>That the other gaue much to few, this giues a little to many.</hi> If you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber when we saw him play at dice, here in <hi>Orleans,</hi> with his Noblesse, he would euer tell his money very precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before he gaue it backe againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9712:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>I will not spare in this discourse (which is onely for your selfe priuate) to speake the trueth, though of a King: we are here in a Country, where ye daily heare his owne Subiects speake of him more liberally.</p>
            <p>And besides, his Maiestie hath generally this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, which is very laudable in a Prince, he can endure that any man should tell him the truth, though of himselfe. Which I will interpret to wisedome, though perhaps some will impute it to a facility of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Concerning this thriftie vertue then of sparing, we must note that he is a very good mesuager. <hi>Il fait d' argent auec ses dens</hi>: He makes money with his teeth, saith the Frenchman, meaning his sparing of great and superfluous expence at his table.

               <hi>There is no Prince without his fault.</hi> Howbeit those few that are in this Prince, are recompenced with many very heroicall and princely vertues, both of body &amp; mind.

At his being at the siege of <hi>Amiens,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others of the Noblesse, which he summoned to that seruice, he sent also for the <hi>Count Soissons,</hi> a Prince of the bloud, &amp; one of the rarest Gentlemen of France, to whom the King giues (as is said) 5000. Crowns pensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The <hi>Count,</hi> at that time discontented, returned the King answere, that he was a poore Gent. &amp; wanted meanes to come to that seruice, as became one of his birth &amp; place, being a Prince of the bloud, &amp; Peere of France: he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most humbly craued pardon, and that hee would

pray for his Maiesties prosperous successe, which was all he could doe. Well, saith the King, <hi>Dautaut que les prieres ne seruent point sans ieusne, il faut qu' il ieusne de la pension de ses</hi> 5000. <hi>escus:</hi> Seeing prayer is not acceptable without fasting, my couzin shall hereafter fast from his pension of fiue thousand Crownes.</p>
            <p>After the death of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> when almost all France had reuolted from the late King, &amp; like a poore (<hi>Roy d' Iuidot</hi>) as the French prouerbe is, he was chased of them of the League, from all places of France, to <hi>Toures,</hi> and was there, as it were besieged of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi>: After that this King present came thither with his small forces, to the distressed Kings suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, the King of France, whose name was also <hi>Henry,</hi> would needes perswade <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> with those small forces, which they both had, to march out of the Towne, and encounter the Dukes forces, who were double the number. <hi>Sirs</hi> (saith hee) <hi>ne hazardons point vn double Henry contre vn Carolus:</hi> Let vs not play a double Henry, against a Carolus: (that, is a peece of gold, of 14 shillings, and this, a peece of brasse onely of 10. deniers.)

Hereupon all the Court began to despise learning, and to say, that Latine was for a Priest, not for a Gentleman: And that it was learning ynough for a Nobleman, if hee could write his owne name, yea, and I haue heard of an Admirall of France, that could not do that neither.</p>
            <p>The second example is, of <hi>Frances</hi> the first, who cut his hayre short, because of a hurt hee had in his head: and presently all the Court and Noblesse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that fashion,<note place="margin">

The third was the warres with the English, wherein by force they lost them.

Yee see then, how necessary it was, this olde institution being corrupted and quite decayed, to erect a new: which they called <hi>Les gensdar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes des ordonnances</hi>: because at their first erection, there were diuers lawes and ordinances made for them to obserue, which who so brake, was surely punished. They were at first only 1500. But after, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased to a hundred Companies, and giuen to diuers Princes of the bloud, and Nobles of France, to conduct and commaund, with an honourable pension: In these Companies should be 6000.

                  <hi>Cabinet du Roy.</hi>
               </note>The Cabinets reason is this: There be in France fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thousand Gentlemen that are able to beare Armes: for (sayth he) rate this proportion at a Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in eche league, by the measure of France (where are forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand in square) and it wanteth but a fift. Howbeit, sayth hee, in some Countries, ye shall haue thirty or forty, within the compasse of one league, besides their children. Out of these, if the King would, hee might compose a <hi>Gendarmery</hi> of 8000. men at Armes, and 16000. Archers: which bodie of 24000. Gentlemen, would represent in the field 60000. horse. Hee might also haue a <hi>cauallerie Legiere,</hi> of foure or fiue thousand Gentlemen. He might also furnish the <hi>Ban</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erban,</hi> according to the olde fashion, with twelue or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene thousand Gentlemen. And yet might hee haue besides all this, foure or fiue thousand for the State of his Court, and gouernment of his Prouinces. This is his computation. But you shall see it proued, when wee come to speake of the Nobilitie of France, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly shortned in number, and decayed in estate, and therefore nothing able to come neere this number.
<pb facs="tcp:9712:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
As good a consequent it were to say, that because yee haue two or three millions of men in England, able to fight, that therefore our State can bring so many into the field: without considering the prouision of Armes, and all other things necessary. But this Cabinet was made by one of the Religion, that was transported out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, by the heate of his zeale, and hate to the temporall liuings of the Church: Whose proiects and driftes are much like those of the <hi>Supplication of Beggars</hi> (a booke made in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eights dayes) where he frameth in his fancy an <hi>Vtopia</hi> and felicitie, not to be hoped in France, building Castles in the ayre, and concluding, that if it would please the King to aliene the Church temporall liuings, and vnite them to the Domaine, <hi>nihil est dictu facilius:</hi> (a thing easily sayd, but not easily done) that ouer and besides the forces of fourescore thousand horse abouesaid, hee might also maintayne an Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of the French Gentlemen of twelue thousand. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, another of the populare, of forty eight thousand. And lastly, yet another Infantery legionaire of 48. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Supplication</hi> was answered by Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> his booke, called The <hi>Pitifull complaint of the puling soules in Purgatory:</hi> How well I knowe not, but of this I am sure, that if such a number of horse and foote should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee maintayned vpon the Church liuing, or vpon the poore people (vpon whome all these charges of the <hi>Gend'armes</hi> lyeth, here would bee many more puling soules, and pitifull complayntes in France, then are Sir <hi>Thomas Moores</hi> Purgatory.</p>

Neither do I thinke this the least rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why our Ancestors haue wonne so many battelles vpon them, namely, for that wee euer haue had men of Noble houses, to lead &amp; serue on foot with our forces.

            <p>And for the opinion that the world hath of our foot, ye shall obserue what the same writer elsewhere sayth, <hi>Bonnes gens de pied,</hi>

            <p>And in another place, where hee opineth of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of seruice, he sayth: <hi>Mon aduis est, que la souueraine chose du monde es battaille sont les Archers, et la fleurdes Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers sont les Anglois</hi>: My opinion is, that in battels, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are the weight that turnes the ballance, and of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, the English are the flower: where he likewise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth, how daungerous a thing it is to abide a battel, except your foote be much the better: which in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion was no little cause why the French King fought not with the Cardinall this last yere 97. before <hi>Amiens,</hi> because the enemies foote were holden in number eighteene thousand (though I hardly thinke they were so many) a number full as great as the French, and the Souldier farre better, they being all French, except some
<pb facs="tcp:9712:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
three thousand English, and Swissers, and theirs the choyse men of all his Garrisons, &amp; experienced Soldiers in those Low Countries. For true it is, that the Kings <hi>Gensd'armes</hi> were two for one, and holden also much the better men, aswell because there was in a maner all the Nobilitie &amp; Flower of France, as also that they had the aduantage in the maner of weapon, for that the French serueth with the Pistoll, &amp; the Spanyard still holds him to his Lance. But I make no question, that the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the oddes on foote, was not the chiefe cause why we fought not that day: for we had a goodly fayre Field, and playne as might be possible, as also large: a singular aduantage for him which is strongest in horse: So had we the winde and Sunne in our backes, which are holden no small helpes.</p>
            <p>But this was the reason: the King thought it no poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to play all his Rest at once, where he might haue lost more at one game, then hee had got in eight yeeres: hee had no reason, but to make the Card that was now going, a Bridge of Gold (as the Prouerbe is) considering, that by this meanes hee should gayne the Towne of <hi>Amiens,</hi> reassure other Cities that then stoode wauering, and recouer his reputation in the world, which by the losse of that Towne was much disputed.</p>
            <p>Of this somewhat hath beene sayde before: I therefore leaue to speake further thereof, as also of the French forces, or seruice in warres, with the onely remembrance of a French mans reason, who thought himselfe no small wise man, that would needes proue that the French seruice, and Souldier also, was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the English: Because (sayth he) wee haue
<pb facs="tcp:9712:48"/>

            <p>But yee must obserue, that of all these Court charges and others here beforemencioned (except those of his Forces) yee are not to make any ground as of a trueth: they being onely the supposed charges, set downe by this said Authour, who for his errors in other matters, hath also lost his credit in this.</p>

            <p>What then hath bene the expence in these eight and thirtie yeeres space of the Ciuill warres, may easily bee coniectured to be infinit, considering withall the lauish prodigalitie, and immeasureable spending of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, especially of the last: who some let not to say, that hee left the state engaged by one meanes and other; as namely, the sale of his Aides,<note place="margin">

Besides, to the <hi>Duke of Ferrara,</hi> and other debts for marriages, to the summe of 8514592. Besides other debts to particular Marchants, of 1564787.

And lastly, 3000000. which he ought to the <hi>Hostell de Paris,</hi> to the Chamber or Towne-house of <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the beginning of all this is imputed to <hi>Francis</hi> the first, who hauing in his Coffers, one million, and seuen hundred thousand Crownes in ready money, would notwithstanding take vp great imprests of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at great vsance, to enable himselfe to goe through with his warres in <hi>Italy.</hi> A course very ill taken: and (if we may compare great things with small) much like to a couetous and greedie-minded man, who will venter vpon a purchase of his neighbours land, before he bee well prouided for such a purpose, but taketh vp money to loane, which so eateth into him, as he is at last forced not onely to sell his new purchase, but his ancient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance also.</p>
            <p>For by these great interests, a Prince is brought to one of these two extremities, either vtterly to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his Domaine and Finances, whereof the Kings of <hi>France</hi> are good examples: or else to play Bankrupt and pay no body, as now of late the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath done, with the Marchants of <hi>Genoa, Florence, Ausburghe,</hi> and almost all the Bankes in <hi>Christendome</hi>: insomuch as
<pb facs="tcp:9712:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the last yeere, when I was in Italy, ye should heare them say in derision, that the King of Spayne had made more ill faces vpon the Exchange, in one day, then <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> the famous Paynter and Caruer, had euer made good faces in all his life.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> learned this kind of borrowing, of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, his father, who at one time was indebted fiftie millions, for which his Domaynes, and Reuenues of <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Millaine</hi> were morgaged, and once also in twenty yeres discharged all his debts on this fashion.

            <p>
               <hi>Monsieur Bretagne,</hi> in <hi>Charles</hi> 9. anno, 1562. in his <hi>Harangue</hi> (Oration) for the third estate at the assembly of Saint <hi>Germaine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Com. de l' estat.</hi>
               </note> after many wayes disputed how to pay that Kings debts, concludes this as the best: The temporall liuings of the Church (sayth hee) are foure millions of rent, yeerely: this sold, would amount to
<pb facs="tcp:9712:51"/>
one hundred and twentie millions. Of these, forty eight millions may be put in sure hands, to interest, for the Clergie, which would yeerely yeeld them their foure millions, <hi>à denier douze,</hi> at 8. and one third of eight in the hundred, as commonly they let in France. Then would remaine for the King seuenty two millions: wherewith forty two millions hee might pay his debts, and redeeme his Domaine and Finances morgaged: And with the thirtie that remayne, he might fortifie his frontiers, entertayne his Garrisons, encrease his <hi>Ban</hi> and <hi>Arrierban,</hi> and furnish himselfe with Shipping. If in those dayes, so wise a Counseller, as was any in the land, could not deuise possibly how to pay the Kings debtes, without selling the Church lands, you may imagine it will be a hard matter, to deuise how to discharge them now, that they bee growne fiue times so great, as then they were. For all his Domayne is morgaged, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is sayd, or at least the greater part, and (as <hi>La Nouë</hi> sayth) that is engaged for 15. millions,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>La Nouë.</hi>
               </note> which is worth 50.</p>
            <p>His rents of his Aydes are also gone: for they are engaged to each Generallity in France, as of <hi>Paris, Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, Caen, &amp;c.</hi> to the number of one &amp; twenty of them, and each hath his portion therein: which would be too tedious to set downe in particular. His Offices are all sold, and many thousand erected, ouer and besides the ordinarie, and money also made of them. His poore people are already with these ciuill Warres so spoyled, and impouerished, as there is almost nothing to be had.</p>
            <p>I see not therefore, but we should say of this King, as the <hi>Recueil de l' estat de France</hi> saith of the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy,</hi>

            <p>Of these 8. meanes I wil giue you particular obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and then conclude, what is generally holden to be the whole Reuenue of the Crowne of France, by all these meanes.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9712:52"/>There are 2. sorts of Domaines, First, the rent which the King holds in his hands, of the Feifes giuen for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: Secondly, that which is vnited and incorporate to the Crowne. The rights of the Domaine are these: <hi>Rents, Fifts, payments at alienations, tributes, peages, toll,</hi> of whatsoeuer enters or comes out of Cities, woods, forrests, and diuers other.</p>
            <p>This is the most ancient and most lawfull ground and foundation of Finances: For yee shall obserue in <hi>Liuy,</hi>

            <p>That is Domaine, which belongeth to the Crowne: First, either by Possession, time out of mind: Or second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Reunion, for want of heires males, as the Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages when they returne: Thirdly, or by Confusion, for want of such as can make iust claime, much like our concealed lands in England: Or lastly, by Confiscati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of offenders inheritances.</p>

For in all other cases, all Lawyers and Historiens of France agree, that it is inalienable, and many Arrests haue beene made of late yeeres to confirme it.

            <p>These (<hi>tailles</hi>) were first raysed by Saint <hi>Lewes</hi> (but by way of extraordinary Subsidie.) <hi>Charles</hi> the 7. made them ordinary for the maintenance of his <hi>Gendarmerie.</hi> And whereas at first they were neuer leuyed but by consent of the three States, and to endure but while the warre lasted, he made them perpetuall.

            </p>
            <p>Lastly, there is the <hi>sold,</hi> or pay of 50000. foote, which ye may remember were erected by <hi>Lewes</hi> the eleuenth, in eight legions, sixe thousand to a legion, which with their Officers, come about this number. To maintaine these Legions, there was a taxe leuyed vpon all sortes of persons priuiledged in the (<hi>taille</hi>) but onely the Nobles. (There are also the <hi>Decymes</hi> (Tenthes) leuyed vpon the Church.) For the leuying of the <hi>taille, taillon,</hi>

            <p>So doe they to the <hi>Maieures, Consuls, Escheuins,</hi> and chiefe Officers of euery City, that are lyable to any of these payments, who rating euery man according to his abilitie, giue these Rolles to certayne Collectors to gather it vp: These are bound to bring it quarterly to the Receiuers.

In those of Gold I must be better instructed my selfe, for I know not but the Crowne, which is of three or foure sorts, whereof that of the Sunne is the best, and the halfe Crowne. Those of Siluer are these, the <hi>Liure</hi> or <hi>Franc,</hi> which is 2. shillings sterling: The <hi>quart d' escu,</hi> which is 1. shilling, 6. pence.

Those of Brasse, is the peece of sixe Blanks, which is three pence: that of three blankes, three halfe pence. The <hi>soubs</hi> of 12. <hi>deniers</hi>: the <hi>liard</hi> of foure <hi>deniers,</hi> the <hi>double,</hi> of two: and lastly, the <hi>denier</hi> it selfe, whereof tenne make 1. peny ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

            <p>But in as much as the better halfe of their Reuenue is by the <hi>baise-mani,</hi> there remaineth the better halfe of the land to the other two States: which notwithstanding is a proportion small ynough.</p>

            <p>Some say, they had the name of <hi>Huguenots,</hi> of the words wherewith they began their Oration, when they prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which began thus, <hi>Huc nos venimus, &amp;c.</hi> Hither we are come, &amp;c.

            <p>This Authour reprooueth two things in the French apparrell.

            <p>The second thing he dislikes, is this, that <hi>De deux ans en deux ans les façons changent</hi>: Euery two yere the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on changeth. And heereof it commeth, that when ye see all other Nations paynted in the proper habit of their Countrey, the French man is alwayes pictured
<pb facs="tcp:9712:77"/>
with a paire of sheeres in his hand, to signify, that hee hath no peculiar habit of his own, nor contenteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe long with the habit of any other, but according to his cappriccious humour, deuiseth daily new fashions.</p>
            <p>This variety of fashions a man may well note in the Fripperies of <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises.</hi>
               </note> me thinks, the Frenchman is very immoderate, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in those which are somewhat violent; for ye may remember, ye haue seene them play Sets at Tennise in the heat of Summer, &amp; height of the day, when others were scarce able to stirre out of dores. This immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate play in this vnseasonable time, together with their intemperate drinking and feeding, is the onely cause, that heere ye see them generally itchy &amp; scabbed, some of them in so foule a sort, as they are vnfit for any honest table.</p>
            <p>Among all the exercises of France, I preferre none before the <hi>Palle-maille,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Palle-maille.</hi>
               </note> both because it is a Gentleman-like sport, not violent, and yeelds good occasion and opportunity of discourse, as they walke from the one marke to the other. I maruell, among many more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish and foolish toyes, which wee haue brought out of France, that wee haue not brought this sport also into England.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Shooting in the Peece,</hi>
               </note>Concerning their shooting with the Crossebowe, it is vsed, but not very commonly. Once in a yere, there is in each city a shooting with the Peece at a Popingay of wood, set vpon some high steeple (as also they doe
<pb facs="tcp:9712:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in many places of Germany.) He that hitteth it downe, is called the King for that yere, and is free from all taxe: besides, he is allowed twenty crownes towards the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a Collation for the rest of the shooters. And if it happen, that three yeres together he carry the Prize, he is free from all taxe and imposition whatsoeuer, all his life after.</p>
            <p>This custome, no question, is very laudable, whose end tendeth much to a publike benefit: for by this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise and emulation, he groweth more ready and perfit in the vse of his Peece, and so more able and fit to do his Countrey seruice. And I suppose, if in times past wee had had like Prizes for the long Bow (the ancient glory of our English seruice) we had not so soone quit the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise thereof, nor degenerate so farre from ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome. So doe I thinke, that in these dayes, wherein the Peece is onely prized, if wee had this fashion of France and Germany in England, to reward him in euery place that should best deserue therein, that our Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would grow more perfit &amp; expert in the vse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, at whose vnaptnesse and aukwardnesse in their first trayning, before they come to haue serued some time, I haue often maruayled.</p>
            <p>He hath also his sports of bowling, carding, dicing, and other vnlawful, and vnvseful games, whereof I will omit to speake, being too common both with them and vs.</p>
            <p>As for the exercise of Tennis play,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tennis Play.</hi>
               </note> which I aboue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, it is more here vsed, then in all Christendome besides; whereof may witnesse the infinite number of Tennis Courts throughout the land, insomuch as yee cannot finde that little <hi>Burgade,</hi> or towne in France, that
<pb facs="tcp:9712:78"/>
hath not one or moe of them. Here are, as you see, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score in <hi>Orleans,</hi> and I know not how many hundred there be in <hi>Paris:</hi> but of this I am sure, that if there were in other places the like proportion, ye should haue two Tennis Courts, for euery one Church through France. Me thinks it is also strange, how apt they be here to play well, that ye would thinke they were borne with Rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets in their hands, euen the children themselues ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage them so well, and some of their women also, as we obserued at <hi>Blois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is this one great abuse in this exercise, that the Magistrates do suffer euery poore Citizen, and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to play thereat, who spendeth that on the Holyday, at Tennis, which hee got the whole weeke, for the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of his poore family. A thing more hurtfull then our Ale-houses in England, though the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be bad ynough. And of this I dare assure you, that of this sort of poore people, there be more Tennis Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in France, then Ale-drinkers, or Malt-wormes (as they call them) with vs.</p>
            <p>You obserue here, that their Balles are of cloth, which fashion they haue held this seuen yeeres: before which time they were of lether, like ours. Much more might be said of this exercise, but I will not reade you a Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Schoole of Tennis, whom I confesse the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Scholler.</p>

For yee shall not onely see the <hi>Damoiselles</hi> (Gentlewomen) and them of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort, but euery poore <hi>Chapperonnieze</hi> (draggletayle) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Coblers daughter, that can Dance with good measure, &amp; Arte, all your <hi>Quarantes, Leualties, Bransles,</hi> &amp; other Dances whatsoeuer: notsomuch but the <hi>Chambri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere</hi> (Chamber-maid) and poore Citizens wife, Dance v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually in the Citie streets, in a round, like our countrey lasses on their towne greene, about the May-pole, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king musick of their own voices, without any instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And rather then faile, the old women themselues, both Gentle &amp; base, who haue moe toes then teeth, and these that are left, leaping in their heads, like Iacks in Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, will beare their part. This argueth (I will not say a lightnes &amp; immodesty in behauiour) but a stirring spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp; liuelynesse in the French nature: whereof also the Musicke and songs they haue, is no small argument:<note place="margin">

Whereby it should seeme, it is a winning and perswading language. But this is onely the opinion of themselues, who are dotingly more in loue with their owne tongue, then with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which is the reason, that yee haue now almost all Histories, Greeke, and Latine, translated into French, yea, and the Artes also: insomuch as now the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man readeth these things in his owne language onely: a course in my opinion most preiudicial to all good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>There is one reason, me thinks, aboue all other, why the Frenchman affects to haue his tongue delicate and smooth, namely, for that rather then hee will lose the nigardise thereof, contrary to all rules of Grammar, and all other tongues, he obserueth no gender, where it may hinder the sweetnesse of the pronunciation (an Italian fault this, to take the Masculine for the Feminine: the more beast he.)</p>

               </note> that it is compounded of the French &amp; Almaine: so iudgeth he rightly of the French, that it is the daughter of the Latine and Greeke: for, as for that which it hath common with the Italian, both in word and phrase (which is very much) the Italian, no questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, had it from hence, this French being the more ancient Language: and this nation hauing left in Italy, with the memory of many great victories, the vse also of many of their words, as by all Historie appeareth, without which, at this day the Italian could not serue himself of his owne.</p>
            <p>True it is, that now of late, the French, especially in the Court, haue gotten many of theirs in vse, for a grace forsooth, not of necessity; wherein they much resemble vs of England, who (they say) send diuers skinnes into other countries, which those people vse to their necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and make toyes and bables of the tayles, which they returne backe againe to vs, at as great a rate, as they bought the whole.</p>
            <p>Concerning the difference betweene the language vsed at this day, and that of former times, ye are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, that all things in this world haue their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, growings, perfection, corruption and alteration: As maners of liuing, formes of gouernment, abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Lawes, change of Militarie seruice, new-fangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of habit, new fashion of building, diuersities of Armour, new inuentions of instruments, &amp;c.

<pb facs="tcp:9712:80"/>
nor no language in the world more then this of the French.</p>
            <p>For as <hi>Polibius</hi> sayeth of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that when they should conclude a Peace, after the second <hi>Punicke</hi> warre with them of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that they could not reade the Articles of the first, so much was the Character: And as <hi>Liuie</hi> saith of the song which the <hi>Sabin</hi> Priestes vsed in their sacrifice, that they were so olde Latine, they could not be vnderstoode: And as wee may say of our <hi>English,</hi> that it very much differeth from that of <hi>Chaucers</hi> time: so saith <hi>Lu.
