            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is matter of unspeakable grief and sorrow, to consider how great Indignation the Lord hath let forth against us, heaping wrath upon wrath, and making one Judgment to follow an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; as the waves of the Sea, and for the most part, the fruits thereof through the Land, have bin no other then further departing from his wayes, and dividing one from another in judgment and affection. Our breach is wide as the Sea, and who can heal it? Spirituall Judgments especially are multiplied upon us, Temptations abound, and Divine Influences are restrained He hath poured upon us the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his anger, and the strength of battell, and it hath set us on fire round about, yet we knew it not, and it burneth us, yet we lay it not to heart. There is no returning to the Lord, his hand is stretched out still; and is there not great cause to fear, lest the glory of the Lord should depart from amongst us? It were good for us, if we could (with <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) remember all our desireable things which we had in the dayes of old, and compare them with the days of our misery and affiction. If we look back to that which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained of the Work of Reformation (notwithstanding our short coming in the power and practice of godlinesse) what purity was there of worship? What soundnesse of Doctrine? Unity of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pastors? order and authoritie of Assemblies? What endeavours for promoving the power of godlinesse? for purging of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Judicatories and Armies? and for employing such in places of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94267:3"/>
power and trust, as were of constant integritie and good affection to the Cause, and of blamelesse conversation. And again, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how in place of these, within these two years, have succeeded for unity, division, for order, confusion, for purity of worship, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward contempt; for the power of godlinesse, Atheisme and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; for purging of the Ministery, Judicatories and Armies, sinfull mixtures; for zeal, lukewarmnesse and tolleration. It is too palpable, that we are far gone on in the way of declining, having lost much of that which we had attained, and that which remains being ready to die. If we look before us, it seems now there is a wide door open for conjunction with all parties, in case of straits and necessities. How subtile are the devices of Sathan, to make use of the same bad principle, for contrary ends, and may we not make use of what was said in former times, to the declining children of this Church? How will posterity blame us that we have not resisted the beginnings of evils? Shall not their hearts mourn, when they shall behold so fair a Fabrick, so dearly conquest, so firmly grounded, to be so pittifully ruined be their fathers? If we look inward to our own hearts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have had most of the Lords Spirit with us in the old ways, or the late; and whether our spirits were then more with the Lord, or now? It is easie to judge: If we look about us on every hand, what hardening is there of Adversaries of all sorts? what offence given to the weak, who see changes of parties, and fear change of Principles and Interests, when they perceive conjunction with those against whom the Covenant was made, and deserting of these for whom it was made; and see mens interests preferred to the Lords; sinfull mixtures make way for sinfull separations, and the preferring of mans interest to Gods, makes our Adversaries to be exalted over us. Thus he writes our sin upon our judgment; and because we tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted his Interests to his Adversaries, therefore he gives up our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests to the power of our Adversaries; and Judgment hath entered by the door, which Policy had locked fastest. It was the complaint of the non-Conformists of old, that Conformitie was preferred to the duties of the first and second Table; for if a Minister were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, grosse faults were passed over in silence; and if he were not conform, though an able, painfull, and gracious Pastor, and blamelesse in his conversation yet he was the object of persecution. This was held by the non-Conformists, a sure sign of defection in the Church: We wish there were nothing like this amongst us, and that insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94267:3"/>
and scandalous Ministers, made not a Sanctuary of the Publick Resolutions. What Acts are made against Expectants, Students, and Profedors, which are not of this judgment, we desire may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred; And we have it to regrate, That too many make it their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice upon this ground, to debar such as would be usefull in the Lords Vineyard. How great influence this hath also had, and may farther have in all Elections, we need not mention. How much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious time have the publick resolutions caused to be spent in debates, and thereby many diversions from most necessary duties, &amp;c. is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great stumbling, both to the weak, and to strangers which are amongst us, that grosse ignorance and scandals are not onely to be found in Professours uncensured, but also amongst Elders; and that many Ministers are not onely carelesse to instruct the ignorant, and to endeavour, that scandals may be censured, but some are openly given to the same themselves, and not onely no course taken to censure them, but some who have been justly censured for prophaneness and malignancie, are re admitted; and unqualified Expectants in some places, put in the Ministery. The approbation of the publick Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being made a main part of qualification. We hope it will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily acknowledged on all hands, that there hath been a great back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding of heart from the Lord; for the which we are filled with our own wayes; We trust also that there be few that will deny, that the Lords quarrell against us is for his broken Covenant; and therefore it is, that he hath threatned against us, as against <hi>Israel,</hi> not only that we shall not be a Kingdom, but that we shall not be a Nation, nor a Church, but put away by a Bill of divorce. It is high-time for us then, to <hi>search and try our wayes, and turn again to the Lord.</hi> Let us examine by what way we have departed from him, that by the same steps we may return, wherein the Land hath declined from their sworn Covenant with the Lord, and known principles, before this ruine came upon us; and wherein they have sithence further depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by staying upon those that smote them, and forsaking the Lord, the Covenanted God of this Nation. It was unto us no small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of grief and trouble, that the testimonies given the last; year a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Publick Resolutions of the Commission of the General! Assembly 1650 and against the Meeting at <hi>S. Andrewes</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> and their proceedings, was looked upon by many (of whom we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to judge charitably) as not proceeding from principles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but as a Compliance with the Invaders of the Land. Blessed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94267:4"/>
be the Lord our God, who knowing our Innocencie and integritie, hath made that cloud of reproach so clear to evanish, as we trust we are now freed from that calumnie, in the judgments and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all judicious and charitable men. There is another advantage on your path, that you are now free from the temptations; which redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced many to act and co<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itting of these men, concerning whom the contest was the last year, into places of power and trust over the Work and People of God. An Overture was made to us at our Meeting in Winter last, That we would desist from making use of any power derived from the Generall Assembly 1650. And we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ved we had ground to expect on the other hand, that no use should have been made of any power, by vertue of the Meeting at <hi>S. Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee.</hi> And that in the mean time, endeavour should have been used for agreement, which was assayed by us once, and again; but the advantages of the time having setled on another quarter then that season wherein the Overture was made, did seem to promise to such who did not well consider principles and parties. It is now fallen out other wise, and by power from them, without any agreement you are now conveened. In the Meeting at <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> it was earnestly desi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed, that there might have been an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment, which through the Lords blessing might have prevented much of the division that hath since fallen out, and the differences that were amongst us, might have been more easily removed. The breach is now wider, and only the strong hand of the Lord can help us. If you should now again proceed to assume unto your selves the power, and constitute your selves into a Generall Assembly, we look upon it as a very great obstruction in the way of our agreement, and (as that which for ought we can yet see) may highten the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: The Lord is calling to Holinesse, and to return to the Work of Reformation, and purging the Church according to the Word of God, and approven rules of this Kirk, and not to confirm the last years proceedings, which were the chief ground of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions It is a thing beyond all question in reason, that all doubts and objections proponed, concerning the constitution of an Assembly,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94267:4"/>
ought to proceed the constitution, and not to follow after it. When the question is determined, sad experience may teach us, from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, what influence an Assembly hath according to its consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, right or wrong; for which cause, the Generall Assembly 1639. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

               </gap> determine the keeping and authorizing corrupt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assemblies, to be one of the chief causes of the many evils which had befallen this Church in time of defection.

               </gap>sly consider, how inconvenient and unwarrantable it is for you, to constitute your selves into a Generall Assembly, and to assume the Power and Authority thereof, not only when the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by which you are conveened, is so much questioned, and such prelimitations are upon the elections of Commissioners; but when you also want the concurrence of so many Presbyteries, who are not clear in their consciences to concur with you. And when you want the concurrence of Commissioners from burrows, who by reason of their present in capacity, cannot send Commissioners to sit in any As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly. And when the far greater part of Commissions from Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and Universities are questioned and contraverted, by Dissents and Protestations in their meetings for Election; and some by reason of usurpation of them who are no Presbyteries: So that we know not how few can be admitted unquestioned Members; and besides we beseech you, consider how great a snare your former actings which were not to Edification, have been to some people to tempt them to the way of separation, and to the shaking of the Government of this Church, from which as we desire to be keeped free as from a course highly displeasing to God, and impedimentall to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So we desire you may not tempt them further, and lay new snares in the way of any, by your not right using of so precious an Ordinance of Christ, as are the Assemblies of this Church Upon these, and other grounds, we are constrained to make this Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you, That without assuming any such power unto your selves, you would be pleased to appoint a Conference with us, wherein we may (with the Lords Assista<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce.) search out the causes of his wrath against us, and freely and friendly debate concerning our Differences, and propone Overtures, and Remedies for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both the one and the other: In order thereunto, we offer these Propositions herewith communicated, for the Subject of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; it being our earnest desire, that an agreement being made,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94267:5"/>
we may through the Lords blessing, have a free, and lawfull well constituted Generall Assembly. And now having laid these our thoughts and desires before you, we do solemnly obtest you by the Meeknesse, and Gentlesse of Christ, by his Consolations, and the comfort of his Love, and by the fellowship of the Spirit: If there be any bowels and mercies, by the affection which you bear to the Word of Truth, to the Peace and Order of this Church, to the Lords precious Ordinances, and to his people in this generation, and to the posterity, that you will take these things into your serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and hearken to our Request. Who knoweth but the Lord may have compassion on our condition, and <hi>bring the blinde by a way they know not, lead them in paths they have not known, make darknesse light before us, and crooked things straight?</hi> Even do all these things unto us, and not forsake us.</p>

Therefore for satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Consciences, and for the securing the Work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, for purging the Church, and for promoving the power of Godlinesse, and for removing of these sad differences, and for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and preserving a good understanding, We desire,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> That they give evidence, and assurance that they approve of, and will adhere unto, our Covenants, and the solemn Publick Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sins, and engagement to Duties, and all the Acts of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traversed Assemblies of this Church, for advancing the work of Reformation, in the Litterall and Genuine sense and meaning thereof: And that in dispensing of the Ordinances, censuring of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94267:5"/>
scandalous persons, receiving of Penitents, trying, admitting, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, &amp; deposing of Church officers, they walk according to the same.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> That it may be laid seriously to heart before the Lord, how after such a defection, and so sad judgements for it, the Lord may be restored to his Honour, the Land to his Favour, and the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection prevented in time coming.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> That as we are ready in our station to follow all religious &amp; conscionable means and overtures for securing, and guarding of the Cause and VVork of God, against Errour, Heresie, and Schisme, on the one hand: So they would hold out to us a solide Way for securing the same, against dangers from Malignancie on the other. And, we desire to know what shal be the Characters in time coming by which Malignants may be known, and judged.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> That a reall and effectuall course be taken, according to the established Rule of this Kirk, for purging out, and holding out all such from being Church Officers as have not the positive quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications required in the Word of God, and Acts of this Kirk; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that Ministers deposed by lawfull Assemblies, who have intruded themselves, or have been unwarnantably restored by Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, and Presbyteries to their charges, contrary to the Form, and Order prescribed in the Acts of Assemblies, be removed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign censures inflicted, and that sufficient provision be made for preventing the like in time coming.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>V.</hi> That effectuall means be fallen upon, and followed for censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all Scandals, and scandalous persons, and casting out of these who shall be found grosly, and obstinately scandalous, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, after they are made inexcusable by sufficient means, and pains taken for their instructing, and reclaiming.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>VI.</hi> That some course more effectuall then any hath been fallen upon hitherto, may be condescended upon, for putting in execution the Acts of this Kirk, anent debarring from the Lords Table such persons, who are found not to walk sutable to the Gospel, and have not the knowledge to examine themselves, and to discern the Lords Body.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>VII.</hi> That in the receiving of Penitents, care may be had, that none be admitted to the publick Profession of Repentance, or recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the Church, but these who are found to give such evidence of their Repentance, as is expressed in the Acts of the Assemblies, concerning the receiving of Penitents.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94267:6"/>
               <hi>VIII.</hi> That an effectuall course may be taken for securing of the Work and People of God, from the harme and evill consequences which bath already, and may further ensue from the late pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Assembly, at <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> and the Acts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and for preserving the right constitution of free Generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies for time to come.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Protestation of the Ministers, Elders, and Professors under subscribing for themselves, and in name of many others well-affected Ministers, Elders and People.</head>
            <p>IT is so wel known to divers of your number, what peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours we have used without successe, in order to the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the differences that are amongst us, that we shall not trouble you therewith; nor how we were neglected in the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding timeous advertisements for your last Meeting in this place, where a desire of reconciliation was presented, but peremptorily the electing and sending of Commissioners from Presbyteries, to keep the day indicted by the pretended authority of the Meeting at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi> was concluded on as the only mean to heal our breach; and not so much as some few dayes of delay could be obtained, by these few of our number which were then present, whereby they might give advertisement to others. We have laboured with some in private, and have given a Paper to all in publick, with some Propositions, wherein we have the concurrence of the generality of the Godly in the Land, earnestly entreating a conference, wherein we might have opportunity with the Lords assistance, to have laid before you the Causes of the Lords controversie against the Land, and how we might be united in the Lord; being ready also to have heard what
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94267:6"/>
you should offer to us upon the same subject; but this ye have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied unto us, and proceeded to assume the power, and constitute your selves into a Generall Assembly. It is a burden upon our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and we have no delight to be contesting with, and opposing any who professe themselves to be maintainers of the Government of this Kirk; but the truth is (with grief of heart we desire to speak it; for we think that it doth much provoke the Lord, and threaten his departure from the Land) that although with the renewing of the Nationall Covenant, and with the casting out of Prelates, and the corruptions introduced by them, the Lord was graciously pleased to give repentance to not a few, who were involved in that defection; yet since that time there hath alwayes remained a corrupt party of insufficient, scandalous, and ill-affected Ministers in this Kirk, enemies to the power of Godlinesse, and Obstructers of the Work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and purging of the Kirk, whereof many were sworn Vassals to the Prelats (as we are able to make good by their subscriptions to horrid oaths) this party complied with the times, and pretended for Reformation, though they were groaning under it as a heavy yoke which they could not endure, as did appear by their carriage and expressions, upon several occasions, when any revolution offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them the opportunity of discovering their mindes, particularly in the time of <hi>James Grahams</hi> Prevailing, and of the Engagement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>England;</hi> and having of lategotten a greater advantage then at any time before, since the beginning of this Reformation, by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Resolutions and actings of the Commission for bringing in of the Malignant party, to places of power and trust, and bearing down of such as were opposers of these Resolutions, and had bin faithfull and straight in the Cause, and stirring up the Civill Magistrate against them, subjecting also the liberty of the Word in the mouth of Christs Ambassadors for the reproof of sin, to the immediat judiciall cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, restraint and censure of the Civill Magistrate, contrary to the many Acts and practices of our Predecessors grounded on the Word of God, and our Covenants, having the countenance of King, State and Army, and diverse worthy and gracious men (of whom we shall ever esteem honourable, and love them dearly) upon consideration of the straits and pressures of the time, concurring also with them in the Publick Resolutions, that Party perceiving, that they were not able to endure tryall in a time of Reformation and purging, began the last year to lift up their heads, and speak the language of their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94267:7"/>
own, being much encouraged by the Constitution, Acts and Censures of the pretended Assembly at <hi>S. Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> they have so strengthened themselves by their practices since in the Judicatories of the Kirk, as they now carry the determinations ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to their own ends. And may we not with sad hearts say, what can be expected from such of whom we have experience, how forward they are to favour wicked men, and every evill course, to persecute such as make conscience to seek the Lord in sincerity of heart, and suppresse the power of godlinesse, and to open the door of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery to such as for insufficiencie, scandals, or dis-affection, have been justly deposed, and to bring in the like. In regard whereof, we wish there were not too great cause to make use of the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>I have seen also in the Prophets of Jerusalem, saith the Lord, a herrid thing, they strengthen the hands of evil doers, that none doth return from his wickednes: therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the Prophets, Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the Prophets of Jerusalem is prophaneness gone forth into all the land.</hi> These things we speak not to reflect upon the Ordinances of Jesus Christ in this Land; it shall be our stedfast purpose (as the Lord shall enable us) to maintain the Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government of this Kirk, and particularly the Nationall Assemblies, which we look upon as a rich priviledge, and speciall blessing from Heaven, for suppressing errour on the one hand, and prophanenesse on the other, so long as they are preserved from corruption in the constitution thereof. And, we trust, all who are acquainted with the principles and practices of our worthy Predecessors, and of the learned and godly non-Conformists in <hi>England,</hi> wil easily see how far we are from their judgments who follow the wayes of separation. We hold it our duty, firmly to adhere to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein (through the Lords goodnes) we do this day enjoy the purity of Doctrine and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and the Government which Christ hath appointed in his House, though there be corruptions in the Constitution of a pretended Assembly. Whereby we are deprived of the benefit of a free, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and well constitute Assembly for the present; where we meet with corruptions, we shall (the Lord assisting) disclaime and oppose them. And herein we have the approbation of the first and second Assembly of this Kirk, in the beginning of this last Reformation; the one annulling and declaring void six se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94267:7"/>
Assemblies, upon many of the same grounds, for which we do protest against the present corrupt Assemblies. And the other having clearly determined the keeping, and Authorizing corrupt Generall Assemblies, to have been one of the chief causes of the many evills which have befallen this Church. We trust in the Lord our God, that our Actions shall abundantly witnesse for us in this respect, and so we shall not further insist upon it. We have clear grounds in Scripture to warrand us to plead, and testific against Corruption; and therefore being sensible that there is a course of defection carried on in the Church, we have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, first to prevent the same, in the beginnings thereof, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to give Testimony against it, as it comes to be discovered to us; We have since studied in a Christian, and brotherly way, to reclaime the Authors thereof, and these that have concurred with them, and now when still we perceive our labours and endeavours to be without successe, as we professe our adherence to former Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies against the late Defection, so we are necessitated to adde this upon the grounds before mentioned; and for all, or some of the Reasons following.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> This meeting hath dependance upon, and the power and authority to which it can lay claime; for the indiction thereof is derived from the pretended Assembly which met at <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> and adjourned to <hi>Dundee,</hi> which being unfree, unlawfull, and corrupt, cannot derive or communicate to another that which it had not in it self.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> It is constitute after the same manner (for the most part) of the Members constituted as the former pretended Assembly, of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which were Authors, and Abettors of and have carried on a course of defection in this Church, contrary to the VVord of God, the solemn League and Covenant, the solemn Engagement, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Acts and Declarations of the Kirk, which Persons being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der so great a scandall, are by the Acts of the Kirk incapable to be Members of Generall Assemblies.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> Because of the pre-limitation of Election by the Acts made at <hi>Dundee,</hi> injoyning Provinciall Synods, and Presbyteries to proceed with the Censures of the Kirk against Ministers, Students, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctants, &amp; Professors, who altogether opposed the Publick Resolutions, or shall not acquiesce to the Acts made at <hi>Dundee;</hi> and so excludes all who are not involved in the course of defection, as incapable of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is a corrupt rule for election and constituting Assemblies;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94267:8"/>
and in pursuance thereof, there were several pre-limitations made since by severall Synods, and Ptesbyteries, in their Acts, Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Proceedings of the pretended Assembly at <hi>Dundee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> There are many Presbyteries who have expresly refused to send Commissioners to this meeting as an Assembly and who do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in Protesting against the same, and where Presbyteries have sent Commissioners, the Elections are generally contraverted, there being Protestations made, or at least dissents entred against most of their Elections upon good grounds conform to the Acts of the Kirk; also there be wanting Commissioners from Burrows, who in regard of their present incapacity, cannot send Commissioners. The generality of the godly in the Land go along with us, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our protesting against this meeting, as an unlawfull and corrupt Assembly.</p>
            <p>Therefore from the zeal we owe to the glory of God, to this Cause and Truth, the Duty of our Callings, as set for the defence of the Gospel, and according to our Covenant, wherein we are bound to prevent, and reveal all parties and courses contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, from the sense of the awful judgements of an angry God, both felt, and feared for these begun, and continued in-defections, that we may according to the example of our forefathers, acquit our selves as guiltlesse of this growing Apostacie to the present age, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to our posterity the right Constitution of free and lawfull Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assemblies, and to prevent the Lords giving a Bill of divorce to the Land. We do hereby solemnly Declare and Protest, against the Constitution, Authority, Acts, and Proceedings of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Assembly met at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and particularly against their ratifying or renewing the former defection, in the matter of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Resolutions, and against their entering into any the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie, or association with any party opposite in Principles, and Practices to the Word, Work, Covenant, Cause, and People of God in this Land, against their appointing of Commissions, emitting of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, Warnings, Causes of Humiliation, and against their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and discussing of Appeals, References, and Dissents, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing competent to a free, lawfull Generall Assembly, and that neither the Authority, Acts, or Censures of the meeting at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> or of this present Meeting, shall be obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to any Synod, Presbytery, Minister, Elder, or Member of this Church. And we do humbly beseech and implore the Lord our God,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94267:8"/>
that he wil not look upon these your proceedings as the deeds of the representative of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor impute the same into the Collective Body; But that he would be pleased in his mercy, freely to pardon all our transgressions. And we do further protest, that the General Assembly 1650 be held and accounted in this Church as the last free and lawfull Generall Assembly; And that it shall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to us, and every one of us, to continue in the full and free exercise of our Function, and in our Callings and stations to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and keep the former good old Principles, Declarations, and Acts of the lawfull and free Generall Assemblies of this Kirk, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any Declarations, Warnings, Proceeding, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the said Meetings at St. <hi>Andrews, Dundee,</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> or any Commission following therefrom, or any exemption thereof, by any other; and likewise that it shall be lawfull to conveen in a free Generall Assembly, when the Lord shall give opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And lastly, We do Protest, that it shall be lawfull to us to give in to this Meeting, or publish to the World, or to present to the first free and lawfull Generall Assembly this our Protestation, and to enlarge the same as shall be found most to conduce to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, the good of his Work, comfort of his People, and for our exoneration. In Testimony thereof, We subscribe thir presents, and do take Instruments.</p>

and confer about Overtures, how to make the matters of their Propositions practicable and effectuall in their own stations, according to their capacities. And the next morning, the minde of the several Committees upon that matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reported in writ. The several clerks of these Committees were apointed to meet together, and draw up in one Paper, all that was reported, which being done, there was another Committee appointed to meet upon it, and to consult and advise more deliberately thereanent, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their diligence upon <hi>Munday</hi> to the whole Meeting, whereby it appears that they do really, and seriously mind the work themselves, which they prop<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
