            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>FOR the dislike that I haue conceiued in the vse and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> I take it to be grounded on eight princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
reasons and arguments.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 First, that in their vse or custome, no methode of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is obserued. Diuersitie and distinction of persons, tymes
and seasons considered, no varietie of accidents and diseases
pondered.</item>
               <item>2 Secondly, for that it is in qualitie and complexion more hot
and drye then may be conueniently vsed dayly of any man:
much lesse of the hot and cholericque constitution.</item>
               <item>3 Thirdly, for that it is experimented and tryed to be a most
strong and violent purge.</item>
               <item>4 Fourthly, for that it withereth and drieth vp naturall moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
in our bodies, therby causing sterrilitie and barrennesse:
In which respect it seemeth an enemie to the continuaunce
and propagacion of mankinde.</item>
               <item>5 Fiftly, for that it decayeth and dissipateh naturall heate, that
kindly warmeth in vs, and thereby is cause of crudities and
rewmes, occasions of infinit maladies.</item>
               <item>6 Sixtly, for that this herb or rather weed, seemeth not voide
of venome and poison, and thereby seemeth an enemie to the
lyfe of men.</item>
               <item>7 Seauenthly, for that the first author and finder hereof was
the Diuell, and the first practisers of the same were the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells
Priests, and therefore not to be vsed of vs Christians.</item>
               <item>8 Last of all, because it is a great augmentor of all sorts of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie
in our bodies, a humor fit to prepare our bodies to
receaue the prestigations and hellish illusions and impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Diuell himselfe: in so much that many Phisitions
and learned men doe hold this humour to be the verie seate
of the Diuell in bodies possessed.</item>

the Common weale it is perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
so in the preseruation of

adiudged most dangerous.</p>
               <p>But that in these our daies, in this land of <hi>England,</hi>
this new come simple of the <hi>West</hi> commonly knowne

this, that it is taken early in the morning, and also very
late at night: in the morning fasting, and in the euening
feasting and on a full stomacke. In the beginning, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
and ende of meales. To be short, at all times, at all

is receiued: for the smoake of <hi>Tabacco</hi> seemeth

that it ought to bee tied to reasons and rules (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perhaps a thing in it selfe more irregular and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable)
seeing that by experience (as they thinck)
they haue found great good &amp; profit by the vse therof.</p>
               <p>They boast much of this their experience as a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

ground for this their disorder. But their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
not grounded on reason, but rather repugnant
thereto, and contrary to commonsence also, is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
sufficient for the simple, but no way an argument
for the wiser sort, to daunce after their vnsauory and
vnpleasant <hi>Tabacco pipe.</hi>

it doth not onely consume and dissipate naturall heat

               <p>For it is not fierie nor immoderate heat in vs, but
rather a milde &amp; vnctuous warmth, consisting in a temt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perate

for his cold reumatick &amp; stomacke. But now said he, I
would that I could so easely leaue it, condicionallie I
had giuen 300 pounds more, for I finde my selfe hart
sick that day, till I haue tasted thereof.</p>
               <p>No doubt the long and dailie vse of drincking <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,</hi>

the same againe, which could, by no other

               <p>For as it hath a powre &amp; faculty to draw to the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
(as other strong purges haue) so likewise hath
it a property and vertue to expell forth the same, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

from other purges, that it seemeth to be of a far

as well by stoole vomits and swetes, as also
by saliuacion, coughing &amp; spittings, which thing other

truely this his assertion seemeth to be grounded vpon
good &amp; substanciall reason. For wheras the vertue and

the body such corrupt &amp; vnholsome humours as haue
any affinitie or likenesse in substance with the purge; &amp;
in healthy bodyes finding none of that disposition &amp;

and euacuateth out of vs by spitting and sweats
&amp; otherwise much of that matter that in time would
proue in vs good blood &amp; good foode for our bodies.
And therefore <hi>Tabacco</hi> must needs be said to be a great
decaier and witherer of our radicall moysture before

               <p>Moreouer <hi>Tabacco</hi> by meanes of his great heat and
immeasurable drinesse, dissipateth naturall heate and

The humors therfore in vs by this meanes made crude

               <p>Hereby it must needs in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequent follow, that the

men much abridged.</p>
               <p>And for certaine proofe that <hi>Tabacco</hi> dryeth vp the

such as haue much vsed it; That whereas before the vse

For no doubt, this fierie fume, dried vp the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie

esteemed deliterious, for that they (being taken in any

and wasting the same.</p>
               <p>In good Authors I finde three kinds of deliterious

or <hi>Opium.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Of the second sort, are those which by their owne
poysoned nature and substance, be deadly offensiue to
the takers therof, and they being receiued but in small
dose or quantitie, kill and poyson the takers thereof.
Such are venemous musrumps, <hi>Napellum, Taxicum,</hi>
and such like.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Of the third kind of deliterious and deadly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
be such, as are by reason of their veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
euacuation, most daungerous and perillous, if in

it is also very pernicious and hurtfull <hi>in his manifest and

one thing may be added therevnto, that <hi>Tabacco</hi> is in

Aniseeds, Nutmegs, and such like sweete and aramati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Spices, partly to take away the vngratefull sent of
the purge, and partly to defend the vitall spirits, &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
parts, from the malice and hurt which otherwise
would happen by the ill qualitie of the purge.</p>
               <p>Out of this rule of preparation of purges, onely
<hi>Aloes Succotrine</hi> is by <hi>Mesnes</hi> excepted. Which as hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth)
is so farre from ill qualitie and deliterious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as that it is commonly giuen with other purges to
amend &amp; correct their venemous &amp; malitious nature.</p>
               <p>But what correctiues I pray you in our time and
Countrey are there vsed in this Indian <hi>Tabacco,</hi> which
the more simple &amp; sincere it is, the more holsome and
effectuall it is adiudged to be? And if it haue by any
meanes any aramaticall spices shufled amongst it, it is
straight reiected and condemned for naught &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.</p>
               <p>I denie not but that since <hi>Hippocratus</hi> and <hi>Mesnes</hi>
time, there haue beene found out sundrie purges by
the latter Arabians, which for that they worke gently
and without offence, are called of them, <hi>Benedicta Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamenta:</hi>
Blessed and safe medicines, and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:3747:16"/>
haue need of no preparation to be vsed with them for
their correction. Such are thought to be <hi>Manna</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria,
Camarinds, Cassia</hi> of <hi>Rhubarbe.</hi> But this <hi>Tabacco</hi>
(now in vse) is of an other keye, and no waies to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<hi>Benedictum</hi> in working, but rather diabolicall
and hellish: for that it worketh with extremitie, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and griefe.</p>
               <p>And that it is also in substance and nature deliteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and venemous,<note place="margin">Tabacco in his nature poison.</note> may be gathered by the symtornes
and accidents which doo immediately follow and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
the large drinking therof. That are, violent vomits,
many and infinite stooles, great gnawings and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the guts and inward parts. Coldnesse in the
outward and externall members, Crampes, Convulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
cold sweats, ill colour, and wannesse of skinne,
defect of feeling, sence, &amp; vnderstanding, losse of sight,
giddinesse of the head and braine, profound and deep
sleepe, faintnesse, sounding, and to some hastie and
vntimely death. All which, or the most part of them
concurring, do manifest a poisoned qualitie or vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
nature in the thing receiued.</p>
               <p>And it is the more daungerous for that it hath in it
the effects of contrary and repuguant poisons:<note place="margin">Tabacco a double poison</note> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
it be in qualitie very hotte &amp; drie, yet hath it a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying
and benumming effect, not much vnlike to
<hi>Opium</hi> or Henbane: which ere held to be colde in the
extreamest degree. And albeit, it be apt to suffocate or
strangle like to Gipsum or playster of Parrise, yet doth
it purge &amp; scoure as violently as Precipatate or Quick-siluer
sublymed.</p>
               <p>I cannot resemble the poysoned force of this <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>For example, the flesh of Vipers in Treacle is so tempered

               <p>So in like maner we denie not but that in smal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
<hi>Tabacco</hi> may be taken of any men without peril or

by the force of the fire wherewith it is ministred.</p>
               <p>For that fire sometimes doth represse the poisoned
vapour of venemous things,<note place="margin">Fire correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth poison.</note> may be prooued by the
testimony of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who (in his 2. booke of his natural
questions,<note place="margin">Seneca. lib. 2. nat. quest. cap. 31.</note> and 31. Chapter, going about to shewe the
reason why that poisoned and venemous beasts do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
engender wormes within them, vntill such time as
they be first striken with lightning) saith, that wormes
are engendred of humours apt to receiue life. But
such be farre differing from such as are of a venemous
or poisoned disposition or nature, for they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
aduersaries and enemies to life. This poisoned
and venemous nature in Serpents (once striken with
lightning) is in them wasted, dissipated &amp; dispearced,
by meanes of the fire in the lightning, and the humors
remaining after in them, beeing freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> venome and
<pb facs="tcp:3747:17"/>
poison, may the more aptly be conuerted into things
bearing life, and to wormes themselues.</p>
               <p>It may also be assigned out of <hi>Mercurialis</hi> for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason,<note place="margin">Hieronimus Mercurialis ll. 1. de veneni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> why wormes are not engendered in poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
serpents, because that wormes haue their originall
from vndigested and crudie humours in the body: <hi>But

and perfectly digested.</hi> Which may well bee gathered by
the fragrant and sweete smell, and pleasant smell and

in those places where they vsually haunt.</p>
               <p>But here may be obiected,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> that if <hi>Tabacco</hi> were of
that poysoned nature (as wee haue affirmed) then no

their bodies, to suffer &amp; endure the same without hurt
or offence: for custome altereth nature.</p>
               <p>In like case I read in <hi>Galen</hi> in his 3.<note place="margin">Galen lib. 3. de simpl med. cap. 18.</note> booke of simples,

(saith he) they were expert and cunning in them.</p>
               <p>So that it is manifest &amp; apparant by the testimonies

               <p>The like is seene in the East <hi>Indies,</hi> where the Turkes
familiarly vse <hi>Opium</hi> in large quantitie, which to vs but
in very small dose is experimented to be manifest poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
onely long vse &amp; familiar practise hath made this
vnconuenient for their bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3747:18"/>And so no doubt if our countrey men from their
infancie had by litle and litle vsed to take this <hi>Tabacco</hi>
fume or other poyson whatsoeuer, they should haue
had as litle cause to feare the daunger thereof, as the
Turkes haue of their <hi>Opium,</hi> or the old Marsitians had
of Vipers, or the West Indians haue of their <hi>Tabacco.</hi>
But for want of that Custome, it fareth with vs in that
sort, that if we take any great quantitie of the <hi>Opium</hi>

else fall into that kinde of dead sleepe, as that we shall
by no other meanes then by the Arch-angels trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
(sounding at the latter day) be awakened thereout.</p>
               <p>To this may be added a secret vertue and specificall
qualitie giuen the Indians by nature, whereby they
are not ouercome by this kinde of poyson, as other
Nations be. For <hi>Sextus Empericus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sextus Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericus.</note> reporteth in the like

no venemous Beast or Serpent whatsoeuer. And that
certaine people of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> did naturally feed &amp; nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
themselues with the flesh of Scorpions.</p>
               <p>But we Englishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may not safely presume that this

                  </gap> vertue &amp; hidden qualitie doth abide or lurk
in vs, seeing that by far weaker poisons then these, we
sustaine infinit perils, and often incurre death it selfe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we haue the lesse cause to venture on
things in reason suspected to be of a venemous &amp; poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
qualitie, because forsoothe the Indians doo it
without offence.</p>
               <p>Neither is it of any great waight or moment which
is alleadged of the <hi>Tabacco</hi> patrons for her commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
that Marriners and Sea-faring men, neuer
<pb facs="tcp:3747:19"/>
found any remedie so forceable against the Scuruie
and other diseases of like nature, commonly incident
to that kinde of people (by meanes of the foggy ayre
in the Sea, and their vnholsome diet) then is the fume
of <hi>Tabacco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reason of this profit in Marriners may bee,
because their bodies after long lying on the Seas, are
filled and stuffed with badde and corrupt humours,
on the which the force and power of <hi>Tabacco</hi> dooth
worke, drawing and purging them forth of the body,
no otherwise then other strong purges expell and
purge forth such corrupt humours as haue any simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
or likenesse to themselues.</p>
               <p>But as strong purges taken of sound and holsome
bodies (as I shewed you before) be very perillous and
dangerous: So truly is <hi>Tabacco,</hi> being taken of such as
are cleare and voyd of such impure and corrupt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which to the Marriners is most familiar and
vsuall.</p>
               <p>The like is seene of other poysons, which when
they find any of their owne qualitie &amp; nature in mans
body, or that hath any likenesse or similitude to them,
they drawe forth the same (the like coue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing his like)
and leaue the sound and healthy humours cleare and
vnspotted.</p>
               <p>But when no such poisoned matter is found in the
bodie, then dooth the poyson or venome receiued,
worke on the good humours, vtterly corrupting and
destroying them. So that it is apparant that sometime
venomes (to venemous and poysoned persons) may
be profitable &amp; medicinable. But to sound &amp; healthy

be the very sediment and dregges of bloud; which is
so farre thicker &amp; colder then bloud, as yeallow chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
is held to be thinner and hotter then the same.</p>
               <p>And this melancholy humour is said to bee of two
sorts: the one naturall, the other vnnaturall.</p>
               <p>The naturall is that thicke part of the bloud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rehearsed. The vnnaturall is not the sediment or
<pb facs="tcp:3747:20"/>
grounds of good bloud, but rather a certain burnt and
parched matter rising of the adustian and scorching of
the other humors, that is, of phlegme, yealow choller,
and of the former sediment of pure bloud, which we
termed naturall melancholy.</p>
               <p>And albeit it seemeth very vnlike that phlegme (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of nature cold and moist) may be any adustian be
turned into swoart and blacke choller; yet in qualitie
and disposition that humour doth often represent and
resemble melancholy it selfe. And therefore <hi>Galen</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
sometimes melancholy to bee ingendered of
phlegmy ouer-hardned and dried.</p>
               <p>The contrarietie and diuersitie of these vnnaturall
melancholies, doth hang and depend on the contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie
and difference of the humours whereof they bee
engendered.</p>
               <p>All these sorts of melancholies are augmented and
encreased much in such as often accustome themselues
to the fume of <hi>Tabacco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For first, touching the natural melancholy, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that the thicker and grosser that the bloud is, the
more of that thicke and earthly sediment it shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
But <hi>Tabacco</hi> thickeneth and engrosseth the
bloud, and therefore <hi>Tabacco</hi> engendereth in vs a
greater store of that thicke and grosse sediment which
wee defined to bee of <hi>Galen</hi> called naturall melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
               <p>The Maior or first Proposition is manifest, for all
liquid and moist things are the more thicke, or thinne,
and cleare, according to the quantitie of the grounds
and feces mixed in the same. For if the groundes
<pb facs="tcp:3747:21"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3747:21"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3747:22"/>
be many, then is the matter or humor troublesome
and thicke. But if the dregges or feces be fewe, then
is the humor cleare and thin.</p>
               <p>The Minor or second Proposition of the former
Sillogisme, may be proued in this sort. All those things
which waste and consume the purest &amp; thinnest parts
of the blood, doo cause the same blood to remaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
more grosse and thicke, and therfore may iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be said to thicken the blood.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Tabacco</hi> wasteth and absumeth the liquid and
thin part of our blood, and therfore <hi>Tabacco</hi> may iustly
be said to thicken the same. The Maior Proposition
being euident, needeth no farther proofe.</p>
               <p>The Minor is prooued by daily and vsuall practise
and experience of such as commonly doo drinke this
<hi>Tabacco.</hi> For thereby doo they purge great store of a
cleare and thin humour, which would mixe it selfe
with the blood, and cause the same to be more liquid
and fluent, and in time also (by good Concoction)
turne into pure and subtile blood, apt to feede and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
the bodie.</p>
               <p>And albeit melancholy (being of nature cold) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to haue no need of phlegmetique and thin hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
to be mixed therewith (least that his colde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
be greatly increased thereby): yet of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
some store of this crude and rawe matter is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to runne with the melancholy Iuice, to moderate
and temper his extreame siccetie and drythe, and to
defend it from Induration &amp; hardnesse. The increase
whereof in our bodies, breedeth dulnesse, sottishnesse,
and blockishnesse. All which are the vsuall effects of
<pb facs="tcp:3747:22"/>
ouer-hardened and dryed melancholie.</p>
               <p>For melancholy ouer-hardened, if it come once
to be cooled, it is extreame cold as Iron. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heat, is extreame hotte; and being cooled againe,
is extreame cold also.</p>
               <p>So this hard and drie melancholy once depriued
of naturall heate by the inordinate vse of <hi>Tabacco</hi>
fewme (the fierie heate of the one dissipating the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
and lesser heate of the other) can yeeld nothing
else but the effects of an excessiue and immoderate
colde cause lying in the veines, and mixed with the
blood. Such are esteemed to bee dulnesse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
blockishnesse, mopishnesse, and sottishnesse, one
of the worst kindes of accidents that commonly ensue
ouer-hardened, cooled and dryed melancholy in our
bodies.</p>
               <p>Againe, such as the partes of the blood be, such
also is thought the blood to bee, and as the blood
prooueth, so likewise are the spirites affected, for they
doo issue and proceed from the blood it selfe. And
such as the spirites are, such also is adiudged to be the
temper and dissipation of the heart and braine: and
as the braine is disposed and affected, so likewise are
the vertues of conceit, imagination, vnderstanding,
and remembrance, affected and disposed also. All
which in particular, by sundrie examples were easie
to prooue, for him that is but meanely seene and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
read in Philosophie sayings, that the sanguine
man by meanes of the puritie of his blood, hath his
braine and inward parts well tempered, his sences
cleare, his spirites light and subtile, his heart bold and
<pb facs="tcp:3747:23"/>
merrie, his minde affable, curteous and ciuil. Whereas
on the contrary part, the melancholy person by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the superfluous earthly and drie matter mixed
with his bloud, hath his complexion more wan and
swarte, his conceit of braine more dull and hard, his
minde giuen to sollitarinesse and priuate life. For
those two humours of bloud and melancholy, are in
both their qualities very repugnant and contrary.
The one being hotte and moyst, the other colde
and drie.</p>
               <p>But here me thinkes I hear you say, what maketh
this idle discourse of bloud and melancholy, of the
disposition of the braine and spirits to your purpose,
or to the reputation of <hi>Tabacco?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Forsoothe very much. For heereby it appeareth
that the continuall practises of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> destroy the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and clearnesse of their bloud, in that as I proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

before, it hardeneth and thickeneth the same.
And in thickening it engendereth dull &amp; melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirites, which make blockish and sottish conceits,
and a timerous and deiected mind not fit or conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for man that delilghteth in ciuilitie and societie of
others. For seeing that the fewme of <hi>Tabacco</hi> yeeldeth
no good foode or nourishment to the pure blood, but
rather troubleth and corrupteth the same, it is thereby
most plaine and euident, that it ingendreth in vs most
dull and troubled spirites, also tasting and sauouring
much of that loathsome fewme and duskish smoake
which rise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and pallate of the mouth, first sent thither through the
<hi>Tabacco</hi> pipe full charged with <hi>Tabacco</hi> dust, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:3747:23"/>
scorched and incinerated by the extreame heate
of the parching fire.</p>
               <p>This darke and smoakie fume, pearsing the cauities
and ventricles of the braine, no otherwise, then a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
winde or adust vapour (rising from an adust
Liuer, or obstructed splene) do breed in vs terror, and
feare, discontentment of life, false and peruerse imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and fantasies most strange, no way depending
vpon iust cause or grounds, and alwaies a melancholy
spirit, a fertfull and timerous minde. For truly the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
darknesse and obscuritie of the braine, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
and terrifie our inward sences and minde also, in
no lesse sort then doth the externall darknesse or myst
of the outward aire, terrifie &amp; apall the same.</p>
               <p>And if any man be farre blinded with <hi>Tabacco,</hi>
that he will not admit for true, that the vapour or fume
thereof ascending to the braine, is darke and swart of
colour, and of qualitie excessiue drie; let him but cast
his eyes on the smoake issuing forth of the nosthrils of
the <hi>Tabacconists,</hi> or to the smoakie tincture left in the
<hi>Tabacco</hi> Pipe after the receit thereof, and he shall easily
reclaime his error. This swart &amp; sottish tincture clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
so fast to the inward part of the Pipe, as hardly by
any means but by the extreme heate of the fire it may
be cleared from thence. And no doubt the like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
doth the same leaue in our braines, and in the
cauities thereof. So that the animall spirits ingendred
in those places, can no lesse but (participating thereof)
sauour of the same, no otherwise then wine put into
an vnsauorie and mustie bottle, doth euer sauour of a
mustie taste.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3747:24"/>Neither am I any waies ignorant that <hi>Aristotle</hi> in

deemed of him the most wisest. But this kinde of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
(which <hi>Aristotle</hi> talketh of) is altogether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
and no way engendreth of the <hi>Tabacco</hi> smoake.

The spirits which issue from this kinde of melancholy,
are verie light, fine and subtile, not much vnlike to the
spirits of wine well distilled, and artificially rectified:
which is by art and force of the fire drawne out of the
feces or grounds of pure wine. And the spirits rising
from this drie melancholy humor, are the thinner and
the more subtile by reason of the closenesse &amp; straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the pores of the same matter: and they are the
more firme &amp; constant in their action, by meanes that
they issue and proceed from an humor more compac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and close vnited.</p>
               <p>The subtilitie therefore and stabilitie of these spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
rising from such a naturall melancholy, doeth
much further the sharpning of the wit and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of man.</p>
               <p>But the like cannot be expected of the spirites ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of that kinde of melancholy which is engendred
by the abuse of <hi>Tabacco.</hi> For this sort of melancholy
humor is neither bright &amp; shining like to molten gold,
nor yet the grounds of pure and perfect blood, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an earthly and adust matter, not much vnlike
<pb facs="tcp:3747:24"/>
stoncole or scorched earth. So that the spirites issuing
from it must needs be of a diuers and farre contrarie
qualitie and nature.</p>
               <p>Last of all, melancholy being of nature cold and
drie, had in reason need of some thin and liquid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
to be mixed therewith, to temper his extreame
siccetie and drythe: which is the qualitie of most of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and annoyance in it. For as phlegme offendeth
most in cold, so doth melancholy falt most in dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tabacco</hi> therefore ought in no respect to be famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
vsed of the melancholy person, because it is exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
drie, both in his manifest qualitie, and likewise by
accidentall meanes of his immoderate purging and
euacuation, by meanes whereof, great part of that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
and moyst matter is purged out of the body that
should retaine and keepe it in perfect state and temper.
And for that <hi>Tabacco</hi> is confessed to be hotte, almost in
the third degree of excesse, therfore his drithe and sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetie
is thereby made the more vehement, and vntolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>So that it is apparant that vnnaturall melancholy,
whether it be made of adustian of bloud, choller, or
phlegmy, or else of the sediment of them, scorched
and as it were in cinerated, hath no small encrease by
the vntimely vse of this phantasticall deuice of <hi>Tabacco</hi>
smoake, leauing in our bodies a fierie impression and
drie distemper, not easily remedied.</p>
               <p>And therefore in my opinion all melancholy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
of what state or condition soeuer they bee of, and
especially Students and Schollers, ought to bee very
<pb facs="tcp:3747:25"/>
well aduised in the vse of so pernitious and dangerous
a thing, least that in them, naturall melancholy be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
into vnnaturall, and this also, either into a corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
and adust humour apt to inflame the braine, or
else into a matter so hard and drie, as that it be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hurtful and offensiue to the vnctuous and radicall
moisture of the life of man: and thereby occasion a
hastie and vntimely death. For no longer can life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
then naturall heate bee refreshed with an ayrie
and moderate moisture included in the radicall
humour, and appointed by nature for
the reliefe and sustentation
of the same.</p>
