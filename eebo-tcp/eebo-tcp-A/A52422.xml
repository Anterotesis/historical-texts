            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO' you have been pleas'd to assign me the Task of an Angel, and in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect have warranted me to disobey you; yet since a considerable part of that experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Knowledge which I have of Happiness is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Delight which I take in your vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and endearing Friendship, I think 'tis but reasonable I should endeavour to give you an <hi>Idea</hi> of that, whereof you have given me the <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You desire to know of me wherein the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Happiness attainable by man in this Life does consist. And here, tho' I see my self engaged in a work already too difficult for me, yet I find it necessary to enlarge it: For since the greatest Happiness, or <hi>Summum Bonum</hi> of this Life is a <hi>Species</hi> of Happiness in general, and since it is call'd (Greatest) not because absolutely perfect and compleat; but inasmuch as it comes nearest to that which indeed is so, it will be necessary first to state the Notion of Happiness in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and then to define wherein that Happiness does consist which is perfect and compleat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48450:3"/>
I can proceed to a Resolution of your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
            <p>By Happiness in the most general Sence of the word, I understand nothing else but an Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Good. The least Degree of Good has the same Proportion to the least Degree of Happiness as the greatest has to the greatest, and consequently as many ways as a man enjoys any Good, so many ways he may be said to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: neither will the Mixture of Evil make him forfeit his Right to this Title, unless it either <hi>equals</hi> the Good he enjoys, or <hi>exceeds</hi> it: And then indeed it does; but the Reason is, because in strictness of Speaking upon the whole Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the man enjoys no Good at all: For if the Good and the Evil be equal-balanc'd, it must needs be indifferent to that man either to be or not to be, there being not the least <hi>Grain</hi> of good to determine his Choice: So that he can no more be said to be happy in that Condition, than he could before he was born. And much less, if the Evil exceeds the Good: For then he is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not happy, but absolutely and purely mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: For after an exact Commensuration sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed between the Good and the Evil, all that remains over of the Evil is pure and simple Misery; which is the Case of the Damn'd: And when 'tis once come to this (whatever some
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48450:3"/>
Mens <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> may perswade them) I am very well satisfied, that 'tis better not to be than to be. But now on the other side, if the Good does never so little out-weigh the Evil, that <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus</hi> of Good is as pure and unallay'd in its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as if there were no such Mixture at all; and consequently the Possession of it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be call'd Happiness.</p>
            <p>I know the Masters of Moral Philosophy do not treat of Happiness in this Latitude; neither is it fit they should: For their Business being to point out the ultimate End of Humane Actions, it would be an impertinent thing for them to give any other <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Happiness</hi> than the highest: But however this does not hinder but that the General <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Happiness</hi> may be extended far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even to the Fruition of any Good whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: Neither is there any reason to find Fault with the Latitude of this Notion, since we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Degrees even in Glory.</p>
            <p>In this General <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Happiness</hi> two things are contain'd. One is some Good, either real or apparent, in the Fruition of which we are said to be in some measure or other happy. The other is the very Fruition it self. The first of these is usually called <hi>Objective Happiness,</hi> and the latter <hi>Formal.</hi> Some I know divide Happiness into these as distinct <hi>Species</hi>; but I think not so
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48450:4"/>
artificially: For they are both but constituent Parts, which joyntly make up one and the same Happiness: Neither of them are sufficient alone, but they are both equally necessary. That the last of these is a necessary Ingredient, I think no doubt can reasonably be made: For what would the greatest Good imaginable signifie without Fruition? And that the former is likewise ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary is no less certain: For how can there be such a thing as Fruition without an Object? I grant 'tis not at all necessary that the Object be a real substantial Good; if it appear so 'tis sufficient.</p>
            <p>From this Distinction of <hi>real</hi> and <hi>apparent</hi> Good, some have taken occasion to distinguish of Happiness likewise into two sorts, <hi>real</hi> and <hi>imaginary</hi>: But I believe upon a more narrow Scrutiny into the matter, 'twill be found, that all Happiness, according to its Proportion, is equally <hi>real</hi>; and that that which they term <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary,</hi> too well deserves the Name, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no such thing in Nature: For let the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it be never so <hi>Phantastick,</hi> yet it must still carry the Semblance and Appearance of Good (otherwise it can neither <hi>move</hi> the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite nor please it, and consequently be neither an Object of <hi>Desire</hi> nor of <hi>Fruition</hi>;) and if so, the Happiness must needs be real, because the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48450:4"/>
Formality of the Object, tho' 'twere never so true and real good, would notwithstanding lie in the <hi>Appearance,</hi> not in the <hi>Reallity</hi>: Whether it be real or no is purely accidental: For since to be happy can be nothing else but to enjoy some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which I desire, the Object of my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness must needs be <hi>enjoy'd</hi> under the same For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality as 'tis <hi>desired.</hi> Now since 'tis desired on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as apparently good, it must needs please me when obtained under the same Notion. So that it matters not to the Reality of my Happiness, whether the Object of it be really good, or only apprehended so, since if it were never so <hi>real,</hi> it <hi>pleases</hi> only as <hi>apparent.</hi> The Fool has his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise as well as the wise man, and for the time is as happy in it; and a kind Delusion will make a Cloud as pleasing as the Queen of <hi>Heaven.</hi> And therefore I think it impossible for a man to think himself happy, and (during that Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) not really to be so. He enjoys the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of his own Fancy, worships the <hi>Idol</hi> of his Imagination, and the happiest man upon Earth does no more: For let the Circumstances of his Life be what they will, 'tis his Opinion only that must give the Relish. Without this Heaven it self would afford him no Content, nor the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God prove <hi>Beatifick.</hi> 'Tis true, the man is seated at the <hi>Spring-Head</hi> of Happiness, is sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48450:5"/>
with excellent Objects; but alas, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not so to him; he is not at all affected with his Condition, but, like <hi>Adam,</hi> lies fast in a dead Sleep in the midst of Paradise.</p>
            <p>The Sum of this Argument is this; Good is in the same manner the Object of <hi>Fruition,</hi> as 'tis of Desire; and that is not as <hi>really</hi> good in its own Nature, but as 'tis <hi>judged</hi> so by the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: And consequently, tho' it be only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, it must needs be as effectual to <hi>gratifie</hi> the Appetite as it was at first to <hi>excite</hi> it during that Appearance. So long as it keeps on its Vizor and imposes upon the Understanding, what is wanting in the thing, is made up by an <hi>obliging</hi> Imposture, and <hi>Ignorance</hi> becomes here the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Happiness</hi> as well as of <hi>Devotion</hi>: But if the man will <hi>dare</hi> to be wise, and too curiously examine the superficial Tinsel-Good, he unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himself to his own Cost, and, like <hi>Adam,</hi> adventuring to eat of the Tree of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> sees himself naked, and is ashamed. And for this reason I think it impossible for any man to love to be flatter'd: 'Tis true, he may delight to hear himself commended by those who indeed do flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; but the true Reason of that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he does not apprehend that to be Flattery which indeed is so; but when he once throughly knows it, 'tis impossible he should be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48450:5"/>
any longer delighted with it. I shall conclude this Point with this useful Reflection, That since every Man's Happiness depends wholly upon his own Opinion, the Foundation upon which all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Men proceed, must needs be either <hi>false</hi> or very <hi>uncertain.</hi> False, if they think that outward Circumstances and States of Life are all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of Happiness; but uncertain however: For since they measure the Happiness of other Men by their own Opinion, 'tis mere Chance if they do not misplace their Envy, unless they were sure the other Person was of the like Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with themselves. And now what a vain irrational thing is it to disquiet our selves into a dislike of our own Condition, merely because we mistake an other Man's?</p>
            <p>Thus far of the Notion of Happiness in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; I now proceed to consider that Happiness which is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as <hi>Plato</hi> speaks) sound and entire, perfect and compleat. Concerning the general Notion of which, all men, I suppose, are as much agreed as they are in the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Triangle.</hi> That 'tis such a State then which a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot be conceiv'd: In which there is no Evil you can fear, no Good which you desire and have not: That which fully and constantly satisfies the Demand of every Appetite, and leaves no possibility for a desire of Change; or to summ
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48450:6"/>
it up in that comprehensive Expression of the Poet,
<q>
                  <l>Quod sis esse velis, nihilque malis.</l>
               </q>
When you would always be what you are, and (as the Earl of <hi>Roscommond</hi> very significantly renders it) do <hi>Rather</hi> nothing. This I suppose is the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most that can be said or conceiv'd of it, and less than this will not be enough. And thus far we are all agreed. For I suppose, the many various Disputes maintained by Philosophers concerning Happiness, could not respect this general Notion of it, but only the particular <hi>causes</hi> or <hi>means</hi> whereby it might be acquired. And I find <hi>Tully</hi> concurring with me in the same Observation, <hi>Ea est beata vita</hi> (says he) <hi>quaerimus autem non quae sit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 3 <hi>de Fin.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>sed unde.</hi> The difficulty is not to frame a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of a perfectly happy State in the general, but to define in particular wherein it consists.</p>
            <p>But before I undertake this Province, I think it might not be amiss to remove one Prejudice, which because it has gain'd upon my self some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in my Melancholy Retirements, I am apt to think it may be incident to other men also. It is this, Whether after so many Disputes about, so many restless endeavours after this state of perfect Happiness there be any such thing or no. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not a meer <hi>Idea,</hi> as imaginary as <hi>Plato</hi>'s
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48450:6"/>
               <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> as fictitious as the Groves of <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sium.</hi> I confess, this suspicion has oftentimes <hi>overcast</hi> my mind with black thoughts, damp'd my Devotion, and as it were clipp'd the wings of my Aspiring Soul. And I happened to fall into it upon a serious reflection on the nature of Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition in the several Periods and Circumstances of my life. For I observ'd according to my <hi>Narrow</hi> experience, that I never had in all my life the same thoughts of any good in the very time of the enjoying it as I had before. I have known when I have promised my self vast Satisfactions, and my imagination has presented me at a distance with a fair <hi>Landscape</hi> of Delights, yet when I drew nigh enough to grasp the alluring Happiness, like the <hi>Sensitive Plant</hi> it contracted it self at the <hi>touch,</hi> and <hi>shrink'd</hi> almost to nothing in the Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And though after the Enjoyment is past, it seems great again upon <hi>reflection</hi> as it did before in <hi>expectation,</hi> yet should a <hi>Platonical Revolution</hi> make the same Circumstances recur, I should not think so. I found 'twas ever with me as with the <hi>Traveller,</hi> to whom the ground which is <hi>before</hi> him, and that which he has left <hi>behind</hi> him seems always more curiously embroider'd and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, then that which he <hi>stands</hi> upon. So that my Happiness like the time wherein I <hi>thought</hi> to enjoy it, was always either <hi>past</hi> or to <hi>come</hi> never

               <hi>present.</hi> Methought I could often say upon a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection,</hi> How happy <hi>was</hi> I at such a time! Or when I was in <hi>expectation.</hi> How happy <hi>shall</hi> I be if I compass such a design! But scarce ever, I <hi>am</hi> so. I was pretty well pleased methought while I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, while I hoped, till Fruition jogg'd me out of my pleasing slumber and I knew it was but a Dream. And this single Consideration has often made me even in the very persuit after Happiness, and full career of my Passions, to stop short on this side of Fruition, and to choose rather with <hi>Moses</hi> upon Mount <hi>Nebo</hi> to entertain my fancy with a remote Prospect of the <hi>Happy Land,</hi> then to go in and possess it, and then <hi>repine.</hi> How then shall man be happy when setting aside all the Crosses of Fortune, he will complain even of <hi>Success,</hi> and <hi>Fruition</hi> it self shall <hi>disappoint</hi> him!</p>
            <p>And this melancholy reflection bred in me a kind of suspicion, that for all that I knew it might be so in <hi>Heaven</hi> too. That although at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance I might frame to my self bright <hi>Ideas</hi> of that Region of Bliss; yet when I came to the possession of it, I should not find that perfect Happiness there which I expected, but that it would be always to <hi>come</hi> as 'tis now, and that I should seek for Heaven even in Heaven it self. That I should not fully acquiesce in my condition there, but at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire a change. And that which confirm'd me the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48450:7"/>
more in this <hi>unhappy Scepticism,</hi> was because I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd that a great number of excellent Beings who enjoy'd the very <hi>Quintessence</hi> of Bliss, who were as happy as God and Heaven could make them, grew soon uneasy and weary of their State and <hi>left their own Habitation.</hi> Which argues that their Happiness was not <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>compleat,</hi> because otherwise they would not have <hi>desired</hi> a change, since that very desire is an imperfection. And if Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be not compleat in Heaven, sure 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be found any where else.</p>
            <p>Before therefore I proceed to define wherein perfect Happiness does consist, I think it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to endeavour the removal of this Scruple which like the flaming Sword forbids <hi>entrance</hi> into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise.</hi> In order to which, I shall inquire into the <hi>true reason</hi> why these Sublunary good things when enjoy'd do <hi>neither</hi> answer our <hi>expectations,</hi> nor satisfy our <hi>Appetites.</hi> Now this must <hi>proceed either</hi> from the nature of Fruition it self, or from the imperfection of it, or from the Object of it, or from our selves. I confess, did this <hi>defect</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the <hi>very nature</hi> of Fruition (as is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the Objection) 'tis impossible there should be any such thing as <hi>perfect Happiness,</hi> since 'twould <hi>faint</hi> away while <hi>enjoy'd,</hi> and <hi>expire</hi> in our <hi>embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> But that it cannot proceed thence, I have this to offer, Because Fruition being nothing else
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48450:8"/>
but an Application or Union of the Soul to some good or agreeable Object, it is impossible that should <hi>lessen</hi> the <hi>good</hi> enjoy'd. <hi>Indeed</hi> it may les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen our <hi>estimation</hi> of it, but that is because we do not rightly consider the nature of things, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise our <hi>selves</hi> infinite Satisfactions in the <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of finite Objects. We look upon things through a false Glass which magnifies the Object at a distance much beyond its just Dimensions. We represent our <hi>future enjoyments</hi> to our selves in such <hi>favourable</hi> and <hi>partial Ideas</hi> which abstract from all the <hi>inconveniencies</hi> and allays which will really in the <hi>event</hi> accompany them. And if we thus over-rate our <hi>Felicities</hi> before-hand, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they baulk our <hi>Expectations</hi> in the <hi>Fruition.</hi> But then it must be observ'd that the <hi>Fruition</hi> does not <hi>cause</hi> this <hi>Deficiency</hi> in the Object, but only <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover</hi> it. We have a better insight into the nature of things near at hand, then when we stood afar off, and consequently discern those <hi>defects</hi> and <hi>imperfections</hi> which like the qualities of an ill Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss, lay hid all the time of <hi>Courtship,</hi> and now begin to betray themselves, when 'tis come to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment.</hi> But this can never happen but where the Object is finite. An infinite Object can never be over-valued and consequently cannot frustrate our <hi>expectations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48450:8"/>And as we are not to charge <hi>Fruition</hi> with our <hi>disappointments</hi> but our selves (because we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory to our own <hi>delusion</hi> by taking false measures of things) so neither is the <hi>Vnsatisfactoriness</hi> of any condition to be imputed to the Nature of <hi>Fruition</hi> it self, but either to the <hi>imperfection</hi> of it or to the finiteness of the Object. Let the Object be never so perfect, yet if the <hi>Fruition</hi> of it be in an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect measure there will still be room for <hi>Vnsatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriness,</hi> as it appears in our <hi>enjoyment</hi> of God in this Life. Neither can a <hi>finite Object</hi> fully satisfy us though we enjoy it never so thoroughly. For since to a full satisfaction and <hi>acquiescence</hi> of mind 'tis required that our Faculties be always <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd</hi> and we ever <hi>enjoying</hi>: it is impossible a <hi>finite Object</hi> should afford this satisfaction, because all the good that is in it (being finite) is at length run over, and then the <hi>enjoyment</hi> is at an end. The flower is suckt dry, and we necessarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire a change. Whenever therefore our <hi>enjoyment</hi> proves unsatisfying, we may conclude, that either the Object is <hi>finite,</hi> or the <hi>Fruition</hi> imperfect. But then how came the <hi>Angels</hi> to be dissatisfy'd with their Condition in the Regions of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,</hi> when they drank freely of the <hi>Fountain of Life</hi> proceeding out of the Throne of God,<note place="margin">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48450:9"/>
no room either for the <hi>finiteness</hi> of the <hi>Object,</hi> or the <hi>imperfection</hi> of <hi>Fruition.</hi> And therefore their dissatisfaction can be imputed to no other Cause, then the Nature of <hi>Fruition</hi> in general, which is to <hi>lessen</hi> the good <hi>enjoy'd,</hi> as was suppos'd in the <hi>Objection.</hi> This I confess presses hard, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I have but one way to <hi>extricate</hi> my self from this difficulty, and that is by supposing a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Probation</hi> in the <hi>Angels.</hi> That they did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon their <hi>Creation</hi> enjoy an <hi>infinite Object,</hi> or if they did, yet that 'twas in an <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect measure.</hi> For should it be granted that they were at first confirm'd in Bliss and <hi>compleatly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py</hi> both in <hi>respect</hi> of <hi>Fruition</hi> and <hi>Object</hi> as we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they are now, I cannot <hi>conceive</hi> it possible they should be dissatisfy'd with their condition. This being repugnant to the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Perfect Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then this dissatisfaction must be derived either from the imperfection of the <hi>Fruition,</hi> or the finiteness of the Object, and not from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Fruition in the general, to infer the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of perfect <hi>Happiness,</hi> there needs no more to be supposed then the <hi>existence</hi> of a Being full fraught with infinite inexhaustible good, and that he is able to communicate it to the full. There may be then such a thing as perfect <hi>Happiness.</hi> The possibility of which may also be farther <hi>proved</hi>

(tho' not <hi>explicated</hi>) from those boundless De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, that <hi>immortal Thirst</hi> every man has after it by Nature: Concerning which I observe, that nothing does more constantly, more inseparably cleave to our Minds that this Desire of perfect and consummated Happiness: This, as <hi>Plato</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically expresses it, is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the most excellent end of all our Endeavours, the great Prize, the great Hope. This is the Mark every Man shoots at, and tho' we miss our Aim never so often, yet we will not, cannot give over; but like passionate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers take <hi>Resolution</hi> from a <hi>Repulse.</hi> The rest of our Passions are much at our own Disposal; yield either to Reason or Time; we either argue our selves out of them, or at least out-live them. We are not always in love with Pomp and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, nor always dazzl'd with the glittering of Riches; and there is a Season when Pleasure it self shall court in vain: But the Desire of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Happiness has no Intervals, no Vicissitudes, it out-lasts the Motion of the Pulse, and survives the Ruins of the Grave. <hi>Many Waters cannot quench it, neither can the Floods drown it</hi>: And now certainly God would never have planted such an ardent, such an importunate Appetite in our Souls, and as it were <hi>interwoven</hi> it with our very Natures had he not been able to satisfie it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48450:10"/>I come now to shew wherein this perfect Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness does consist, concerning which I affirm in the first place, that it is not to be found in any thing we can enjoy in this Life. The greatest Fruition we have of God here, is imperfect, and consequently unsatisfactory. And as for all other Objects they are finite, and consequently though never so fully enjoy'd cannot afford us perfect sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. No,<note place="margin">Job 28.</note>

The first is this, that the Objects wherein Men generally seek for <hi>Happiness</hi> here, are not only <hi>finite</hi> in their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but also <hi>few</hi> in <hi>number.</hi> Indeed could a Man's Life be so contrived, that he should have a new <hi>Pleasure</hi> still ready at hand assoon as <hi>he</hi> was grown <hi>weary</hi> of the Old, and <hi>every</hi> day <hi>enjoy</hi> the

               <hi>Maiden-head</hi> of a fresh Delight, he might then perhaps, like Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Notion, and for a while think himself happy in this <hi>continued Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of new Acquisitions.</hi> But alas, Nature does not treat us with this Variety. The compass of our <hi>enjoyments</hi> is much shorter then that of our Lives, and there is a <hi>Periodical Circulation</hi> of our <hi>Pleasures</hi> as well as of our <hi>blood.</hi>

               </q>
The Enjoyments of our Lives run in a perpetual Round like the Months in the <hi>Kalendar,</hi> but with a quicker Revolution; we <hi>dance</hi> like <hi>Fairies</hi> in a <hi>Circle,</hi> and our whole Life is but a nauseous <hi>Tautology</hi>: We rise like the Sun, and run the same Course we did the day before, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is but the same over again: So that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Favourite of Fortune will have Reason often enough to cry out with him in <hi>Seneca, Quousque eadem?</hi> But there is another Grievance which contributes to defeat our Endeavours after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Happiness in the Enjoyments of this Life. Which is, that the Objects wherein we seek it, are not only <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>few</hi>; but that they commonly prove Occasions of greater <hi>Sorrow</hi> to us than ever they afforded us <hi>Content.</hi> This may be made out several ways, as from the Labour of Getting, the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48450:11"/>
Care of Keeping, the fear of Losing, and the like Topicks, commonly insisted on by others; but I wave these, and fix upon another Account less blown upon, and I think more material than any of the rest. It is this, that altho' the Object loses that great appearance in the <hi>Fruition</hi> which it had in the <hi>expectation,</hi> yet after it is gone it resumes it again. Now we when we lament the loss, do not take our measures from that appearance which the Object had in the <hi>enjoyment</hi> (as we should do to make our sorrow not exceed our <hi>Happiness</hi>) but from that which it has in the <hi>reflection,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently we must needs be more <hi>miserable</hi> in the <hi>loss</hi> then we were <hi>happy</hi> in the <hi>enjoyment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From these and the like <hi>Considerations,</hi> I think it will evidently appear that this perfect <hi>Happiness</hi> is not to be found in any thing we can enjoy in this Life. Wherein then does it consist? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer positively, in the full and intire Fruition of God. He (as <hi>Plato</hi> speaks) is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the proper and Principal End of Man, the Center of our <hi>Tendency,</hi> the Ark of our <hi>Rest.</hi> He is the Object which alone can satisfy the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of the most Capacious Soul, and stand the <hi>Test</hi> of Fruition to Eternity. And to enjoy him fully is perfect Felicity. This in general, is no more then what is deliver'd to us in Scripture, and was believ'd by many of the <hi>Heathen Philosophers.</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48450:11"/>
But the manner of this Fruition requires a more particular <hi>Consideration.</hi> Much is said by the School-men upon this Subject, whereof in the first place I shall give a short and methodical account, and then fix upon the Opinion which I best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of. The first thing that I observe, is, that 'tis generally agreed upon among them, that this Fruition of God consists in some <hi>Operation</hi>; and I think with very good reason. For as by the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective</hi> part of <hi>Perfect Happiness</hi> we understand that which is best and last, and to which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are to be refer'd. So by the <hi>Formal</hi> part of it must be understood the best and last Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude of Man toward that best Object, so that the <hi>Happiness</hi> may both ways satisfy the Appetite, that is, as 'tis the best thing, and as 'tis the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, use, or Fruition of that best thing: Now this Habitude whereby the best thing is perfectly possess'd must needs be some <hi>Operation,</hi> because <hi>Operation</hi> is the ultimate perfection of every Being. Which <hi>Axiom</hi> (as <hi>Caietan</hi> well observes) must not be so understood as if Operation taken by it self were more perfect then the thing which tends to it, but that every thing with its Operation is more perfect then without it.</p>
            <p>The next thing which I observe, is, that 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so farther agreed upon among them, that this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration wherein our Fruition of God does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48450:12"/>
is an Operation of the <hi>Intellectual</hi> part, and not of the <hi>Sensitive.</hi> And this also, <hi>I</hi> take to be very reasonable. First, Because 'tis generally receiv'd that the Essence of God cannot be the Object of any of our Senses. But Secondly, Suppose it could, yet since this Operation wherein our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Happiness</hi> does consist must be the perfectest Operation, and since that of the <hi>Intellectual</hi> part is more perfect then that of the <hi>Sensitive,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that the Operation whereby we enjoy God must be that of the <hi>Intellectual</hi> part only.</p>
            <p>But now whereas the <hi>Intellectual</hi> part of man (as 'tis opposed to the <hi>Sensitive</hi>) is double, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and that of the <hi>Will,</hi> there has commenced a great Controversy between the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> and the <hi>Scotists,</hi> in which Act or Operation of the <hi>Rational Soul</hi> the <hi>Fruition</hi> of God, does consist, whether in an act of the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> or in an act of the <hi>Will.</hi> The <hi>Thomists</hi> will have it consist purely in an act of the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> which is <hi>Vision.</hi> The <hi>Scotists</hi> in act of the <hi>Will,</hi> which is <hi>Love.</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not here to launch out into those <hi>Voluminous Intricacies</hi> and <hi>Abstrusities,</hi> occasion'd by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this Argument: It may suffice to tell you, that I think they are both in the extream, and therefore I shall take the middle way and resolve the perfect Fruition of God partly into <hi>Vision</hi> and partly into <hi>Love.</hi> These are the two arms with which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48450:12"/>
we embrace the Divinity, and unite our Souls to the <hi>fair</hi> one and the <hi>good.</hi> These I conceive are both so <hi>essential</hi> to the <hi>perfect Fruition</hi> of God, that the <hi>Idea</hi> of it can by no means be maintained if either of them be wanting. For <hi>since</hi> God is both Supream <hi>Truth</hi> and infinite <hi>Goodness</hi> he cannot be intirely possess'd but by the most clear <hi>knowledge</hi> and the most ardent <hi>love.</hi> And besides, since the Soul is happy by her Faculties, her Happiness must consist in the most perfect Operation of each Faculty. For if Happiness did consist formally in the sole operation of the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> (as most say) or in the sole operation of the <hi>Will</hi> (as others) the Man would not be compleatly and in all respects Happy. For how is it possible a Man should be perfectly Happy in loving the greatest good if he did not know it, or in knowing it if he did not <hi>love</hi> it? And moreover these two Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations do so mutually tend to the promotion and Conservation of one another, that upon this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the perpetuity and the constancy of our Happiness. For while the Blessed do <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Face to Face contemplate the Supream Truth and the infinite Goodness, they cannot chuse but love perpetually; and while they perpetually love, they cannot chuse but perpetually contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate. And in this mutual reciprocation of the actions of the Soul consists the <hi>perpetuity</hi> of Heaven, the <hi>Circle</hi> of Felicity.</p>

Which Opinion he endeavours to illustrate by this Similitude. That as a piece of Iron red hot by reason of the <hi>Illapse</hi> of the fire into it appears all over like fire, so the Souls of the Blessed by this <hi>Illapse</hi> of the <hi>Divine Essence</hi> into them shall be all over <hi>Divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think he has scarce any <hi>Followers</hi> in this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but I am sure he had a <hi>Leader.</hi> For this is no more then what <hi>Plato</hi> taught before him, as is to be seen in his Discourses about the <hi>refusion</hi> of the Souls of good men into the <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> which is the self same in other terms with this Opinion.

This certainly will affect the Soul with all the pleasing and ravishing Transports of Love and Desire, Joy and Delight, Wonder and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, together with a settled Acquiescence and Complacency of Spirit only less infinite then the <hi>Loveliness</hi> that causes it, and the peculiar Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency of him who rejoyces in his own fulness, and the <hi>Comprehensions</hi> of Eternity.

And if so, what then shall we think of the <hi>Beatific Vision,</hi> the pleasure of which will so far transcend that of the other, as God who is all over Harmony and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion exceeds the sweetest Melody of Sounds and Colours, and the perception of the Mind is

more vigorous quick and piercing then that of the Senses? This is <hi>Perfect Happiness,</hi> this is the Tree of Life which grows in the <hi>midst</hi> of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise</hi> of God, this is Heaven, which while the Learned dispute about, the good only enjoy. But I shall not venture to Soar any longer in these Heights, I find the <hi>Aether</hi> too thin here to breath in long, and the Brightness of the Region flashes too strong upon my tender sense; I shall therefore hasten to descend from the Mount of God, lest I grow <hi>giddy</hi> with speculation and lose those Secrets which I have learnt there, the <hi>Cabala</hi> of Felicity.</p>
            <p>And now (Sir) I come to consider your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion <hi>(viz.)</hi> Wherein the greatest Happiness at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by man in this Life does consist. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, there is as great variety of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among <hi>Philosophers,</hi> as there is among <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers,</hi> about the Seat of <hi>Paradise.</hi> The learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Varro</hi> reckons up no less then 288 several Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about it, and yet notwithstanding the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Writers who have <hi>bequeath'd</hi> Volumes upon this Subject to Posterity, they seem to have been in the dark in nothing more then in this, and (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only a few <hi>Platonists</hi> who placed Mans great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est End in the Contemplation of truth) they seem to have undertaken nothing so <hi>unhappily,</hi> as when they essay'd to write of <hi>Happiness.</hi> Some measure their <hi>Happiness</hi> by the high-tide of their Riches, as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48450:16"/>
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did the Fertility of the Year by the increase of the River <hi>Nile.</hi> Others place it in the Pleasures of Sence, others in Honour and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But these and the like were Men of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Herd, low groveling Souls that either <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood</hi> not the <hi>Dignity</hi> of Humane Nature, or else <hi>forgot</hi> that they were Men. But there were others of a <hi>Diviner Genius</hi> and <hi>Sublimer Spirit</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Queis meliore luto finxit praecordia Titan.</l>
               </q>
Who had a more generous blood running in their Veins, which made them put a just value upon themselves, and scorn to place their greatest <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi> in that which they should blush to enjoy. And those were the <hi>Stoics</hi> and the <hi>Peripatetics</hi> who both place the greatest <hi>Happiness</hi> of this Life in the Actions of Vertue, with this only difference, that whereas the former are contented with <hi>Naked Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> the latter require some other <hi>Collateral</hi> things to the farther <hi>accomplishment</hi> of <hi>Happiness,</hi> such as are Health and Strength of Body, a Competent Lively-hood, and the like.</p>
            <p>And this Opinion has been subscribed to by the hands of <hi>eminent Moralists</hi> in all Ages. And as it is Venerable for its Antiquity, so has it gain'd no small Authority from the Pen of a great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Writer <hi>(Descartes)</hi> who resolves the greatest <hi>Happiness</hi> of this Life into the right use of the <hi>Will,</hi> which consists in this, that a Man have a firm and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48450:16"/>
constant purpose always to do that which he shall judge to be best.</p>
            <p>I confess, the Practice of Vertue is a very great instrument of <hi>Happiness,</hi> and that there is a great deal more true satisfaction and solid content to be found in a constant course of well living then in all the soft Caresses of the most <hi>studied</hi> Luxury, or the Voluptuousness of a <hi>Seraglio.</hi> And therefore I have oftentimes been exceedingly pleased in the reading of a certain Passage in that Divine Moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist <hi>Hierocles,</hi> where he tells you, that the Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man lives much more pleasantly then the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Man. <hi>For</hi> (says he) <hi>all Pleasure is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of Action, it has no Subsistence of its own, but accompanies us in our doing such and such things. Hence 'tis that the worser Actions are accompanied with the meaner Pleasures. So that the good Man does not only excel the wicked Man in what is good, but has also the advantage of him even in Pleasure, for whose sake alone he is wicked. For he that chuses Pleasure with Filthiness, altho for a while he be sweetly and deliciously entertain'd, yet at last through the Filthiness annexed to his enjoyment, he is brought to a painful Repentance. But now he that prefers Vertue with all her Labours and Difficulties, though at first for want of use it sits heavy upon him, yet by the Conjunction of good he alleviates the labour and at last enjoys pure and unallay'd Pleasure with his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48450:17"/>
Vertue. So that of necessity that Life is most unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, which is most wicked, and that most pleasant which is most vertuous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this I readily submit to as a great truth, that the degrees of <hi>Happiness</hi> vary according to the degrees of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and consequently that that Life which is most <hi>Vertuous</hi> is most <hi>Happy</hi> with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to those that are Vicious or less Vertuous, every degree of Vertue having a proportionate degree of <hi>Happiness</hi> accompanying it, (which is all, I suppose, that excellent Author intends.) But I do not think the most <hi>Vertuous</hi> Life <hi>so</hi> the most <hi>Happy,</hi> but that it may become Happier un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less something more be comprehended in the Word (Vertue) then the <hi>Stoics, Peripatetics,</hi> and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of other Moralists understand by it. For with them it signifies no more but only such a firm <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or habitude of the Will to good, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are constantly disposed, notwithstanding the contrary tendency of our Passions to perform the necessary Offices of Life. This they call <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> Vertue, and althongh this brings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>Happiness</hi> enough with it to make ample a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for all the difficulties which attend the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it: Yet I am not of Opinion that the greatest Happiness attainable by Man in this Life consists in it. But there is another and a higher sence of the Word which frequently occurs in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48450:17"/>
               <hi>Pythagorean</hi> and <hi>Platonic</hi> Writings, <hi>(viz.) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation</hi> and the <hi>Vnitive</hi> way of Religion. And this they call <hi>Divine Vertue.</hi> I allow of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, but I would not be thought to derive it from the <hi>Principle,</hi> as if Moral Vertue were <hi>acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> and this <hi>infused</hi> (for to speak ingeniously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Vertue seem'd ever to me as great a <hi>Paradox</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> as Occult qualities in <hi>Philosophy</hi>) but from the nobleness of the Object, the Object of the former being Moral good, and the Object of the latter God himself. The former is a State of <hi>Proficiency,</hi> the latter of <hi>Perfection.</hi> The former is a State of difficulty and contention, the latter of ease and Sincerity. The former is employ'd in mastering the Passions, and regulating the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of common life, the latter in Divine Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Extasies of <hi>Seraphic</hi> Love. He that has only the former is like <hi>Moses</hi> with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty climbing up the Holy Mount, but he that has the latter is like the same Person conversing with God on the serene top of it, and shining with the Rays of <hi>Anticipated</hi> Glory. So that this latter supposes the acquisition of the former, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently has all the <hi>Happiness</hi> retaining to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, besides what it adds of its own. This is the last <hi>Stage</hi> of <hi>Humane Perfection,</hi> the utmost <hi>round</hi> of the Ladder whereby we ascend to <hi>Heaven,</hi> one <hi>Step</hi> higher is Glory. Here then will I build my
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48450:18"/>
               <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> for <hi>it is good to be here.</hi> Here will I set up my Pillar of Rest, here will I fix, for why should I travail on farther in persuit of any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Happiness,</hi> since Man in this Station is but a <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lower than the Angels,</hi> one <hi>remove</hi> from <hi>Heaven.</hi> Here certainly is the greatest Happiness as well as Perfection attainable by Man in this State of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection. For since that Happiness which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely perfect and compleat consists in the clear and intimate <hi>Vision</hi> and most ardent <hi>Love</hi> of God, hence we ought to take our Measures and conclude that to be the greatest Happiness attainable in this State, which is the greatest participation of the other. And that can be nothing else but the <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive</hi> way of Religion, which consists of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of God. I shall say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of each of these severally, and something of the <hi>Vnitive</hi> way of Religion which is the result of both, and so shut up this Discourse.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Contemplation</hi> in general (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand an application of the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> to some truth. But here in this place we take the word in a more peculiar sence, as it signifies an habitual attentive steddy application or conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit to God and his Divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Of this the Masters of <hi>Mystic Theology</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make fifteen Degrees. The first is Intuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Truth, the 2 is a Retirement of all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48450:18"/>
and strength of the Faculties into the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most parts of the Soul, the 3 is Spiritual Silence, the 4 is Rest, the 5 is Union, the 6 is the hearing of the still Voice of God, the 7 is Spiritual Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the 8 is Ecstacy, the 9 is Rapture, the 10 is the Corporeal Appearance of Christ and the Saints, the 11 is the Imaginary Appearance of the same, the 12 is the Intellectual Vision of God, the 13 is the Vision of God in obscurity, the 14 is an admirable Manifestation of God, the 15 is a clear and intuitive Vision of him, such as St. <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Tho. Aquinas</hi> attribute to S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was rapt up into the third Heaven. Others of them reckon seaven degrees only, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Tast, Desire, Satiety, Ebriety, Security, Tranquility, but the name of the seaventh (they say) is known only to God.</p>
            <p>I shall not stand to examine the <hi>Scale</hi> of this Division, perhaps there may be a kind of a <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goric</hi> Superstition in the number. But this I think I may affirm in general that the Soul may be <hi>wound</hi> up to a most strange degree of <hi>Abstraction</hi> by a silent and steddy <hi>Contemplation</hi> of God. <hi>Plato</hi> defines <hi>Contemplation</hi> to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Solution and a Separation of the Soul from the Body. And some of the severer <hi>Platonists</hi> have been of Opinion that 'tis possible for a Man by mere <hi>intention</hi> of thought not only
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48450:19"/>
to withdraw the Soul from all commerce with the Senses, but even really to separate it from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to <hi>untwist</hi> the Ligaments of his Frame, and by degrees to <hi>resolve</hi> himself into the State of the Dead. And thus the <hi>Iews</hi> express the manner of the Death of <hi>Moses,</hi> calling it <hi>Osculum Oris Dei, the Kiss of God's Mouth.</hi> That is, that he breath'd out his Soul by the mere strength and Energy of <hi>Contemplation,</hi> and expired in the Embraces of his Maker. A Happy way of Dying! How am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious should I be of such a conveyance, were it practicable? How passionately should I joyn with the Church in Canticles? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">1 Ver. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Let him kiss me with the Kisses of his Mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however this be determin'd, certain it is, that there are exceeding great Measures of <hi>Abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> in <hi>Contemplation,</hi> so great, that sometimes whether a Man be in the Body or out of the Body, he himself can hardly tell. And consequently the Soul in these <hi>Praeludiums</hi> of Death, these <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhoods</hi> of Separation must needs have <hi>brighter</hi> glimpses and more <hi>Beatific Ideas</hi> of God, then in a State void of these <hi>Elevations,</hi> and consequently must <hi>love</hi> him with greater Ardency. Which is the next thing I am to consider.</p>
            <p>The love of God in general may be consider'd either as it is purely <hi>intellectual,</hi> or as it is a <hi>Passion.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48450:19"/>
The first is when the Soul upon an apprehension of God as a good delectable and agreeable Object joyns her self to him by the Will. The latter is when the motion of the Will is accompany'd with a sensible Commotion of the Spirits, and an estu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the blood. Some I know are of Opinion, that 'tis not possible for a man to be affected with this sensitive Love of God which is a <hi>Passion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is nothing in God which falls under our imagination and <hi>consequently</hi> (the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being the only Medium of conveyance) it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be propagated from the Intellectual part to the Sensitive. Whereupon they affirm that none are capable of this sensitive passionate love of God but Christians who enjoy the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> whereby they know God has condescended so far as to cloath himself with flesh, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like one of us. But 'tis not all the <hi>Sophistry</hi> of the <hi>old Logicians</hi> that shall work me out of the belief of what I feel and know, and rob me of the sweetest entertainment of my Life, the <hi>Passionate Love of God.</hi> Whatever some Men pretend who are strangers to all the affectionate heats of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore make their Philosophy a Plea for their indevotion, and extinguish all Holy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours with a <hi>Syllogism</hi>; yet I am firmly persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that our love of God may be not only passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but even <hi>Wonderfully</hi> so, and <hi>exceeding the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48450:20"/>
Love of Women.</hi> 'Tis an <hi>Experimental</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>undeniable</hi> Truth, that <hi>Passion</hi> is a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of <hi>Devotion,</hi> and accordingly we find that Men of the most warm and pathetic <hi>Tempers</hi> and <hi>Amorous Complexions</hi> (Provided they have but Consideration enough withal to fix upon the right <hi>Object</hi>) prove the greatest <hi>Votaries</hi> in <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And upon this account it is, that to heighten our Love of God in our Religious <hi>Addresses,</hi> we <hi>endeavour</hi> to <hi>excite</hi> our Passions by <hi>Music,</hi> which would be to as little purpose as the <hi>Fanatic</hi> thinks 'tis, if there were not such a thing as the <hi>Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Love of God.</hi> But then as to the <hi>Objection,</hi> I <hi>Answer</hi> with the <hi>excellent Descartes,</hi> that although in God who is the <hi>Object</hi> of our <hi>Love,</hi> we can <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine</hi> nothing, yet we can <hi>imagine</hi> that our Love, which consists in this, that we would unite our <hi>selves</hi> to the <hi>Object</hi> beloved, and consider our <hi>selves</hi> as it were a part of it. And the sole <hi>Idea</hi> of this very Conjunction is enough to stir up a heat about the Heart, and so kindle a very <hi>vehement Passion.</hi> To which I add, that although the <hi>Beauty</hi> or <hi>aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness</hi> of God be not the same with that which we see in <hi>Corporeal Beings,</hi> and <hi>consequently</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>directly</hi> fail within the <hi>Sphere</hi> of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet it is something <hi>Analogous</hi> to it, and that very <hi>Analogy</hi> is enough to <hi>excite</hi> a <hi>Passion.</hi> And this I think sufficient to warrant my general divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48450:20"/>
of the Love of God into <hi>Intellectual</hi> and <hi>Sensitive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is a more <hi>peculir Acceptation</hi> of the <hi>Love</hi> of God proper to this place. And it is that which we call <hi>Seraphic.</hi> By which I understand in short, that Love of God which is the <hi>effect</hi> of an intense <hi>Contemplation</hi> of him. This differs not from the other in kind, but only in <hi>degree,</hi> and that it does <hi>exceedingly,</hi> in as much as the thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Contemplative</hi> Man (as I hinted before) has <hi>clearer Perceptions</hi> and <hi>livelier Impressions</hi> of the <hi>Divine Beauty,</hi> the lovely <hi>Attributes</hi> and <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of God, then he whose Soul is more deeply <hi>set</hi> in the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and lies groveling in the <hi>bottom</hi> of the <hi>Dungeon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Nature of this <hi>Seraphic Love</hi> may be the better understood, I shall consider how many <hi>degrees there</hi> may be in the <hi>Love</hi> of God.<note place="margin">

absolutely consider'd, but to the utmost ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of a <hi>Mortal Creature</hi> in this Life.

               <note place="margin">The great Exemplar <hi>pag.</hi> 60.</note> 
               <hi>a Discourse without variety, a Vision and Intuition of Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, an immediate entry into an Orb of light, and a resolution of all our Faculties into Sweetness, Affections and Starings upon the Divine Beauty. And is carried on to Extasies, Raptures, Suspensions, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, Abstractions and Apprehensions beatifical.</hi>

            <p>I make no doubt but that many an honest Pious Soul arrives to the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> who is not fed with this <hi>Manna</hi> in the <hi>Wilderness.</hi> But though every one must not expect these <hi>Antepatists</hi> of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity that is vertuous, yet none else must. <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi> was never open but to a State of <hi>Innocence.</hi> But neither is that enough. No, this Mount of God's presence is fenced not only from the <hi>profane</hi> but also from the <hi>Moderately</hi> vertuous. 'Tis the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Angelical Dispositions, and the reward of <hi>eminent Piety</hi> and an excellent Religion to be admitted to these <hi>Divine Repasts,</hi> these <hi>Feasts</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi> And here I place the greatest Happiness attainable by Man in this Life, as being the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Approach to the State of the Blessed above, the <hi>Outer Court</hi> of Heaven.</p>
            <p>These (Sir) are my thoughts concerning Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. I might have <hi>spun</hi> them out into a greater length, but I think a little Plot of ground <hi>thick-sown</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48450:22"/>
is better then a great Field which for the most part of it lies Fallow. I have endeavour'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my Notions with as much perspicuity and in as good Method as I could, and so to answer all the ends of <hi>Copiousness,</hi> with the advantage of a shorter Cut. If I appear singular in any of my Notions 'tis not out of an industrious affectation of Novelty, but because in the composing of this discourse (the Meditation of a few broken hours in a Garden) I consulted more my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Notices of things and private <hi>Reflections</hi> then the Writings of others. So that if sometimes I happen to be in the Road, and sometimes in a way by my self, 'tis no wonder. I affect neither the one nor the other, but write as I think. Which as I do at other times, so more especially when I subscribe my self</p>
