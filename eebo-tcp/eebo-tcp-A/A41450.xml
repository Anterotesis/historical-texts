            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Aut hoc non eſt Evangelium, aut nos non
ſumus Evangelici, Either Chriſtian Religion
is not what it was, or men are not what
they were wont to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For beſides the palpable Contradiction of
the Lives of the generality of Chriſtians now,
to the Rules of their Religion, laid down in
the Writings of the New Teſtament, which
is ſuch, as would make an indifferent man
ſuſpect that they believed thoſe Books to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
abſolute impoſſibilities, or at leaſt, not
<pb facs="tcp:45558:13"/>
the things that are neceſſary to ſalvation;
ſince ſo few take the Rule of their Lives, or
the Meaſures of their Actions thence: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, I ſay, he that ſhall obſerve how
the Primitive Chriſtians for ſeveral Ages
after our Saviour are reported to have lived,
and how far ſhort the latter Ages fall of
thoſe Examples, will be tempted either to
pronounce the Hiſtories of thoſe Times meer
Romances; or the Men of theſe Times to be
any thing, rather than what they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Such a general Declenſion there hath been,
that the complaint of <hi>Tully,</hi> concerning the
Philoſophers of his time, may juſtly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to the Chriſtians of ours, That they made
<hi>diſciplinam ſuam, oſtentationem ſcientiae,
non legem vitae; non obtemperant ſibi ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
ſed in eo peccant, cujus profitentur ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam.</hi>
That whereas Chriſtian Religion
was calculated for no other Meridian, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to no other purpoſe, than the better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and improving the Tempers and Lives
of Men, it is <hi>perverted</hi> rather to an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
for our Looſneſs, than <hi>applyed</hi> to the Cure
of our Diſorders.</p>
            <p>I cannot pleaſe my ſelf with ſo odious a
Compariſon as the Caſe in hand would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb facs="tcp:45558:14"/>
of; nor will I trouble the Reader with
long ſtories of the admirable Converſation of
thoſe early Chriſtians, which whoſo will take
the pains, may find in <hi>Juſtin Martyr, A the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoras,
Tertullian, Origen</hi> and others: And
he that is willing to decline that trouble,
may find nearer hand in the Collections of a
judicious and faithful Writer, in his Book
called, <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may not be unuſeful to remark
ſome few particulars.</p>
            <p>Of old to be a Chriſtian, was to be all that
is holy, juſt and good, to be adorned with all
thoſe Virtues that can render a man acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable
to God, or lovely amongſt men.
Whereever this Religion came, it was a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Purity in mens Hearts, of Honeſty
in their Lives, and of Peace in Kingdoms
and Societies. It raiſed mens minds to a
Contemplation and Purſuit of another World,
and inabled them both to deſpiſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and to be a bleſſing to it. It did not
teach men to ſpeak great ſwelling words,
but to live, to do and to ſuffer admirably;
that the very Pagans (their mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,)
were aſtoniſhed at them; and ſome of
them gave them this teſtimony, <hi>Hi ſunt qui
vivunt ut loquuntur, &amp; loquuntur ut vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vunt;
<pb facs="tcp:45558:14"/>
Theſe are the men that are as good
as their word, and live as high and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
as others talk.</hi> The Chriſtian Faith
was not then a meer trick of Wit, nor a bone
of Contention; but a Principle of ſincere
Honeſty, which guided men into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their Duty, and inſpired them with
courage and reſolution to perform it.</p>
            <p>Give me,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. 26. cap. de falſe ſap.</note> 
               <hi>ſaith</hi> Lactantius, a fierce and
contentious man, and if he will but apply
himſelf to the Grace and Inſtitutions of the
Goſpel, he ſhall become as mild as a Lamb:
Give me a Drunkard or a Laſcivious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
with this Doctrine I will make him
chaſte and ſober: Let a Covetous man
hearken to this Doctrine, and he ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
diſpenſe his money as charitably, as
before he raked it together fordidly: Give
me a timorous and cowardly perſon, this
Religion ſhall preſently make him valiant
and deſpiſe death and danger. <hi>And ſo he
goes on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In thoſe dayes Believing was not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for Diſobedience, or a commutation for
a holy Life; but a foundation of Obedience
to all the Laws of God and man.</p>
            <p>Then all the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity bad
<pb facs="tcp:45558:15"/>
one heart and one lip, and then they built
towards Heaven in a good ſenſe; but ſince,
diſtraction of Mind, alienation of Affections,
and confuſion of Language hath made a <hi>Babel</hi>
of a Church. There was then but one divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of men, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> were the only
Sects the World was divided by; all good
men were of one way, and evil men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But now there are almoſt as many
Opinions as Men, as many Parties as Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and as many Religions as either.</p>
            <p>Time was, when men ſacrificed their Lives
in teſtimony to their Faith, as frankly, as
ſince they have done to their Paſſions, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
or Ambition. Then was Charity count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as eſſential a part of Religion, as Cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs
is now with too many. Brotherly
love and mutual dearneſs was a characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Note of thoſe then, that now may be
as well known by their diſtractions and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities.<note place="margin">Orat. 1.</note>
St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> ſaid of
thoſe Times, That if one Chriſtian took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the error, ſin or failing of another,
it was to bewail it, to heal it, to cover his
ſhame, and cure his wound, and prevent a
ſcandal to his Profeſſion; but he obſerved,
that after-times made triumphs of mens
weakneſs and follies; and men learnt to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
their own wickedneſs by the miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
<pb facs="tcp:45558:15"/>
of their Brethren; and that he that
would prove himſelf of the higheſt form of
Chriſtians, ſet himſelf down in the ſeat of
the ſcorner.</p>
            <p>Nothing was then thought too good or coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the ſervice of God or Religion: Men
would not content themſelves to ſerve God
with that which coſt them nothing. It was
only <hi>Julian,</hi> or ſuch another, that envyed
the coſtly Veſſels, wherewith Chriſt was ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Works of Piety and Mercy and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
coſt them as much as Luxury and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
now a dayes. When the Gentiles in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>'s
time, upbraided the Chriſtians, that
they made choice of a Cheap Religion, and
renounced the Pagan Sacrifices, becauſe they
would not undergo the charge of them; and
complained that the Frugality of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Worſhip cauſed a decay of Trade for the
Eaſtern Gumms and Spices, that uſed to be
ſpent in the ſervice of the Gods, and that by
this means the Cuſtoms of the Emperors were
alſo diminiſhed: To all this he makes this
anſwer: <hi>We Chriſtians ſpend more in the
relief of the poor, than you Gentiles do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Gods: And though we uſe not
Gumms and Spices for Incenſe, yet we as
much promote Trade by the vaſt proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of thoſe commodities we ſpend in the</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45558:16"/>
               <hi>imbalming our dead. And laſtly, if it ſhould
happen that the Emperors Exchequer ſhould
loſe any thing, either by the temperance of
our Lives, or the nature of our Religion,
yet we make it up another way; for we
make conſcience of paying him his juſt dues:
whereas you cheat and defraud him of
more than the proportion of your expences
above ours would amount to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In thoſe early times the Chriſtian Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
drained and emptied the <hi>Roman</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres,
and the multitude thronged into the
Church, as earneſtly as now they crowd out;
<hi>Coimus in coetum ut ad deum quaſi manu
factâ precationibus ambiamus orantes,</hi> ſaid
the forementioned <hi>Tertullian.</hi> The conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the publick Worſhip was in thoſe
dayes ſo great, and the conſent of heart and
voice ſo univerſal, that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaid, The
<hi>Hallelujahs</hi> of the Church was like the noiſe
of many Waters, and the <hi>Amen</hi> like Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
Heaven and Earth then anſwered
each other in a glorious <hi>Antiphone,</hi> and
made up one bleſſed <hi>Chorus:</hi> There was joy
in Heaven, and peace on Earth: The
Hymn ſung by the Angel at our Saviours
Nativity, was verified in thoſe firſt Ages
of his Religion, <hi>Glory to God on High,
on Earth peace, and Good-will amongſt men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45558:16"/>
The Holy men of thoſe times that approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our Saviour, had as it were ſome Rayes
of his Divinity ſhed upon them, and their
faces ſhone like <hi>Moſes</hi>'s, when he came down
from the Holy Mount.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian Church was a Colledge of holy
and good men, and the Glory of God filled the
place where they aſſembled; and Fire came
down from Heaven too, but not to ſet the
World in combuſtion, but to exhale and lift
up the Odours of pious and devout Prayers.</p>
            <p>But ſince thoſe times Zeal hath decayed,
as if it had not been the intrinſick Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of Religion but the fires of Pagan Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
that kindled that heat in the breaſts
of Chriſtians. And the Church ſo divided
and broken in pieces, as if it was not one
Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm that united
them, but a common enemy. Dry Opinions
have been taken for Faith, and Zeal of a
Party hath gone for Holineſs of Life; Men
have been buſie in making new Creeds, and
have forgotten to practiſe the old one. And
ſince the Empire hath been divided into Eaſt,
and Weſt, Churches have been at defiance,
and as oppoſite to each other as thoſe points
are. In ſhort, the once famous <hi>Greek</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb facs="tcp:45558:17"/>
are now over-run with ſo ſqualid a
Barbariſm, that little but the Name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
is left amongſt them: And the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 8.</note> whoſe Faith was famous and
<hi>ſpoken of through all the world,</hi> is now as
infamous for Uſurpation, Superſtition and
Cruelty, and ſo deformed with Pagan Rites
and mundane Policies, that Chriſtianity is the
leaſt part of her.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we take to be the reaſon of
this general Defection? Was it only Novelty
and not its intrinſick Goodneſs and Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
that commended this Religion to the
World, that the longer it laſts, the leſs it
ſignifies? Or are the Principles of Chriſtianity
effete (like the Cauſes of the Gentile Oracles,
as <hi>Plutarch</hi> diſcourſes) that all the motives
of Virtue and Holineſs have now ſo little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon mens tempers and lives? Or is
it true that was ſaid of old, <hi>Religio peperit
divitias, &amp; filia devoravit matrem,</hi> ſince
Churches have been endowed, men have
eſpouſed only the Fortune, and not the Faith?
Or is the true reaſon, that of old, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
was deeply rooted in the Hearts of
men, and brought forth the fruits of good
works in their Lives: whereas now it is
only a barren notion in mens Heads, and is
productive of nothing but leaves of Opinion
<pb facs="tcp:45558:17"/>
and Profeſſion? Then it was the employment
of mens hearts in meditation, of their knees
in devotion, of their hands in diſtribution
and beneficence: now it is become the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of mens ears in hearing novelty, of
their tongues and lips in cenſuring and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing.</p>
            <p>But whatever the cauſes have been, ſuch
is the condition of Religion generally in the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Churches; and I doubt if
we come nearer home, we ſhall not find things
much better.</p>
            <p>This Iſland of <hi>Britain</hi> had the glory not
only to be the native Countrey of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
the firſt Chriſtian Emperour, but a far Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that under <hi>Lucius</hi> it received the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith firſt of any great Kingdom in the
world. <hi>Britannorum loca, Romanis inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſa,
Chriſto verò ſubdita,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
The Croſs made a more effectual as well as
a more happy Conqueſt here, than all the
<hi>Roman</hi> Powers could do. And this Northern
Climate was not only thus early enlightned
with the beams of the Sun of Righteouſneſs,
but had life and warmth proportionably. An
evidence whereof we have, in that we find
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops at the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> which
was held before the <hi>Nicene:</hi> And at the
<pb facs="tcp:45558:18"/>
time of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council <hi>Britian</hi> was count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one of the Six Dioceſes of the Weſtern
Empire. And for the Zeal of the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Chriſtians, the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Albane,
Amphilochius</hi> and others are great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
inſtances.</p>
            <p>But to deſcend to lower times. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of this Iſland have not been more
famous for Martial Proweſs againſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
hoſpitality to ſtrangers, and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
towards all mankind, (which three things
have been, and, I hope, are ſtill their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
glories,) than for ſincere piety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.
<hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> and
<hi>Eraſmus</hi> a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> both of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Communion, and competent Witneſſes, do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
That there was more true Devotion
and ſincerity of Religion in this Church and
Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> than in any one place
of the world beſides. What was ſaid of <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
that <hi>ibi ſenes ſunt maximè ſenes,</hi> might
be applyed to this purpoſe, that here Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were ſo the moſt heartily and truly of
any people in the world. The Univerſal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
(as he would be called) I mean the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> obſerved the Sheep of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
to bear ſuch good Fleeces, and ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
to ſubmit to the Shearer, that he kept
a watchful eye over this Flock, and his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy
<pb facs="tcp:45558:18"/>
was rewarded with the Golden
Fleece. He and his Emiſſaries found ſuch
large hearts and devout minds here, that
we are inabled to underſtand the reaſon of
their great concern for our going aſtray
ſince, and their earneſt and unwearied endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to reduce us back again to that fold.
Yet what by being oftner ſhorn than fed,
(and then not with the beſt Paſtures nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,)
what by the ill examples of others,
(but eſpecially of their Guides,) and what
by length of time; corruption overſpread
this Church too: But then, as it happens
in bodies of a ſtrong and vivacious Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
when they chance by ill Diet or other
accident, to be ſtuft with Crudities and bad
humours, they Critically evacuate them by
meer ſtrength of Nature: So this Church
gave certain proof that it had <hi>ſana princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi>
and a true ſenſe of the reality of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
that one of the firſt in <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
it returned to it ſelf and a juſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
by a Reformation.</p>
            <p>And the Reformation of this Church,
which the Romaniſts, for their own ends, ſo
much deteſt, and ſome others unreaſonably
ſlight, was as much the Emulation of other
Nations, as Glorious in it ſelf. For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45558:19"/>
1. It was the moſt orderly and beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Chriſtianity; it was not brought
in with Tumult and Sedition, as moſt
Changes are, but by Laws and the Supream
Magiſtrate. There was no noiſe of Axes
and Hammers in this Building, but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts of this Fabrick fell in together
with a kind of Harmony, as the Jews ſay of
the Temple of <hi>Salomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It was the moſt moderate and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
as being the reſult of Deliberation and
Reaſon, not of blind Paſſion or an humour of
Innovation. Our Reformers did not purge
out the good, becauſe formerly it had been
abuſed (as the humour of ſome men is to
do) but vindicated what was uſeful, from
the abuſe: they neither countenanced what
was evil by the good was to be found, nor
rejected the good for the caſual adherence of
evil. They did not aboliſh a venerable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or Office in the Church for the ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of ſome that had born it; but took care
to put better men in the rooms of ſuch. They
were not of opinion, that the Church could
not arrive at primitive purity, unleſs it was
reduced to primitive poverty; nor becauſe
they found ſome Ceremonies then uſed that
were ſuperſtitious and dangerous, and thought
<pb facs="tcp:45558:19"/>
too many were but denſome, therefore conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all decency in the ſervice of God was Popiſh.
And in ſhort, they did not depart farther from
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> by Reformation, than
ſhe had departed from the Truth and her
ſelf by degeneracy and corruption. By all
which they demonſtrated, that the change
they made, was not for the ſake of humour
and faction, but neceſſity and publick good.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> reproaches us with
the ſiniſter ends of the Prince and ſeveral
of thoſe that ſate at the helm of this great
affair: But who knows not, that it is the uſual
method of Almighty God to bring about his
own deſigns, and accompliſh the greateſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
to Mankind, by making the ſiniſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of men co-operate towards them?
He made uſe of the unnatural cruelty of
<hi>Joſeph</hi>'s brethren towards him, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the whole family of <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Aegypt</hi> as an Harbinger and
Nurſe to provide for them in a famine.
And in reſpect hereof <hi>Joſeph</hi> tells them, <hi>it
was not they, but God ſent him thither.</hi>
The Cruelty of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who ſought by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
to break and wear out the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
harden'd them and prepared them for all the
difficulties they were afterwards to encounter.
The obſtinacy and incredulity of the Jews,
<pb facs="tcp:45558:20"/>
proved to be <hi>the riches of the Gentiles.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 8. 4.</note> The
perſecution of the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> made
way for the ſpreading of the Goſpel into all
other Countreys. Inſtances of this kind are
innumerable; or if they were not, yet were
it very unſafe for thoſe of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> to make this objection, leſt they provoke
us to ſay what cannot be either denyed or
juſtified, That the barbarous Tyrant and
Uſurper <hi>Phocas</hi> brought in the Univerſal
Paſtorſhip of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that
the moſt bloody and rapacious Princes have
ordinarily been the great Patrons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowers
of their Church; thinking, it ſeems,
to hallow their own Villanies, and legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
their unjuſt acquiſitions, by dividing
the ſpoil with the Biſhop and Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reformation was the moſt
compleat and perfect in its kind, as retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the moſt antient Doctrine and ſoundeſt
Confeſſion of Faith, founded upon the holy
Scriptures, and agreeable to the firſt General
Councils, the moſt Primitive Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a Liturgy the beſt accommodate
to reconcile and unite mens Devotions: Such
a Liturgy, as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> the Author of the
Martyrologie is not afraid to ſay was indited
by the Holy Ghoſt; but certainly had a great
<pb facs="tcp:45558:20"/>
teſtimony in the unſpeakable joy and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
holy men took in it in King <hi>Edward</hi>
the Sixths dayes, their zeal for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of it, longing for the reſtitution of
it, and ſealing it with their blood in Queen
<hi>Maries</hi> dayes, and the univerſal triumphs and
acclamations at the reſtoring of it in Queen
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign.</p>
            <p>And admirable it is to conſider how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
this Church and Nation then was; in
what Glory and Majeſty the Prince reigned,
in what Peace and Concord the Subjects liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but eſpecially it is remarkable, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
and pious an Age that was, as is ſcarce
perhaps to be parallel'd ſince the time that
Chriſtianity flouriſht under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the
Great. what reverence was then yielded to
the Miniſters of Religion? What devotion to
the publick worſhip? How general an acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence
of hearts and minds in it?</p>
            <p>Which the greater it was, the more juſt is
our wonder, and the more reaſonable our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
what ſhould be the Cauſe that in the
ſame Church, and amongſt devout and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt-minded
Engliſhmen, ſuch a zeal ſhould
terminate in ſo cold an indifferency, as
may now be obſerved; or rather that ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:45558:21"/>
a bleſſed harmony ſhould degenerate into
ſo much diſcord, as is now too diſcernable
amongſt us.</p>
            <p>We read <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. that when the ſecond
Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was building, the young
men rejoyced at the reviving glory of their
Nation and Religion, but the old men that had
beheld the far greater ſplendour and more
ſtately Majeſty of the former Temple built
by <hi>Salomon,</hi> they wept, as contemplating
how far this came ſhort of that: ſo that it
was hard to ſay, whether the ſhouts of the
young men or the lamentations of the elder
were the more loud. And truly when we
conſider in how low a condition the Church
of <hi>England</hi> was ſome few years ſince, till it
had a happy Reſurrection with the return of
our Gracious Soveraign, will ſee cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
and thank God that we are in no worſe
condition than we are; But he that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
and conſiders what was the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the firſt Age of our Reformation,
and compares it with the preſent condition of
our affairs, will have juſt cauſe to lament
the difference.</p>
            <p>For in thoſe dayes ſo venerable was the
Society of the Church, that to be caſt out of

they counted a Civil death, and dreaded
as much as a Natural. But now it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a matter of Ambition with ſome, and

            <p>There were few or none then that did

            <p>In that time we ſpeak of, the Liturgy

part of Gods worſhip; now they are
not only nothing without a Sermon, but in
danger to deſecrate the Sermon too by their

            <p>Heretofore there were but few things

a Proverb to juſtifie the

what age ſoever) do not think themſelves

               <p>That our Church is of a ſound and
healthful conſtitution, and might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſo, had it not met with this fortune,
I think I have ſufficiently, though briefly
manifeſted in the foregoing Introduction:
But ſome men either loving to be alwayes
reforming, or having firſt ſeparated from it,
that they may either commend their own
skill, or juſtifie their own fact, muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:45558:24"/>
We read of <hi>Brutus,</hi> that having killed
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> he was alwayes after inveighing againſt
him as a Tyrant, <hi>Ità enim facto ejus expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diebat,</hi>
ſaith the Hiſtorian, It was expedient
he ſhould call <hi>Caeſar</hi> Tyrant, for otherwiſe
himſelf muſt be a notorious Traytor. So
theſe men, though the greateſt diſorders of
the Church be but what themſelves have
made, muſt find faults, that they may not
ſeem to have raiſed all the duſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
themſelves and others from it without
cauſe.</p>
               <p>1. And in the firſt place the Doctrine of
this Church is blamed; though thanks be to
God, there are but few that are of ſo little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion
as to bring in this charge, and thoſe
that are, will never be able to prove it.</p>
               <p>The main (if not the only) thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
againſt in this kind, is, that the thirty
nine Articles are not ſo punctual in defining
the five points debated at the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi>
as they could wiſh. But this though it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
needs nor deſerves an anſwer, yet I ſhall
reply theſe two things to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is not ſo with the Doctrine
of Chriſtianity as with common Arts and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45558:25"/>
Sciences, which depend upon humane wit
and invention, and conſequently are capable
of daily improvements: For the mind of
man having not an intuitive knowledge, but
proceeding by way of diſcourſe, diſcovers
one thing by another, and infers things from
one another; ſo that there is not a <hi>Nè plus
ultrà</hi> in thoſe things, but daily new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
<hi>&amp; dies diem docet.</hi> Whereto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
the ſaying of wiſe men, <hi>Antiquitas
ſaeculi, eſt juventus mundi,</hi> That which we
call the old World, is but indeed the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of knowledge, and the latter Times muſt
needs have as much the advantage of truth
as they have of deliberation and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But it is quite otherwiſe with Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
for that depending ſolely upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation, can admit of no new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries;
time may obſcure it, and the buſie
wit of man may perplex and confound it
with its inventions, but can never diſcover
any thing new, or bring to light any truth
that was not ſo from the beginning. For if
we admit of new Revelations, we loſe the
old and our Religion together, we accuſe
our Saviour and his Apoſtles as if they had
not ſufficiently revealed Gods mind to the
world, and we incurr St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Anathema</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45558:25"/>
which he denounces againſt him (whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it ſhall be, nay, if an Anger from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)
that ſhall preach any other doctrine than
what had been received. And St. <hi>Jude</hi> hath
told us the Faith was <hi>once,</hi> that is either at
once, or once for all delivered to or by the
Saints. But if we ſhall pretend a private
Spirit or Revelation to diſcover and interpret
what was before delivered, we do as bad;
we ſuppoſe Chriſt and his Apoſtles not to
be able to deliver the mind of God, and we
open a Gap for all Impoſtures and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
perpetually to infeſt and corrupt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Doctrine.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of theſe premiſes is, that
(contrary to what I affirmed before of other
Sciences) the elder any Doctrine of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
can be proved to be, it muſt needs be
the truer, and accordingly deſerve the greater
veneration from us, as coming nearer the
fountain of Evangelical Truth, Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
and that he that talks of more clear
Light of the latter times, and clearer diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
in Religion, talks as fooliſhly as he
that ſhould affirm he could diſcern things bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at a miles diſtance, than the man that hath
as good eyes as himſelf, and yet ſtood cloſe by
the object.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45558:26"/>
This being ſo, it muſt needs be the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
and great commendation of this Church,
that her Articles of Doctrine agree better
with the firſt Times of Chriſtianity than the
laſt Age; and is an irrefragable Argument
that ſhe derived it not from any Lake or lower
ſtreams troubled and mudded with mens paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and diſputes, but from the Fountain of
the holy Scripture, and from thoſe who
certainly had beſt advantage of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in its own ſimplicity, the Primitive
Church. That no one Father or Writer of
the Church, whether Greek or Latin, before
St. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> time agreed in Doctrine with the
determination of the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> is ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
plain that it needs no proof, nor
can be denyed. And if he (I mean St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>)
agrees therewith, yet it is certain that
in ſo doing he diſagrees as much with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as he doth with us of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> And what if St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> a devout
good man, (but whoſe Piety was far more
commendable than his Reaſon,) being hard
put to it by the <hi>Manichees</hi> on one hand, and
the <hi>Pelagians</hi> on the other, was not able to
extricate himſelf, who can help it? Shall his
Opinion, and that which he was rather
forced into by diſputation than made choice
of, but eſpecially ſhall the Determination
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45558:26"/>
of a few Divines at <hi>Dort</hi> vye with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Doctrine of the Primitive Church, or
make that an imputation upon our Church,
which is really amongſt its Glories? Muſt
a novel <hi>Dutch Synod</hi> preſcribe Doctrine to
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and outweigh all
Antiquity? Shall thoſe that knew not how
God could be juſt, unleſs he was cruel, nor
great, unleſs he decreed to damn the greateſt
part of Mankind; that could not tell how
man ſhould be kept humble, unleſs they made
him not a man but a ſtock or ſtone: Shall, I
ſay, ſuch Men and ſuch Opinions confront
the Antient Catholick Apoſtolick Faith, held
forth in the Church of <hi>England?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Articles of the Doctrine
of this Church do with ſuch admirable pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and warineſs handle theſe points we
are now ſpeaking of, as if particular reſpect
was had to theſe men, and care taken that
they might <hi>abundare ſuo ſenſu,</hi> enjoy their
own Judgements, and yet without check ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to theſe Articles. And accordingly
it is well known, that not many years ſince,
when the <hi>Dort</hi> Opinions were very predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
amongſt many Divines of this Church,
they uſed (it may be) a little more ſchola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
ſubtilty to reconcile their own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with theſe Articles, but never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45558:27"/>
the latter for the ſake of the former.</p>
               <p>And at this day divers good men are in the
ſervice of this Church that are in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Judgements of the <hi>Dort</hi> perſwaſion, and
yet never thought their ſubſcription to theſe
Articles did any violence to their Conſciences
or Judgements: therefore this can be no cauſe
of our Troubles, nor ground of Separation
from the Church.</p>
               <p>A ſecond pretence againſt this Church is,
that it is not ſufficiently purged from the
droſs of Popiſh Superſtitions, that it comes
too near the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo the
Communion of it is dangerous.</p>
               <p>Popery is an odious Name in this Nation,
and God be thanked that it is ſo, for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
no leſs: But as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> when he
condemned the <hi>Arrians</hi> and decreed their
Books ſhould be burnt, appointed that they
ſhould be called <hi>Porphyrians,</hi> a Name ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
deteſted by the generality of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
So thoſe men that have a mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Church, know no more effectual
way of affixing an Ignominy upon it, than
by laying the imputation of Popery to it.
And indeed if the Charge were as true as it is
falſe, or if it were as probable as it is mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45558:27"/>
it would not only ſerve to exaſperate
the Vulgar againſt the Church, but to juſtifie
their Seceſſion from it. But it is hard to ſay
whether the unreaſonableneſs or the unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs
be greater in this ſuggeſtion. For,</p>
               <p>1. It is certain there hath been little or
no alteration made in either the Doctrine,
Diſcipline or Liturgy ſince the firſt Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and therefore if either of them incline
too much that way, they did ſo from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
Now that which I inquire into, is,
what ſhould be the cauſes of the late revolt
and ſeparation from this Church, or what
ſhould make that diſcernable change in mens
affections towards it, from what was in the
former Age? And he that tells me it was Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly
conſtituted at firſt, gives indeed a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
(if it was true) why this Reformation
ſhould not have been entertained at firſt,
but doth not aſſign a cauſe why thoſe ſhould
depart from it now, that had imbraced it
with ſo much zeal formerly. He therefore
that would ſpeak home to this caſe, muſt
ſhew that this Church hath <hi>loſt its firſt love,</hi>
and hath warped towards the old corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from which it was once purged. But
this is ſo far from being poſſible to be ſhewn,
that it is certain on the contrary, that all the
change that hath been made of late years,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45558:28"/>
hath been meerly in complyance with and
condeſcenſion to thoſe that object this againſt
it; and a man would reaſonably expect, they
would eaſily pardon ſuch Innovations.</p>
               <p>But in truth the main quarrel is, that
we are not alwayes reforming, but keep to
the old Matron-like Dreſs, the Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
faſhion. If the Governours of the
Church would comply with the curioſity of
this wanton Age, our Religion would quickly
have the fortune of <hi>Apelles</hi>'s picture accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the known ſtory. He to deride the
conceited folly of the Age, expoſes to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
view a Maſter-piece of his work: And
as it uſually happens, that every body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to skill in reforming (by the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of the Proverb that ſaith, <hi>facile
eſt inventu addere</hi>) ſcarcely any perſon
that paſt by, but ſpent their verdict upon the
picture; All commend it in the general, yet
to give ſome ſpecial inſtance of their skill,
every one finds ſome fault or other: One
would have had more Shadow, another leſs;
one commends the Eye, but blames a Lip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The ſubtil Artiſt obſerves all, and ſtill as
any paſſenger had ſhot his bolt, alters the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
accordingly. The reſult was, that at
laſt by ſo many Reformations it became ſo
deformed and monſtrous a piece, that not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45558:28"/>
only wiſer men, but theſe vulgar Reformers
themſelves wondered at it, and could now
diſcern nothing worthy ſo famed an Artiſt.
He on the other hand, to right himſelf, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
another Piece of the ſame Beauty and
Art, which he had hitherto kept up by him,
and had eſcaped their cenſure, and upbraids
them thus, <hi>Hanc ego feci, iſtam populus,</hi>
This latter is my work, the other is a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of your own making.</p>
               <p>This is our caſe; Chriſtian Religion was
by holy and wiſe men our Reformers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
of thoſe gaudy and meretricious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements
the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> had dreſt her up
in, and habited according to primitive ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity;
but this would not pleaſe every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
every Sect and Party would have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
or other added or altered according to
their ſeveral phancies and Hypotheſes, which
if it ſhould be allowed (the opinions of men
are ſo contrary one to another as well as to
truth) the true lineaments of Chriſtianity
would quite be loſt. Upon this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath not this Church been very fond
of alterations.</p>
               <p>But to all this it is likely it will be reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That now we have more light and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
blemiſhes and deformities, which (though
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45558:29"/>
they were before, yet) we could not diſcern
when our ſelves came out of the dark Den of
Popery. At firſt, like the man under cure of
his blindneſs, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 24. we ſaw men as
trees walking, we diſcovered only ſome more
palpable errors, but now we diſcern though
leſſer yet not tolerable deformities.</p>
               <p>2. To this therefore I anſwer in the ſecond
place, That it is certain all is not to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Popery, that is held or practiſed by the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and it cannot be our duty
(as I have ſaid before) to depart further from
her than ſhe hath departed from the truth:
for then it would be our duty to forſake
Chriſtianity it ſelf in deteſtation of Popery.
To reform is not ſurely to caſt away every
thing that was in uſe before, unleſs Barbariſm
be the only through Reformation.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtorian obſerves of thoſe that ſpoil
Provinces and ranſack Kingdoms <hi>ubi ſolitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
fecere pacem appellant,</hi> when they had
converted a flouriſhing Countrey into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate
wilderneſs, they called this a profound
peace. But ſure to reform is not to deſtroy
and lay waſte, but to amend. Unleſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it can be proved againſt the Church of
<hi>England</hi> that ſhe holds or practiſes any thing
falſe or ſinful, it will little avail them that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45558:29"/>
object againſt her, and as little be any ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
to her conſtitution, that in ſome things
ſhe concurs with the <hi>Roman.</hi> Nor is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to ſay, ſuch a thing is received from
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> meerly becauſe there it
is to be found, unleſs it be to be found no
where elſe: for though it be true that many
things are the ſame in both Churches, (in as
much as it is impoſſible they ſhould be Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Chriſt at all elſe,) yet it is as true that
thoſe things wherein they agree are ſuch (and
no other) as were received generally by all
Chriſtian Churches, and by the <hi>Roman</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it lay under any ill character. But that
this Church doth not ſo ſyncretize with that
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to make its Communion unſafe
or ſinful, I ſuppoſe the following Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
will give ſufficient ſecurity to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced
mind. In the mean time let me
intreat him that hath entertained any ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
of that kind againſt her, to give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
Anſwer of theſe two or three Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>1. If there be ſuch a dangerous affinity
betwixt the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,</hi>
how came it to paſs that the bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of our Reformation, ſuch as A.
Biſhop <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer</hi> and others,
laid down their lives in teſtimony to this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45558:30"/>
againſt that? For if thoſe of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> could have been ſo barbarous as cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to murder thoſe excellent perſons for ſome
ſlight Innovations, or for differing from them
in Circumſtantials; yet certainly ſuch wiſe
and good men would not have been ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
of their own blood, nor weary of their
lives as to caſt them away upon Trifles. It
is probable at leaſt therefore that thoſe of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thought the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to be eſſentially different from them;
and it is more than probable that thoſe holy
men aforeſaid thought ſo, and did not offer
to God the ſacrifice of fools.</p>
               <p>2. Or how comes it to paſs that all thoſe
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from ours, and are commanded ſo to
do by the Head of their Church under peril
of damnation? And on the other ſide the
true Proteſtants of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
think it their duty to abſent themſelves from
the <hi>Roman</hi> Worſhip, leſt they ſhould defile
their Conſciences with their Superſtitions?
I ſay how comes this diſtance and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſin and danger reciprocally, if the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
between them be inconſiderable?</p>
               <p>3. Whence comes it to paſs, that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots</hi>
of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church have more ſpite
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45558:30"/>
againſt our Church, than againſt any Sect or
Party whatſoever? but that they take us not
only for Enemies, but the moſt mortal and
formidable of all thoſe they have to do
with.</p>
               <p>Or Laſtly, if both the Church and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>England</hi> are not far enough removed
from any participation with that of <hi>Rome,</hi>
how comes it to paſs that they of all men
moſt zealouſly and conſtantly upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſtand in the gap and oppoſe the return of
Popery into <hi>England,</hi> when other men either
ſlight the danger, or are ſo fond of their own
private ſentiments, as apparently to run the
hazard of this for the ſake of them? Any
reaſonable man would think thoſe men have
not really ſuch an abhorrence of Popery as
they pretend, and that there might eaſily be
found terms of accommodation between them,
when he ſhall obſerve them more fond of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
petty Opinion, than concern'd for the
publick Security againſt that common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
And that they will rather venture the
danger of that breaking in upon them, than
forgo the leaſt fancy or opinion; nay, will
be inſtrumental in procuring a Toleration
and ſuſpenſion of the publick Laws for that,
which they are ſo jealous others ſhould have
any kindneſs for. And for proof of this, I
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45558:31"/>
call to witneſs the tranſactions of the laſt
year, when thoſe very men that would be
thought the <hi>Atlas</hi>'s and only ſupporters of
Proteſtant Religion, and would give out as if
their Zeal was the only Bulwark againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
had by their ſeparation from, and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to this Church, weakned the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and by their reſtleſs importunities and
unlimited deſires of liberty, in a manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
a ſuſpenſion of the Laws touching
Religion. Had not His Majeſty and His
Parliament timely foreſeen the conſequence,
and the whole Nation been awakned into an
apprehenſion of the danger by the ſerious
and conſtant admonitions of the Epiſcopal
Clergy, Popery might have come in like a
Landflood upon us, notwithſtanding thoſe
quickſighted Watchmen that can ſpy Popery
ſo far off. I ſay had not the <hi>Church-men</hi>
eſpecially beſtirred themſelves, and ſhewed
both a better courage and zeal againſt Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and alſo a better skill in that warfare
than their Accuſers, the ſo much dreaded
Enemy had ere this time been in fair hopes
of attaining his deſires.</p>
               <p>This was a paſſage of ſo much glory to
the true Church-men, and ſo great and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
an inſtance of their integrity, that I
am in hope whileſt it ſhall remain in memory,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45558:31"/>
Malice it ſelf will be aſhamed to lay any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of inclining to Popery either upon
the Church or Church-men of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to add to all this, That there
are as underſtanding men in Religion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of as holy Lives, and of as comfortable
Conſciences, of this Churches Education, as
are any where to be found in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.
Which three things together fully
acquit any Church of participation with
Popery. For that degeneracy of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is for nothing more truly hateful, nor by
nothing more diſcoverable than by its blind
devotion, principles of immorality, and the
bad ſecurity it gives to the Conſciences of
men; which who ſo acquits any Church of,
(as every conſiderate man muſt needs do
this Church) he ſhall after that, very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
leave any ill character upon her, at
leaſt of that nature we now are ſpeaking of.</p>
               <p>3. But there is a terrible Charge yet to
come, and that is againſt the Sufficiency, but
eſpecially the Sanctity of the Clergy and
Miniſtry of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> as if
they, like the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 15. <hi>made
men to abhor the offerings of the Lord.</hi> And
this is made the pretence of reſorting to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,
and forſaking the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:45558:32"/>
Now if this was as true as it is horribly
falſe, it might be an Objection perhaps fit
for a <hi>Papiſt</hi> to make, who is taught that the
efficacy of all Divine Offices depends upon
the intention and condition of him that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters;
But no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
his own principles can make uſe
of it to juſtifie his receſſion from the Church:
For if the efficacy of all Divine Ordinances
depend upon the Divine Inſtitution and the
concurrence of Gods Grace with my uſe of
them, what can it prejudice me, that he that
adminiſters is an evil or unlearned man, ſo
long as I prepare my ſelf to receive benefit
immediately from God in the uſe of the
means appointed by him? This therefore
may ſerve for a malicious ſtone to caſt at
us from whom they are departed; but no
argument in the cauſe, nor excuſe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Yet I confeſs nevertheleſs, this way of
arguing (for we muſt be forced to call hard
word by that name) is of great prevalence
with injudicious perſons, and able to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
them againſt the beſt Conſtitutions in
the world. For they not underſtanding the
reaſon of things, give reception and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to any propoſition in proportion to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45558:32"/>
the opinion or reverence they have for the
perſon that recommends it. It is a known
ſtory, how well the <hi>Spartans</hi> were aware of
this; and therefore if in their Council, a
man of a bad life had propounded excellent
counſel, they would not ſuffer him, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn
ſome other perſon of great ſanctity to
be the Author of it: Amongſt other reaſons,
leſt the ill opinion that was generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of the perſon, ſhould derogate from
the weight and value of the counſel and
advice.</p>
               <p>Therefore the more extreamly to blame
are thoſe that acknowledging the truth and
excellency of the Doctrine of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> can yet find in their hearts to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
the ſucceſs of it by ſowing ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and in raiſing ſcandals againſt them, that
are to propagate it.</p>
               <p>It will be to the immortal glory of the
Great <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that when at the <hi>Nicene</hi>
Council the Biſhops and Clergy had exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
to him a great bundle of Libels one
againſt another, he burnt them all together
before their faces, as thinking them fitter
for the <hi>fire</hi> than the <hi>light.</hi> And proteſted
he had ſo great a zeal for the reputation of
Church-men, and ſuch a ſenſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45558:33"/>
and conſequence of their good ſame and
reputation, that if he ſhould ſee one of them
in the moſt ſcandalous commiſſion, he would
cover ſuch a mans ſhame with his own
Purple.</p>
               <p>But as I doubt in theſe dayes there is little
of the Spirit and Charity of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſo
thanks be to God, there is little need of it
in this caſe; for I doubt not to convince this
ſuggeſtion againſt the <hi>Church-men</hi> of as
much falſhood, as the former againſt the
<hi>Church</hi> of frivolouſneſs. For though there
want not thoſe in theſe dayes that are ſo
quick-ſighted as to diſcover ſpots in the Sun
it ſelf: Though I ſay, there be both thoſe
that have great skill in all the methods of
uncharitableneſs, ſuch as can inſinuate little
whiſpers and jealouſies firſt, and then foment
and hatch them up to a ſtory, and then ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
the fact, and laſtly make the folly
of ſome one man, be the ſcandal of the whole
Order; And alſo thoſe Atheiſtical perſons
whoſe intereſt it is (in order to the extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
their own villanies,) as much as may
be to render the perſons of thoſe that reprove
them as ridiculous as they can, and to that
purpoſe are become great proficients of late
in a ſcurrilous kind of drollery, whereby
they can ſublimate their own vices and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45558:33"/>
into a kind of vapour, a meer
frolick and Gentile humour, and on the other
ſide aggravate the meer humane infirmities of
graver men into great deformities: yet all
their combined wit and malice will never
be able to affix any ſcandal upon the Body of
the preſent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy.</p>
               <p>1. For their Learning and Ability: If the
Preaching of the preſent Age be not better
than that of former, I would fain know the
reaſon why the Homilies are in no greater
reputation, and ſhould expect to ſee the
people deſire their Paſtors to read them in
the Congregation, and ſave the labour of
their own compoſitions.</p>
               <p>If the Sermons of foreign Divines be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> what is then
the reaſon that all Proteſtants abroad admire
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> way of Preaching, inſomuch that
ſome foreign Congregations (as I am credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
informed) defray the charges of the
travails of their Paſtor into <hi>England,</hi> as well
as diſpenſe with their abſence, that they may
return to them inſtructed in the method of
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Preaching.</p>
               <p>Whether the Preaching in the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> be to be preferred before ours, he that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45558:34"/>
hath not a mind to travail into thoſe parts,
may yet indifferently well reſolve himſelf, if
he take but the pains to read a Book written
by <hi>Eraſmus</hi> of the Art of Preaching: which
whoſoever hath done or ſhall do, I verily
perſwade my ſelf, he ſhall quickly be able
to reckon up more follies and ridiculous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
than all thoſe gathered together by
the Author of the <hi>Inquiry into the Cauſes of
the Contempt of the Clergy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, He that ſhall take the pains or
have the curioſity to compare the Preachings
generally in our <hi>Churches</hi> with thoſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
in the <hi>Conventicles,</hi> will either find
them very unequally matcht, or elſe if he
hath any reaſon at all, he hath reaſon to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
himſelf intolerably prejudicate. For
on the one ſide, he ſhall find ſound Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
ſtrength of Argument, gravity of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and diſtinctineſs of Method; on the other
ſide nothing more frequent than puerile and
flat, oft-times rude, and ſometimes blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
expreſſions, Similitudes inſtead of
Arguments, and either apiſh Geſtures, or
tragical Vociferations inſtead of Eloquence.</p>
               <p>Beſides, a wiſe man may in great meaſure
take an eſtimate of the wiſdom and abilities
of a Preacher or Writer by the very ſubject
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45558:34"/>
he chooſes to diſcourſe on, and not only by the
manner of handling it. And he that ſhall
impartially apply himſelf to this little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
may eaſily obſerve the Sermons and
Tractates of the Non-conformiſts generally,
to be either about. <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> which
(beſides the danger of it amongſt the people
for miſtakes) nothing but unskilfulneſs could
make any man confident enough to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the unfolding of; or about <hi>Union with
God and Chriſt,</hi> which themſelves confeſs to
be unintelligible, and they help to make it
ſo; or the <hi>ſweetneſs, beauty</hi> and <hi>lovelineſs</hi>
of Chriſt's <hi>Perſon,</hi> which is ſeldome han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
with any better effect, than the ſtirring
up ſome ſenſual paſſion or other in the fond
Auditors, as I have ſeen verified by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
               <p>God forbid that I ſhould charge all the
Non-conformiſts with ſuch indecencies as
theſe; but it is manifeſt it is ſuch kind of
diſcourſes as I have intimated, that are the
moſt taking and raviſhing amongſt them.</p>
               <p>But then on the other ſide, you ſhall hear
Diſcourſes of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> of
God, and the <hi>reaſon of Religion</hi> deduced
thence; of the <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of <hi>Contentment, Reverence</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:45558:35"/>
inferred therefrom; of the <hi>Eternal
reaſons of Good and Evil,</hi> and <hi>indiſpenſable
obligations to Virtue,</hi> as the conſequence of
that principle laid upon the Conſciences of
men; of the <hi>nature of Faith, the neceſſity
of Holineſs, of Charity, of Obedience to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours:</hi>
all which are good and profitable,
and of great weight and importance.</p>
               <p>If we now compare the <hi>Writings</hi> of both
parties, the difference will yet be more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.
Although it hath been obſerved of
old by a Wiſe and Great man, That general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ableſt of men have not been moſt given
to writing of Books, as being loth to make
themſelves Themes for fools to comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but a middle ſort of men are moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed,
and uſually have beſt ſucceſs that
way, whoſe Genius is more adequate to vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
capacities: yet let any man of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
judgement lay paſſion and prejudice aſide,
and ſay, if the Writings of the Divines of
this Church, both in the Controverſies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and moſt other parts of Learning,
have not matcht any other Profeſſion, any
other Church, but extreamly overmatcht
their Opponents? It were eaſie to name Men
and Writings, but I conceive it needleſs in ſo
clear a caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:45558:35"/>
2. But then for the lives of Church-men;
Though I will not render evil for evil, nor
retaliate the reproaches caſt upon the Sons of
the Church, by ripping up the miſcarriages
of the other perſwaſions: For (beſides that
I have not ſo leaned Chriſt,) I have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo much of the world, that ſuch unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
recriminations have not only made an
Apology for the Atheiſm and Profaneneſs of
the Age, but afford a pleaſant ſpectacle to all
evil men, to behold Divines coming upon
the Stage like Gladiators, and wounding and
murdering one anothers reputation. To
which add, that I verily hope the Lives, of
the <hi>generality</hi> at leaſt, of the Clergy of
<hi>England</hi> are ſo unblameable and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in themſelves, that they need not the ſoil
of other mens deformities to ſet them off or
recommend them. Yet I will ſay theſe two
two things further in the caſe.</p>
               <p>1. If a man be a male-content with the
Government, and forſaking the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
to private Aſſemblies, or if being a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man
and continuing in the Church, he
ſhall debauch his Office and undermine the
Church which he ſhould uphold; ſuch a
man may then debauch his Life too, and yet
have a very charitable conſtruction amongſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45558:36"/>
the generality of diſſenters. And on the
other ſide, if a man be of ſingular ſanctity
and the moſt holy converſation, but withal
zealous of the intereſt of the Church and
his own duty in it, this man ſhall have
worſe quarter and be more maligned by the
fiery Zealots of other parties, than one that
is both of a more looſe life and meaner
abilities. Whence it plainly appears, that
the bad lives of Clergy-men (if it were
true) is but a pretext, not the true cauſe of
quarrel with the Church.</p>
               <p>2. If impertinent and phantaſtical talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Religion be Religion, if endleſs ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity
and ſtraining at Gnats, if cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
and raſh judging our Betters and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
if melancholy ſighing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
be true Chriſtianity, if going from
Sermon to Sermon, without allowing our
ſelves time to mediate on what we hear,
or leiſure to inſtruct our Families; if
theſe, and ſuch as theſe, are the main
points of true Godlineſs, then I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
the Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
are not generally the moſt holy men, and
the Non-conformiſts are. But if a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſenſe of God, and Conſcience of keeping
all his expreſs Laws, if Juſtice, Mercy, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
Humility, Patience, Peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45558:36"/>
and Obedience to Governours, be the
principal ingredients of a good life; as
doubtleſs they are, if we take our meaſures
either from our Saviour, the Apoſtles or
Prophets: Then I do not deſpair but the
Church-men may be good Chriſtians, and
of far more holy lives than their accuſers,
notwithſtanding all the contempt caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. For upon this Iſſue I dare chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
Malice it ſelf to be able to faſten any
brand of bad life upon the generality or
body of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>I know this Age is not without ſome
of the brood of <hi>Cham,</hi> who will take the
impudence to uncover their Fathers naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and expoſe thoſe deformities, which
they ought, not only out of charity or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
but wiſdom alſo to conceal. And
it is not to be expected that ſuch a body of
men, made of the ſame fleſh and blood, and
ſolicited with the ſame temptations with other
men, ſhould be altogether without ſpot or
blemiſh: yet I do really believe, thoſe
are extream few of that number that juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſerve any ſcandalous character, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
very inconſiderable in reſpect of the
whole. And he that ſhall for the miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of a few, reflect diſhonour upon the
Clergy in general, ſhall do as unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45558:37"/>
as he that ſhall take a downright ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
man, and omitting his many and great
vertues and innumerable good actions, only
rake up and repreſent in an odious Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
all the follies of his youth and errors
of his life. By the which artifice, the beſt
man in the world, much more the beſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of men may be rendred odious enough.
It is well enough known, that the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt
body is not without ſome humours,
which if they were all drawn together, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſome one part or member, would make
an ill and dangerous ſpectacle: but whileſt
they lye diſperſed in the whole maſs of
blood, where there is a vaſt predominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the good, or elſe are lockt up in their
private cells, <hi>glandulae</hi> or other recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
till they ſhall be critically evacuated,
do in the mean time, little or nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
or deform ſuch a body. I need not
apply this to the caſe in hand. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
therefore; Were there but either ſo
much Charity and Humanity as ought to
be in Men and Chriſtians, or ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudicacy
as becomes wiſe and good
men, uſed in this matter; we ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of reproaching the failings or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
of a few, heartily thank God for
that remarkable Holineſs, Humility and
Charity that is yet alive and warm in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45558:37"/>
breaſts of ſo many of the Divines of this
Church in this cold and degenerate Age.
And for the reſt we ſhould think of that

                  <p>Of the more remote and leſs obſerved Cauſes

               </argument>
               <p>HItherto I have only noted and refuted
the Scandals and Contumelies caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Church, which how groundleſs and
unreaſonable ſoever they are, yet do not a
little miſchief when they are whiſpered in
corners, and inſinuated in Conventicles.</p>
               <p>I might have reckoned up ſome more of
the ſame nature, and as eaſily have diſproved
them; but they are either reducible to thoſe
we have touched, or will fall under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
in due time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:45558:38"/>
I now proceed from thoſe Imaginary, to
inquire into and conſider of the true and real
Cauſes of the preſent diſaffection to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Reformation, and they will be found
to be of ſeveral kinds; but I will not trouble
my ſelf curiouſly to diſtinguiſh them into
exact Claſſes, contenting my ſelf faithfully
to relate them, and repreſent their peculiar
malignant influences. And in this Chapter
I will bring into view theſe five following.</p>
               <p>1. It was the misfortune, and is the great
diſadvantage of this Church, that it was not
well confirmed and ſwadled in its Infancy.
It is the obſervation of wiſe men, that it
greatly contributes to the duration and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevity
of any Society, to have a good time
of Peace in its Minority, and not to have
been put upon difficulties and tryals till its
limbs and joints were ſetled and confirmed,
that is, till the people were competently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured
to the Laws, and the Conſtitutions by
time digeſted into Cuſtoms and made natural
to them. The State of <hi>Sparta</hi> remained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
without any conſiderable change in its
Conſtitution or Laws the longeſt of any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
we have read of: And <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the
Law-giver and Founder of that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
is thought to have taken an effectual
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45558:39"/>
courſe to make it ſo durable by this ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem.
When he had framed the body of
their Laws, he pretends occaſion of Travail
to conſult the Oracle at <hi>Delphos</hi> about their
affairs, but firſt takes an Oath of all the
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to preſerve the Laws in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inviolable till his return. Which having
done, he reſolvedly never returns to them
again. By this means whileſt the people
were by the Religion of their Oath and a
long expectation of his delayed return, for a
long time uſed to the Conſtitutions he had
eſtabliſhed, they grew ſo well practiſed in
them, that at laſt Cuſtom had habituated
and even naturalized them to them, that they
became unchangeable. Agreeable hereunto
is the obſervation of our own Lawyers, that
the Common Law, as they call it, is never
grievous to the people, and ſeldome repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whatever defects are in it, as Statute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Laws
frequently are; becauſe long Cuſtom
and Uſe hath fitted either that to the men
or the men to it, that all things run eaſily
and naturally that way. It is obſerved alſo
by Divines, That when God Almighty gave
a peculiar Body of Laws to the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
he took not only the opportunity of
their ſtraits and adverſities at their coming
out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that his Inſtitutions might
the more eaſily be received; but alſo kept
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45558:39"/>
them fourty years under the continual educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in and exerciſe of thoſe Laws, and that
in the Wilderneſs, where they were not
likely to take in any other impreſſions, nor
have other examples before their eyes to
tempt or corrupt them. And beſides all this,
in a wonderful providence he ſo ordered it,
that all thoſe men that came out of <hi>Aegypt</hi>
(except <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi>) and had obſerved
other Cuſtoms and Laws, and ſo might be
likely to give beginning to innovation, ſhould
all dye before they came into the Land of
<hi>Canaan.</hi> That by all theſe means, the Laws
he gave them might take the deeper root,
and ſo remain unalterable to all generations.</p>
               <p>I cannot chooſe but obſerve one thing
more to this purpoſe, That when our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Saviour had by himſelf and his Apoſtles
planted his Religion in the World, though
it was ſuch a Law as ſufficiently recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it ſelf to the minds of men by its own
goodneſs, eaſineſs and reaſonableneſs, and
therefore was likely to be an <hi>everlaſting
Religion</hi> (or Righteouſneſs) as the Prophet
<hi>Daniel</hi> calls it; yet for more ſecurity, it
pleaſed the Divine Providence to reſtrain the
rage of Pagans and Jews for a good while,
and to give the Chriſtians above ſixty years
of peace, before any conſiderable perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45558:40"/>
broke in upon them; that in that warm
Sun it might ſpread its roots, and get ſome
conſiderable ſtrength and footing in the
world.</p>
               <p>But it was the will of God, that the ſtrength
of this new-born Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould
be early tryed. And that it might give
proof of its divine extraction, it muſt, like
<hi>Hercules,</hi> conſlict with Serpents in its cradle,
and undergo a ſevere perſecution, the good
King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth dying immaturely,
and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſucceeding him in the
Throne.</p>
               <p>By which means it came to paſs, that as
this Infant-Reformation gave egregious proof
of its intrinſick truth and reaſonableneſs,
many fealing it with their blood; ſo it had
this diſadvantage (that we are all this while
repreſenting) namely, that by reaſon of this
perſecution a great number of the Miniſters
and other members of this Church, were
driven into other Countreys for refuge and
ſhelter from the ſtorm; and there, were (as
it's eaſie to imagine) tempted with novelty,
and diſtracted with variety of Rites and
Cuſtoms, before they were well inſtructed
in the reaſons, or habituated to the practice
of their own. And hereupon (as it is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45558:40"/>
obſerved of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Travailers) brought
home with them thoſe foreign faſhions, the
fond ſingularity of which is ſtill very taking
with too many to this day.</p>
               <p>I ſay, thus it came to paſs, that thoſe that
went out from us, returned not again to us
when they did return, in regard that before
they were well inured to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
they became inamoured of the Rites
of other Churches, not much conſidering
whether they were better, ſo long as they
were freſher and newer, nor minding that
there are oft-times reaſons that make one
Form neceſſary to be eſtabliſhed in one place
or people, and not in another, when other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it is poſſible they may be both indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in themſelves, but not equally fit to the
humour and cuſtome of the people, or conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Civil Conſtitutions; nor yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
that many things were taken up and
brought into uſe in other Churches not upon
choice but neceſſity, not becauſe they were
abſolutely better in themſelves, but the ſtate
of affairs ſo requiring. As for inſtance;
where the Reformation had not at firſt the
countenance of the Civil Government, there
the Reformers were conſtrained to enter into
particular confederations with one another;
from whence Presbyterian Government ſeems
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45558:41"/>
to have taken its riſe. I ſay, theſe Exiled
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants not entring into ſo deep
a ſearch into the ſpecial cauſes or occaſions
of thoſe different Rites and Forms they
found in the places whither they fled for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
as to diſcover whether they were ſtrictly
Religious or meerly Political: but obſerving
ſome pretexts of Scripture to be made for
them, and in proceſs of time, during their
abode in thoſe parts being uſed to them, and
by uſe confirmed in them; they at laſt, when
they might with ſafety return to <hi>England</hi>
again, came home laden with theſe Foreign
Commodities, and crying them up with a good
grace, found too many Chapmen for ſuch
Novelties. Thus as the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
even then when they had Bread from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Angels food, longed for the Onions and
Garlike of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> remembring how ſweet
thoſe were to them under their bitter bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and had upon all occaſions, and upon
every pet or diſguſt, a mind to return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
So theſe men retained as long as they
lived a lingring after thoſe entertainments
which they found then very pleaſant when
other was denyed them; and ſo much the
more, in that, as I ſaid before, they received
a tincture of theſe before they had well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
or ſufficiently underſtood the reaſons of
the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:45558:41"/>
And though theſe men are now dead, yet
the Childrens Teeth are ſtill ſet on edge with
the ſowre Grapes their Fathers have eaten.
For thoſe perſons being conſiderable for their
Zeal againſt Popery, and very much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to the eſteem of people at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
by the travail and hardſhip they had
underwent for the Proteſtant profeſſion, were
eaſily able with great advantage to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
their Sentiments and propagate their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
amongſt the Members of this Church.
Here therefore I think we may juſtly lay
the firſt Scene of the Diſtractions of this
Church.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Cauſe may be reckoned the bad
and incompetent proviſion for a Learned and
Able Miniſtry in the Corporations and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of great Pariſhes in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is eaſie to obſerve, that the multitudes
of Opinions that deform and trouble this
Church, are generally hatcht and nurſed up
in the Corporations, Market-Towns, and
other great places; whereas the leſſer Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Villages are for the moſt part quiet, and
peaceably comply with Eſtabliſh't Orders.
And if I ſhould ſay, that not only the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction
with the Rites and Government
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45558:42"/>
of the Church, but alſo the Convulſions and
Confuſions of State, took their Origin from
the bad humours of thoſe greater Societies
or Congregations of people, I ſuppoſe I
ſhould ſay no more than what the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of every conſiderative man will allow and
confirm.</p>
               <p>Now he that ſearching for a reaſon of this
difference ſhall impute it either to the Eaſe,
Fulneſs and Luxury of the former, whereby
they have leiſure and curioſity to excogitate
Novelties, and ſpirit and confidence to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and abett them, whileſt the latter tired
with hard labour, neither trouble themſelves
nor others, but apply themſelves to till the
ground, and earn their bread with the ſweat
of their brows: or to the multitude and great
concourſe of people in the former, amongſt
whom Notions are more eaſily ſtarted, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
protected, and parties ſooner formed for
the defence and diſſemination of them. He,
I ſay, that diſcourſes thus, gives a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for ſo much, but ſearches not far
enough to the bottom. For had there been
an able Learned Orthodox Clergy ſetled in
ſuch places, they by their wiſdome and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
would in a great meaſure have obvated
all beginnings of theſe diſorders; partly by
principling the minds of men with ſound
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45558:42"/>
Doctrine, partly convincing Gain-ſayers, and
eſpecially rendring the Government of the
Church lovely and venerable by their wiſe
deportment.</p>
               <p>In order therefore hereunto, there ought
to have been the moſt liberal Maintenance
and ingenuous Encouragement ſetled upon
ſuch important places. That where the
work was greateſt, and the importance moſt
conſiderable, the motives to undertake it
might be ſo too. To the intent that the
moſt able and judicious Clergy-men might
have been invited to, and ſetled upon thoſe
places that moſt needed them. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe
it is moſt viſible, that in thoſe places
where moſt Skill is to be exerciſed and moſt
Labour to be undertaken, there is little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
to encourage the Workman.</p>
               <p>In a little obſcure Pariſh or Country Village
often-times there is a well endowed Church,
but in theſe great ones, generally, where the
Flock is great, the Fleece is ſhorn to the
Shepherds hands, and ſo pittiful a pittance
left to the Curate or Miniſter, that he can
ſcarce afford himſelf Books to ſtudy, nor
perhaps Bread to eat, without too ſervile a
dependance upon the Benevolence of his
richer Neighbours; By which means either
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45558:43"/>
his Spirit is broken with Adverſity, or the
Dignity of his Office obſcured in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his condition, or his Influence and
Authority evacuated, having neither where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to live charitably nor hoſpitably; or
all theſe together: nay, it is well, if, to help
himſelf under theſe Preſſures, he is not
tempted to a ſordid Connivance at, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with all thoſe Follies and Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
he ſhould correct and remedy. And ſo
like <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſell his Birthright (the Dignity of
the Prieſthood) for a meſs of Pottage.</p>
               <p>Now how this comes to paſs, that the
greateſt Cures have generally the leaſt Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
is eaſily found; for it is well enough
known that in thoſe Times when the Popes
had a Paramount Power in <hi>England,</hi> a great
part of the Tythes and Revenues of Churches
were by their extravagant Authority raviſht
from them, and applyed to the Abbies and
Monaſteries, and this like an Oſtraciſme fell
commonly upon the greateſt Pariſhes, as
having the beſt Revenues (and conſequently
the more deſirable Booty to thoſe hungry
Caterpillers) and ſo the Iſſue was, that the
richeſt Churches were made the pooreſt, in
many ſuch places little more than the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites
and <hi>Eaſter-Offerings</hi> being left to
thoſe that ſhall diſcharge the Cure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:45558:43"/>
And then though afterwards theſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
Societies were diſſolved, yet the
Tythes being not thought fit to be reſtored
to their reſpective Churches, the conſequence
is, that thoſe places which ought for the
good both of Church and State to be well
provided for, are too often ſupplyed by the
moſt inconſiderable Clergy-men, or thoſe
men made ſo by the places they ſupply. My
meaning is, that by reaſon of the incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Legal Maintenance provided for ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
the people have it in their power
either to corrupt an eaſie and neceſſitous
man, or to ſtarve out a worthy and inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
one; and ſo whatever the humour of
the place ſhall be, it is uncontroulable and
incurable.</p>
               <p>To remedy theſe inconveniencies, it hath of
late pleaſed His Majeſty and the Parliament,
to make ſome proviſion ſo far as concerns the
City of <hi>London,</hi> and it is hoped the ſame
wiſdom will in time take like care of other
great places in the ſame condition; for till
ſome ſuch courſe be taken, it will be in vain
to expect that the Church of <hi>England</hi> or the
beſt Laws of Religion that can be deviſed,
ſhould either obtain juſt Veneration or due
Effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:45558:44"/>
3. I account the late Wars another Cauſe
of the bad eſtate of the Church and Religion
amongſt us. Which may perhaps ſeem the
more ſtrange, ſince when men put their Lives
moſt in danger, one would think they ſhould
then take the moſt care to put their Souls out
of danger. Beſides it hath been the wiſdom of
moſt Nations to deſire the countenance and
incouragement of Religion in all their Martial
undertakings. The <hi>Romans</hi> made great ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of enterprizing any thing of that nature,
till either their Prieſts (from inſpection of
the Sacrifice) or ſome other of their Pagan
Oracles had given them the ſignal. And the
<hi>Turkiſh Mufti</hi> or High-Prieſt muſt give the
<hi>Prime Viſier</hi> his bleſſing before he enters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the buſineſs. Whether it be that men
indeed believe God Almighty to be the <hi>Lord
of Hoſts,</hi> and to give Victory to thoſe that
ſtand beſt approved with him; or whether it
be only that they apprehend that the opinion
of being under Gods favour, gives reputation
to their Arms, inſpires their men with valour
and reſolution, and diſheartens their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
or upon whatſoever conſideration: it
is certain the matter of Fact is true, and
that Religion is of great efficacy in Warlike
exploits.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:45558:44"/>
It may, I ſay, therefore ſeem the more
ſtrange, that War ſhould be injurious to that
which it ſeeks to for countenance and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.
But moſt ſtrange of all, that Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
abroad ſhould make men quarrel with
their Friends at home; that Iron and Steel,
Wounds and Blows ſhould make men tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcienced;
that thoſe who can find in their
hearts to ſhed the blood of Men, of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and of their Brethren without remorſe,
ſhould be ſo queaſie ſtomached as to ſcruple
every punctilio and nicety in Eccleſiaſtick
matters. And yet he that narrowly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the riſe and progreſs of our Diſorders,
will find that the diſtractions of the Church
have kept pace with thoſe of the State; and
as before the War our Religious diſputes
and diſſentions were but few to what they
came to afterwards, ſo by every War, they
have ſenſibly increaſed and grown upon us.
For the proof of which I will deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to look no further back than to either
of the Wars between this <hi>Kingdom</hi> and the
<hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Low Countreys;</hi> and if he do
not obſerve the contempt of Religion to be
greater, and the ſtate of the <hi>Church</hi> worſe at
the end of each of them than at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
I will confeſs my ſelf too ſervere an
Interpreter of the effects of War. How
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45558:45"/>
War ſhould ſo much debauch the Spirit of
a Nation is not my buſineſs to inquire; yet
theſe four things following ſeem to give ſome
light into it.</p>
               <p>1. There are certain Doctrines and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
found to be very uſeful in War, and to
animate men in Encounters, that are utterly
contrary both to Truth and Peace. Such
as that of the Fatal Neceſſity of all things;
which in the natural conſequence of it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
of all Virtue. Yet however, the
<hi>Turks</hi> find it of great conſequence in their
Wars, and it ſerve to animate their <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi>
to run deſperately upon the very
mouths of Canons. And this ſame perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or one very like it, was highly cryed
up and found ſerviceable to all bad purpoſes
of our late Civil Wars.</p>
               <p>2. Thoſe that have occaſion to uſe mens
Courage, are forced to be content to wink at
their Debaucheries, for fear they ſhould emaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
the ſpirits of thoſe they imploy, and
turn the edge of their mettle. So Drunkenneſs,
Whoring, Swearing and Blaſphemy ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
paſs under a very eaſie Cenſure amongſt
Souldiers. Men whoſe hearts are eagerly
ſet upon a War are apt to permit thoſe
whoſe hearts and hands they uſe in it, to be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45558:45"/>
afraid of nothing, that ſo they may be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of the Enemy. And when the War is
over, theſe Extravagancies are not laid down
with their Arms: For when Lewdneſs hath
gotten a habit, and mens Foreheads are brazen
in their wickedneſs, they will not receive a
check from diſarmed Religion; but rather
harden themſelves againſt it, and account
that their Enemy which they are ſure will
not give countenance to the Vices they are
now ſetled in. In ſhort; War lets looſe the
Reins and incourages men to ſin; And when
the War is over, theſe men are turned over
to the Church for cure of their Souls, as
to the Hoſpital for their bodily wounds. But
no man will wonder if theſe men have no
great kindneſs to the Church, which forbids
them the liberty and pleaſure the Camp al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them; eſpecially if it alſo preſcribe
them a ſevere courſe, and make their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
ſmart for the ſins they have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practiſed with pleaſure, and have yet a
mind to.</p>
               <p>3. War hath its peculiar Laws different
vaſtly from thoſe of the Church and of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well ordered Common-wealth too. The
hazards and neceſſities of War make many
things lawful there, that are otherwiſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable;
as to make no difference betwixt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45558:46"/>
things Sacred and Prophane, to pull down
Churches, and do other ſuch horrid things as
nothing but War can palliate. And from
hence it is too ordinary for men to be led
on by Cuſtome, ſo as in time they forget
the Differences of things altogether; and the
Church and the Stable, the Prieſt and the
Peaſant are all one to them.</p>
               <p>4. The meer diſuſe of Religion and its
Offices antiquates the obligations of it with
many. When men have long heard the noiſe
of Drums and Trumpets, they are deaf to the
ſtill voice of the Goſpel; and after long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with Iron and Steel, the Weapons
of the Spiritual Warfare are of no force with
them. Then, inſtead of Prayers men learn to
curſe and ſwear, and by diſuſe of Religion
grow to forget it and ſlight it; and from
not going to Church for a time (upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity)
grow to plead a priviledge not to
come at it at all.</p>
               <p>Since then the Sword doth ſo much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to the Gown, and the Camp to the
Church, it is no wonder when we have been
ſo often ingaged of late in the one, that the
other hath been and is in no better condition.</p>
               <p>4. I would in the next place, might I do it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45558:46"/>
without offence, take the boldneſs to ſay, that
the vaſt increaſe of Trade doth uſually reflect
ſome inconvenience upon Eccleſiaſtical affairs.
I mean no hurt either to any mens Perſons or
Intereſt, I envy no mens Proſperity and
Wealth; It is far from my thoughts to wiſh
the Tide of Trade dammed up: for I confeſs
it is hugely advantageous to the publick, as
well as to private perſons in many reſpects.
It much raiſes the parts and ſharpens the wits
of a Nation by foreign converſation, to
which ſome apply that paſſage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 12. 4. <hi>Many ſhall paſs
to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It opens a paſſage to the diſcovery of
other Countreys, and of the works of God
and Man, of Nature and of Art.</p>
               <p>It is the great Incentive and the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of humane Society; it makes all
Mankind of one body, and by mutual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to ſerve the occaſions, ſupply the
needs, and miniſter to the delight and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
one of another.</p>
               <p>It inlarges the Minds of men as well as
their Fortunes; inſomuch that any Nation
is unpolite, unbred, and half barbarous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:45558:47"/>
It inures men to hardſhip and danger, and
inſtructs them in ſubtilty and all the Arts of
living, and ſelf-ſecurity.</p>
               <p>It adds much to the beauty, power and
ſtrength of a Nation, and to the riches and
revenue of the Prince.</p>
               <p>Yet all this notwithſtanding, I muſt crave
leave to ſay, that the Inlargement of Trade
hath uſually been attended with as much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Conſcience, and the heat of that
with as much coldneſs and indifferency in
Religion. It is commonly obſerved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
great diverſity of Opinions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
to abate of mens Zeal for, and
Reverence of, an Uniformity in what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
eſtabliſht. For men by converſing much
abroad or with Strangers, get a tincture of
the Humours and Perſwaſions, of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
and Sentiments of thoſe Perſons with
whom, and Places where, they have to do.
And this is moſt remarkably true of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi>
whoſe temper is not ſo ſtubborn and
inflexible as that of ſome other People, nor
ſo faſtuoſe and contemptuous of other mens
Opinions and Practices. Their good nature
prompts to look and think favourably upon
ſuch things as they ſee in requeſt with others;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45558:47"/>
and from hence they proceed to admiration,
and at laſt to affect the novelty; and then
they bring over with them and ſet to ſale at
home many a new fangle amongſt other ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
commodities.</p>
               <p>The wiſe Law-giver of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>
of whom I have had heretofore occaſion to
ſpeak, in contemplation of this danger, and
that the Laws and Government might not be
diſturbed with Novelty, abſolutely forbad
Trade or Traffick, and ſo much as travailing
into other Countreys, leſt the Citizens ſhould
barter away their own Laws and Cuſtoms
for thoſe of other Cities. But thanks be to
God, there is no neceſſity of having recourſe
to ſuch a violent Remedy; the Laws of our
Religion do both admit of, and direct and
govern Commerce, and the reaſonableneſs
of our Chriſtian Religion in general, and of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reformation in particular is
ſuch, as that it may be well hoped they may
rather gain than loſe Proſelytes by being
confronted with any other Inſtitutions, and
allure conſiderate men to the embracing of
them, whileſt ſome lighter and incogitant
perſons may be betrayed by their Curioſity.
All the Uſe therefore that I make of this
Obſervation concerning Trade is, That ſince
there is ſome danger to Religion thereby, all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45558:48"/>
thoſe that do not make a God of the World,
and take Gain for Godlineſs, will think theſe
three things following to be reaſonable.</p>
               <p>1. That ſince it is plain, the ſame Means
will not preſerve Uniformity in Religion, nor
conſerve the Reverence and Happineſs of
the Church in a Nation vaſtly addicted to
Foreign Commerce, as would do where the
more ſimple way of Agriculture was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to (as it was amongſt the <hi>Spartans</hi> and
this Nation formerly) that therefore there
may be ſuch Laws provided, and ſuch care
taken as that the one be not diſcouraged, nor
the other corrupted.</p>
               <p>2. That every man will not only take care
to inform himſelf in the grounds of his own
Profeſſion of Religion, but alſo have ſo much
Charity towards the Governours of his own
Countrey and this Church, as to think them
both as wiſe and as honeſt as in other places;
that by both theſe his Reaſon may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
and his Affections ſomewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
againſt every aſſault of Novelty from
other mens Opinions or Practices.</p>
               <p>3. That at leaſt we will not think it juſt
to impute all the Diſtractions of mens Minds
and Quarrels againſt the Church to the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45558:48"/>
of its Conſtitution, ſince this point of
Trade hath ſuch influence as we ſee both in
the Nature of the thing and in the viſible Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it.</p>
               <p>5. It muſt not be omitted that both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
and Atheiſt, though upon ſeveral grounds,
combine their Malice againſt this Church,
and uſe all their ſeveral Intereſts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to render it as contemptible as
they can.</p>

               <p>We know they remember the ſlur we gave
then in our Reformation; they are well
aware that the decent Order, the Dignity
and antient Gravity of this Church, reproves
and ſhames the Pageantry of theirs. They
forget not how often the eminent Abilities of
our Church-men have baffled theirs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are to be reckoned upon as immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Enemies. They know, nothing ſtands ſo
much in the way of their Deſigns as the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> This hath the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Laws, the ſupport of Reaſon,
the favour of Antiquity, the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45558:49"/>
of Decency. They therefore can eaſily
frame themſelves to a complaiſance towards
all other Sects, becauſe they deſpiſe them;
but here <hi>oderunt dum metuunt:</hi> their fears
and danger by this, provoke their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
inflame their anger, and ſuffer them
not ſo much as to diſſemble their ſpite
againſt it. It is well enough known, how
under the diſguiſe of Quakers and other
names, they have undermined its reputation
and given it what diſturbance they can
how by their Inſinuations into ſome looſe o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
weaker perſons they ſeek to weaken is
powers and draw off her numbers; how
they have furniſhed others with Arguments
to impugn it, and ſubaided all unquiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
againſt her. They that ſcruple nothing
themſelves, nor will ſuffer any to ſcruple any
thing in their own Communion, can teach
people to be very nice and ſqueamiſh in the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> They that are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a blind Obedience at home, preach
up tenderneſs of Conſcience abroad; and
when an Implicite Faith will do well enough
in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy, &amp;c.</hi> yet in <hi>England</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
muſt content men but Infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
and that in the moſt circumſtantial
and inconſiderable matters.</p>
               <p>Then for the Atheiſts; They conſcious
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45558:49"/>
of the odiouſneſs of their pretences (though
of late arrived at greater impudence than
formerly) think it not ſafe to laugh at all
Religions at once, though they equally abhor
all. Therefore leſt they ſhould ingage too
many enemies at once, they deal by Retail,
and expoſe to ſcorn the ſeveral Parties of
Chriſtians one after another. But to be
ſure, the better any Perſwaſion is, the more
induſtriouſly they ſet themſelves to depreſs
it; as knowing well, if they can bring that into
Contempt, they may be ſecure of the other,
which muſt one time or other fall of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by reaſon of the unſoundneſs of their
Foundations. Beſides it ſeems ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them to ſet their wit againſt a Fanatick,
they muſt have higher game, and their
Jeſts go off more piquantly when they grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the popular envy, by being level'd againſt
that which hath a great ſtock of Reputation,
and the countenance of publick Laws.</p>
               <p>Theſe blind Beetles that roſe out of filth
and excrement, and now buz about the
world, hope, not only to cover their ſhame,
but to increaſe their Party daily by the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Chriſtians; and therefore labour to
inflame the Cauſes, to provoke mens Paſſions
and exaſperate their minds one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45558:50"/>
They ſcurilouſly traduce all that is
ſerious, and ſtudy Religion only to find out
flaws in it. And what they cannot do by
manly Diſcourſe, they endeavour by Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry.
In ſhort; It is their manner to dreſs
the beſt Religion in the world in a phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
and ridiculous habit, that Boyes may
laugh at it, and weak people brought out of
conceit with it, and their Worſhips made
merry with the Comedy.</p>
               <p>Now ſince the Church of <hi>England</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
with all theſe Enemies and under the
aforeſaid Diſadvantages, it is no wonder if
the felicity and ſucceſs of it be not a little
diſturbed. It was noted amongſt the
Felicities of old <hi>Rome,</hi> as that which gave it
the opportunity of growing up to ſo vaſt
a Greatneſs, That till it had by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
ſubdued all its Neighbours, and was
now match for all the World, it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
but one Enemy at once to encounter.
Whileſt this Church in its firſt times had
only thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiict
with, it eaſily triumphed over them
and maintained its Peace and Dignity at
home: but that now under the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
I have repreſented in the five fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Particulars it bears up ſo well as it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45558:50"/>
doth, is an illuſtrions argument of its
Strength and Soundneſs of Conſtitution;
and they are very ſevere and uncharitable
perſons that reckon its Enemies and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
in the number of its Vices or
Faults.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the more immediate Cauſes of the Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Church of England; ſuch as,
1. Raſhneſs of popular Judgement. 2. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm.
3. Prejudice. 4. Want of true
Chriſtian Zeal, in the generality of its
Members.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>COming now in this Chapter to enquire
into the immediate Cauſes of the Evils
we groan under, I do not ſee how it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to be avoided, but that in touching this
ſore I muſt make ſome body or other ſmart.
And therefore I beſpeak ſo much candour of
the Reader that he will believe it is not any
delight I take to rake in the wounds of my
Brethren and fellow-Chriſtians; but that it
is meer compaſſion to the Souls of men, and
good will to the publick Peace, and nothing
elſe, that prompts me to this undertaking.
For had any other ends ſwayed with me, I
could better have purſued them in ſilence and
privacy, or at leaſt in the choice of ſome
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45558:51"/>
other ſubject than this which is ſo tender and
tickliſh. But conſcious of my own ſincerity
in the undertaking, and in confidence of a
benign interpretation, I proceed.</p>
               <p>1. And Firſt, I perſwade my ſelf that it
will be manifeſt to any conſiderative and
impartial perſon, that a great part of the
averſation to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ariſes
from that which is the conſtant and known
Adverſary of every thing that is generous
and excellent, namely popular Raſhneſs and
Injudiciouſneſs.</p>
               <p>When weak perſons judge of the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
and Counſels of wiſer men, and
thoſe that pierce no further than the meer
ſurface of things, paſs a Verdict upon thoſe
whoſe Reaſons are profound and deep; there
can be no good Iſſue expected. It is certain
there are many men of honeſt Hearts, who
yet have <hi>not ſenſes exerciſed</hi> (as the phraſe of
the Apoſtle is) whoſe Intellectuals are either
clouded by an unhappy Conſtitution of Body,
or were never well opened and enlarged by
Education and Study. Thoſe generally not
being ſenſible of their own infirmity, nor
knowing how little that which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
is, compared with what they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of, are ready to think there is no larger
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45558:52"/>
Sphere of Knowledge than that which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
move in; and by reaſon that they do
<hi>ad pauca reſpicere, facilè pronunciant,</hi> not
foreſeeing the difficulties, eaſily come to a
concluſion, and cenſure all that complyes not
with their own meaſures.</p>
               <p>It's eaſie to obſerve men hugging their
own Phancies, and entertaining with ſcorn and
contempt things above their capacity, or out
of the rode of their meditations. I by no
means commend the zeal of that Biſhop,
<hi>Virgilius</hi> by name, who became a Martyr
for the opinion that there were <hi>Antipodes,</hi>
though it was demonſtrably true, and the
contrary impoſſible. But I obſerve thence,
how ſevere and raſh a bolt folly will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.
And I little doubt, but that if a
man ſhould aſſert the mobility of the Earth,
or ſome other ſuch opinion (which yet the
generality of the Learned are agreed in,)
and do it with the like conſtancy that <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius</hi>
did, (if he had the people for his
Judges) he would be in danger of the ſame
Fate.</p>
               <p>But to come nearer my purpoſe; It is an
Obſervation, not more antient than true,
That the ſame thing ſeldome pleaſes the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and the few; Wiſe men generally take
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45558:52"/>
middle Counſels, as finding by Experience,
not only Peace but Truth for the moſt part to
be there placed. The Vulgar contrariwiſe
are altogether for Extreams, and when one
Extream diſguſts them, run violently to the
other without ſtop or ſtay. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
ſaid the Hiſtorian, The
middle opinion is condemned by both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams,
and thoſe that ſtand by it, (like thoſe
that go about to part a fray) receive blows
from both ſides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> the glory of his Time and
Countrey, for the ſagacity of his wit and
ſimplicity of his temper, becauſe he came not
up to the height of either of the then contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parties (though he was admired by the
Wiſer) was mortally hated, reproached and
perſecuted by the Vulgar of both Parties.</p>
               <p>It is not much to the honour of Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi>
that he is ſaid to have written to <hi>Bucer</hi>
who was employed in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That he ſhould take care to avoid <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate</hi>
Counſels in Religion. In which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he complyed but too much with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
of the Vulgar, eſpecially of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
at leaſt if the obſervation of a witty
Writer of the laſt Age be well taken. But
perhaps it is not the Levity, but the Spirit
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45558:53"/>
and Vigor and natural Courage of the people,
that middle Counſels are not acceptable to
them: but however, it is eaſie to remember, that
when in the late Times ſome diſguſts were
taken at the publick management of Affairs,
no Propoſition or Expedient would at one the
fault, or propitiate the people, but the utter
Subverſion of the Government. When Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
diſpleaſes, we think our ſelves never ſafe
till we are run as far the other way; and
again when thoſe that have been at the
higheſt pitch of Fanaticiſm, ſuſpect their
ſtanding, and have a new qualm come over
them, there is then no remedy, no ſafety, no
Ark but the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Church of <hi>England</hi> cutting by
a thred (as it were) between both theſe
Extreams, eſcapes not a ſevere Cenſure on
either hand. Thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
cannot but confeſs, that all is good in our
Liturgy, only they ſay it is defective in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things that they have a great value for;
Proteſtants on the other ſide generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the main to be good, but ſome
things they account redundancies, which they
would have taken away: And ſo between
them both they give a glorious Teſtimony to
this Church as guilty of the Faults of neither
Extream, whileſt yet ſhe is accuſed of both.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:45558:53"/>
But that which I chiefly intend is this;
That a great part of men have not their
Minds elevated above the Horizon of their
Bodies, nor take an eſtimate of any thing,
but by its impreſſion upon their Senſes.
From whence it muſt needs follow, that
whatever moſt powerfully ſtrikes them, muſt
alſo be moſt admired by ſuch perſons, and
nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>Now the Liturgy of our Church being
compoſed plainly, gravely and modeſtly, no
turgid or ſwelling expreſſions, no novelty of
phraſe or method, no luxuriancy of wit or
phancy, ſeems therefore dull and flat to ſuch
mens apprehenſions. And on the other ſide,
ſuch Prayers as are occaſionally conceived
and uttered by men of hot tempers (like
themſelves) with a torrent of words, and
in a melting tone, ſtrike them with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and almoſt tranſport them. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that they are ready to conclude (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more ado) the former to be a cold for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Service, but theſe latter to be the very
Dictates and Impulſes, the Breathings of the
Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>And ſo for Preaching; Thoſe Divines
that deliver themſelves gravely and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45558:54"/>
that take care to <hi>ſpeak the words of
truth and ſoberneſs,</hi> that endeavour calmly
and modeſtly to inlighten the minds of their
Hearers, ſeem to ſuch people heavy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying.
But if there be a ſort of heady
and incogitant Preachers, that have more
heat than light, that thunder in mens ears
with a ſtentorian noiſe, and make uſe of
ſuch dreadful expreſſions as raiſe the humours
and paſſions of the body, or ſuch ſoft ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes
as demulce and mitigate them, or ſuch
myſtical repreſentations as tranſport their
imaginations and confound them; thoſe ſeem
mighty-powerful-ſoul-ſaving-Preachers. Who
ſees not that this muſt needs be a mighty
diſadvantage to the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
When Devotions ſhall be eſteemed by their
noiſe and not by their weight, and Sermons
tryed not by their light but heat?</p>
               <p>But if to all this, Truth and Falſhood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
and that in the moſt ſublime points, and,
which is more, Expediency it ſelf muſt be
decided at Vulgar Tribunals, ſo that there
ſhall not be that Doctrine ſo profound or
nice, which every man will not take upon
him to determine, nor that Reaſon ſo ſubtle,
which the craſſeſt minds ſhall not pretend to
underſtand, nor that Rule or Art of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which ſhall not fall under vulgar
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45558:54"/>
cognizance; if every mans Mind become the
Standard and Touchſtone of every Truth: it
is impoſſible (upon the ſuppoſitions before
laid) but there muſt be diſſentions, diſputes
and diſtractions in ſuch a Church, and yet
neither the Doctrine, Diſcipline, Liturgy,
nor Miniſters thereof be to blame. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the Reformers of ſuch a Society be no
wiſer than the Vulgar, and the Clergy and
Governours and all Learned men have the
ſame ſentiments with the people; unleſs, I
ſay, all could be alike wiſe or alike weak,
(where all will be alike Judges) it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe therefore of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
have a cure for this; They appropriate all
Judgement to the Clergy, and deal with the
reſt of Mankind as Sots and Ideots, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
them to read the Scriptures in the
Vulgar Tongue, leſt they ſhould grow too
wiſe to be governed; nay, they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them to be maſters of common ſenſe,
but requre them to believe the moſt contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
Propoſitions, and make that an Article
of Faith which a man may confute by his
Fingers ends. This is an admirable way to
wean them from their own Underſtanding,
to unlearn them Diſputes, and to exerciſe
them to believe in and obey their Rulers.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45558:55"/>
This way makes the people Sheep indeed, but
ſilly ones God-wot.</p>
               <p>But the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath no ſuch
Antidote of Diſputes and Diviſions as this is.
She makes not her ſelf the Miſtris of mens
Faith, nor impoſes upon their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
She teacheth that our Saviour hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
the Mind of God touching the points
of neceſſary Belief or eſſential to Salvation
fully, and plainly to the capacity of every
conſidering man that will uſe the means; and
in other leſſer matters debatable amongſt
Chriſtians, ſhe allows a judgement of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
Only ſince the Peace of the Church
often depends upon ſuch points as Salvation
doth not, and ſince in many of thoſe, every
man is not a competent Judge, but muſt
either be in danger of being deceived himſelf
and of troubling others, or of neceſſity muſt
truſt ſome body elſe wiſer than himſelf:
She recommends in ſuch a caſe as the ſafer
way for ſuch private perſons to comply with
publick Determinations, and in ſo adviſing,
ſhe jointly conſults the Peace of the Church
and the quiet of mens Conſciences. So all
that ſhe challenges is a Reverence, not a
blind Obedience. And if after all this, ſome
people will be fooliſh, and proud, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,
ſhe hath no further Remedy, than
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45558:55"/>
to declare them guilty of Sin and Contumacy,
and that not ſufficing, to caſt them out of
her Communion. But when all this is done,
men may be peeviſh and wilful, and render
the State of that Church unhappy, whoſe
Conſtitution is neither guilty of Tyranny nor
Remiſneſs.</p>
               <p>Now if it ſhall be objected to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
That this cauſe from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Folly and Injudiciouſneſs of men
is too general, and will equally extend to all
other Reformed Churches as well as our own,
and eſpecially that this might have brought
forth all the Evil we complain of, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to it, in the former Age as well as
now, for as much as the generality of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were not much wiſer then, than now.
To this I anſwer in two points.</p>
               <p>1. If other Reformed Churches have not
found the effects of Ignorance and Arrogance
joyned together as well as we (which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they have done more or leſs) it is not to
be aſcribed to the happineſs of their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
but to the unhappineſs of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Circumſtances. Their Poverty, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
Perſecution, or being ſurrounded
with common Enemies, hath probably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon them to lay aſide or ſmother their
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45558:56"/>
private Opinions, and to check their animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,
more than our Gratitude to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
for our Eaſe and Peace and Plenty and
Liberty hath done, upon us. Who knoweth
not that the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> firſt needed
the ſevere check of an Apoſtle for their
wantonneſs and diviſions, that <hi>one was of</hi>
Paul, <hi>another of</hi> Apollos, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And who can
give a more probable account of this their
Luxuriancy, than from the riches, eaſe, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and liberty of that City? Or who hath
not obſerved, that whileſt the Primitive
Chriſtians were in Adverſity ſurrounded with
Enemies and under Pagan perſecuting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
ſo long they had one heart and
mind, they ſubmitted their private phancies
and peculiar ſentiments to publick ſafety;
but the ſame conſtituted Churches quickly
broke out into Quarrels and Factions, as ſoon
as a warm Sun of Proſperity ſhone upon
them? We have reaſon accordingly not to
charge our unhappineſs upon our Religion,
nor our troubles upon our Proſperity, but to
lay them at the right door, of our Folly
and Weakneſs.</p>
               <p>2. That theſe Evils broke not out in our
Church ſooner, ſince the Seeds of them were
ſown long ago, is due to the joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
that men generally took at their firſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45558:56"/>
emerging out of the darkneſs and ſuperſtitions
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by the Reformation,
which was proportionable to the deliverance;
and ſo great, that for a time it ſuffered them
not to be very ſolicitous about little diſputes
or ſcrupuloſities. Like the people of <hi>Greece</hi>
when the <hi>Romans</hi> at the <hi>Iſthmian</hi> Games by
a publick Herald pronounced them and their
Countrey free, they forgat the contentions
they came together about, and uſed to be
infinitely taken with. But when the novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this great Bleſſing was over, Proteſtants
forgat the great and intolerable burdens they
had eſcaped, and then began ſcrupulouſly to
weigh every petty inconvenience; and (by
the goodneſs of God) not having a publick
Enemy to unite them, quarrel amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
This therefore may be admitted as
one cauſe of our unhappineſs.</p>
               <p>2. That which I would aſſign as a ſecond
cauſe, I know not well what name to give
to it: But for want of a better expreſſion, I
will adventure to ſay, That a great part of
this Nation having been leavened with
<hi>Jewiſh Superſtition</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh Traditions,</hi>
hath thereby been indiſpoſed to an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
reception of, and perſeverance in
the Reformation of Religion held forth
by this Church. How this ſowre leaven
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45558:57"/>
ſhould get in amongſt us is not very eaſie to
determine: Some Stories would incline a
man to think that it had been in the veins of
this Countrey, ever ſince it firſt received
the Chriſtian Faith; for the greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk found here, was to
bring the Inhabitants from the obſervation of
<hi>Eaſter,</hi> and ſome other Rites according to the
manner of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches,
to that of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Weſtern;</hi> and the
doing it (as the Story tells us) coſt the lives
of twelve hundred Monks, who it ſeems ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly
oppoſed his Innovation. Which (by
the way) is a good argument that this
Church owes not its firſt Chriſtianity to
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or this Monaſtick Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
as they would perſwade us; ſince it is
plain by this paſſage, that he made our
Anceſtors only <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> but found them
Chriſtians before, and perhaps of a better
and more generous race of Religion than that
he ingraffed upon the old ſtock. But I will
make no uſe of this; for perhaps we may
find the riſe of this <hi>Judaiſm</hi> nearer hand, if we
obſerve that the great Patriarchs of the
Non-conformity, ſuch as <hi>Cartwright, Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,
H. Broughton</hi> and others, were great
Students of the <hi>Rabbinical Writings,</hi> and the
main of their Learning lay that way; and as
by this ſort of Study (which was rare in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45558:57"/>
thoſe dayes,) they got the reputation of
great <hi>Rabbies,</hi> ſo perhaps they might not
only by this means be bewitched with the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> fancies themſelves, but propagate
their unhappy Sentiments through their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
to this generation.</p>
               <p>But howſoever it came to paſs, the matter
of Fact will appear undeniably true, That a
vein of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> runs through the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the diſſenters from the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
Of which I will give ſome Inſtances.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>firſt</hi> ſhall be their grand <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
That nothing is lawful in the ſervice
of God, but what is expreſly preſcribed in
Scripture.</hi> This is the Characteriſtical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of that Party, and in confidence of
the truth of which, they cry out of us for
uncommanded Rites, and humane Inventions
and little leſs than Idolatry. Now whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
well conſiders this Tenet, will find it
ſo irrational in it ſelf, ſo ſervile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
of all Chriſtian Liberty, and making
ſo ill reflections upon the Goodneſs of God,
(as I ſhall have occaſion to ſhew hereafter)
that it is not to be imagined how it ſhould
enter into the minds of men, much leſs find
ſuch entertainment and ſo zealous patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
amongſt ſo many honeſt and devout
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45558:58"/>
men, were it not, that they ſtudied the
Old Teſtament better than the New, and
graffed their Chriſtianity upon the ſtock of
<hi>Judaiſm.</hi> And the caſe muſt be after this
manner. They conſidering and obſerving
how punctually God preſcribed ſome very
little matters touching the Temple and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Worſhip of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Law of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> carry this notion along with them to
the New Teſtament, and thence infer, That
Chriſt Jeſus muſt needs have alſo as punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
determined all the Rituals of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Worſhip: Otherwiſe he <hi>is not faithful
in his houſe as</hi> Moſes <hi>was in his,</hi> (for that
Scripture is brought to prove it). That all
abſolutely Neceſſaries are ſo determined by
our Saviour we readily grant them, and that
all thoſe Rites that are preſcribed by him
are neceſſary to be obſerved, we will yield
them; but that nothing is lawful but what
is to be found ſo preſcribed, we utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and they will never be able to prove.
Nor indeed would they ever have been led
by any principle of reaſon to think of or
expect ſuch a thing, had it not been by the
aforeſaid prejudice. But having gotten that
notion into their heads, they will fancy the
New Teſtament to comply with it, or writhe
it to their ſenſe, though with never ſo much
violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:45558:58"/>
Of affinity with the former is another
Notion of theirs, <hi>That all Princes and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers
are bound to conform the Municipal
Laws of their ſeveral Dominions to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of</hi> Moſes; and where this is not
done, <hi>ſc.</hi> where Princes make other Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Caſes, or appoint other Puniſhments
than that Law allows, they are in danger
to have their Conſtitutions declared null,
and themſelves irreligious.</p>
               <p>This is a miſtake as wide as the former,
highly injurious to Soveraign Princes and
dangerous to Kingdoms and States, in a great
meaſure diſannulling the publick Laws, and
ſtripping the Governours of all proper Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative
power.</p>
               <p>But that which I conſider now in this
miſtake, is not the conſequence and Effects,
but the riſe and Cauſes of it, which ſeems
to be no other than the fondneſs the <hi>Jews</hi>
had to their Laws, and which they expreſs
in their Writings, as if thoſe Laws God gave
them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> were not only beſt for them,
but beſt in themſelves alſo. The foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of which Error is both detected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
by this conſideration, That God was
not only the God, but the temporal Prince of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45558:59"/>
the <hi>Jews</hi> in a peculiar manner, ſo as he is
not of any other people in the world; he
calls himſelf their King, appoints his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
and Vicegerents, divides his Subjects
their Inheritance, gives them Laws, takes
up a Reſidence amongſt them, appoints their
way of Addreſs to him for Judgement and
reſolution of weighty and extraordinary
Caſes, and reſerves many Caſes to himſelf,
and ſometimes inflicts Puniſhments by his
own hand. Any man that conſiders theſe
things well, will never go about to make
thoſe Laws oblige other Nations, or require
neceſſarily all Princes to conform their Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to that of <hi>Judaea,</hi> till he can perſwade
himſelf that every Nation hath the peculiar
Priviledge of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and its Government
to be a Theocracy.</p>
               <p>A <hi>third</hi> Inſtance ſhall be their notion of
<hi>Excommunication,</hi> which they hold <hi>muſt be
denounced by a Synod or Presbytery, and the
Prince as well as the people muſt be ſubject
to the ſentence.</hi> And this againſt all Rules of
Government, the Prerogatives of Princes and
the Peace of Kingdoms. But becauſe it was
thus amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> or at leaſt ſome of the
Writers of that Nation ſay ſo, (whether
true or falſe is not well conſidered) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this is the only Goſpel way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:45558:59"/>
I muſt by no means omit their Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> which muſt be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>Sabbath</hi> too, though ſuch name is no
where given it either in the New Teſtament
or in any antient Writer that I know of;
but contrariwiſe alwayes oppoſed to it. But
that's the leaſt matter. The <hi>Lords Day</hi> with
theſe men muſt have all the nicety of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
that the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath</hi> had; and
which is yet worſe, <hi>ſuch obſervation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of</hi>
made one of the <hi>principal parts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
And becauſe God appointed the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>be a ſign between
him and them,</hi> and to diſtinguiſh them from
all other people, therefore in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
the ſuperſtitious obſervation of the
<hi>Lords Day</hi> muſt be the <hi>principal Character of
a godly man.</hi> He that conſiders well this
matter can find no original of it but perfect
Judaiſm introduced into Chriſtianity. And
methinks any unprejudiced man ſhould be
convinced of this by this one obſervation,
That this kind of obſervation of the <hi>Lords
Day</hi> diſtinguiſhes this ſort of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
from all other Proteſtants and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in the whole world beſides; It being in
no Church or Countrey obſerved with that
punctuality and in that Sabbatical manner,
as by thoſe perſons. Whence it's plain, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45558:60"/>
ſuch obſervation thereof could neither be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from Chriſtianity in general, nor from
Proteſtantiſm as ſuch, but meerly from a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
tincture theſe perſons have received.</p>
               <p>A <hi>fifth</hi> Inſtance ſhall be their Doctrine of
<hi>Abſolute Predeſtination.</hi> Which though it
be not peculiar to theſe men, yet is ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
and ardently embraced by the men of
that way, as is ſcarce to be parallel'd. And
he that ſeeks the Source of ſo odd an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
can in my opinion pitch no where more
probably, than upon the abſolute Decree of
God to favour the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> for
his ſake. It pleaſed God to beſtow the good
Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> upon the deſcendents of that
good man, and he reſolved and declared he
would do it without reſpect to their deſerts:
now this is made a ſufficient ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That accordingly as he diſpoſed in this
Temporal affair, ſo he will proceed by the
ſame way of Prerogative in determining the
Eternal Doom of Men.</p>
               <p>I will add but one more, which is their
<hi>ſuperſtitious obſervation and interpretation
of Prodigies.</hi> To this a great number of this
Party are ſo addicted, that every unuſual
Accident, every new Appearance in the
World, be it in Heaven above or in the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45558:60"/>
Earth below, is preſently commented upon,
and applications made of the errand of it:
though for the moſt part with Folly as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
as is the Uncharitableneſs; yet with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
as if it were undoubtedly true, that
God governed the affairs of the World by as
viſible a Providence now, as he did hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the Land of <hi>Judaea;</hi> and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of what he did <hi>then,</hi> ſeems to be the
only imaginable account of this conceit of
theirs <hi>now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many other Inſtances might be given of
this kind, but I have made choice of theſe,
becauſe they contain the principal Doctrines
and moſt Characteriſtical Practices of the
Non-conformiſts; and theſe carrying ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the marks of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> upon them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no otherwiſe accountable than upon thoſe
Principles, I think I ſaid not improperly,
when I called <hi>Judaiſm</hi> the ſecond Cauſe of
our Unhappineſs; ſince any man may eaſily
ſee, that ſuch Notions and Principles as theſe
are, muſt needs indiſpoſe thoſe that are lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
with them, to Conformity to, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance
in, the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. But if the weakneſs of Judgement or
bad Inſtruction only obſtructed the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this Church, it were not very difficult
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45558:61"/>
to find a Remedy: but alas! the minds of a
great number of men are under ſuch Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
as have barricado'd them up and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
them almoſt inacceſſible; and that I
reckon as a third Cauſe of our Diſtractions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prejudice</hi> is ſo great an evil that it is able
to render the beſt Diſcourſes inſignificant,
the moſt powerful Arguments and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
evidence ineffectual; this ſtops mens
Ears againſt <hi>the voice of the Charmer, charm
he never ſo wiſely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This alone was able to ſeal up the Eyes
of the Gentile World againſt the Sun of
Righteouſneſs when he ſhone upon them in
his brighteſt glory, and to confirm them in
their blind Idolatries, when the God that
made Heaven and Earth gave the fulleſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoveries
of himſelf that it was fit for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to expect.</p>
               <p>Upon the account of this the <hi>Jews</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
that <hi>Meſſias</hi> they had ſo long expected,
and gloried in before he came, though he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
anſwered all the Characters of Time,
Place, Lineage, Doctrine and Miracles that
their own Writings had deſcribed him by.</p>
               <p>Nay, 'twas Prejudice abuſed the honeſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45558:61"/>
minds of the Diſciples themſelves, ſo that
they could not for a long time believe thoſe
things Chriſt Jeſus told them from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
muſt come to paſs, only becauſe they
were againſt the grain of their Education,
and were croſs to the perſwaſions they had
received in common with the reſt of the
<hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No wonder then if the Church of <hi>England</hi>
ſuffer under Prejudice amongſt thoſe, that
have not only ſeen it ſtigmatized with the
odious marks of Popery and Superſtition,
and had been drawn into a <hi>Solemn League
and Covenant</hi> againſt it, as if it had been an
act of the higheſt Religion to defie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrate
it, and ſo had both their Credits and
their Conſciences engaged againſt it; But
alſo had lived to ſee it proſcribed for near
twenty years by a prevailing Faction.</p>
               <p>Few have that Generoſity and ſtrength of
mind to bear up againſt the torrent of times,
or Confidence enough to oppoſe the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs
of common vogue and prevailing
opinion: There are not many have the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity
to diſcern the true images of things
through thoſe thick miſts that cunning Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians
caſt about them. It is very ordinary to
take the condemnation of any Perſon or Party
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45558:62"/>
for a ſufficient Proof of the Accuſation, and to
think the Indictment proved, if the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
be paſt with common conſent. It was
enough both with the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>
againſt our Saviour, that he was condemned
as a Malefactor, the Ignominy of his Croſs
was a greater Argument againſt him, with
the generality, than the excellency of his
Doctrine or Evidence of his Miracles was
for him.</p>
               <p>This Church was dealt with like the
Great Lord <hi>Strafford,</hi> run down by common
Fame, oppreſt by Neceſſity, not by Law
or Reaſon, and made a Sacrifice to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
Multitude.</p>
               <p>The Arguments againſt it were not weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but numbered: As that Great Lords Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
was of Accumulative Treaſon, ſo
was the Churches of Popery; there was
more in the Concluſion, than could be made
out by the Premiſes; and in the ſumm total,
than in the particulars of which it conſiſted:
for though no one point of Popery or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
could be proved againſt it, yet it
muſt be ſo upon the whole. This being
agreed, the cry then is, <hi>Crucifige,</hi> deſtroy it
root and branch. And now was the Church
ſeemingly dead, and (as I ſaid before) bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45558:62"/>
too for near twenty years; but when
by the wonderful Providence of God it was
raiſed again, as it was matter of equal Joy
and wonder to all ſuch as were not too far
under the power of theſe Prejudices, ſo it
could not be expected otherwiſe but that
weak and timerous perſons ſhould run from
it as from a Ghoſt or Spectre.</p>
               <p>To all which add, That it was the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Intereſt of ſome to deceive others into
an ill opinion of it; partly as being inraged
that by the Churches unexpected Revival,
they loſt its Inheritance which they had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
amongſt themſelves, partly being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
to themſelves that by reaſon of their
no more than vulgar abilities, they could be
fit to fill no extraordinary place in the
Church, and yet were not able to content
themſelves with any ordinary one, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
choſe to ſet up a Party againſt it, and
become Leaders of a Faction, ſince they
might not be Governours of a Church. And
when it is come to that paſs <hi>that by this
craft we get our Livings,</hi> like the Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths
at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> no wonder if Apoſtolical
Doctrine and Government be cryed down,
and the Great <hi>Diana</hi> be cryed up. The ſumm
is this; Some men were blindly led by their
Education, others by their Intereſt, a third
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45558:63"/>
ſort by their Reputation, to make good what
they had ingaged themſelves and others in;
and theſe three things are able to form a
great Party againſt the Church.</p>
               <p>4. The Fourth and Laſt Cauſe, (and I
wiſh it be not the greateſt) of the Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and ill Eſtate of this Church, is the
want of true Chriſtian Zeal, and of a deep
and ſerious ſenſe of Piety; in defect of which
hath ſucceeded that wantonneſs, curioſity,
novelty, ſcrupuloſity and contention we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of.</p>
               <p>What was it made the Primitive Church
ſo unanimous, that it was not crumbled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Parties, nor mouldered away in Diviſions,
nor quarrelled about Opinions, nor ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one part from another upon occaſion of
little ſcruples? How came it to paſs, (as I
obſerved in the Introduction to this Diſcourſe)
that all good men were of one way, and all
evil men of another, that thoſe that travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the ſame City the heavenly <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
kept the ſame Rode and parted not
company?</p>
               <p>It could not be that they ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
different apprehenſions, for mens Parts
were no more alike, nor their Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45558:63"/>
more equal in thoſe times than now.</p>
               <p>There were then ſeveral Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
that might have afforded matter of
ſcruple (if the Chriſtians had been ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed)
as well as now: and I think both
more in number, and as lyable to exception
as any thing now in uſe. There was then
<hi>bowing towards the Eaſt,</hi> obſervation of <hi>Lent</hi>
and other dayes, <hi>diſtinction of Garments,</hi>
and innumerable other Obſervations in the
early dayes of <hi>Tertullian;</hi> and yet neither
any Scripture brought to prove them, nor
any ſuch proof thought neceſſary, and yet
they were obſerved without ſuſpicion on one
ſide, or objection on the other. <hi>Harum &amp;
aliarum ejuſmodi diſciplinarum, ſi legem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtules
Scripturarum, nullam invenies, ſed
traditio praetenditur auctrix, conſuetudo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatrix
&amp; fides obſervatrix,</hi> ſaith he in
his Book <hi>De Corona militis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, in his time <hi>the number
and burden of Ceremonies was grown as
great as under the Law of</hi> Moſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wiſhes for a Reformation thereof,<note place="margin">Ep. 118, 119.</note> in
his Epiſtles to <hi>Januarius;</hi> yet never thought
theſe things a ſufficient ground of Separation
from the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:45558:64"/>
There was then ſome diverſity of Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in which the Governours and Paſtors of
ſeveral Churches delivered themſelves, yet
did they not diſpute themſelves hereupon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Parties, nor accuſe one another of falſe
Doctrine, or either Side make the diviſion of
the Church the Evidence of its Orthodoxy,
or the Trophy of its Victory. The true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
then of the different Event of the ſame
Cauſes then and now, ſeems to be this, That
in thoſe dayes men were ſincerely good and
devout, and ſet their hearts upon the main;
the huge Conſequence and concern of which
eaſily prevailed with thoſe holy men to
overlook their private ſatisfactions. They
were intent upon that wherein the Power of
Godlineſs conſiſted, and upon which the
Salvation of Souls depended; and ſo all <hi>that</hi>
was ſecure, they were not ſo ſuperſtitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned for Rituals, nor ſo unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
fond of Opinions, as to play away the
Peace of the Church and the Honour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
againſt trifles and meer tricks of wit
and fancy. They conſidered that they all
had one God, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in which they all agreed;
and theſe great matters were able to unite
them in leſſer. They, Good men, found
enough to do to mortifie their Paſſions, to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45558:64"/>
their burdens of Affliction and Perſecution,
to withſtand the Temptations of the Devil,
and the contagion of evil Examples from
the world, and had not leiſure for thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Diſputes that now imploy the minds of
men, and vex the Church. They ſpent their
Heat and Zeal another way, and ſo their
Spirits were not eaſily inflammable with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
petty Controverſie.</p>
               <p>But when men grow cold and indifferent
about great things, then they become ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
about the leſſer. When they give over
to mind a holy Life, and heavenly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
then they grow great Diſputers, and
mightily ſcrupulous about a Ceremony.
When they ceaſe to ſtudy their own hearts,
then they become cenſorious of other men;
then they have both the leiſure and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to raiſe Sarmiſes and Jealouſies,
and to find fault with their Superiours.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, then and not till then, do the
little Appendages of Religion, grow great
and mighty matters in mens eſteem, when
the Eſſentials, the great and weighty matters
are become little and inconſiderable.</p>
               <p>And that this is the Caſe with us in this
Nation is too evident to require further
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45558:65"/>
proof, and too lamentable a ſubject for any
good Chriſtian to take pleaſure in dilating
upon. I conclude therefore, in this Point
lyes a great part of the Unhappineſs of this
Church and Kingdom.</p>

Diſputes, loaden with Objections, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by Separation. Nor can it be hoped
that where the buſineſs is Religion, and the
concern Eternal Life, that men ſhould incuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſwallow every thing without moving any
queſtion or ſtirring any diſpute. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Churches muſt of neceſſity more or
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45558:66"/>
leſs have conflicted with the ſame difficulties
we complain of. And conſequently the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
being ſo common, it cannot be but
that many and divers Remedies have been
tryed and made uſe of. And out of that
ſtore we will in this Chapter make election
of ſuch as ſeem beſt to fit the condition of
the Patient and are moſt practicable in the
Caſe.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt place, they of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> (as many and great Schiſms as they
have laboured under formerly, yet) now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
in their Unity and Peace, and upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all others with their reſpective Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
may ſeem to have arrived at ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
skill, and to be fit to be adviſed
withal; and they attribute an admirable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
to the following Method.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By way of Prevention, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
that the people be kept in profound
<hi>Ignorance,</hi> and then they ſuppoſe, they will
never trouble the Church with Diſputes,
nor themſelves with Scruples. Let them
but be blind enough, and they will ſwallow
many a Flye that others ſtrain and boggle
at: keep them up in the dark like Birds or
Wild Beaſts, and you will render them tame
and manageable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:45558:67"/>
They affirm Pictures to be Books good
enough for the Laity, and ſay, Thoſe are
the beſt Sheep that know nothing but their
own Fold. <hi>The Prieſts lips,</hi> they confeſs
<hi>ſhould preſerve knowledge;</hi> but ſo they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it from the people, it is no great
matter whether they have it themſelves
or no.</p>
               <p>This Opiate or ſtupefactive Ignorance theſe
Empiricks mightily cry up; and for proof
of the virtue of it, go but over into <hi>Spain</hi>
or <hi>Italy,</hi> and you ſhall obſerve what ſtrange
cures it hath done. It hath made as ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
people as any in the world naturally,
ſo far from Diſputes in Religion, that they
ſcarce know what it means. Adminiſter but
a large Doſe of this, and it ſhall have the
ſame effect the Plague of Darkneſs had in
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> that <hi>ſuffered no man to ſtir out of
his place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Advice how ſucceſsful ſoever it
hath been in other places, will not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in <hi>England</hi> for two reaſons.</p>
               <p>1. If it were commendable in it ſelf, yet
it comes too late; for the people of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
know ſo much already that the only
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45558:67"/>
way to cure the inconveniences of that, is
to let them know more. And as an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Perſon hath well obſerved concerning
Atheiſm, <hi>That a little ſmattering in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
diſpoſes men to it, by intangling them
in Second Cauſes which they cannot expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
but a through inſight into it leads them
through that perplexed maze to the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Firſt Cauſe of all things.</hi> So 'tis
only ſuperficial knowledge in Chriſtianity
that gives occaſion to our troubles, when
men think they know, but do not; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they know a little, conceit they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
all that is knowable, and hereupon
refuſe inſtruction, and oppoſe their private
opinions to the publick wiſdom. Whereas
did theſe men ſee further into things, they
would then diſcover a reaſon of many things
they are now diſſatisfied with, or at leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
their own underſtandings and grow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
and peaceable.</p>
               <p>2. Beſides, if this Advice came timely,
yet we take the Remedy to be worſe than
the Diſeaſe; for we eſteem it better (if one
be neceſſary) to erre like Men, than to be
driven like Beaſts, or acted like Puppets.</p>
               <p>The Goſpel Church is frequently called
in Scripture <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45558:68"/>
the Kingdom of light;</hi> but by this courſe of
blind Devotion and ſtupid Ignorance, it would
become more like Hell, which they ſay hath
heat without light.</p>
               <p>God in the Goſpel requires a <hi>reaſonable
ſervice,</hi> and it can never be conſiſtent that
thoſe that pretend Chriſt Jeſus is riſen upon
them as a Sun of Righteouſneſs, ſhould think
to worſhip this Sun by turning their backs
upon him, or ſhutting their eyes againſt his
light. If it were or could be ſo, then this
Propoſition would be true, That the way
to become good Chriſtians, is to ceaſe to be
Men.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, They direct us to an <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Judge</hi> of all Controverſies. And this
they ſo much magnifie and repreſent as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
neceſſary to Peace, that they tell us
we ſhall labour in vain, in the uſe of all
other Expedients, and only roll up a weight
with infinite pains, that will with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
violence return upon us again, till we
make uſe of this Remedy.</p>
               <p>But it is ſo Mountebank-like to pretend
to Infallible Cures, that we deſire to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
of theſe two or three things before we
can comply with the advice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:45558:68"/>
1. We would fain know how it came to
paſs, that ſo important a point as this is
(of an Infallible Judge of Controverſies)
which it is pretended would ſecure the Peace
of all States, preſerve the Concord and the
Dignity of all Churches, ſtop the mouths of
all Atheiſts, prevent the Sin and the Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many Souls, is no more plainly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
in Scripture, nor proved by Reaſon,
nor better agreed of amongſt themſelves, that
thus recommend it? A man would reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
expect that a buſineſs of this nature,
(which is therefore of more value than any
one Article of Faith, in as much as that it
hereupon depends what ſhall be ſo,) ſhould
have been more clear and evident than thoſe
things that depend upon it: but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
we find that no man ever yet could
perſwade by Reaſon, that one certain man
in the World was more than a man, and all
the reſt leſs.</p>
               <p>And then for Scripture, that plainly tells
us, <hi>that all men are lyars; i. e.</hi> ſuch as
may deceive, or be deceived; and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
would never have made ſuch a
diſtinction of Chriſtians, as <hi>ſtrong men</hi> and
<hi>babes</hi> in Chriſt, nor made it our duty to
conſider one anothers weakneſs, and practiſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45558:69"/>
mutual forbearance, if it had intended any
where to direct us to ſuch an Umpire as
ſhould have ended all diſputes, and made all
men equally certain.</p>
               <p>But then for agreement amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
where to lodge this Infallibility, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Pope alone, or in the Pope and
Conſiſtory, or in a General Council, or in
all theſe together, or in ſomething elſe, is,
for ought I ſee, a Queſtion that needs an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Judge to determine.</p>
               <p>2. How comes it to paſs that all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
are not determined and Diſputes ended
long ago, if this were true that is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
               <p>Whether there be any Infallible Judge to
reſort to now, is the point in queſtion; but
it is certain there was ſuch a thing in the
Apoſtles times: they had the aſſiſtance of
the Holy Spirit in ſuch a manner as to guide
them into all truth, and gave miraculous
proofs that they had ſo; and yet this would
not cure all the Schiſms, nor reſolve all
Scruples, nor ſilence all Diſputes then. And
how Infallibility in a Pope or any other
perſon, (if it were there to be found) ſhould
have better ſucceſs now than it had in thoſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45558:69"/>
more ſincere and ſimple times of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
I think is not very reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>Beſides, We find manifeſtly that thoſe
that glory ſo much of this Remedy, have
not found ſuch benefit by it, as that they
commend it to us for. For it is well enough
known, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have their Diſputes
as well as we; The <hi>Franciſcans</hi> againſt the
<hi>Dominicans,</hi> and the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> againſt the
<hi>Moliniſts,</hi> and their ſeveral Perſwaſions ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
with as much heat as any of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies;
ſaving that indeed they all agree
in <hi>uno tertio</hi> the Supremacy of the Pope.
Therefore we ſay, <hi>Medice cura teipſum.</hi>
Let us ſee all their own Difficulties decided
and Diſputes ended, and then, and to be ſure
not till then, ſhall we be encouraged to make
uſe of the Remedy.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Thirdly, They have another Remedy
which I muſt needs confeſs hath done ſtrange
things and been very ſucceſsful amongſt
themſelves, and I will tranſcribe the Receipt
of it out of an ingenious Book called</hi> Europae
ſpeculum, pag. 34. <hi>of the Edition at the</hi>
Hague, 1629. <hi>in theſe words:</hi> The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
wayes they hold to raviſh all affections
and fit each humour, are well nigh infinite;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45558:70"/>
there being not any thing either ſacred or
prophane, no virtue nor vice almoſt, nothing
of how contrary condition ſoever, which they
make not in ſome ſort to ſerve that turn,
that each phancy may be ſatisfied. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
wealth can ſway with the lovers, or
voluntary poverty with the deſpiſers of the
world; what honour with the ambitious,
what obediene with the humble; what
great employment with ſtirring and active
ſpirits, what perpetual quiet with heavy and
reſtive bodies; what content the pleaſant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can take in paſtimes and jollity, what
contrariwiſe the auſtere mind in diſcipline
and rigour; what love either chaſtity can
raiſe in the pure, or voluptuouſneſs in the
diſſolute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What change of vows with
the raſh, or of eſtate with the unconſtant;
what pardons with the faulty, or ſupplyes
with the defective; what miracles with the
credulous, or viſions with the phantaſtical;
what gorgeouſneſs of ſhews with the vulgar
and ſimple, what multitude of Ceremonies
with the ſuperſtitious, what prayers with
the devout; And in ſumm, whatſoever can
prevail with any man, either for himſelf to
purſue, or to love and reverence in another,
the ſame is found with them.—On the
one ſide of the ſteet a Cloyſter of Virgins,
on the other a Stye of Courtezans, with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45558:70"/>
toleration. This day all in Masks with
looſneſs and foolery, to morrow all in Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
whipping themſelves till the blood fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
To conclude, Never State, never Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the world, ſo ſtrangely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
of infinite contrarieties, all tending
to the entertainment of the ſeveral humours
of men.</p>
               <p>Now no wonder that this courſe ſhould
keep them generally contented, ſince it is in
effect an univerſal Toleration, a permitting
men to be and do what they liſt, ſo they
caſt but ſome garb of Religion or other
over it.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> it is commonly
ſaid, There is an allowance of all Opinions;
but the truth is no more but this, That that
State being made up of a combination of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Free Cities, he that finds not his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
countenanced in one City ſo much as he
deſires, may retire to another where it is
publickly profeſt. So in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> he that likes not the debaucheries of
the Court, may enjoy ſeverities in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
he that is offended with one Order,
may make choice of another; a man may
be a <hi>good Catholick</hi> as they call it, without
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45558:71"/>
being a <hi>good Chriſtian;</hi> he may perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
his own humour, if he have but
the wit to make a right choice for himſelf;
he need not be at the Self-denyal to conform
his humour to his Profeſſion, but may fit his
inclination with a way of Religion, if he have
not prevented himſelf by an imprudent electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He may almoſt do any thing, provided, as
<hi>Eraſmus</hi> obſerves, <hi>He let but two things
alone, which are the only dangerous points,
that is to ſay, that he meddle not with the
Popes Crown, nor the Monks Bellies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we of this Church are not of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that ſuch a Tenet as this is, is worth
the proſtitution of Religion, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching
of mens minds and Conſciences;
and have too much ſimplicity and ſincerity
of Devotion, to make uſe of this Remedy,
to put an end to our Diſtractions.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, But the great and infallible
Remedy is yet to come, and is that which
others expreſs by ſeveral words, <hi>Axes, Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Racks, Fire</hi> and <hi>Faggot;</hi> but they by one
word that ſignifies as much as all thoſe, <hi>viz.
the Holy Inquiſition.</hi> This is that Engine
that ſtretches all mens Intellectuals to the
proportion of the Prieſts, or cuts them off
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45558:71"/>
to the publick Standard; this decides all
Controverſies, ſilences all Diſputes, reſolves
all Scruples, and makes perfect Peace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it comes. But,</p>
               <p>Though we grant all this, yet will not
this down with <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> For beſides
that our Goſpel is not like (what they ſay
of) the Laws of <hi>Draco, written in blood,</hi> nor
have we any Rubrick, to kill men <hi>for qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs
ſake;</hi> beſides this, I ſay, the Genius
of this Nation is both too couragious and
too compaſſionate, to be this way Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</p>
               <p>No people in the world are leſs moved
by the apprehenſion of death and danger
than they, and no people are more tender
of the Lives of others than they. For ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
theſe two Virtues are inſeparable,
and the moſt generous tempers are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the moſt merciful. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> will be
led like Men, but not driven like Beaſts.
They have great minds that will be moved
by example, and wrought upon by kindneſs,
and melted by good nature; but will ſooner
ſuffer themſelves to be broken in pieces, than
that cruelty ſhall force them, or fear and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
prevail over them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:45558:72"/>
It is generally obſervable here, that no
Laws ſo ſoon grow in deſuetude, and are
rendered unpracticable, as thoſe that are too
ſevere. It is counted a butcherly way of
Chirurgerie with us, for every ſlight wound
to cut off the member. And the exerciſe of
ſo much Cruelty upon the account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
by thoſe Blood-letters in Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
time, hath (thanks be to God) made
that Profeſſion deteſtable to this day; and
it looked ſo ill in the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> that we
ſhall never be perſwaded to practiſe it our
ſelves.</p>
               <p>Therefore none of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
will work the Cure we deſire in this
Church.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee then what other courſes there
are to be taken, and there remain yet theſe
three to be conſidered of. 1. <hi>Univerſal
Toleration. 2. Comprehenſion. 3. Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Conſideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Univerſal Toleration.</hi> This is highly
commended by ſome as the moſt Chriſtian
Remedy, <hi>to let all grow together till the
harveſt.</hi> We are told, <q>That it was it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45558:72"/>
made the Primitive Church ſo happy, and
we may obſerve that this the Chriſtians
pleaded for under perſecuting Emperours,
affirming, <hi>That it was every mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
right to ſerve what God, and uſe what
Religion he thought good.</hi> This the Great
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> declared at his firſt entrance
upon the Empire, and they ſay that every
Prince is bound to do ſo too. Beſides, it
is affirmed, that this is the beſt way of
propagating Truth and giving it Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and making its Triumphs conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
by ſetting it upon even ground, and
giving it no advantage in the encounter of
Error. And that the minds of men will
be as open to truth as falſhood, when they
are delivered from the prejudice. That it
is Power and Intereſt make men of ſuch
or ſuch Opinions. That this is the only
way to make a Learned Clergy, when they
ſhall have a neceſſity upon them to be able
to prove ſubſtantially whatever they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſhould be received; and in fine, That
the only way to make peaceable Subjects,
a rich Countrey and a happy Prince is to
open a Pantheon, to give Liberty to all
Religions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:45558:73"/>
But two things would be conſidered of in
this point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That whatſoever fine things are
ſaid of this or whatever collateral advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
may be reaped by it, they are of no
other force, than to incline the Magiſtrate
prudentially in ſome caſes to uſe Indulgence;
for it never was nor will be proved, that it
is the expreſs duty of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate
to tolerate all Opinions whatſoever; for
ſome are ſuch as deſtroy all Religion which
he is to protect, others ſubvert all Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
which he is to maintain: Therefore
it can never be his duty to carry an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
hand in Religion.</p>
               <p>And though it be true, that the Primitive
Chriſtians uſed ſuch general expreſſions as are
above-ſpecified, and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made ſuch a
declaration, yet both he and they limited and
interpreted themſelves afterwards. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it cannot be ſhewn <hi>de facto</hi> that any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the whole Chriſtian World
doth tolerate all Opinions whatſoever. For
ſhould they do ſo, it muſt be ſuppoſed, that
the Magiſtrate is to have no Conſcience or
Religion himſelf, that other men may have
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45558:73"/>
no check in theirs whatever it be.</p>
               <p>2. But if it were true, that the Magiſtrate
might (if he would) indulge all Sects and
Opinions, and alſo were diſpoſed ſo to do;
yet beſides the Inconveniencies that would
follow, This very thing would be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable
to the people of this Nation;
amongſt whom there is ſo much ſincerity and
heartineſs in Religion.</p>
               <p>It might go down perhaps amongſt ſuch
as have a great Indifferency and Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in Religion, with ſuch people whoſe
God is their Gain, and whoſe Religion is
their Trade or Intereſt. But devout and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
people had rather ſuffer ſome hardſhip
themſelves upon the account of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
than buy their own quiet at the
price of Gods diſhonour. And whatever
kindneſs they may have to ſome diſſenters,
or fondneſs to ſome by-path themſelves, yet
rather than open ſo wide a Gap as that
Popery and Atheiſm it ſelf ſhould enter in
by it, they would deny themſelves and think
it the duty of all other good Chriſtians to
do ſo too.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Comprehenſion;</hi> whereby, I ſuppoſe, is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45558:74"/>
meant the making the terms of Communion
more free and eaſie, an opening the arms of
the Church to receive more into her boſome,
thereby to enlarge both the Society and
Intereſt of the Church. This is highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
by ſome good men as the moſt
proper expedient for a Proteſtant Church in
our condition, as by means whereof it may
be both better ſtrengthened and ſecured
againſt its Enemies abroad, and enjoy Peace
and Contentment at home.</p>
               <p>And truly for my part, if ſuch a courſe
pleaſe our Governours, I have no mind to
oppoſe any thing to it; but only I deſire it
may be conſidered, that there are many
things that look very probably in the general
notion and ſpeculation, and that would flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one into a great opinion of them, and
expectation from them, which when they
come to be tryed, they are no wayes anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to. Many difficulties occurr in the reducing
things of this nature to practice that were
not foreſeen in the theory, and nothing more
common, than for mens minds to deceive
them, or their conſtancy to fail them, ſo as
that they ſhall take no great pleaſure in the
enjoyment of that which they languiſht with
deſire of, whileſt it was ſweetned to them
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45558:74"/>
by the poinant ſauces of hope and fear.
Beſides, this is not yet done, nor do we
know when it will be ſet about, and it's
pity the wounds of the Church ſhould bleed
ſo long as till that can be effected, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if there be any Balm in <hi>Gilead,</hi>
any way of binding them up in the mean
time. And there ſeems to me to remain
no other but that of the <hi>third</hi> Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which is the courſe I have pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon to recommend in the following
Chapters.</p>
               <p>By which I mean nothing elſe but an
Endeavour of better informing the minds of
men, in the nature of thoſe things which
are the matter of our diſputes, and occaſions
of our diſturbances, together with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
conſequences of ſin and danger in
perſevering in our preſent caſe.</p>
               <p>Which if it can be done, we may hope to ſee
the Church recover its antient felicity and
peace, and ſhall not need for cure of our
diſtempers, to reſort either to ſuch ſeverities
as are abhorrent to all <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> or to
ſuch arts as deform Chriſtianity in general,
or to be alwayes changing and altering to
the great diſhonour of Proteſtant Religion
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45558:75"/>
in particular. And this I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
may be obtained, if thoſe Proteſtants
of this Church and Kingdom that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
differ from the Church in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
will impartially conſider the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Propoſitions.</p>

                  <p>Of the true notion of Schiſm, the ſin and
miſchievous conſequents of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THough the Will of man deſervedly
bear the blame of his miſcarriages,
as being neither under Fatal neceſſity, nor
ſubject to violence and compulſion, but
that it may ſuſpend its own act till it be
rightly informed; yet I have ſo much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to humane nature, as to think that moſt
of its irregularities proceed not meerly from
ſtubborn perverſion, but miſtake of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
And that therefore Mankind is very
pittyable in its errors, having not that
clearneſs of perception, nor preſence of
mind that higher and more immaterial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
have.</p>
               <p>And perhaps upon this account, it
pleaſed the Divine Goodneſs to afford men
that which he denyed to the fallen Angels,
<hi>ſecundam tabulam poſtnaufragium,</hi> and to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45558:76"/>
open to them a door of hope by repentance
and retrival of their faults. And accordingly
I obſerve, that thoſe that cruelly murdered
our Saviour, he prayes for them in this
form, <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not
what they do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that it was not only the ſilly multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
that was ſo overſeen, but alſo the wiſeſt
of his Perſecutors, St. <hi>Peter</hi> bears witneſs,
Acts 3. 17. <hi>I wot that ye did it ignorantly,
as alſo did your Rulers.</hi> So that I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſtitute of reaſon nor example for my
charity, if I think in the preſent caſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the greateſt part of thoſe that are
guilty of the diſtractions of this Church, that
did they rightly underſtand the nature of
<hi>Schiſm</hi> and wherein it conſiſts, or the guilt
and miſchiefs that attend it, they would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
be induced to change their courſe. This
therefore I ſhall firſt offer to conſideration.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſin of dividing the Church,
that it is of the deepeſt dye and greateſt
guilt, I ſuppoſe we ſhall eaſily agree; for
indeed no body can well doubt of that, who
conſiders what care our Saviour took to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it, what pains he took with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
that they might be throughly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and not differ in the delivery of his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45558:76"/>
mind to the world, and with what extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
ardour he prayed for them upon this
very account, <hi>John</hi> 17. 11.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtles themſelves anſwered their
Maſters care with their own diligence and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection.
He that obſerves how induſtrious
they were to reſiſt all beginnings of Schiſm in
every Church, to heal all breaches, to take
away all occaſions of diviſion, to unite all
hearts and reconcile all minds; How they
taught people to deteſt this diſtemper as the
bane of Chriſtianity, charging them to uſe the
greateſt caution againſt it, to mark and avoid
all thoſe men that inclined that way, as perſons
of a contagious breath and infectious ſociety;
What odious names they give it, as <hi>Carnality,
the work of the fleſh and of the Devil:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 4.</note> He,
I ſay, that obſerves all this, cannot but be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
of the greatneſs of this ſin.</p>
               <p>But he that ſhall trace the ſenſe of the
Church a little farther, will find the Primitive
Chriſtians hating it in ſuch deteſtation, that
they thought it equal to the moſt notorious
ſins, Idolatry, Murder and Sacriledge.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> amongſt the reſt affirms it to
be of ſo horrible a guilt,<note place="margin">De unitati Eccleſ.</note> that <hi>Martyrdom was
not a ſufficient expiation of it;</hi> that <hi>to dye
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45558:77"/>
for Chriſt the Head, would not waſh out the
ſtain of having divided the Church his Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all this was no more than the caſe
deſerved, for had the Chriſtian Church been
broken into Factions and Parties in thoſe
times, as it hath been ſince, it is not eaſie
to imagine, how it could have reſiſted the
whole World that was united againſt it:
Or if yet it could have ſubſiſted in its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
divided Parties, the miſchief would have
been little leſs; for then thoſe of after-times
would have had the ſeveral Opinions and
diſtinct and peculiar Sentiments of thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Parties, delivered down to them with
equal heat and earneſtneſs, ſo that it would
have proved impoſſible to have diſtinguiſht
the Truth of God from the Opinions of men,
and the common Faith from the <hi>Shiboleth</hi>
and cognizances of the ſeveral Sects and
Parties. And for this cauſe it pleaſed God
that his Church ſhould rather in thoſe early
dayes be haraſſed with perſecutions, which
made it unite it ſelf the cloſer, and (paring
off all ſuperfluities) keep to the neceſſary
and eſſential Doctrines delivered to it, than
to be ſoftened and made wanton by eaſe, and
ſo to corrupt the Simplicity of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Nor is the importance of Unity much leſs
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45558:77"/>
in theſe latter dayes of Chriſtianity, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as all Diviſions in all times deſtroy that
beauty and lovelineſs, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
attract all mens admiration and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Beauty properly is nothing but order
and harmony of parts; the excellency of
any Fabrick conſiſts not ſo much in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the materials, as in the curious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
they are digeſted into, and the good
reſpect and correſpondence one part hath
with another. It is not the ſublimity of
Chriſtian Doctrine, nor the gloriouſneſs
of the Hopes it propounds, that will ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it to the opinion and eſteem of
Beholders, as when it ſhall be ſaid, <hi>Ecce ut
Chriſtiani amant,</hi> when they ſhall obſerve
the love, concord and unanimity amongſt the
profeſſors of it. And the want of this har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
the hearts of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>
more againſt it, than all the reaſons
and proofs we can give for it, will ſoften
them; and inſtead of opening their ears and
hearts to entertain it, opens their mouths in
contempt and blaſphemy againſt it.</p>
               <p>But beſides the diſadvantage Chriſtianity
is expoſed to by its Diviſions, in reſpect of
thoſe that are without, it ſuffers unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
within its own Territories. For who
will be perſwaded patiently to hear, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45558:78"/>
to conſider, or impartially to judge of the
diſcourſes of him againſt whom he hath an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity?
Every thing the truer it is, the more it
is for its advantage to be calmly conſidered:
and by how much of the more importance it is,
by ſo much is he that would have his propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſucceſsful, bound in wiſdome to take care
that the minds of men be not by paſſion and
prejudice indiſpoſed to receive it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Livy</hi> obſerves, that prodigious Stories,
Lyes and Fables find beſt entertainment in
troubleſome times, <hi>quia tutius finguntur &amp;
facilius creduntur;</hi> men are not then at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to conſider ſtrictly what is true and
falſe, and ſo truth loſes its advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground,
and error ſucceeds in it. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
therefore choſe to come into the world
in a time of the moſt profound peace, not only
becauſe ſuch a ſeaſon became the Prince of
Peace, but eſpecially for this advantage of
his Doctrine we are ſpeaking of, namely,
that he might find men in calm thoughts and
at leiſure to conſider the reaſonableneſs of
his propoſitions. For who can maturely
weigh things when all is in hurry and tumult?
Who can diſcern exactly the difference of
things, when all is in motion? Eſpecially
who is there that is willing either to do
good to, or to receive good from him,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45558:78"/>
againſt whom he hath an exulcerate mind?</p>
               <p>In ſhort then, and to ſpeak ſummarily,
From Schiſms and Diviſions amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
comes that prejudice upon the minds of
people that diſcourages the indeavours, and
fruſtrates the labours of the Miniſters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
From thence come all the Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Jealouſies, Whiſperings, Backbitings
and all other inſtances of Uncharitableneſs.
Theſe hinder the fervour of mens Prayers,
and abate the edge of their Devotions.
Theſe evaporate the true Spirit and Life of
Religion in impertinent Diſputes, ſo that
men loſe the ſubſtance, whileſt they contend
for the ſhadow. By theſe the ſinews of all
Society are diſſolved; for when the Church
is diſturbed, it ſeldome reſts here, but the
State is concerned too; and Schiſm in the
former, proves Sedition in the latter. And
this conſideration is able to provoke the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
to keep a jealous eye upon the
Church and Religion.</p>
               <p>All theſe things are ſo true in themſelves,
and withal ſo generally acknowledged by all
Parties, that a man might juſtly wonder,
how any Chriſtian ſhould be guilty of
Schiſm, which all ſo much abominate. Were
it not that we may obſerve too, that ſome
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45558:79"/>
have found pleaſure to get that Child, they
would by no means have laid at their own
door. Schiſm is ſo miſhapen as well as ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begotten
a Brat, that no body is willing to
father it. It was the early proof <hi>Solomon</hi>
gave of his wiſdom, in diſcovering the true
Mother of the living Child, to which
both the Litigants laid equal claim.
It is a matter of no leſs importance, and
ſome think of equal difficulty, to make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovery,
who the diſtractions of the
Church are juſtly to be imputed to. But
as that Wiſe Prince diſcerned the true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the tenderneſs of her bowels towards
the Infant, ſo we perhaps may diſcover the
true Children of the Church by their reſpect
and tenderneſs, and conſequently the Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
by their irreverence and unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
towards her.</p>
               <p>In order to which, I will therefore briefly
and plainly deſcribe the true notion of
<hi>Schiſm;</hi> In hopes that when men ſhall
underſtand, wherein the guilt of it lyes,
they will avoid the evil as well as abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the conſequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Schiſm</hi> is a voluntary departure or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of ones ſelf without juſt cauſe given,
from that Chriſtian Church whereof he was
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45558:79"/>
once a member; or, <hi>Schiſm</hi> is a breach of
that Communion wherein a man might have
continued without ſin.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I call it a <hi>Departure or Separation
from the Society of the Church,</hi> to diſtinguiſh
it from other ſins, which though they are
breaches of the Laws of our Religion, and
conſequently of the Church, yet are not a
renunciation of the Society. For as there
may be a ſickly, infirm, nay, an ulcerous
member, and yet a member of the body: So
there may be ſuch a perſon, who for his
wickedneſs deſerves well to be caſt out of
the Church, as being a ſcandal and diſhonour
to it, yet neither ſeparating himſelf, nor
being caſt out of the Society, remains ſtill
a member of it.</p>
               <p>Now what it is that imports a mans ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of himſelf or departure from the
Church, we ſhall eaſily underſtand; for it is
no more but this, When a man ſhall either
expreſly declare that he doth renounce ſuch
a Society, or ſhall refuſe to joyn in the acts
and exerciſes of Religion uſed by ſuch a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to ſubmit to its Authority. So he ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
that refuſes Baptiſm, the Lord Supper, or
to ſubmit unto the Cenſures of a Church,
and ſufficiently declares that he owns himſelf
no longer of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45558:80"/>
Secondly, I call it a <hi>Voluntary</hi> Separation,
to diſtinguiſh ſin from puniſhment, or Schiſm
from Excommunication. For though the laſt
makes a man no member of a Church, yet
it is ſuppoſed involuntary, and he doth not
make himſelf ſo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I call it a departure from a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church of Chriſt,</hi> or from a <hi>part of the
viſible Church,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie,
which is a caſting off of the whole
Religion, the name and profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
and not only the particular Society:
but the Schiſmatick is he that, retaining the
Religion in general, or at leaſt a pretence of
it, changes his Society, aſſociates himſelf
with, or makes up ſome other body in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to that whereof he formerly was.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I add thoſe words <hi>whereof he
was a member,</hi> becauſe Schiſm imports divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and making two of that which was but
one before. And ſo <hi>Turks, Pagans, Jews</hi>
cannot be called Schiſmaticks, having never
been of the Church.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I ſuppoſe are all generally
agreed of; The only difficulty is in that
which I ſubjoyn in theſe words, an <hi>unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:45558:80"/>
ſeparation, or <hi>without juſt cauſe,</hi> or
to ſeparate from that Society <hi>wherein I may
continue without ſin.</hi> And here we meet
with oppoſition on both ſides, ſome defining
too ſtrictly, and others extending too far,
the cauſes of Separation.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt ſort are the Zealots of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſcarcely allow any
thing as a ſufficient cauſe of Separation; for
being conſcious of ſo many and great Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
in their Church, they know they
can ſcarce allow any thing as a juſt cauſe of
Separation, that will not be in danger to be
uſed againſt themſelves, and juſtifie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of all Proteſtants from them.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, ſome Proteſtants
make the cauſes of Separation as many and
as light as the <hi>Jews</hi> did of Divorce, almoſt
for any matter whatſoever. <hi>Joſephus</hi> put
away his Wife (as himſelf tells us) becauſe
ſhe was not mannerly enough; another his,
becauſe he ſaw a handſomer than ſhe; a
third his, becauſe ſhe dreſt not his dinner
well. As theſe <hi>Jews</hi> did by their Wives, ſo
do many Chriſtians by the Church; One
likes not her dreſs, another thinks her too
coſtly in her ornaments, a third phanſies
ſome <hi>German</hi> beauty or other that he hath
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45558:81"/>
ſeen in his travails, and all (to make way
for new Amours) upon very ſlender pretences
repudiate their former choice. But as our
Saviour when the Caſe was put, found out
a middle way betwixt allowing Divorce for
no cauſe at all, and for every cauſe; ſo ought
it to be done in this buſineſs of Schiſm.</p>
               <p>To hit this mark therefore, I ſay, that
then, and then only, is there juſt cauſe of
Separation, when Perſeverance in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of ſuch a Church cannot be without
ſin; that is, when ſhe ſhall impoſe ſuch Laws
and terms of Society, as cannot be ſubmitted
to without apparent breach of the Divine
Law.</p>
               <p>And upon this foundation, I doubt not but
we ſhall quit our ſelves well on both ſides;
that is, both juſtifie our Receſſion from the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and demonſtrate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantableneſs
of this Separation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
of this Kingdom from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For it's
plain on the one hand, that it cannot be ſin
to ſeparate, when it is ſin to communicate,
ſince no Laws of men can abrogate or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
the obligation of the expreſs Laws of
God. And on the other it is as plain, that
Schiſm being ſo great a ſin, and of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45558:81"/>
bad conſequence, that which muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
me of the guilt of it in my ſeparation,
can be nothing leſs than equal danger on the
other hand, and that when I may perſevere
without ſin, it muſt of neceſſity be a ſin to
ſeparate upon inferiour diſlikes.</p>
               <p>This methinks is ſo plain, that I wonder
any doubt ſhould be admitted of in the caſe.
Notwithſtanding becauſe I obſerve ſome men
think to waſh their hands of the imputation of
Schiſm upon other terms; as namely, Although
a Church ſhall not require or impoſe ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Communion as are expreſly ſinful,
yet if ſhe ſhall require indifferent unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or at moſt ſuſpected things; that in this
caſe there is enough to excuſe the perſon that
ſhall ſeparate, from a participation of this
ſin. And alſo becauſe this opinion bears it
ſelf up by the great name of Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> as
his declared judgement in a little Tract of
<hi>Schiſm</hi> now very much in the hands of men,
I will therefore for the clearing of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſay theſe three things.</p>
               <p>1. I willingly acknowledge, that ſuch a
Church as ſhall ſtudiouſly or careleſly clog
her Communion with unneceſſary, burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and ſuſpected conditions, is very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to blame; yet is it neither burdenſomneſs
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45558:82"/>
nor every light ſuſpicion of ſin, but a plain
neceſſity or certainty of ſin in complyance,
that can juſtifie my Separation; foraſmuch
as I cannot be diſcharged from a plain duty,
but by an equal plainneſs of the ſin. And
for this phraſe <hi>ſuſpected,</hi> it is ſo looſe and
uncertain, that there is no hold of it; men
will eaſily ſuſpect what they have no mind
to: and Suſpicion having this priviledge, we
ſhall quickly evacute every uneaſie duty, and
inſtead of guiding our ſelves by Gods Word
and ſound reaſoning, we ſhall give our ſelves
up to the conduct of Paſſion, Melancholy and
Secular Intereſt.</p>
               <p>2. If the non-neceſſity of ſome of the
terms of Communion be a warrant of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
then there can be no ſuch ſin as
Schiſm at all, foraſmuch as there never was,
nor probably ever will be, ſuch a Church as
required nothing of thoſe in her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but things ſtrictly and abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;
as I have ſhewed partly in the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
and could eaſily make appear at
large through all Ages. And then may the
Author of the Tract about <hi>Schiſm</hi> ſecurely,
as he doth ſomewhat too lightly, call it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Theological Scarcrow.</p>
               <p>3. It will be manifeſt to any conſidering
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45558:82"/>
perſon, that ſome things are neceſſary to the
Conſtitution and Adminiſtration of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church, that are not in themſelves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
abſolutely conſidered. And of this I
will give two inſtances.</p>
               <p>The firſt in the Apoſtles times; The <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining
from things ſtrangled and blood,</hi>
was by the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> adjudged
and declared neceſſary to be obſerved by the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> in order to an accomodation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them and the <hi>Jews</hi> (of which I ſhall
ſay more hereafter) and yet I ſuppoſe ſcarce
any body thinks the obſervation of that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence
ſo enjoyned, neceſſary in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The ſecond inſtance ſhall be <hi>Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
Whatever diſputes there are
about the ſeveral Forms of it, as whether it
ought to be Monarchical or Ariſtocratical.
Epiſcopal or Conſiſtorial, and whatever zeal
for opinion may tranſport men to ſay in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of either of them, yet I ſuppoſe few or
none will affirm, that either of theſe Forms
is abſolutely neceſſary; for if one be of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
neceſſity, the other muſt be abſolutely
unlawful: and not only ſo, but then alſo thoſe
that do not receive that abſolutely neceſſary
Form, can be no Churches, for that Society
which is defective in abſolutely neceſſaries,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:45558:83"/>
can be no Chriſtian Church. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is not only lawful to determine and
define this unneceſſary point, but it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to the conſtitution of every particular
Church, that it be defined one way or
other, I mean ſo far as concerns that Church;
for if this be left indifferent in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church (as perhaps it is in it ſelf in
the general) it is manifeſt there can be no
Superiour nor Inferiour, no Governour nor
governed, no Order, and conſequently a meer
Rout and no Church. Therefore ſome things
not neceſſary in themſelves not only may,
but muſt be defined in a particular Church;
and conſequently it will be no juſt exception
againſt a Church, nor excuſe from Schiſm,
if we ſeparate from that Communion, becauſe
ſuch definitions are made in it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the nature and importance of thoſe things
that are ſcrupled, or objected againſt in
this Church; and that they are ſuch as
may without ſin be ſacrificed to Peace, and
therefore cannot excuſe us from ſin in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
from the Church upon their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is the cuſtome of thoſe that have a mind
to quarrel, to aggravate and heighten
the cauſes of diſcontent, to the end that the
enſuing miſchief may not be imputed to the
frowardneſs of their temper, but to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the provocation. And paſſion is ſuch
a Magnifying-glaſs as is able to extend a
Mole-hill to a Mountain. The way of Peace
therefore is to take juſt meaſures of things;
and as upon the account of Truth we muſt
not make the matters of our diſpute leſs than
they are, ſo for the ſake of both Truth and
Peace we ought not to make them greater.
Wherefore if men would be perſwaded to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45558:84"/>
ſet aſide paſſion, and calmly conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and juſt value of thoſe things that we
in this Church are divided upon, we ſhould
then be ſo far from ſeeing reaſon to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
our diſtance and animoſities, that we
ſhould on the contrary, be ſeized with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and indignation, that we have hitherto
been impoſed upon ſo far, as to take thoſe
things for great deformities, which upon
mature conſideration are really nothing worſe
than Moles, which may be upon the moſt
beautiful face.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe therefore, having in the
former Chapter repreſented the nature of
Schiſm, and the guilt and miſchiefs attending
it, I proceed now to ſhew the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the temptations to it, I mean the
littleneſs and ſmall importance of the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
againſt this Church; and that neither
any of them ſingle, nor all of them together
can countervail the bleſſing of Peace or the
evil of Diviſion.</p>
               <p>In order hereto, I will firſt ſhew that the
cauſes of Diſſenſions amongſt us are not like
thoſe upon which we ſeparated from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Communion. 2. That ſomething muſt
be given for Peace by them that will have
it. 3. That all the ſcruples and objections
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45558:84"/>
againſt this Church, are not too great a price
to pay for it.</p>
               <p>1. Touching the firſt, it is ſaid by ſome in
heat and paſſion, That there is as much
cauſe for ſeceſſion from this Church now,
as there was from the <hi>Roman</hi> in the time of
our Anceſtors: but with no more reaſon,
than if the arguments and diſcourſes writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
againſt a notorious Tyrant and Uſurper,
ſhould be turned againſt a good and lawful
Prince. As will eaſily be manifeſt if we
conſider the juſt ſtate of the caſe on either
hand.</p>
               <p>We could not continue in the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church upon any better conditions than <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſh</hi>
propounded to the men of <hi>Jabeſh Gilead,</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. to put out our right Eyes that
we might be fit for her blind devotion. We
muſt for the ſake of Peace have denyed the
Faith, renounced our Reaſon, and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
our very Senſes. That Church inſtead
of inſtructing men in knowledge, profeſſes to
nurſe them up in ignorance; in lieu of the
Scriptures, it gives them Traditions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of ſuch things as were <hi>from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
and the <hi>faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi>
it preſcribes thoſe things that had their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:45558:85"/>
beginning from private intereſts and ſecular
advantages.</p>
               <p>They make ſeven Secraments, five more
than Chriſt ever intended for ſuch, and take
away from the people the half of one of
thoſe he expreſly inſtituted and enjoyned.
They teach men to pray to Saints inſtead of
God, and to uſe a Language in their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which he that pronounces, underſtands
no more than the Saint, he prayes to, doth his
Needs and Requeſts. Nay, they give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
honour to a piece of Bread, and muſt
ſwallow Idolatry in ſpite of their teeth;
herein little better than the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> who
worſhipt that for a God which they put into
their Bellies. They have taken away one
of the Ten Commandments and have arts of
evacuating allthe reſt, for they elude the
neceſſity of a true and ſerious Repentance,
and ſubvert the principles of holy Life. In
ſhort, they have brought in Pageantry inſtead
of Piety and Devotion, effaced the true line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments
of Chriſtianity, and inſtead thereof
recommended and obtruded upon the world
the dictates of Ambition, the artifices of
Gain, and a colluvies of almoſt all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions,
Errors and Corruptions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages, and this muſt be received and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:45558:85"/>
ſwallowed by all thoſe that will continue in
that Communion.</p>
               <p>Theſe things could not be ſubmitted to
without grievous Sin and manifeſt danger of
Damnation; therefore there was juſt ground
for our Receſſion: for, as I ſaid, it could not
be ſin to depart when it was ſo to continue.
And it is a very reaſonable choice rather to
be condemned by them of Singularity, than
to be damned for Company.</p>
               <p>But now it is quite otherwiſe in the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> No man here parts
with his Faith upon his Conformity, no man
is bound to give away his Reaſon and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Senſe for quietneſs ſake. No man
needs to hazard the Peace of a good and
well inſtructed Conſcience, for the Peace of
the Church. No man is tempted to renounce
his Integrity, but may be as good and holy
a man as he will, and the more of that the
better Church-man. This Church keeps
none of her Children in an uncomfortable
eſtate of darkneſs, but teaches the true
knowledge of God and Chriſt ſincerely and
very advantageouſly. She hath no half
Communions, nor debarrs any of her mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the priviledge and comfort of Chriſts
Inſtitutions. She recommends the ſame
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45558:86"/>
Faith and the ſame Scriptures that all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
are agreed in. The ſame God, and
only he, is worſhipped, the ſame rules of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Life are propounded, as well as the ſame
hopes and happineſs expected.</p>
               <p>By this brief repreſentation the difference
between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
appears ſo wide and vaſt, that they
agree neither in their <hi>Creed,</hi> nor <hi>Object of
Worſhip,</hi> nor <hi>Sacraments,</hi> nor <hi>Rules of Life.</hi>
On the other ſide, the agreements of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
with the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſo
full and perfect, that they have not only
the <hi>ſame God and Chriſt,</hi> but the <hi>ſame object
of Worſhip,</hi> the <hi>ſame way of Devotion</hi> in a
known Tongue, the <hi>ſame Sacraments</hi> and
<hi>ſame rule of life,</hi> which certainly are all
the great things that the Conſciences of men
are concerned in.</p>
               <p>A man might therefore juſtly wonder,
(theſe things being ſo) what ſhould make
a breach, and what place there is for conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
or what can remain conſiderable enough
to occaſion the diſſatisfaction, to provoke the
animoſity, to countenance that diſtance that
is between us. And I verily believe it would
be hard for a ſtranger to this Church and
Nation, that underſtood the ſtate of the caſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:45558:86"/>
thus far, to gueſs what ſhould be the bone of
contention amongſt us.</p>
               <p>I will now as well as I can both ſaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and briefly recite the matters of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
And I muſt needs confeſs, if we <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
them only, they are many; But if we
<hi>weigh</hi> them (not only againſt the things we
are agreed in, but againſt peace and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it ſelf) I perſwade my ſelf they will
be very light. But that I muſt leave to the
judgement of the Reader. The things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are theſe and ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>Whether ſuch Prayers ſhall make up the
body of the publick Liturgy, as have been
conceived by the Governours of the Church,
and uſed ever ſince the Reformation; or ſuch
as ſhall <hi>pro re nata</hi> be occaſionally indited
by every private Miniſter?</p>
               <p>Or, which perhaps is much the ſame, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch words, expreſſions and phraſes ſhall
be continued in the publick Service, as are
by long uſe grown familiar to, and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by vulgar people, or ſuch ſhall come in
their room, as are more modern and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to nicer Ears?</p>
               <p>About the ſeveral poſtures of Standing,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45558:87"/>
Kneeling and Sitting; and whether ſome one
of theſe be more decorous and accommodate
to ſome part of Gods Worſhip than another,
and which to which?</p>
               <p>About obſervation of Dayes and Times;
as whether the Anniverſaries of the Birth,
Death and Reſurrection of our Saviour and
other great paſſages of the Goſpel be of uſe,
and fit to be obſerved? And whether ſome
ſpecial Time of Abſtinence and Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in conformity to the Primitive Church,
may now be retained or not?</p>
               <p>About Habits and Garments, ſuch as
Gown, Surplice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether the habit uſed
in miniſtration in the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi>
be not now as lawful as any other?</p>
               <p>About the Ceremony of the Croſs in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
whether (whileſt it is declared not
eſſential to Baptiſm) it may not upon other
conſiderations be uſed in that Sacrament?</p>
               <p>Or laſtly (which I think is as important
as any of the reſt) whether Subordinacy of
the Clergy in the Epiſcopal way, or Co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinacy
and Parity in the Presbyterian, be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be preferred?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:45558:87"/>
Moſt of the Diſputes we have amongſt us,
are either upon theſe queſtions, or reducible
to theſe, or at leaſt of like nature with
theſe. Now how inconſiderable theſe things
are in themſelves, and how fit to be made a
Sacrifice to Peace, I forbear to ſay, till I
have in the ſecond place ſhewn, as I promiſed,
that ſomething muſt be forgone for it.</p>
               <p>2. It was a worthy and memorable ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Eraſmus, Mihi ſanè adeò inviſa eſt
diſcordia, ut veritas etiam diſpliceat ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſa.</hi>
He did not only ſuſpect that Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was not true, that was not alſo peaceable,
but he thought Peace not too dear at the
price of ſome Truth. And he that pretends
ſo high a value for the latter, as to have no
eſteem for the former, neither underſtands
the one nor the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Greg. Nazianz.</hi> puts this Queſtion, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
and anſwers, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
That peace is not
only the moſt beautiful flower in the Garden
of Chriſtianity, but alſo the moſt ſoveraign
and uſeful. Though it be commonly dealt
with as ſome famed beauty, admired and
courted, but not eſpouſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:45558:88"/>
The Apoſtle, when <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 18. he ſo
paſſionately exhorts, <hi>If it be poſſible, and as
far as in you lyes, have peace with all men,</hi>
ſurely did not mean, that we ſhould only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of Peace when it is offered us for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or be quiet till we can pick a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel;
but that we ſhould be at ſome coſt to
purchaſe it, and part with ſomething for it,
and deny our ſelves ſomething which (but
upon that account) we might lawfully have
enjoyed.</p>
               <p>It is true we may buy Gold too dear, and
ſo we muſt have done our Peace, if we
ſought it at the hands of thoſe Huckſters of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as I ſhewed before. But
that we cannot reaſonably expect it for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in any Society in the World, I think
is demonſtratively evident by this one conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
That there are ſcarcely any intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
<hi>Menaechmi,</hi> I mean hardly any two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
perfectly of the ſame apprehenſion or
ſtature of underſtanding in the whole world.
So much difference there is in mens Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
ſuch diverſity of Education, ſuch
variety of Intereſts and Cuſtoms, and from
hence ſo many kinds of Prejudices and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Conceptions of things, that he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
to yield to no body, can agree with
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45558:88"/>
no body, and conſequently cannot be happy
in any Church or Society on this ſide of
Heaven. There indeed ſome think mens
minds ſhall be all of one capacity, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be the truth in that particular, I much
doubt, whether thoſe perſons will ever make
up that ſociety of the Church Triumphant,
that think themſelves bound to diſturb the
ſtate of the Church Militant, unleſs all
things fall in with their own humour. For
every peaceable man ſees he muſt either go
out of the world, or ſet it all in flames, if he
will not ſubdue his own paſſion, and caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
his heat; That he muſt ſuffer ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
in the tempeſtuous Seas of diſpute and
contentions, if he will not, both take in his
ſails, and lighten the ſhip by caſting over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
the fardles of his private phancies and
opinions. He that will require all other
men ſhould aſſent to what he thinks, and
will conceal nothing he is perſwaded of, and
yet expect to live in peace, muſt either
have very little wit or extraordinary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
And he that will bear nothing that
God hath not expreſly impoſed upon him,
nor part with any thing he may lawfully
keep, nor offer any Sacrifice to thoſe touchy
Deities, received Cuſtome and vulgar Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
muſt expect often to feel the effects of
their rage and power. In ſumm, he that will
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45558:89"/>
ſacrifice nothing to publick tranquillity, muſt
be ſure to live in perpetual flames here,
whatſoever become of him hereafter.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle was not, certainly, of this
ſtubborn humour, who declares of himſelf
that he <hi>became all things to all men, that he
might gain ſome. To the Jews he became
as a Jew, to gain the Jews; to them that
were without Law, as without Law; to them
that were weak he became as weak too,</hi>
1 Cor. 9. 20. He was now no longer a ſtarcht
inflexible Phariſee, but a complaiſant Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
or as ſome perhaps would have called
him, a Latitudinarian Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>When a whole Council of the Apoſtles at
<hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 15. (which is a paſſage I
have often occaſion to mention, and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
to be ſtudied by every peaceable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian)
when I ſay they decreed that the
Gentiles ſhould <hi>abſtain from things ſtrangled
and from blood,</hi> they deprived them of a great
part of their Chriſtian Liberty meerly to
conciliate the Jews to them, and required
that to be done for peace, that no Law of God
otherwiſe required at their hands.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi> affirms of St. <hi>Baſil</hi>
that he diſſembled the Coeſſentiality of the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:45558:89"/>
Holy Spirit, and delivered himſelf in ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
terms on that great point, leſt he
ſhould offend and loſe the weak; which neither
would that holy man have done, nor much
leſs his eſpecial Friend and admirer have
told of him, if either of them had thought
it to have been too great a price for the
purchaſe.</p>
               <p>But we need no other, and can have no
greater, inſtance in this caſe than our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
himſelf, who when he came into the
world complyed with the Rites and Cuſtoms
he found, and condeſcended to the very hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of that ſtubborn people amongſt whom
he was; he uſed their phraſe in all his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes,
he obſerved their Feaſts, he made
his own inſtitutions of Baptiſm and the
Lords Supper as conſonant to their Cuſtoms
as it was poſſible; to the end that he might
not diſturb them with Novelty, but ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
himſelf and his Doctrine by theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyances.
When a certain Tribute was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of him, he firſt proves that he was
not obliged to pay it, yet leſt he ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them, determines to pay it, and works
a Miracle to make <hi>Peter</hi> to do it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 27.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we ſay to all this? Are theſe
Inſtances only to trace out an example of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:45558:90"/>
condeſcenſion in Magiſtrates and Governours
to their Inferiours? or are they not moſt
certainly as Land-marks to all of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
or condition ſoever to direct them how
to ſteer their courſe, and behave themſelves
in order to Peace?</p>
               <p>Let me appeal to the Conſciences of men,
Is it not plain from hence, that although I
be perſwaded ſuch a certain Rite is leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
in it ſelf, yet if it appear to be
an inſtrument of Accommodation, that it is
therefore in that caſe beſt upon that account?
And that ſuch things as are indifferent, or
have no eſſential goodneſs of their own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
not indifferent but good, as they are
uſeful or neceſſary to that end? Or if I am
perſwaded, that ſuch an opinion is more true
than that which is publickly received (ſo
long as the main Doctrine of Chriſtianity is
not in diſpute) I may not for all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
it, rather than diſturb the Church?
This was the counſel of the famous <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
for the preventing and ſilencing diſputes
at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> though the things in
controverſie there, were of a higher nature
than ours are. But if any man be not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the Judgement of ſo great and
good a Prince, let him go and learn what
that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 14. 22. means, <hi>Haſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45558:90"/>
thou faith? have it to thy ſelf, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God.</hi> In ſhort therefore, it will be no
hypocritical tergiverſation, no wrong either
to our Religion or to our Conſciences, if
when the caſe ſhall ſo require, we change
any phraſe of ſpeech, how fit ſoever in our
apprehenſion, for one leſs fit, but more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
and current; any Rite or Ceremony
that we have a great kindneſs for, for one
more grateful to others; and that we may
comply with the Laws in being, ſo they be
not palpably contrary to the Scriptures or
common reaſon, though we think better
might be made in their room. And that
according to the ſaying of the Lord <hi>Bacon,
we may take counſel of the elder times what
is beſt, but of the preſent times, for what as
fitteſt.</hi> And in a word, that we part with all
that which is no eſſential point of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
for Charity, which is.</p>
               <p>3. Let us now for a Concluſion of this
Chapter reflect back upon the aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Catalogue of things in difference, and
ſee if they will not all appear to be of ſuch
a nature as we have hitherto ſuppoſed them,
that is, ſuch as may be fit to become a Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering,
and ſacrificed to the Magiſtrate, the
Laws and the Church. And that we ſhall
be eaſily able to reſolve of, by the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45558:91"/>
help of theſe five following Remarques.</p>
               <p>1. That the things now ſcrupled in this
Church are ſuch as were heretofore ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to by the moſt Leading men of thoſe that
now hereupon depart from it; and if thoſe
things were in themſelves lawful then, they
cannot change their nature by time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unlawful now. It will not be replyed,
That then they made no conſcience of what
they did, leſt it ſhould be ſuſpected they do
but pretend it now; for he that confeſſes a
guilt of the ſame kind, ſtrengthens the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of that whereof he is accuſed. But if
it be ſaid, they did it Ignorantly then, and
now having more light, cannot outface it:
To this it will be as eaſie to anſwer, That
the ingagements of Intereſt and Prejudice are
as lyable to be ſuſpected now, as Ignorance
heretofore; eſpecially if we conſider, that
there was no appearance of any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
light breaking in, when our troubles
and diviſions broke out, but as ſoon as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
offered, and occaſion invited, that
is, when Laws were laid aſleep, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
taken up with other cares, then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without further deliberation, all theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
ſtart up, and new Models ſet up for
themſelves, which if they had been the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of light and knowledge muſt have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45558:91"/>
gradually in proportion to that, and
increaſed by time and deliberation; but this
is ſo far from being the caſe, that it is ſcarce
(if at all) poſſible to find any objection
that is not much elder than he that makes it.</p>
               <p>2. Thanks be to God, ſome Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
daily come over to the Church, and
thoſe not of the meaneſt Character for abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or piety; but let them bragg of any one
if they can find him, that hath ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetlement
of the Church at His Majeſties
Reſtauration apoſtatized to them.</p>
               <p>Now they muſt be horribly uncharitable
that can conclude, either all thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the Church Ignorant, or thoſe that
return to it Hypocritical; and if they do not
judge ſo, they confeſs the matters in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to be not certainly evil, but that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
hath made them ſeem ſo.</p>
               <p>3. That there are men of as clear Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
as good Life and as comfortable
Conſciences in the Society of this Church
as are any where elſe to be found; and if ſo
(which Impudence it ſelf hath not the face
to deny) then there is no capital error in its
conſtitution, ſince thoſe three anſwer to the
whole deſign of Chriſtianity; and it can never
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45558:92"/>
be, that there ſhould be danger that neither
troubles the Conſcience with fears, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playes
it ſelf in a bad Life, nor is diſcoverable
by an honeſt heart and ſound underſtanding.</p>
               <p>4. The things objected againſt this Church
are but at moſt diſputable matters, becauſe all
wiſe and good men are not agreed upon
them. But that which is <hi>ſub judice,</hi> and
yet under diſpute, cannot be called <hi>Evil</hi> till
the diſpute is ended, and the deciſion made
againſt it.</p>
               <p>5. And laſtly, the things ſcrupled in this
Church, are ſuch as the like may be found
and complained of in any Church of the
whole world, at leaſt ſince the Apoſtles times.</p>
               <p>Now if theſe things be true, as I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they will appear upon impartial conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
then are the matters of our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
ſuch as I have ſuppoſed, namely, of
no greater value, than that we may forgo our
private opinion, phancy and cuſtome in and
concerning them, for the Peace of the Church.
And if we reſolve not to unite our ſelves to
the Church whileſt there is any thing of this
nature to diſcontent us, it is too much to be
feared that Peace will for ever be hid from
our eyes. But to prevent that, let me here
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:45558:92"/>
prevent my ſelf in one thing that will fall in
more opportunely hereafter, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſince
there is no grand matter of Religion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Controverſies between us, nor any
violation of the Laws of God in our comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Laws of this Society, and ſince
either <hi>Mahomet</hi> muſt go the Mountain, or the
Mountain muſt come to <hi>Mahomet, i. e.</hi> one
ſide or other muſt yield, we will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to think it reaſonable, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
ſhould ſubmit to the Governour, and
Opinion give place to antient Cuſtome, and
Novelty to the Laws in being.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That thoſe that find fault with the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of this Church, will never be able
to find out or agree upon a better.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT was ſeaſonable advice which a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Long Parliament is ſaid to
have propounded then when all were for pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down, and Deſolation was called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
<hi>That they ſhould do well to let
the old Building ſtand till they had Materials
in readineſs, and were agreed upon a model
of a Fabrick to be ſet up in the ſtead of what
they deſtroyed.</hi> And not unlike was the
Gloſs of the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> upon the words of
the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Chap. 6. 16. <hi>Stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the wayes and inquire for the good way,</hi> &amp;c.
that is, ſaith he, <hi>Inquire for a better way,
but ſtand upon the old wayes till you have
diſcovered it.</hi> And agreeably Mr. <hi>Selden,
Accuratius circumſpiciendae viae omnes, de
ſemitis antiquis conſulendum, quae vero ſit
optima ſeligenda.</hi> And theſe ſayings are not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45558:93"/>
more valuable for their weight or elegancy,
nor for the reputation of their Authors, than
conſiderable in our caſe. We confeſs gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the old way of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
to be right for the main, but certain Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials
are uneaſie to ſome of us, and they,
till thoſe are redreſt, will proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But it's reaſonable then we ſhould be
able to agree upon and produce a better
Model, leſt inſtead of having a new Church,
we have no Church at all.</p>
               <p>For, Firſt, It can never be thought by wiſe
men that ſuch a Society as a Church, can be
conſerved without ſome Rites or other, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as no petty Corporation or Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
can; nor that God can be worſhipped
without all Circumſtance, at leaſt by men,
that have Bodies, and are bound <hi>to glorifie
him with their Bodies as well as Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is as plain, that neither any Society
can continue, or any publick Worſhip be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
if all Ceremonies and circumſtances,
ſuch as of time, place, perſons and the like,
be left indefinite and undetermined; for
who ſhall know whom to obey, whom to
hear, where to aſſemble, or where to meet, if
theſe be not defined?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:45558:94"/>
2. If therefore there muſt be ſome deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
in Circumſtantials, it muſt be made
either by God or Man; And whether God
hath made any ſuch determination in the
caſe we will now conſider; and the rather
becauſe this is made a popular Theme to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
upon againſt the Church, and <hi>jus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum</hi>
is boldly inſtamped upon thoſe Models
that have been deſigned to ſupplant it.</p>
               <p>Indeed in the Old Teſtament, ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the
Worſhip there to be performed, God was
very particular in his directions. And we
(blind as we are) may diſcern plain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for ſo doing; becauſe both the one and
the other, I mean the Temple and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to be performed thereat, were Myſtical
and Figurative, and deſigned by Typical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
to lead that people into ſome
apprehenſion of thoſe things that were not
then plainly revealed, but were afterwards to
be exhibited in the times of the Goſpel.
Now if it had been lawful for the <hi>Jews</hi> to
have innovated or made alterations in thoſe
things whereof they underſtood not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
they muſt of neceſſity have miſ-guided
themſelves, and God had loſt the principal
end of thoſe inſtitutions. For ſince (as I
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:45558:94"/>
ſaid) they had no ſufficient and clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the things typified, the change in the
Rites, (which people (ſo in the dark) were
likely to make,) muſt of neceſſity have led
them further beſide the mark God aimed at;
as a Copy the more removes it is from the
Original draught, is likely to have leſs of the
Life: and ſo the effect would have been, that
by thoſe alterations they would not have left
themſelves ſo much as the ſhadow to guide
them to the knowledge of the ſubſtance or
body.</p>
               <p>But in their Synagogue Worſhip it is very
obſervable, that they had no ſuch limits ſet
them, nor no ſuch punctual directions given
them by Divine Revelation, but were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Governed by Prudence and the general
reaſons of Religion; inſomuch that neither the
very building of Synagogues, nor any part of
the Worſhip there performed, had any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law concerning it, in all the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament:
nor indeed was it needful there
ſhould, here being nothing Symbolical (as
in the former) but natural Religion, which
the notions they had of God, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe of Mankind was ſufficient to guide
them in. Or at leaſt, if thoſe common Rules
ſhould fall ſhort in any reſpect, yet by
any error of that kind, they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45558:95"/>
themſelves of any farther advantage or
diſcovery God intended them, as in the
Temple worſhip they might.</p>
               <p>Now thus it is in the Goſpel; The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion being a plain, eaſie, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
and rational way of ſerving God, it
was not neceſſary that our Saviour or his
Apoſtles ſhould curiouſly order, or minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſcribe what Rites and Circumſtances
ſhould be uſed in it, but might ſafely enough
leave thoſe to prudence and expediency; the
general reaſon of ſo plain and natural a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
being ſufficient to ſecure the Church
againſt any capital miſtake. And therefore
he that reads the Goſpel without coloured
Spectacles, will find that our Saviour made
it his buſineſs to expound the Law, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
it from the corrupt gloſſes of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
to preſcribe men the Rules of true Holineſs
and Righteouſneſs, to raiſe them to a noble
and generous pitch, and ſet them an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Copy of the Divine Life, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
their endeavours after it, by revealing
and demonſtrating the Judgement to come,
and the rewards in another world; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
went about the compoſure of Laws either
of Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Policy. And for
his Apoſtles, they preached the Goſpel of
the Kingdom, and gave certain directions
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45558:95"/>
ſuited to the conditions of the times and
places and people reſpectively, but never
compoſed a ſtanding Ritual for all after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
which will be put beyond all diſpute
by this one Obſervation, That ſeveral things
inſtituted by the Apoſtles in the Primitive
Churches, and given in command in their
Sacred Writings, their Epiſtles, were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and ſo conſtrued to be obliging only ſo
long as circumſtances ſhould ſtand as then
they did, and no longer. Of this nature were
the <hi>Feaſts of Love, the Holy Kiſs, the Order
of Deaconeſſes;</hi> which things with ſeveral
other are no where, that I know of, now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
nor is any man ſcrupled about the
abrogation of them. Which is a plain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that the generality of Chriſtians
(where paſſion and prejudice do not miſ-guide
them) acknowledge it to have been no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of the Apoſtles to have ſtrictly obliged
men to a certain form of Rituals.</p>
               <p>But beſides all this, the Religion God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> was only fitted
to that people, and appropriate to that place
and Countrey, and intended to oblige no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
elſe. It was contrived on purpoſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
them from all other people in
the world, and therefore is called by the
Apoſtle <hi>the middle wall of partition,</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:45558:96"/>
Eph. 2. 14. And to the end that ſuch ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and diſtance might laſt, the boundaries
of their Rituals muſt be immoveable. But
the Chriſtian Religion was to throw down all
Incloſures, to unite all the world under one
Head, and make of all Nations one people,
and therefore muſt be left with that freedome
as to Circumſtantials, as that all Nations,
notwithſtanding their ſeveral Limits, divers
Cuſtoms and Forms of Government, might
be capable of receiving it. For as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
tells us, <hi>his Kingdom was not of this
world,</hi> ſo he never intended that his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhould alter the Bounds, or change the
Cuſtomes, or diſturb the Governments of
people; but only principle the hearts of men
with true holineſs and goodneſs, and ſo leave
them to their diſtinct Policies. And indeed
it was one of the ſingular advantages of the
Chriſtian Religion, and that which made it
fit to be the Catholick Religion (that is, of
all times, Countreys and people) That the
external Policy of it being undetermined, it
reconciled it ſelf to the condition and ſtate
of things where it came, as well as recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
it ſelf to the minds of men by its rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
and goodneſs. Hereto agrees
the known ſaying of <hi>Optatus Millevitanus,
Reſpublica non eſt in Eccleſia, ſed Eccleſia eſt
in Republica,</hi> That the Church being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45558:96"/>
in the Civil Society, conforms it ſelf
as to Externals, to that which contains it.</p>
               <p>Upon all which it is exceedingly evident,
That it is very unreaſonable to expect, that
every Ceremony made uſe of by Chriſtians
ſhould be found preſcribed in the Scripture
or proved thence, and therefore thoſe that
expect to find ſuch definitions in the New
Teſtament, do (as they do too often in
other caſes, as I have noted heretofore)
bring an Old Teſtament Spirit to the writings
of the New, and Jewiſh prejudices to the
Chriſtian Doctrine. And thoſe that can be
ſo fond as to perſwade themſelves they can
find ſuch preſcriptions there, it is hard to ſay
whether humour or weakneſs doth more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
it ſelf in ſuch pretence; for they catch
hold of ſuch weak twigs as no body would
do, but in deſperation of other help, and
they plead ſuch obſcure paſſages, as it is a
wonder if prejudice it ſelf can be contented
with them. And in ſhort, they can as
little agree amongſt <hi>themſelves</hi> either in the
proofs or the things to be proved, as they
do with <hi>us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. If then there muſt be ſome determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Circumſtance or no Society, and
God hath made no ſuch determination, what
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45558:97"/>
remains, but that men muſt? And then
who fitter than our Governours who beſt
underſtand the Civil Policy, and what will
ſuit therewith, and with the cuſtoms and
inclinations of the people under their
Charge? And when ſuch determination is
made, what ſhould hinder us from obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and conformity thereto, eſpecially when
the particulars ſo determined, (as they are
not enjoyned by Scripture, ſo) are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it, or forbidden by it?</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, Whoſoever ſhall go
about to diſturb a ſetled Order, concluded
on by good <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> men, reverenced and
admired by others, incorporated into the
Laws of the Land, rivetted by Cuſtome,
and that hath now given proof of it ſelf
by above an hundred years experience, for
the ſake of new and unpracticable Notions,
ſhall little conſult the real advantage of the
preſent Generation, and leſs their own repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
for diſcretion with Poſterity.</p>
               <p>This occaſion brings to my mind, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Story of <hi>Pacuvius Calavius</hi> of <hi>Capua:</hi>
The people were all in a rage againſt their
Senate; and would needs in a hurry have
them all depoſed, and have uſed other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
to their perſons. This wiſe Plebeian
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45558:97"/>
ſhuts up the Senators all together, and puts
a Guard upon them, and then coming to
the people, tells them, all was in their
power now, adviſes them to determine
their ſeveral faces according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits
one by one. This they very readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hearkened to. But as they paſt a Doom
upon any one, he approves the Sentence,
but before the execution perſwades them,
to bethink themſelves of another and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
man to be in his Room, ſince a Senate
they could not be without. But here the
buſineſs ſtuck, as he had foreſeen it would,
the people who agreed unanimouſly againſt
the old Senator, could by no means accord
who ſhould ſucceed, one named this perſon
and another that, but whoſoever was named
by one party, was rejected by another;
that in concluſion, as great a pique as they
had conceived againſt the old Senate, for
want of agreement in better men to fill their
places, they were conſtrained to continue
them in. I only make this application of
the Story, That it is eaſie and obvious to
find fault with things preſent, but not ſo to
find better for the future. And till that
can be done, 'tis neither juſt to call any
thing evil that is the beſt of its kind, nor
done like wiſe men, to quarrel with a Church
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45558:98"/>
for ſome infirmities which we know the
worſt of by long experience, leſt thereby
we come to have either none at all, or ſuch
an one as may give us cauſe ſadly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
our choice.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That God layes very little ſtreſs upon Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials
in Religion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO make that which we have hitherto
diſcourſed the more clear and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
and to eaſe the minds of men of their
ſcrupuloſities and ſuperſtitious fears, let it be
conſidered in the next place, That even then
when God Almighty did with the moſt pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuality
preſcribe the Ceremonies and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials
of Religion, he never laid ſuch
ſtreſs upon them, but that ſo long as the main
of Religion was provided for, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of his Inſtitutions obſerved, Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
might be and were made in thoſe leſſer
matters without his offence.</p>
               <p>And if this be made appear, it will tend
to beget in men better notions of God, and
better meaſures of Religion, as well as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe
them to Conformity to the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> For they will have no reaſon
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45558:99"/>
to think of God as a captious Deity that
watches advantages againſt his Creatures,
nor make Religion a piece of nice ſcrupulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and conſequently will neither <hi>ſwallow
Camels, nor ſtrain at Gnats,</hi> but ſerve God
with the generoſity of a free and a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
mind.</p>
               <p>Now to this purpoſe it will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful,
to take notice of a diſtinction men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by <hi>Maimonides,</hi> 
                  <q>That the <hi>Jews</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
ſome things in their Law to
be <hi>primae intentionis,</hi> and ſome things
<hi>ſecundae;</hi> That there were ſome things
God required for themſelves, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally
good, and that other things were
only required for the ſake of, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to, the former.</q> The firſt kind that
were <hi>eſſentially good,</hi> were alſo <hi>abſolutely
neceſſary,</hi> and never could be otherwiſe,
ſuch as we call <hi>moral Duties.</hi> The latter
kind were of ſo indifferent a nature, as that
not only they might <hi>not have been command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
but alſo having been commanded, they
may in ſome caſes <hi>not be a Duty;</hi> An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
whereof (though the <hi>Jews</hi> were a
great while before they underſtood it, and
ſoundly ſmarted for their Ignorance) is that
Maxim they have now generally received,
<hi>Periculum vitae diſſolvit Sabbatum.</hi> But
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45558:99"/>
the fulleſt inſtance of the kind, is that
which is remembred by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his
Book <hi>de jure Naturali Gentium, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 10.
<q>That in caſe of ſickneſs a <hi>Jew</hi> might not
only eat ſuch meats as were otherwiſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
but (ſay they) for the recovery
of his health, or avoidance of any great
danger, he might break any Precept, ſave
only thoſe Three great ones againſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Murder and Inceſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe things come not home to my
purpoſe, only I note them, to ſhew that that
ſuperſtitious people had ſome general notice,
that God did not ſo preciſely animadvert in
little matters, ſo the great were minded.</p>
               <p>That which I chooſe to inſiſt upon for the
evidencing of this Obſervation, is the <hi>Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi>
which was a great Sacrament inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by God himſelf upon weighty reaſons,
made a <hi>Statute for ever throughout their
generations, and the ſoul that obſerved it
not was to be cut off from among his people,</hi>
Exod. 12. And in the eleventh verſe of that
Chapter the moſt minute circumſtances are
defined, amongſt other that they <hi>ſhould eat
the Paſſeover with ſtaves in their hands,
ſhoos on their feet, and their loins girt;</hi> by
which expreſſions is plainly intimated (and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45558:100"/>
accordingly they underſtood and practiſed)
that they ſhould eat it in the poſture of
ſtanding.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs it is well known, that when
they were come into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to
ſetled habitations, they eat it ſitting or lying
according to the uſual cuſtome of feaſting in
thoſe Countreys. And this change continued
all along till the times of our Saviour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reproof from God, and our Saviour
himſelf conforms to them herein, and in
the ſame poſture eats the Paſſeover with his
Diſciples.</p>
               <p>Now this is the rather obſervable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
whenas the poſture enjoyned by God,
was ſymbolical of the haſte in which they
went out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> They in the change
aforeſaid inſtituted a Ceremony which was
ſymbolical too, but quite of another matter,
namely, of the reſt and peace God had now
given them in the good Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
And all this alteration made upon prudential
conſiderations, and the reaſon of the thing,
without any warrant from God for their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
or check for the change.</p>
               <p>Let us take another Inſtance; Though
God had ſo carefully deſcribed the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45558:100"/>
of the <hi>Temple-worſhip</hi> (as I have
ſhewed before, and the eſpecial reaſons of ſo
doing) yet we find <hi>David</hi> diſtributing the
Prieſts into Orders for the conveniency of
their Miniſtration, which might have been
called an Innovation in Religion: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, he inſtitutes inſtrumental Muſick
to be uſed in the Worſhip of God without
any Commiſſion from God (that appears).
And yet this novelty alſo was ſo far from
incurring any reprehenſion, that it was
thenceforward conſtantly retained and made
uſe of.</p>
               <p>I might for the fuller Evidence of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
obſerve, That though God had with
great ſolemnity inſtituted <hi>Sacrifices</hi> as the
means of propitiating his Divine Majeſty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſinful men, and had with great accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
preſcribed the Laws thereof, yet he puts
a great ſlight upon all of that nature, as a thing
he regarded not in compariſon with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
points of Virtue and Obedience. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
Pſal. 50. v. 8. <hi>I will not reprove
thee for thy ſacrifices,</hi> &amp;c. v. 14. <hi>Offer to
God the ſacrifices of righteouſneſs.</hi> As if
he had ſaid, Let me have theſe latter, and
I ſhall not much complain for defect of the
former. But eſpecially Micah 6. 7. <hi>Will the
Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams, or</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:45558:101"/>
                  <hi>ten thouſands of rivers of Oyl,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but he
hath ſhewed thee O man what is good, and
what doth the Lord thy God require of thee
but to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk
humbly with thy God.</hi> For a full explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all which and ſeveral other paſſages
of Scripture to the ſame purpoſe, that Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm
ſo frequently made uſe of by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
upon ſeveral occaſions will be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
<hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice.</hi>
Particularly <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. when the Phariſees
who were mighty curious of little things,
cenſured the Diſciples of our Lord for vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the Sabbath in their rubbing the Ears
of Corn as they went through the Fields and
were hungry on that day, our Saviour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
<hi>That</hi> David <hi>did alſo break one of the
Ceremonial Precepts in eating the Shewbread,</hi>
and v. 7. tells them, <hi>If they had known what
that meaneth, I will have mercy and not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
they would not have condemned the
innocent.</hi> Where though it be ſure enough,
that God did not repeal his Law of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
by enjoyning Mercy, yet it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
intimated, that God doth not only
preſer Moral acts before Ceremonial, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
doth make great allowances, limitations
and exceptions in the one caſe and not in the
other. For it is as if our Saviour had ſaid,
<hi>Had you Cenſorious Phariſees, underſtood ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45558:101"/>
God or Religion as ye might and ought
to have done, ye would have known that ſo
long as there is not contumacy and contempt
in the neglect of thoſe rituals, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
of a juſt neceſſity, or the rational conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of a greater good to preponderate
the omiſſion, God doth not impute it for
a ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if this was the caſe and condition
of things in the Old Teſtament, where God
ſeemed ſo punctual in his Preſcriptions, ſo
rigorous in his Animadverſions, and where
the danger of erring capitally from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of thoſe inſtitutions, by the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation
from the line of Divine Revelation,
was ſo great, as I have ſhewed before;
Then certainly in the New Teſtament,
where the Divine Wiſdom hath expreſt far
leſs concern for ſuch little points, may the
minds of men be ſecure from ſuch ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
fears.</p>
               <p>But I will give one Inſtance out of the
New Teſtament alſo. When Circumciſion was
aboliſhed (the diſtinction betwixt <hi>Jew</hi> and
<hi>Gentile</hi> being taken away) and all Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
become the children of <hi>Abraham</hi>) And
when the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> had vehemently
declaimed againſt the neceſſity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45558:102"/>
the danger of Circumciſion, as is
obvious to any one that reads his Epiſtles;
yet this ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 1. circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
<hi>Timothy,</hi> to the intent that thereby he
might render himſelf and his Miniſtry more
acceptable to the <hi>Jews.</hi> In which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of his he hath beyond all exception de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
to us, that all Ceremonial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages
are perfectly ſubordinate, and
ought to yield to the deſigns of Peace,
Charity and Edification, as the greater
good.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this Point with what the
Apoſtle concludes his Diſcourſe about eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or not eating of meats ſacrificed to
Idols, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. which created as much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
and ſcruple amongſt weak Chriſtians
then, as Ceremonies do now. <hi>V.</hi> 17. he
ſayes, <hi>The Kingdom of God,</hi> that is, the
Goſpel, <hi>is not meat and drink,</hi> that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
not or layes little ſtreſs upon thoſe nice
and perplexing matters, <hi>but in righteouſneſs,
peace and joy:</hi> all the weight is laid upon
the more ſubſtantial obſervances of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and holy life, and a peaceable ſpirit and
converſation. And adds a proof, v. 18. <hi>For
he that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of God and accepted of men.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Magiſtrate hath Authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
ſuch Externals of Religion as
are the matters of our diſputes, and what
deportment is due from Chriſtians towards
him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving ſhewed in the former Chapters,
That God hath neither made any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
definition of Religious Circumſtances,
nor is, very curious about them, further than
to ſecure the great things of Chriſtianity; It
follows, that then either thoſe leſſer muſt be
determined by men, or not at all. It will
therefore now be ſeaſonable to inquire what
Authority and Intereſt the Magiſtrate hath
in this affair.</p>
               <p>And although there want not thoſe that
Chameleon like live upon the air of vulgar
applauſe, and get themſelves a reputation
of extraordinary zeal by daring to cenſure
the actions, and aſperſe the perſons of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45558:103"/>
and with ſuch perſons, he that ſhall
vindicate the juſt Rights and Authority of
his Superiours, ſhall hardly eſcape the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of flattery and time-ſerving; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conſcious both of the truth and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of what I am to ſay, and of the
ſincerity of my intentions in ſo doing, I
will deliver my ſelf freely in theſe two
points.</p>
               <p>1. That the Magiſtrate exceeds not his
Commiſſion when he interpoſes for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the Circumſtantials of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>2. That common Prudence, Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Humility do all require of us to
preſume of the wiſdom and reaſonableneſs
of ſuch his determinations. The reſult of
which two things will be, that it is much
more our duty peaceably to comply with
and obey them.</p>
               <p>1. The former of theſe hath been ſo fully
and ſubſtantially proved by the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> in a juſt diſcourſe, and by a
late eminent Divine of this Church, that it
is enough to refer the Reader to them; yet
becauſe ſome perſon may perhaps read theſe
Papers, that will not take the pains, or hath
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45558:103"/>
not opportunity to read thoſe larger Diſcourſes
(that yet would better compenſate his labour)
I will therefore ſay theſe three things.</p>
               <p>1. It is certain, the Magiſtrate had once
a power in the Circumſtantials of Religion,
and that in the Old Teſtament. <hi>David</hi> (as
I have ſhewed before) altered ſome things
and inſtituted others even in the Temple-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
it ſelf. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> without a Scripture
for it, broke the brazen Serpent to pieces,
though it was a ſymbolical Ceremony of
Gods own inſtitution: but beſides this, he
cauſed the Paſſeover to be kept by all <hi>Judah</hi>
and <hi>Iſrael</hi> on the ſecond Moneth, though it
was not according to divine inſtitution, but
done by the advice of his Council upon pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and prudential conſiderations, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
30. 5. He appointed alſo the Levites to kill
the Paſſeover, <hi>v.</hi> 17. which by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
was to have been performed by
the people themſelves. And <hi>Chap. 29. v.</hi> 34.
he prefers the Levites to aſſiſt the Prieſts in
killing the other Sacrifices, which never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were admitted to.</p>
               <p>Many other inſtances might be brought
out of the Old Teſtament to this purpoſe,
but theſe ſufficiently make it appear, that
the beſt Princes did not think they exceeded
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45558:104"/>
their own bounds, or intrenched upon God,
when they prudently ordered ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
and they are ſo far from having any
blot laid upon their memories for theſe
things, that they are recorded to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
honour.</p>
               <p>Now ſince Magiſtrates had once ſuch a
power, how came they to loſe it, or be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
of it? Is it that God is more curious
and jealous of every punctilio in his Worſhip
now, than he was heretofore? That would
be the moſt abſurd ſuppoſition in the world,
as we have ſufficiently demonſtrated. And
he that without evident proof ſhall go about
to deny them what Chriſtianity found them
in poſſeſſion of, ſhall do very bad offices to
the Religion he pretends ſuch zeal for. For
it would be a ſmall encouragement to Princes
to entertain and countenance the Chriſtian
Religion, if it was told them, That the power
which God had allowed them in the Old
Teſtament, was now found too exorbitant,
and therefore he had retrencht it in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
Would it not mightily move Kings
and Princes to become <hi>nurſing Fathers</hi> to
the Church to hear this Doctrine preached
to them?</p>
               <p>2. The New Teſtament is frequent in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45558:104"/>
the power of Princes and Magiſtrates,
and requires all to be ſubject to them and
obey them of what quality or condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and no where excepts the caſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
therefore undoubtedly that is under
their power, (ſo far I mean as Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
and thoſe things that God himſelf hath
not defined) For when God hath made them
a general commiſſion and made no exception
of this kind, who ſhall put it upon them?
If they have not power in ſuch matters of
Religion as we ſpeak of, it's manifeſt they
have no Magiſtracy or Legiſlative power in
Religion at all. And then one would have
expected the Text ſhould not have run abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
and in general terms, <hi>Let every ſoul
be ſubject to the higher powers,</hi> but with
this limitation, in things Civil only; or at
leaſt that ſome other Scripture ſhould have
as plainly reſtrained them, as this and other
impowers them. Which ſince it is no where
done, we wrong both our ſelves and them,
to abridge them herein. Beſides that, when
our Saviour tells us, <hi>his Kingdom is not of
this world,</hi> he ſufficiently intimates, that it
was neither neceſſary that he ſhould, and
that conſequently he had no intention to alter
the forms of Government, or revoke the
Authority Governours were in poſſeſſion of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:45558:105"/>
3. It is generally acknowledged (and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
practiſed) that Fathers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of Families have authority in matters
of Religion within their own Families, at
leaſt ſo far as the caſe in hand. Who doubts
but the Father or Head of a Family may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
what Chapters ſhall be read, what
Prayers uſed, what Times ſhall be ſet apart
for Devotion, what Poſtures, whether kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or ſtanding, and being uncovered, who
ſhall officiate in his Family, and in what Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
with innumerable others of a like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
Do the children or ſervants uſe to
require of him an expreſs Scripture to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
his Commands, and to warrant their
Conformity, or elſe they will not obey?</p>
               <p>And if he in his private capacity and
narrow ſphere hath this Authority, with what
colour of Reaſon, or with what Modeſty, can
every private man deny his Prince what he
arrogates to himſelf? One would reaſonably
think, that as Civil Government aroſe out
of Paternal, it ſhould by inheritance chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
that Authority it was born to; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, as it hath a larger ſphere and a
greater concern, ſo it ſhould have due to it
proportionably a greater latitude of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:45558:105"/>
2. If the Magiſtrate may determine thoſe
matters, then not only Chriſtian Charity and
Humility, but alſo common Prudence require
us to preſume of the Wiſdom and Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
of his Determinations, and much more
to obey them.</p>
               <p>It is enough to warrant and require our
Obedience, that a thing is the command of
our Superiour, and not beyond the ſphere of
his Authority; but if he have not only Law
but Reaſon on his ſide too, then it is both a
ſin and a ſhame to diſobey. Now Humility
requiring that we think meanly and modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of our own Reaſons, Charity that we
judge favourably of anothers, and Prudence
that we think beſt of the Magiſtrates; all
theſe together make it our duty not only to
obey, but to do it with all chearfulneſs
imaginable.</p>
               <p>It is as great as it is a common miſtake,
to think Charity and Compaſſion only due
from Governours to their Inferiours in the
frame and compoſure of their Laws; for it
is alſo as due from Inferiours towards them,
and that they reciprocally make a fair and
candid interpretation of their Injunctions,
and that they indiſpoſe not themſelves nor
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:45558:106"/>
others to obedience by irreverent cenſures of
the abilities, and ſuſpicions and jealouſies of
the ends and intentions of the Law-makers.
It was a Saying of <hi>Greg. Nazianzen,</hi> well
worthy of ſo wiſe and peceable a man,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
That any man the more conſcious he is to
himſelf of his own honeſty and invincible
integrity, ſo much the leſs prone he is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
ſiniſter ſuſpicions of the intentions of
others. Chriſtian ſimplicity, as it means
no hurt, ſo it doth not eaſily ſuſpect any;
and humility and modeſty require, that men
think others intend as wiſely and as honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as themſelves. <hi>Charity,</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle)
<hi>hopeth all things, believeth all things,
beareth all things.</hi> But it is the Genius of
an evil man to ſuſpect every man means miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
becauſe he doth ſo himſelf: whereas
a good man ſuppoſes every man intends well
(at leaſt till the contrary appear) becauſe
conſulting his own breaſt he finds that he
doth ſo. For its natural for all men to take
meaſures by themſelves, nor is it more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
that men ſhould do as they would
be done unto, than it is common and uſual
for men to preſume that of others which
they are privy to in their own boſoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was an ingenious Repartee, that</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45558:106"/>
                  <hi>made to the Pagans in his</hi> Apology;
<hi>They accuſed</hi> the Chriſtians that in their
nocturnal aſſemblies, they took a little Child
and ſealed their confederacy by eating the
fleſh and drinking the blood of the harmleſs
Infant: <hi>But ſaith he,</hi> Since you only ſuſpect
and never ſaw this done, either you could do
ſuch a horrid thing your ſelves, and then
you are monſtrouſly unnatural; or you could
not, and then you are as unreaſonable to
ſuſpect that done by others, which you do not
think poſſible to be done by your ſelves.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more frequent than for
a ſilly man to ſuppoſe there are no other
nor better reaſons of things, than what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly
appear, becauſe if there be other or
better, he cannot reach them. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
a wiſe man, when the ſurface of things
is weak and mean, alwayes imagines there is
ſome better foundation at the bottom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he knows that he himſelf would not be
led by ſuch weak confiderations as thoſe are
that appear. If therefore we would approve
our ſelves either humble, or charitable, or
wiſe, or good, there is no better argument
to demonſtrate any of theſe by, than the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
we make upon the actions and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of others. And if any where it be of
importance to give ſuch a teſtimony of our
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:45558:107"/>
ſelves, and to proceed by ſuch meaſures, it
is in the caſe of the Magiſtrate, not only
for the common equity, but alſo upon the
account of the dignity of his place as Gods
Miniſter, and the uſefulneſs and neceſſity of
his Office and Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Is it fit, ſaith <hi>Elihu,</hi> Chap. 34. 18. <hi>to be
ſaid unto Princes, Ye are ungodly, or to Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
Ye are wicked?</hi> Is it tolerable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
our Governours Dolts and Ideots? to
ſuſpect they have no ſenſe of their duty, or
to reproach their Sanctions as Tyrannical,
Superſtitious or Antichriſtian? If I muſt put
the beſt conſtruction the caſe will bear, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Actions of my Equal or Inferiour,
will it become me to make the harſheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of publick Laws and the Actions
of my Superiours?</p>
               <p>It was an unhappy ſlip of a great and
worthy perſon, whoſe name I will conceal,
for the reverence I bear to his profeſſion
and worth, when reflecting upon the Statute
of the fifth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Jejunium Cecilianum,</hi> or the <hi>Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Faſt;</hi>
he calls it <hi>a Law and no Law, a
meer contradiction, a piece of nonſence. That
it muſt bind the Conſcience if it be a Law,
but the Law-makers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>declare it
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:45558:107"/>
ſhall not bind the Conſcience, and ſo it is no
Law:</hi> with a great deal more to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Now the words of the Statute are
theſe; it is declared penal, if any man ſhall
ſay, <hi>That this Faſt is injoyned upon any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
for the ſaving of the Soul or the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, otherwiſe than other political
Laws be.</hi> Had that excellent perſon read
and conſidered theſe words, they would have
afforded him no colour for the aforeſaid
imputation; for the Law-makers do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that this Law ſhall not bind the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
but the contrary, that it ſhall as
other Political Laws do: but they take care
that the end and reaſon of the Law may be
underſtood, which was not Religious but Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
(for the maintenance of the Wars)
I ſay that clauſe in the Statute had not the leaſt
intention of limiting or declaring the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Law, but only of preventing
rumours of ſuperſtitious deſigns in the end
and intentions of the Law-makers. Nor is
there any other the leaſt paſſage in the Law
that gives countenance to the reflections he
makes either upon the Law it ſelf or the Law-makers.
And I note it only for this end,
that we may obſerve how much more prone
men are to paſs cenſures, than to conſider to
the bottom, the true ſtate of the things we
paſs ſentence upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:45558:108"/>
But to let paſs that as a meer over-ſight,
it is intolerable to hear the immodeſt cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
that are raiſed upon meer miſtakes
and ſurmiſes. Men, it ſeems, think to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
themſelves as perſons both of more
than ordinary Sagacity and alſo of ſingular
purity of Conſcience by finding faults of this
kind. Whereas did they indeed conſider
either the divine Image born by Magiſtrates,
or the great conſequence of publick Peace,
and well weighed how much that depends
upon publick reputation and reverence, they
would certainly chooſe ſome other ſubject to
ſerve thoſe little ends by.</p>
               <p>The Scripture calls the Magiſtrates, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of reſtraint,</hi> Judges 18. 7. (See the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew)
and as ſuch they muſt needs be an
eye-ſore and grievance to all looſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
perſons, and conſequently it is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
to their wiſh, that Authority ſhould loſe
its force, and Laws their veneration, and
thereby the ſinews of all Society be looſened,
that ſo their Extravagancies may be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled,
and their Vices indemnified. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by how much it is the intereſt of all
evil men to have Magiſtracy and Laws in
contempt, by ſo much is it the wiſdom and
concern of all ſober and virtuous men to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45558:108"/>
ſtrengthen thoſe hands that others would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble,
and ſupport that reputation they
would infringe and violate. And thoſe that
conſider this, will not out of levity, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs
or raſhneſs, controll Laws, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
with Magiſtrates about ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
leſt they thereby render them unable to
protect them in their greater and more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
concerns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nos ipſius dei imperium in Imperatoribus
ſuſpicimus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the name of
the Chriſtians in his time. They then made
their interpretation of Authority and Laws in
favour of obedience and of the Governour;
they did not, as St. <hi>James</hi> expreſſes it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>being Doers of the Law, make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Judges of the Law,</hi> and Law-makers
too.</p>
               <p>Nor will it be either a fooliſh charity or
a blind obedience, to permit our ſelves to
the conduct of our Superiours in thoſe little
matters we diſcourſe of, ſince we have great
reaſon to perſwade our ſelves, that as thoſe
that ſtand higher than we, may ſee further,
ſo thoſe that are concerned for the whole may
give a better judgement, than thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
but a part. And that we our ſelves
may as eaſily lye under prejudice as they;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:45558:109"/>
and be as much tranſported with conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Eaſe and Liberty, as they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be ſuſpected to be with Ambition. For
why may not they have a reaſon for their
actions which either we cannot reach, or
are not come to the knowledge of? Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſince that may be beſt for the whole,
that is leſs commodious to us in particular;
and by being ſo, it is not made unlawful for
him (that hath the charge and overſight of
the whole) to command, nor warrantable
for us to diſobey. <hi>Nulla lex ſatis commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da
omnibus, id modò quaeritur ſi majori par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti
&amp; in ſummum prodeſt,</hi> ſaid <hi>Cato</hi> in
<hi>Livy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides (as I have intimated before)
There are no leſs different capacities of mind
than conſtitutions of body, and as great a
difference in mens outward circumſtances as
in either of the former; therefore neither
can the reaſons of Laws be equally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
nor the matter of Laws or the things
impoſed be equally eaſie and accommodate
to the practice of all men. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
thoſe that would have the Laws ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
fitted to their own humour, without
reſpect to other men, imitate the barbarous
cuſtome of the infamous <hi>Procruſtes,</hi> who is
ſaid to have either rackt all thoſe perſons
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:45558:109"/>
that fell into his hands, and ſtretcht them to his
own ſize if they were too ſhort, or cut them
off to his own proportion, if they were too
long: So theſe men would exerciſe the ſame
cruelty themſelves; which they forbid the
Magiſtrate, and lay down a principle of equal
ſeverity towards others, as of fondneſs and
indulgence to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Till we can reconcile the divers Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
(I ſay) of mind and body, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
humours and contrary Intereſts of all
men to one ſtandard, it will be impoſſible
that the wiſeſt Conſtitutions imaginable,
ſhould prevent all ſcruple, or be alike ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to all Parties. Either therefore
there muſt be no Laws made, which muſt
be the ruine of the whole, or one of the
Parties muſt be content upon the account of
publick good, that their private Intereſts or
Opinions be leſs complyed with: that is,
Since the Laws cannot be fitted to every
man, ſome men muſt fit and accommodate
themſelves to the Laws. And this being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
on, the only queſtion remaining will
be, on which of the Parties this ſhall fall;
that is, which ſhall bend to the Law. And
the deciſion of this will be very eaſie; for
though on the one ſide Self-love and favour to
our own Perſwaſion incline us to contend for
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:45558:110"/>
the caſe and incouragement of our own way,
yet Chriſtian Charity on the other ſide, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
as great a condeſcenſion to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
And if now the ſcales ſeem even,
then certainly the conſideration of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
and Laws in being will be of weight
enough to turn the balance, and that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Obedience our Religion teaches
will prevail with us to leave it to publick
Wiſdom to decide between both Parties.</p>
               <p>And then the reſult of all will be, that
inſtead of preſcribing to the Magiſtrate what
he ſhall determine, or diſputing what he
hath concluded on; we ſhall compoſe our
minds and order our circumſtances to the
more eaſie and cheerful complyance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein Chriſtian Liberty conſiſts; and that
it doth not diſcharge us from Obedience to
Laws.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALL that we have hitherto diſcourſed
of the Power of the Magiſtrate, ſome
think may be avoided by pleading the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Charta</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> contained in
the Goſpel. It will therefore be neceſſary in
the next place to conſider the true notion and
extent of that.</p>
               <p>That there is ſuch a Charter is out of
doubt, the New Teſtament frequently making
mention of it, putting of us in mind of
the <hi>gratitude</hi> we owe to him that purchaſed
it for us, of <hi>the price it coſt him,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
us to <hi>ſtand faſt in the liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Chriſt hath made us free,</hi> Gal. 5. 1.</p>
               <p>But what are the Contents of it, is not
ſo well agreed on; and indeed it is too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:45558:111"/>
that few of thoſe that contend ſo much
for it, and plead it upon all occaſions, know
what it is, or wherein it conſiſts. It was a
ſmart Anſwer of a <hi>Spartan</hi> Captive, who
being expoſed to ſale in the Market, and
there askt (as the manner was) by one that
came to buy Slaves, <hi>quid ſciret, what he was
good for, what buſineſs he underſtood: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
Scio quid ſit liberum eſſe, I know
what belongs to freedom.</hi> Had <hi>Chriſtian
Liberty</hi> been all along as well underſtood as
talked of, the Religion had obtained more
Reputation, the Church more Peace, States
and Kingdoms more Security, and more Souls
had gone to Heaven: but for want of this,
men have committed as groſs errors as that
<hi>Tully</hi> complains of <hi>Clodius</hi> for, That he ſet
up <hi>Simulacrum Meretricis Tanagraeae, The
Image of a famous Harlot for that of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> about the Apoſtles times
pleaded <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> both on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of their cowardly Revolts from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
in times of Perſecutition, and of
their ſenſual Debaucheries: as if the
knowledge of the Truth gave a priviledge
neither to profeſs nor practiſe it, when
either the one proved too incommodious
to their Secular Intereſts, or the other
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:45558:111"/>
too diſguſtful to their ſenſual inclinations.</p>
               <p>Others, and they alſo in the firſt times of
Chriſtianity, thought Chriſtian Liberty had
been a Civil Infranchiſement, and had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
ſo far as to cancell all bonds of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
ſubjection to their Princes, or of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to their Maſters; and hereupon like
the pretence of zeal amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> (in
their degenerate times) Chriſtian Liberty
was the Paſsport of fugitive ſervants, and
the pretext for Outrages and Rebellions.
And this made it neceſſary for the Apoſtles
almoſt in all their Writings to preſs Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Superiours.</p>
               <p>A third ſort of men have miſtaken this
Goſpel Liberty to be a diſcharge from the
obligation of the Moral Law, and have been
ſo prodigiouſly abſurd as to take the Goſpel
to contain nothing elſe properly, but a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of Gods Promiſes or Decrees ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to require only a bare aſſent to
them or belief of them, and that thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
are abſolute and without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of our obedience, ſave only as that
ſhould reciprocally become us by way of
gratitude, not that juſtification or ſalvation
depended upon it. This is the Doctrine of
the <hi>Antinomians</hi> or modern Libertines, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45558:112"/>
is a perſwaſion fit to debauch the whole
world, were it not that few men can be ſo
unreaſonable as to believe it, though they
would. But it is ſo contrary to the very
name and nature of a Covenant, which the
Goſpel is ſtyled to be, ſo expreſly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the whole deſign of Chriſtian Doctrine,
and goes ſo croſs to the very ſenſe of every
honeſt mind, that I ſhall not ſpend any more
time or words about it.</p>
               <p>There is a fourth miſtake, which (though I
will not ſay it is equally dangerous with
any of the former, yet) is miſchievous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
and equally falſe. That though the
bonds of Civil Subjection are not quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by the Goſpel, yet that all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are diſcharged from the interpoſitions of
the Magiſtrate in affairs of Religion, and that
there he ought no further to intermeddle,
than he can produce expreſs warrant from
Scripture for his particular Injunctions. But
if notwithſtanding the Governour ſhall arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
to himſelf a larger ſphere of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and make any definitions in Religion, or
eſpecially the matters of the firſt Table, It
is then and in that caſe not only lawful for
a good Chriſtian to refuſe Obedience, but
that it is his duty ſo to do, to withſtand an
Invaſion of his Chriſtian Liberty, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45558:112"/>
an incorachment upon the Prerogative of
God.</p>
               <p>This is the miſtake that is moſt rife
amongſt us, and which hath given occaſion
to much of the unhappineſs of this Age. It
is not my work laboriouſly to confute this
opinion, nor do I think many words neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the caſe, yet of the many abſurd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
let us note theſe following.</p>
               <p>1. This opinion makes all Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the moſt tickliſh and uncertain, and
the condition of Magiſtrates the moſt ſervile
and precarious, that can well be imagined;
foraſmuch as there is ſcarcely any thing can
fall under their care and cognizance, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to be made matter of Law or Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but hath ſuch affinity to, or connexion
with Religion, as to be ſufficient (upon
this principle) to raiſe a diſpute of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>So that the caſe between the Civil Laws
and Religion will be like the condition of
affairs that often happens in thoſe places
where the Supremacy of the Pope and Court
of <hi>Rome</hi> is received, there is a perpetual
contention about bounds and limits of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
between the Civil and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:45558:113"/>
Courts; for whileſt the Civil Judge goes
about to take cognizance of the cauſe, the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
will (it may be) challenge the
perſon as belonging to his Juriſdiction: or
if the perſon be Laick and <hi>alieni fort,</hi> yet it
will go hard but the cauſe ſhall be found
to have ſome connexion with Religion, and
ſo the Eccleſiaſtical Court either directly
or <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia</hi> draws all matters
to it.</p>
               <p>And not unlike was the ſtate of affairs a
long while together in the Kingdom and
Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> by virtue of this very
perſwaſion: The Prince or the State could
enact nothing almoſt but the <hi>Kirk-men</hi> found
themſelves grieved and Religion concerned,
and Excommunication is denounced: The
<hi>Kirk</hi> on the other ſide make their Decrees,
and the Civil Power declares them null, and
grants Prohibitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He that will ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
himſelf of the truth of theſe things and
thereby convince himſelf of the miſchief of
the Principle we are ſpeaking of, let him
read the Judicious Hiſtory of the Church of
<hi>Scotland</hi> written by the Moſt Reverend Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Biſhop
<hi>Spot ſwood:</hi> And he ſhall find that this
unhappy notion raiſed and maintained for
many years a <hi>bellum limitaneum,</hi> and that
it is like the Marches or bateable ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45558:113"/>
two bordering Potentates, a Scene of
contention and a field of blood. Whereas
did we agree of certain Limits, and make
the Magiſtrates Power and Province extend
to all that which God hath not taken in by
expreſs Law, both Gods Glory and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
Authority would be kept entire,
and there would be neither cauſe nor room
for Controverſie.</p>
               <p>2. This opinion at once condemns all the
States and Kingdoms in the whole world of
Impiety and Irreligion, foraſmuch as there
neither is, nor ever hath been any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
as hath not had ſome Laws of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that could not be deduced particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Scriptures. And ſo he that
is of this perſwaſion and will be true to it,
is bound in Conſcience to be a Rebel where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he lives.</p>
               <p>3. It is an unreaſonable Fear, a meer
Melancholy Jealouſie, and expreſs Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
inſtead of Religion, to ſuſpect that either
the Magiſtrate can offend in making, or the
people in obeying ſuch Laws as (though they
are not expreſly warranted, yet) are no
where forbidden by the Scripture. For it is
a ſuppoſition that a man may be a Sinner,
when yet he breaks no Law, contrary to the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:45558:114"/>
expreſs words of St. <hi>John, 1 Ep.</hi> 3. 4. who
defineth Sin to be <hi>a tranſgreſſion of a Law.</hi>
And as is the uſual Genius of all Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it miſ-repreſents God as cruel and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical,
that can condemn men <hi>ex poſt ſacto,</hi>
for doing of that againſt which there was no
Law in being. But,</p>
               <p>4. Which is moſt obſervable, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
inſtead of aſſerting Chriſtian Liberty,
in truth ſubverts it, and layes far more ſevere
bonds upon the Conſciences of men than the
very Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> did. That was a yoke
(ſay the Apoſtles, Acts 15. 10.) <hi>which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we nor our Fathers were able to bear,</hi>
upon this account, eſpecially, becauſe it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
a great number of little Obſervances,
which by their multitude were hard to be
remembred, by their nicety difficult to be
obſerved, and by their meer poſitive nature,
and having no eſſential goodneſs in themſelves,
had leſs power upon the Conſciences of men
to awaken their care and diligence about
them. It is manifeſt that Law contained no
precept that was in it ſelf impoſſible to be
performed, but becauſe it is hard for the
mind of man to attend to many things at
once, eſpecially if alſo the things in which
his care and obedience is required be ſuch,
as are not enacted in his Conſcience, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:45558:114"/>
when he can ſee no other reaſon of, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by his obedience, but meerly his
obedience, therefore was that Law called im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.
Now if a man were bound by the
Goſpel to avoid all thoſe particulars that
were commanded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is plain, the
ſervitude and the difficulty would be the
ſame; but if not only ſo, but he be alſo
bound to avoid all that which the Scripture
is ſilent in, his obligation is infinite, and
his ſervitude intolerable. For Poſitives are
determinate and definite, and ſo fall more
eaſily within our care and attention: but
Negatives are infinite, and therefore ſuch a
yoke muſt be properly impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Theſe miſtakes therefore being removed,
The true Notion of Chriſtian Liberty will
beſt be underſtood, if we conſider, That in
the times of the Old Teſtament, the viſible
Church of God was incloſed within a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
pale, and none could be members of it,
without ſubmiſſion to Circumſciſion and the
other Rites of <hi>Judaiſm.</hi> Whence it came
to paſs, that at the firſt publication of the
Goſpel, it was a riddle and an aſtoniſhment
to the very Apoſtles themſelves, that the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> were to be taken into it. And
when the effecting this was taken in hand,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15. 1. the Jewiſh Chriſtians ſtood upon
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:45558:115"/>
their priviledge, and would not admit the
<hi>Gentile</hi> Converts into Society, nor become of
one body with them, unleſs they would <hi>be
circumciſed and keep the Law.</hi> Hereupon
a Council is called, and there the Apoſtles
find out a temper and middle way for both
parts to meet in for the preſent, which was
that the <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts ſhould ſubmit to
the terms of Proſelytiſm at large or the
precepts given to the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> as
ſome underſtand the paſſage, or (as is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable)
that they ſhould comply with the
<hi>Jews</hi> in theſe three things, <hi>of abſtaining
from fornication, from things ſtrangled, and
from blood.</hi> And on the other ſide, the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Converts ſhould abate of their rigor,
and not require of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> the ſtrict terms
of compleat <hi>Judaiſm.</hi> At which deciſion
the <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtians were tranſported with
Joy, <hi>rejoyced at the conſolation,</hi> v. 31.</p>
               <p>For (as I ſaid) till then, none could be
of the ſame body with the <hi>Jews</hi> in reſpect of
viſible Church Society, without Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and univerſal ſubmiſſion to the Law of
<hi>Moſes.</hi> This therefore was an expedient for
the preſent, till the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
better inſtructed in the liberty of that
Chriſtian Religion they had lately received.
But when the Goſpel was fully publiſhed,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:45558:115"/>
then the aforeſaid Incloſure is laid open, and
all Nations invited into the Society of the
Church upon equal terms, neither party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bound to thoſe nice Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor
any other but thoſe plain and reaſonable ones
contained in the Goſpel, and ſuch other
(not contradictory to them) as publick Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Peace and Charity ſhould dictate and
recommend.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe is the obſervation of
<hi>Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>Praepaeratio Evangelica,</hi> 
                  <q>That
Chriſtianity is nothing elſe but the old
Patriarchal Religion revived, a reſtitution
of that Primitive ſimplicity and liberty
that was before the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
that now there lyes no more bonds upon
the Conſciences of Chriſtians, than did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Antient Patriarchs, ſaving thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
our Saviour hath made upon
the Law of Nature, and thoſe few poſitive
Inſtitutions of his expreſly ſet down in
the Goſpel. And that men obeying theſe
are at liberty to conform to whatſoever
common Reaſon and equity, or publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
ſhall impoſe.</q> And this diſcourſe
of <hi>Euſebius</hi> is in effect the ſame with that
of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>v.</hi> 19. where he puts this queſtion, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
then ſerved the Law?</hi> he anſwers, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:45558:116"/>
                  <hi>it was added, &amp;c.</hi> it was a kind of <hi>interim,</hi>
or like a <hi>parentheſis,</hi> which when it ſhall be
left out, the former and latter parts joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
again, without any interruption of
the ſence. That is, when this <hi>interim</hi> or
temporary proviſion of the Law ſhall be taken
away, the Primitive Patriarchal Religion and
that brought in by our Saviour ſhall ſeem to
be of one piece, the latter beginning where
the former ended.</p>
               <p>The Contents then of the great Charter
purchaſed for us, and brought in by our
Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> are theſe; That beſide the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of us from the power and dominion of
ſin, which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> could not do,
and from the Tyranny of Sathan which the
<hi>Gentile</hi> world lay under till Chriſt came; I
ſay, beſides theſe (which are no matters of
our preſent diſpute) our Chriſtian Infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement
diſcharges us not only from a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of obſerving the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law and
Rites of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> but further and eſpecially
ſets our Conſciences at Liberty to purſue our
own Reaſon, and to obey any Laws of men
that ſhall not contradict the expreſs Laws of
the Goſpel. That we are as perfectly free
as thoſe were that lived before any Scripture
was written, as to all thoſe things that are
not determined in thoſe Scriptures; and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45558:116"/>
that within all that ſphere we may without
guilt or burden upon our Conſciences, ſerve
all the intereſts of peace and order in the
world. And conſequently, that neither the
Magiſtrate need to fetch a particular war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
from the Scripture to authorize his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
nor we an expreſs licence thence
to legitimate our reſpective obedience; but
the former may freely conſult his own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
common prudence and the intereſt of
his Government, and the latter their own
peace and tranquillity.</p>
               <p>This is true and real Freedom, when with
a good and a quiet Conſcience we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our ſelves to the Wiſdom of our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
and the intereſts of Society; when
I have a power <hi>in utramque,</hi> and may do
or leave undone all thoſe matters that are
not defined in Scripture, according as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Laws and the ends of all Society ſhall
require.</p>
               <p>And that this is the true notion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Liberty will appear further by this,
That the Apoſtle in ſeveral of his Epiſtles,
but eſpecially that to the <hi>Romans,</hi> injoyns
the Chriſtians in their ſcruples about Eating
or not Eating of certain Meats, and in the
conduct of themſelves in all ſuch matters,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45558:117"/>
to <hi>conſult charity towards their weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the peace of the Church, and their own
edification;</hi> that is, ſuch principles of reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſcruples as before I deſcribed, and bids
them not to apply themſelves to any Scripture,
or to expect a determination of ſuch queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thence. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 3, 5, 13, 14, 15,
19. and <hi>chap. 15. v. 2, &amp;c.</hi> From whence
theſe two things follow.</p>
               <p>1. That Chriſtian Liberty doth conſiſt in
a freedom <hi>in utramque,</hi> that is, that ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently
to the conſiderations of Prudence,
Peace and Charity, it is equally in the
power of a Chriſtian to do or not do any or
all thoſe things that are not expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the holy Scriptures: and that where
the Scripture is ſilent the Conſcience is free
in the general, and only to be determined
by thoſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p>2. That it is no infringement, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of this liberty, actually to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to that ſide towards which Prudence
or Charity ſhall incline, though in the
mean time the other ſide be in the general as
lawful as that. Hence it is that we find li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and condeſcenſion or ſelf-denyal joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 5. 13. <hi>Ye have
been called unto liberty, only uſe not liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:45558:117"/>
as an occaſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve
one another;</hi> and by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Ep. 2. 16.
<hi>As free, yet not uſing your liberty as a cloke
of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of God.</hi>
Which two places are ſo clear in themſelves,
as no Commentary can make them more ſo,
and ſo full to our purpoſe, that nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can reaſonably be deſired.</p>
               <p>And ſo theſe two points thus gained, will
give abundant foundation for a third to be
inferred from them, <hi>viz.</hi> That whatſoever
is ſo free to me that I may do it or not do it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as I ſhall be inclined by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of Brotherly Charity and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
muſt of neceſſity be alſo as free to me
to obey the Magiſtrate and ſerve publick
Peace and Order in, without either proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of my Liberty, or violation of Gods
right and Prerogative. For whatſoever I
may do in compaſſion to my Brothers infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
ſurely that I may much more do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
to Gods Ordinance, the Lawful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate;
which is the point we have all this
while drove at.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of a Tender Conſcience, what it is, and its
Priviledges.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF pleading our Charter of Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
will not give us a diſcharge from
Obedience to our Superiours, whether in
things Sacred or Civil, as I have proved it
cannot, yet poſſibly the plea of a <hi>Tender
Conſcience</hi> may.</p>
               <p>This is thought to have not only a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
but a kind of Prerogative, to carry
with it an exemption from all humane Laws
whatſoever, but eſpecially Eccleſiaſtical. It
pretends to be Gods <hi>peculiar,</hi> and <hi>exempt</hi>
from any inferiour cognizance, like the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick
Orders in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
are immediately and only ſubject to the Pope,
ſo this to Gods Tribunal and none elſe:
Nay, it looks like a Dictatorian Authority,
and ſeem to be <hi>legibus ſoluta.</hi> This (they
would make us believe) can limit the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45558:118"/>
null Laws, forbid execution, and
which is yet more, change the very nature
of things, and make that good and holy
which was wicked and rebellious before.
This can canonize any Opinion, legitimate
any action, warrant any extravagancy in the
perſon that owns it. The man of a Tender
Conſcience may paſs all guards; all mounds
and barrs that are ſet to confine others, muſt
be open to him. <hi>He is a righteous man,
and for him there is no Law,</hi> no controll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
no puniſhment. The Tenderneſs of
his Conſcience is an inviolable Sanctuary,
and he that meddles with ſuch a man, is a
<hi>fighter againſt God.</hi> Make uſe of the beſt
arguments to convince him, diſcourſe to him
with the greateſt evidence, he is not bound
to hear you, his Conſcience is his Prieſt, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
and King too, he hangs and draws and
all within himſelf (as we ſay;) whatſoever
he <hi>thinks</hi> can be no hereſie, and whatſover he
<hi>does</hi> can be no ſin.</p>
               <p>Unleſs therefore we can pull down this
Uſurper, we muſt look for no Magiſtracy,
and except we diſcover the weakneſs and
abſurdity of this pretenſion, all endeavours
of reſtoring Uniformity in the Church will
be vain and uſeleſs. Let us 1. Therefore
conſider what <hi>Conſcience</hi> is in general, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:45558:119"/>
then we ſhall better come to underſtand the
grounds and ſtrength of this mighty pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
2. What a <hi>tender</hi> Conſcience is; 3. What
<hi>priviledges</hi> or <hi>exemptions</hi> it may lay claim
to.</p>
               <p>1. What <hi>Conſcience</hi> is. And indeed the
original of the miſtake in this matter ſeems
to lye here; ſome have given ſuch pompous
and Romantick deſcriptions of Conſcience,
that they have beguiled men into an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
that it is far a Mightier Potentate
than indeed it is. I have read of a vulgar
perſon, who firſt having heard himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
to the Prince for ſtature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
and afterwards heightned up into
the conceit by the flatteries of ſome and arts
of others that had ends to ſerve by him,
came at laſt to conceit himſelf to be the
Prince indeed, and gave ſufficient trouble to
the King in poſſeſſion. Men have ſpoken ſo
magnificently of Conſcience, that divers
have grown into a belief, that it was ſome
Ghoſt or Spirit, and little thought it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their own inconſiderable ſelves.</p>
               <p>It is called a <hi>Tutelar Genius, a Familiar,
a Domeſtick Deity, a God within men,</hi> and at
leaſt Gods Vicegerent inthroned in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms.
Now under theſe diſguiſes men have
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:45558:119"/>
been ready to fall down and worſhip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and like the Pagans, have given Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
honours to their own Paſſions; but the
leaſt that could follow from ſuch premiſes,
was that the Magiſtrate muſt ſtrike ſail to
this admired Numen. Hence probably Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm
took its riſe, the men of which way
are generally a ſtubborn and incurable gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
Bring Scripture or Reaſon or any
Authority againſt them, they ſlight all, and
only appeal to the light within them, that
mighty Deity, that internal Chriſt, their
Conſcience. Hence alſo it's probable, that
miſchievous principle aroſe, That it is lawful
to do Evil that Good may come of it, in ſpite
of the Apoſtle: And it is believed that for a
good cauſe, and under a good intention (that
is, the perſwaſion of our Conſcience, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if Providence alſo ſmile upon our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings,
and incourage us with hopes of
ſucceſs,) that it is lawful for any man of
what quality ſoever to ſet up for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and turn the world upſide down. Nay;
ſo far have ſome been bewildred by theſe
cloudy and miſty deſcriptions, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Humour hath been predominant in their
Bodies, whatever Paſſion of their Mind, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Prejudice of Education, or Intereſt, or
Profit, all this hath paſt for Conſcience, and
under that name been uncontrollable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:45558:120"/>
But now if ſuch men would conſider, and
loved plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to underſtand what
they ſay, Conſcience is neither God, nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
nor Spirit, nor any thing that will bear
all that weight is thus laid upon it. But
is plainly this and no more; namely, <hi>It is
a mans own mind or underſtanding under
the diſtinct conſideration of reflecting upon
himſelf, his own actions and duty.</hi> When
we take notice of things that do not concern
us morally, then this notice is called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
only, or mind, or opinion, or
ſcience, or ſome ſuch name; but when we
conſider whether a thing be good or evil
morally, lawful or unlawful, that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be agreeable to ſuch a rule of action
or ſuitable to the end of eternal happineſs,
then we call this notice or reflection of our
mind, Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Now when we ſpeak thus plainly, a great
part of the aforeſaid Legendary conceits va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh;
for ſcarcely any man that ſayes his
Conſcience is incontrollable, will ſay his
own opinion or Reaſon is the ultimate rule
of his actions: but will confeſs he may as
a man err and be miſtaken, and therefore
hath need of a Guid, or ſome Law or light
to direct him. Therefore it is plain, that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:45558:120"/>
men deceive themſelves with Metaphors, with
words and phraſes.</p>
               <p>Some man perhaps will ſay, That allowing
Conſcience to be nothing but the Mind of
man as aforeſaid, yet even ſo it is ſubject to
no humane Laws, foraſmuch as no man can
force me to think otherwiſe than I do, nor
compell me to be of his opinion in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſence of my mind: My Mind therefore
or Conſcience is only obnoxious to God.</p>
               <p>But the anſwer to this is eaſie, That
though it be true, that neither men can
know my thoughts, nor put any conſtraint
upon the free actings of my Mind; yet for
all this, ſince my Mind is not infallible, I
may and muſt needs have ſomething to guide
my mind, in its judgement and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that is it which we call <hi>Law;</hi> and
though this cannot force me to follow its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
yet it morally obliges me, that is, it
will be my ſin if I do not. In ſhort; The
moſt that Mind or Conſcience can pretend to,
is to be a Judge, yet is it but ſuch a Judge
as is ſubject to the Laws, and they muſt guide
it, as that guides the man, or otherwiſe its
petty Soveraignty that it pretends to, will not
ſecure it from the wrath of the great Soveraign
of the world, by whom Kings reign.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:45558:121"/>
But if it be further objected, That we are
notwithſtanding bound to obey the dictates
of our Mind or Conſcience before any Law
or command of any humane Authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
if they happen to interfere.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is true in things notoriouſly
and plainly evil, and the reaſon is, (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
my Mind or Conſcience ſuperſedes the
Law of the Magiſtrate, but) becauſe ſome
higher Law of God or Reaſon by which my
Conſcience is guided, hath in that caſe made
a nullity in the Law of the Magiſtrate; for
if my Conſcience have not the direction and
warranty of ſuch ſuperiour Law, the meer
Opinion of my Mind or Conſcience will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
me no ſecurity, for where thoſe are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
there the Law of the Magiſtrate is the
immediate Rule of my Conſcience; and then
to oppoſe or contradict that, is to affront the
publick Tribunal with a private Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and to ſet my own Opinion againſt Gods
Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>If yet it be further urged, That if after
all my conſideration of the reaſon of publick
Laws, I cannot ſatisfie my ſelf of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the thing commanded, I muſt then
govern my ſelf by my Conſcience, and not by
the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:45558:121"/>
I reply, That if the unlawfulneſs of the
thing commanded is not as plain and viſible,
as the Command of God for obeying Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is, my Opinion or Conſcience will be no
excuſe to me, becauſe I forſake a certain
Rule to follow an uncertain.</p>
               <p>But if after all endeavours of ſatisfying
my ſelf to obey the humane Law, yet the
thing commanded by the Magiſtrate (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
innocent it may be in it ſelf) ſeems to
me as plainly unlawful, as obedience is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a duty, I ſay this caſe is pittyable, and
will make ſome abatement of the ſin of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
but doth not totally excuſe it,
much leſs make a nullity of the Law. It
cannot make the Law null; for that depends
upon its own Reaſonableneſs and the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
enacting it, and not upon the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men. Nor can it totally excuſe from
ſin, <hi>for ſin is the tranſgreſſion of a Law,</hi>
according to the definition of the Apoſtle.
All therefore that can be allowed in the caſe
is, That by reaſon of ſuch a mans unhappy
circumſtances, his diſobedience will then be
only a ſin of infirmity, which is pittyable
amongſt men upon conſideration of common
humanity, and is pardonable with God as
other errors are upon a general repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:45558:122"/>
2. Now let us proceed to conſider what
a <hi>Tender</hi> Conſcience is, and how that will
alter the caſe.</p>
               <p>And it is no more eaſie to find out what
men mean by Tenderneſs, than what they
meant by Conſcience. Doubtleſs when men
ſpeak of a Tender Conſcience, they do not
mean ſuch an one as will endure no check or
reſtraint, that like an unbroken Horſe will
admit of no rein of Government: nor yet a
nice and phantaſtical Conſcience, that can
brook nothing contrary to its own humour.
Theſe at the firſt view are plainly vitious and
moſt of all need and deſerve the reſtraint of
Laws, and to be inured to that they ſo ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly
decline.</p>
               <p>Nor yet on the other ſide, can Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
be taken in the ſame latitude with a
Good Conſcience. Every good man hath
ſuch a tenderneſs as to be afraid of ſin, and
to decline the occaſions and temptations to
it; and it would be too arrogant and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
for thoſe that plead the tenderneſs
of their Conſciences, to ſuppoſe themſelves
the only men that make Conſcience of what
they do; for then the contrary to a tender
Conſcience muſt be a brawny and obdurate
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:45558:122"/>
or ſtupid Conſcience: which it would be too
contumelious to reproach all other men but
themſelves with.</p>
               <p>It remains then, That that which is meant
by Tenderneſs, is ſomething betwixt theſe
two; namely, neither a ſteady well inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
nor yet a ſturdy and rebellious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
but a weak, unſetled and timorous
one. And now having before reſolved
Conſcience in general to be nothing but the
Mind or practical Underſtanding, a Tender
Conſcience will be nothing but either an
ignorant or uninſtructed Mind, or a ſickly,
melancholy and ſuperſtitious Underſtanding.
And then to ſpeak plainly, A man of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Conſcience is ſuch a perſon, as being
right and honeſt for the main, yet either
through the weakneſs of his Intellectuals or
prejudices of his Education, or through the
melancholy of his Conſtitution, doth not
rightly underſtand his duty, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is apt to doubt and ſcruple and fear where
no fear is; and by this miſtake (from the
cauſes aforeſaid) renders thoſe things evil to
himſelf that are not ſo in themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now this being ſo, that a Tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is this and no more, a man will juſtly
wonder whence it ſhould come to paſs, that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:45558:123"/>
either the pretence of ſuch a Conſcience
ſhould be a matter of ambition as we ſee it
is with ſome, and much more that it ſhould
be thought fit to give Laws to the world as
it ſeems to be the mind of others.</p>
               <p>However we grant it pittyable, but before
we ſhew what priviledges it may claim, we
will a little unfold more particularly the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
it muſt have to be able to ſue out
its priviledges. And in general I have ſaid
already, That ſuch a perſon muſt be right and
ſincerely honeſt for the main. Now of that
he that pleads tender Conſcience, muſt give
proof in theſe following Inſtances.</p>
               <p>1. He that pleads for Compaſſion upon the
account of his Weakneſs, muſt be ſo inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
as willingly to ſubmit himſelf to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
for he that ſcorns it, and thinks
himſelf wiſer than all the world beſides, of
all men hath the leaſt right to make this
plea. I do not ſee how he that hath the
confidence to be a Preacher to others, or a
Diſputer for opinions, can pretend to the
priviledges of that Tenderneſs we ſpeak of.
For either a man owns himſelf an ignorant
or a knowing man; if he be an ignorant
man, he ought not to take upon him to
teach others, but to learn; if he be a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:45558:123"/>
knowing man, he ought not to ſcruple, but
to obey.</p>
               <p>2. He that pretends Tenderneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
muſt make good his claim by being
uniformly conſcientious; that is, making as
much Conſcience in other things, as that he
pleads exemption from. Otherwiſe it will
be but Phariſaiſm, <hi>to ſtrain at a Gnat and
ſwallow a Camel. Davids heart ſmote him
when he cut off the skirt of</hi> Saul<hi>'s Garment,</hi>
but it would never have been called Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
of Conſcience in <hi>David,</hi> if at another
time he ſhould have attempted the life of
<hi>Saul.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of ſome that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to themſelves ſtricter limits of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
than the Laws did, <hi>per Mores non
fiebat quod per Leges licebat, &amp; factum hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebatur
licitum, ob vicinitatem illiciti.</hi> But
then, they were ſeverly holy men in all their
converſation, otherwiſe this would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
no better eſteem than Superſtition in
them or worſe. He that ſhall ſcruple a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
and neglects an Inſtitution of Chriſt,
that dares not kneel at the Sacrament, but
dares neglect the Communion, that ſcruples
the obſervation of <hi>Lent,</hi> but ſcruples not
Senſuality or Luſt, Drunkenneſs or Gluttony,
that is afraid to <hi>eat</hi> blood, but not afraid to
<hi>ſhed</hi> the blood of men, that will abſtain
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:45558:124"/>
from things ſtrangled, but not from fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Let ſuch a man pretend what he will,
he neither hath nor can plead the priviledges
of a Tender Conſcience.</p>
               <p>3. He that is truly tender, if he cannot do
all that he is commanded, will yet do all that
he can. He will not make the breach wider,
nor the diſtance greater than needs muſt,
leſt he ſhould betray more of humour and
ſtomach than Conſcience. He that cannot
bow at the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> yet perhaps can
ſtand up at the Creed; or if not that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet probably he can be preſent at it.
He that cannot kneel when he is required,
may expreſs ſo much reverence as to ſtand;
And he that is not ſatisfied in all the parts
of the publick Prayers, may poſſibly be
able to come to Church; or if none of theſe,
yet at leaſt</p>
               <p>4. He that cannot perform what the Laws
require of him, may forbear judging and
cenſuring thoſe that do. His Conſcience is
a rule to himſelf, but doth not oblige him
to paſs ſevere Cenſures upon all other men.
It is a very proud Conſcience that will tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
its own Province, and preſcribe to all
the world beſides. If he be weak and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
it is very unſuitable that he ſhould carry
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:45558:124"/>
himſelf as the only ſagacious man, and make
his mind the publick ſtandard of truth and
falſhood, of good and evil. For in ſo doing
he contradicts himſelf, pleads ignorance and
pretends knowledge, would be dealt with as
the moſt weak, but deals by others as if he
was the moſt ſtrong and skilful.</p>
               <p>The man of a tender Conſcience finds it
enough to rule and judge his own actions,
but leaves other men <hi>to their own maſters.</hi>
He is ſo modeſt upon the ſenſe of his own
defects, and conſequently ſo charitable as
to think other men may know a reaſon of
that he is not ſatisfied in. But they that
muſt erect a Judicature for all thoſe that
differ from them, and arraign them of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
or Popery, that are not of their
own mind, ſhall ſooner convict themſelves
of pride and pragmaticalneſs, than give proof
of any true tenderneſs of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>5. The truly tender Conſcience will freely
part with Money and whatever elſe uſes to
be valuable of that kind to preſerve its own
Innocency and Peace, and is far from the
humour of pretending Conſcience to advance
his Gain, or excuſe his Purſe. If ſuch a man
cannot conform to the Laws, yet he can pay
the penalty; if he cannot go to Church, he
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:45558:125"/>
can pay his Tythes: otherwiſe it is his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
he is tender of, and not his <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
his God is his Gain, and his Profit
his Conſcience. He that comes up to theſe
five points of honeſty, may be heard in his
plea of Tenderneſs, and no man elſe. And
now I will in the laſt place ſhew what conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is to be had of ſuch a caſe, and that in
theſe three particulars.</p>
               <p>1. Every private Chriſtian is bound in
charity and compaſſion towards ſuch a man,
to deny himſelf of ſome part of his liberty,
to pleaſe and to gain him. That is, in thoſe
things that are the matter of no Law, but
left free and undeterminate, there the rule
of the Apoſtle takes place, Rom. 15. 1, 2.
<hi>We that are ſtrong, ought to bear the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of the weak, and not to pleaſe our
ſelves. And let every one of us pleaſe his
neighbour for his good to edification.</hi> I ſay,
in ſuch things as are not the matter of any
Law, for I may not do evil that good may
come of it; I muſt not break either the
Laws of God or man out of an humour of
complaiſance to my Brother, for this were
as we ſay, to rob <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul,</hi> or to
commit Theft or Sacriledge, that I may give
Alms. But in ſuch things, as both the
Laws of God and man have left me at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:45558:125"/>
and at my own diſpoſe, I may then juſtly
and ought in charity to conſider his weakneſs,
rather than uſe my own ſtrength; and ought
not to walk over Rocks and Precipices, where
I know the infirmity of others is ſuch that
they cannot follow me. For though my
own ſtrength would bear me up, yet it were
very charitable to deſcend from that height
which I know others cannot climb up to
without giddineſs.</p>
               <p>To do all that I may do without danger
to my ſelf, and not at all to regard what
othes can comply with, or to uſe my own
liberty to the offence of others, is to be
unchriſtian and uncharitable. It is to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
of my own abundance when my Brother
is in want. And in this ſenſe only are we
to underſtand all theſe diſcourſes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
about Scandal and Offence. In thoſe
times the Magiſtrate being Pagan, took no
care of the Church, nor had paſſed any
Laws concerning the manage of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion; therefore whatſoever God had
left free and undetermined, was ſo ſtill: ſo
that the Chriſtians had a great deal of
ſcope and room for mutual condeſcenſion,
and accordingly the Apoſtle exhorts them,
that in all that <hi>materia libera, they ſhould
by love ſerve one another.</hi> And with great
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:45558:126"/>
equity; for he that will provoke his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſin, by doing that which he himſelf
can omit without ſin, is guilty of ſin in ſo
doing. But the caſe is quite otherwiſe when
there is a Law in being; for if my Brother
will be offended, unleſs I break a Law to
comply with him, in that caſe Charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
at home, as we ſay, I muſt look to my
ſelf firſt, and if he take offence, he doth
take it where it is not given, for I do but my
duty. And as I may and muſt give Alms
of what is my own, and what I can ſpare
from my own occaſions, but am neither
bound to deprive my ſelf of neceſſaries, that
I may ſerve any mans needs, nor much leſs
to rob another of his right, that I may
furniſh him that wants; ſo the ſame Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
requires that in all thoſe caſes where
no Law of God or man hath reſtrained my
liberty, I there conſider the infirmity of a
another, rather than the pleaſing of my ſelf.
And that this is it which St. <hi>Paul</hi> meant in
all thoſe paſſages, appears by conſideration
of the inſtance he gives in himſelf, and
wherewith he concludes the argument, 1 Cor.
8. 13. <hi>Wherefore if meat make my Brother
to offend, I will eat no fleſh while the world
ſtands.</hi> The eating of fleſh was under no
Law, and conſequently he ſhould not offend
if he forbore it, therefore he reſolves that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:45558:126"/>
he would abridge himſelf of his own liberty,
rather than offend another.</p>
               <p>2. It becomes the wiſdom and compaſſion
of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate ſo far to conſider
the ſatisfaction of peoples Minds as well as
the peace and ſafety of his Dominions, as
not to make thoſe things the matter of his
Laws which he foreſees mens weakneſs will
make them boggle at: unleſs there be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
reaſons on the other hand to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
that conſideration. Such as, that
the things which ſome ſcruple, are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
neceſſary to Government, or grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to a greater or more conſiderable part
of his Subjects. If without theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
he ſhall however conſtitute ſuch Laws,
I will not ſay ſuch Laws are therefore null,
(for the weakneſs of people doth not take
away his power) but I will ſay they are
unkind and ungracious. But thoſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
being ſuppoſed, that is, if ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
as are apt to be ſcrupled by ſome,
be yet either neceſſary to Government, or very
grateful to the more conſiderable part of his
Subjects, he hath then no obligation upon
him to conſider the offence of a few, but
the good and ſafety of the whole. Yet
when thoſe intereſts are ſecured, there is
great ſcope for his compaſſion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:45558:127"/>
it is the duty of a good Magiſtrate
(as of a good Shepherd) to drive as the
Cattle can go.</p>
               <p>3. If it ſhall be found neceſſary upon the
conſiderations before intimated, or any the
like, to make ſuch things matter of Law
that were before indifferent in themſelves,
and which being ſo made, are likely to be
ſcrupled by thoſe who ought to obey; It
becomes a Chriſtian Magiſtrate who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
he governs Men and not Beaſts, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
means of inſtruction to ſuch weak and
ſcrupulous perſons, and competent time for
thoſe inſtructions to take place, and in the
mean time to ſuſpend rigorous executions.
For it is not in mens power to believe what
they liſt, much leſs what others would have
them: and it hath alwayes been found that
force without inſtruction hath been preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
only upon the worſt of men, and ſet the
more conſcientious farther off by prejudice.
But after ſuch inſtruction afforded and time
allowed, if then ſuch perſons be not rightly
informed and ſatisfied, yet the Magiſtrate is
unblameable, for he commands but what is
reaſonable in it ſelf, and he hath done what
lay in him, that mens Judgements might be
convinced, and Conſcience quieted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:45558:127"/>
It is very obſervable that in the Council
held by the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 15. of
which I have ſometimes made mention, whilſt
there was hopes of gaining the <hi>Jews</hi> to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
and until they had time to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
inſtructed in it if they would, for ſo
long time the Apoſtles uſed them with great
tenderneſs, and as it appears made that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
in complyance with them, whereby they
abridged the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of the exerciſe of a
conſiderable part of their Chriſtian Liberty
in meer condeſcenſion to the <hi>Jews:</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuch time as the <hi>Jews</hi> might have been
ſufficiently inſtructed, but remained incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and obſtinate, then this Indulgence grew
into <hi>deſuetude,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> reſumed their
due liberty. From the ſame conſideration
was it that St. <hi>Paul</hi> (as I alſo obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
practiſed Circumciſion in the caſe of
<hi>Timothy,</hi> which he otherwiſe declared uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and dangerous. And again upon the
ſame grounds did the Apoſtolical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
enjoyn the obſervation of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi>
Sabbath as well as the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and
ſeveral other things were both acted by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Chriſtians, and decreed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Councils in favour of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
till they appeared no longer pittiably weak
and ignorant, but contumacious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:45558:128"/>
And as the Elder Chriſtians
did by the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo ſeems the Great <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
to have done by the Pagans; He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
that thoſe that had beèn all their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
kept in the darkneſs of <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> could
not preſently bear ſo great a light as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
Therefore though he zealouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
it, yet he did not preſently make
it penal not to be a Chriſtian, but for a time
gave every one leave to be of what Religion
he would, to chooſe his own God and his own
way of Worſhip. In the mean time care was
taken, that all ſhould have opportunity of
underſtanding the truth if they would, which
when they had enjoyed for a competent time,
he then requires all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Chriſtianity. This laſt inſtance I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
fits not the very matter we have in hand,
which is touching things in their own nature
indifferent: But it agrees with the general
reaſon of proceeding, which is ſufficient to
my purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But now after all this, if people will not
be inſtructed, but ſhall be ſo ridiculous as to
pride themſelves in their folly, and glory to
continue weak, when they may be ſtrong,
that is, will affect Ignorance, to countenance
Diſobedience, I ſee no obligation upon the
Magiſtrate either to forbear to make or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:45558:128"/>
ſuch Laws as he apprehends for the good
of his Government, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>And ſo I hope I have cleared this point,
That though a Tender Conſcience hath its
Priviledges, yet it hath not ſuch a Prerogative
as to null the Laws, or ſuſpend the Power of
the Magiſtrate in the Sphere of Religion.
And therefore this pretence will be no longer
an excuſe for mens Non-conformity to the
Laws and Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The great diſhonour that diſobedience to Laws

               </argument>
               <p>HAving, as I think, ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
the ſin and miſchiefs of Schiſm,
and evacuated all the excuſes and palliations
of it from the plea of Chriſtian Liberty or
the pretence of Tender Conſcience, I cannot
ſee what ſhould remain able to perpetuate
our diſtractions, unleſs it be a point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that ſome think themſelves obliged to
perſevere, becauſe they have begun: A hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
like that <hi>Tull</hi> notes and taxes in the
Stoicks, That when Arguments failed them,
Conſtancy ſupplyed that defect, and that
they were not deſerted of their Courage,
when they were deſtitute of Reaſon. It is,
I confeſs, too common with men, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that they may not ſeem to have had a
bad and indefenſible Cauſe at firſt, they will
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:45558:129"/>
indeavour to give it reputation by the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and conſtancy of the Defendants, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they hope to gain one of theſe points,
that either by Victory they ſhall have it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to them, or at leaſt extort Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conditions to lay down Arms, which is a
kind of parting ſtakes. Hereupon it is far
more eaſie to convince men, than to ſatisfie
them, becauſe at laſt it comes to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of Honour and Spirit, and not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
of Truth.</p>
               <p>They ſay, nothing ſubdues <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirits
but Ceſſion and Condeſcenſion; yield them
a little, and they will in Bravery and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity,
give you up all the reſt: but if you
continue to contend, they will fight, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it's either hopeful or neceſſary, neither
becauſe they can reaſonably hope to obtain
the victory, nor becauſe they muſt be ruined
if they do not, but becauſe they cannot
brook the diſhonour of being vanquiſht. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is a kind of <hi>Gentile</hi> Conſcience, and
tender like that too. And I confeſs, though
it be a very virtuous, yet it is no very eaſie
thing, to come about perfectly, to change
ones courſe, and to proclaim ones ſelf to
have been in the wrong before, to forgo a
mans opinion and his reputation together,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:45558:130"/>
wholly to yield up the cauſe we have long
contended for, without any conditions to
ſalve our honour, without abatement, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
or comprehenſion. For though wiſe
men will cenſure our obſtinacy if we perſiſt,
yet the multitude will reproach us with levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and cowardize if we retreat. And though
many a man could contentedly give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the inſtruction of the few, yet to be
expoſed to the contumelies of the vulgar is
harſh and uneaſie. This conſideration hath,
I acknowledge, a great deal of Rhetorick,
and I doubt prevails with not a few in our
preſent caſe. I will therefore endeavour to
ſhew the unreaſonableneſs of it in theſe two
points.</p>
               <p>1. I affirm, That it is no real diſhonour,
but a manly generoſity and a Chriſtian vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to change our minds upon mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
and the evidence of better reaſon.
Indeed to change we know not why, or
meerly becauſe we are weary of old things,
is a vitious levity; or upon new intereſts to
eſpouſe new perſwaſions, is baſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
either of a Chriſtian or a Man: yet on
the other ſide, obſtinately to maintain what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we have aſſerted, is as far from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſtability and perſeverance, as it is from
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:45558:130"/>
ingenuity. That very temper which our
Saviour requires in his Diſciples, and which
is the preparatory diſpoſition to the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of Chriſtianity, eſpecially conſiſts
in a ſimplicity of mind; and an indifferency
to comply with whatſoever ſhall beſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it ſelf to our faculties. And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is not of this diſpoſition, it was meerly
by chance that he became a Chriſtian; or
whatſoever opinions he hath better than any
other man, nothing is owing to his virtue,
but his fortune; and he is not the better
man, but had the happier Education. For
ſince no man is infallible, nor hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive
knowledge of things, he muſt either
make himſelf a meer Machine to be filled
and moved by others, and receive without
diſcrimination whatſoever is inſtilled into
him by others, that doth not think it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
him to leave room for better reaſons,
and further light in all ſuch matters as we
ſpeak of, and where Almighty God hath not
once for all expreſly delivered himſelf. And
thoſe are not only the moſt ingenuous men,
but ordinarily the moſt uſeful alſo, that are
what they are, not by Inſtinct and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
of Education, but by Conviction and
Argument. In ſhort, he that reſolves never
to change his opinion, nor hopes to be wiſer
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:45558:131"/>
than he is, either will be alwayes a fool,
or hath the fortune of ſuch an one, or
both.</p>
               <p>Now then, he that ſeeing Reaſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
him to take new meaſures, ſhall yet
upon Secular conſiderations think fit not to
own a change, may have the reputation of
a <hi>cunning</hi> man, but never of an <hi>honeſt,</hi>
and ſhall loſe more in the Judgement of
wiſe men, than he ſhall gain with the
vulgar.</p>
               <p>2. Epecially let it be conſidered, how
much the honour of our Religion is of more
value than our Perſonal reputation, and how
much that is concerned in the peaceable and
obedient temper of all thoſe that pretend to
it; and withal, what it ſuffers in defect of
this: And ſurely a due ſenſe of theſe things
will have ſuch weight with all thoſe that
are ſincerely Chriſtian, as to depreſs and keep
down the turgency of our phancy and vain
glory.</p>
               <p>It was an effectual courſe <hi>Haman</hi> took,
<hi>Eſther</hi> 3. 8. (and he had wit in his malice,)
when he deſigning to ruine the whole Church
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> firſt undermines the reputation
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:45558:131"/>
of their Profeſſion, delates their Religion as
not fit for the protection of the Prince, and
that it contained <hi>Laws contrary to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and that they would not obey the Kings
Laws.</hi> There is nothing caſts ſo indeleble
a blemiſh upon Religion as when the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of it are turbulent, unperſwadable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable.
When that which ſhould
ſtrengthen the hands of the Magiſtrate, ſhall
weaken them, when that which ſhould eaſe
his care and ſave the labour of his Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions,
ſhall it ſelf awaken and raiſe his
Jealouſie; when that which ſhould enact his
Laws in the very Conſciences of men, ſhall
pretend to abrogate or diſpenſe with them;
when men ſhall ſmite and break the two
Tables one againſt another, and put other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations
and conditions upon Princes than
God hath, and pretend a revocation of the
Broad Seal of Civil Authority by the Privy
Signet of Religion: whereever this is done,
that Prince or Magiſtrate had need be a very
devout man indeed, that caſts a benign aſpect
upon that Profeſſion which hath ſo malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
an influence upon his Government. And
all conſidering men will with great reaſon
doubt, whether that Religion be of God that
gives ſuch trouble to his Vicegerent, and
whether that will carry men to Heaven here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:45558:132"/>
that makes tumults, confuſions and a
Hell upon earth.</p>
               <p>But I have ſaid ſo much to this buſineſs
heretofore, when I conſidered the miſchiefs of
Schiſm, that I ſhall need to ſay the leſs
now. Only let me obſerve, That the more
raiſed and elevated any Religion pretends to
be, the more it profeſſes a Contempt of this
world, the more it ſpeaks of Patience, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation,
Humility, and the more it glories
in the hopes of another world, ſtill the more
horribly abſurd and contradictious will it be,
that this ſhould give countenance to diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and diſturbance of Government.</p>
               <p>I have alſo noted before, that it was the
great advantage Chriſtianity had for the
planting it ſelf in the world, that it diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
no ſetled Form, made no noiſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion,
but fell like the dew of Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Fleece of Wooll. Our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was ſo careful of giving offence, that
he not only gave no jealouſie to thoſe in
poſſeſſion of the Government, but alſo abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his own Liberty, rather than he would
ſeem to retrench their Power. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
when he was accuſed by an eloquent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<hi>Tertullus,</hi> Acts 24. 5. <hi>as a mover of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:45558:132"/>
doth with equal eloquence diſprove
the charge, and deteſt the Crime. And that
the generality of Chriſtians were of the ſame
temper and ſpirit, <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives ample
teſtimony. <hi>Externi ſumus, &amp; veſtra omnia
implevimus, urbes, inſulas, caſtella, muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipia,
caſtra ipſa, tribus, decurias, palatium,
ſenatum, forum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cui bello non idenei,</hi> &amp;c.
Apol. c. 37. <hi>We want,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>neither num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
nor Leaders, nor Spirit, to inable us
for any attempt; but that we have learnt
to</hi> ſuffer <hi>ill, and not to</hi> do <hi>it, to obey and
ſubmit, not to contend with our Rulers.</hi>
And <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> a Pagan Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
in <hi>Julian</hi>'s Army, and therefore the
more undeniable witneſs in the caſe, gives
this ſhort deſcription of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<hi>Nil niſi juſtum ſuadet &amp; lene: It
is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>compounded of nothing but
mildneſs and innocency.</hi> It makes men
juſt and honeſt, it fills mens hearts with
virtuous principles, but not their heads
with troubleſome niceties; It teaches men
not to be troublers of the World, but to
go quietly and inoffenſively through it,
with as little noiſe and provocation as is
poſſible, and ſo to arrive at eternal reſt
and peace in Heaven. And as this is the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:45558:133"/>
known glory of Chriſtianity in general, ſo
it was peculiarly of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reformation
in particular, as I ſhewed before. It was
brought in by the Prince, not by the rout
of people; it was eſtabliſht orderly by Law,
did not force its way by popular tumult,
and was truly what it ought to be, a revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of Primitive purity and ſimplicity. And
it is infinite pity, that its glory ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
be ſtained by the inſolence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
of thoſe that pretend to it. It is
a great blot in the writings of Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi>
that after he had diſcourſed rarely well of
the power of Princes and the duty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
in the laſt Chapter of his <hi>Inſtitutions</hi>
and the one and thirtieth Paragraph, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does
all again with an unhappy exception, in
theſe words, <hi>de privatis hominibus ſemper
loquor:</hi> A paſſage of that ill aſpect upon Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
that it is ſuſpected by ſome, and
not altogether without cauſe, that moſt of
the confuſions of Kingdoms which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
ſince, and eſpecially the troubles of
this Nation, have received incouragement, if
not taken riſe from thence. But whether that
be ſo or no, it is certain that it hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
the Papiſts with a recrimination upon the
Proteſtant Doctrine, when we have charged
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:45558:133"/>
theirs as blowing a Trumpet to Sedition and
Rebellion. And though the true Proteſtant
Doctrine be as innocent, as theirs is guilty
in this kind, yet if it can be objected againſt
us, that our Churches are alwayes infeſted
with Diviſions, and the States under which
we live, imbroyled in troubles, we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be concerned, foraſmuch as we have no
reaſon to expect that our Adverſaries will be ſo
juſt or charitable, as to diſtinguiſh betwixt
the faults of the Doctrine and the miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
of thoſe that Profeſs it, but will be
ſure to involve both in the diſhonour. For
it cannot be, but that either the Seed muſt be
very bad, that brings forth ſuch Fruit, or the
Soil very corrupt, that makes good Seed ſo
degenerate; that is, either the Religion muſt
be very faulty, that fills men generally with
ſo bad Principles, or at leaſt, the Men muſt
be extreamly evil, that debauch good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And whether ſoever of theſe two
things be concluded on, (as it is certain one
muſt and both may) we ill conſult either
for our ſelves or our Profeſſion that by our
diviſions, diſputes, turbulencies and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
make the aforeſaid dilemma inevitable.
And all the wit and courage we ſhew in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
our private opinions, and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:45558:134"/>
our ſeveral parties, when the common
cauſe and intereſt is by this means rendred
odious and contemptible, is but like the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
ſollicitude of him that ſhall be adorning
his private Cabin, when the Ship is ſinking.
And thoſe men have little cauſe to triumph
in their particular ſucceſſes, who loſe to a
common Enemy whatever they gain upon
one another.</p>

               <p>It was obſerved of old, that the Conqueſt

by the Inteſtine diviſions of the Inhabitants,

whereas had they conſulted in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and made a joynt defence, they had

upon the ſame point that the Civil
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:45558:135"/>

with one another, and with our Rulers about
little things, we loſe the main, and by the
opportunity of our Diviſions and Subdiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
a common enemy break in upon us.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that no advantage can more
encourage the attempt or befriend the deſigns
of our Adverſaries, than the preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

we have no enemies, or ſo mad as to think

ſpeaks a Wit and a man of more than

to profeſs their Infidelity, as the Pſalmiſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes

ſuch black impreſſions, and that nothing

For when witty men ſhall obſerve that the
generality of thoſe that pretend to the
higheſt pitch of Religion, do either repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
God Almighty ſo incredibly and contrary
to the natural notions men have of him, or
Religion ſo apiſhly and ridiculouſly (as is
the Genius of Superſtition to do) It will be
very ready and eaſie to them to conclude, there
is no reality either in the one or the other:
Eſpecially if thoſe happen to make the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
whoſe vicious and deſperate courſes
have made it become their intereſt that there
ſhould be no ſuch things. When men ſhall

moſt certain and moſt eſſential points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
are or ſhould be, what can be more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
than to think thoſe things alike true,
that are alike imbraced and have equal ſtreſs

that ſeeing ſome are notoriouſly falſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ſeems more than probable to them that
the reſt are ſo too. It is in this caſe as in the
hearing of Civil Cauſes, when it appears to
the Judges, that there is falſe play made uſe
of and ſome ſuborned Witneſſes brought to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:45558:137"/>
give evidence, they are hereby prejudiced
againſt the reſt.</p>
               <p>And (which is further conſiderable) it is
very probable that thoſe very men that were
formerly ſunk into the mire of the aforeſaid
Superſtitions, may afterwards when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to emerge out of their deluſions, make
up a conſiderable part of the Atheiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
For by the ſame reaſon we gave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
theſe men finding themſelves cheated and
impoſed upon even in theſe very points that
they were as confident of, as of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Creed, grow hence to ſuſpect
even <hi>them</hi> too, foraſmuch as with them it
hath no better foundation than the things
that now are apparently falſe: And thus
from too large and prodigious a Creed they
come to have no Faith at all. When they
diſcover that they believed many things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ground, they think now they have
ground to believe nothing, and from fierce
and hot Bigots, become cold Scepticks and
Atheiſts.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place I ſuſpect the lewd
practices that have gone under the cloak
and countenance of Religion, have had a
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:45558:137"/>
great hand in this miſchief alſo. That not
only the prodigious Faith, but the monſtrous
Life of ſome great pretenders to Religion
hath made men ſcorn and abhorr the very
notion of it. When not only mens ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Follies, but alſo their Vices, their
Pride, and Paſſion, and Rancour ſhall be
father'd upon the Spirit of God (as we
know when and where ſuch things have
been done) when men ſhall ſeek God for
all the Villanies they are reſolved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
when they make long Prayers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
Widows houſes, and proclaim a Faſt
that they may kill and take poſſeſſion;
when Religion ſhall be proſtituted to all
bad deſigns, and <hi>in nomine Domini incipit
omne malum:</hi> when, I ſay, the moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Profeſſion is a cloke for the vileſt
Knavery; It cannot be much wondered if
ſuch men as I deſcribed before, be inclined
by theſe things to think there is no reality
in any of the diſcourſes of God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
For as, if a man were to obſerve
whether the Sun was riſen upon the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere,
he would direct his eyes to the tops
of Mountains, expecting to ſee him diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his beams firſt upon them that are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Heaven: So a man would think if there
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:45558:138"/>
were any ſuch thing as Religion and a ſenſe
of Divinity amongſt men, it ſhould be
found amongſt thoſe that have alwayes God
in their mouths, and ſuch a Garb of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
upon them. But if he find himſelf
diſappointed here, and that theſe men that
pretend ſo high, have as great Senſualities,
Paſſions, Covetouſneſs, Malice as other men,
he will deſpair of finding it any where,
and conclude with <hi>Brutus, O virtus, quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivi
te ut rem, ſed tantùm merum nomen es,</hi>
that there is no ſuch thing at all.</p>
               <p>3. To the aforeſaid Cauſes we may well
add the perpetual Janglings and Diſputes
between Profeſſors of Religion, as not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
making Religion unlovely, but even cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it wholly into queſtion. When ſo
many ſhall tell us there is ſuch a place and
ſtate as Heaven and a World to come, but
every one tells us a ſeveral way thither;
witty men who know that all cannot be
true, but all may be falſe, think it not
comporting with their diſcretion to take the
pains of the journey, till the Guides ſhall
be agreed of the way. The diſagreement
of the two rank Elders in their teſtimony
againſt <hi>Suſannah</hi>'s chaſtity, whileſt one ſaid
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:45558:138"/>
the fault was done under one kind of Tree
and the other under another, diſcovered her
Innocency and their Hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, there may and muſt be
diverſities of apprehenſions in ſeveral points
of Chriſtianity, whileſt men are of different
capacities, and this need not, nor if things
be modeſtly carryed, will give any juſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the Atheiſt. But when every
private opinion is made neceſſary to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and men pronounce damnation againſt
one another upon every little diverſity, when
they make as many Religions as there are
Opinions, and as many Wayes to Heaven,
as there are Notions amongſt men, it cannot
be hoped, but that the cold Sceptick ſhould
be incouraged in his Neutrality.</p>
               <p>4. But if to all theſe we conſider with
what rancour and malice the ſeveral Parties
proſecute one another, what odious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famatory
Libels, and bitter Invectives they
write one againſt another, wherein all the
ſecret follies of each party are blazed and
publiſhed, all the errors aggravated, all the
Opinions racked to confeſs blaſphemy in
their owners and defenders; one party ſaid
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:45558:139"/>
to make God a Tyrant, the other to deny
his Wiſdom, or Soveraignty; the one ſide
accuſed of Idolatry, the other of Rebellion:
he, I ſay, that conſiders how uſual all
this is, and how ready all thoſe that have
no good mind to Religion are to catch up
the darts that each of the parties caſt at
each other, and make uſe of them againſt
both, and with what ſeeming Reaſon they
conclude, that the Confeſſion of the Parties
againſt each other, and their mutual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments
of each other ſhould argue the
guilt of both, and obſerves that all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famatory
Sermons and Libels that men
write in heat and paſſion againſt each other,
(wherein they charge folly, blaſphemy and
nonſenſe upon each other reciprocally) at
laſt rebound or are retorted upon the wheel
of Religion, cannot be altogether to ſeek of
the riſe of the Atheiſm of this Age. But
whether theſe be the principal cauſes of
the great appearance which Atheiſm makes
in this Age above the proportion of other
times, or whether there be other of a more
latent and malignant influence, I ſhall not
further enquire at preſent, ſince it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that the matter of Fact is true, and
that being ſo, the danger to Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:45558:139"/>
be obſcure. We have reaſon therefore
better to govern our paſſions and lay aſide
our animoſities for the future, and to unite
our forces in an uniform order of Religion
againſt this common enemy, leſt the gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and piety of this Nation end in Buffoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and our beſt heat and ſpirits being ſpent
upon one another, or againſt our Governours,
the mortal ſymptome of a cold clammy ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
Atheiſm ſucceed.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Popery,</hi> is another <hi>Hannibal ad portas,</hi>
an enemy that watches but till our Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſhall open the Gates to him. I hope I
need not exaggerate the formidableneſs of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
to thoſe that remember either eighteen
thouſand ſouls diſpatcht out of the World
by the hands of the common Hangman in
about three years time in the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes</hi>
under the Government of the Duke
of <hi>Alva,</hi> or the <hi>French</hi> Maſſacre, or Queen
<hi>Maries</hi> Reign in <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Treaſon.</hi> There was a clauſe in our
Litany in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths and <hi>Edward</hi>
the Sixths time, <hi>From the tyranny of the
Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>and his deteſtable enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Good Lord deliver us;</hi> and upon what
reaſons ſoever it was ſince left out, it was
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:45558:140"/>
not certainly, becauſe either their Errors are
leſs enormous, or their Spirits leſs cruel; but
God forbid, that becauſe they at preſent
hide their Teeth, we ſhould think they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
or will not bite, for if we ſhould be ſo
good natur'd as to warm this Snake in our
boſomes that now pretends to have neither
power nor will to hurt us, I doubt we
ſhould quickly find it to reſume its malice
and poiſon together with its warmth and
ſtrength.</p>
               <p>If any one ſhall be ſo hardy as to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
there is no danger of its return in this
Nation, I pray God his foreſight be as great
as his courage; but he that conſiders the
following Circumſtances will think it adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
not to be over ſecure. For,</p>
               <p>1. It is not with this party as with any
other Sect whatſoever, theſe have a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Head and great intereſts abroad, the
Pope and all the Popiſh Princes to unite,
to direct, to animate and imploy them,
which muſt needs render them very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to any State that is inclined to middle
counſels, that is, that doth not either ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
pleaſe them, or effectually diſable
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:45558:140"/>
them. And upon this account the <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Sultan (who hath ſcarcely any need to
learn reaſon of State from any body) uſes
the <hi>Latin</hi> Chriſtians with greater caution
and ſeverity under his Dominion than the
<hi>Greek,</hi> becauſe he accounts the former al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
dangerous upon account of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Head and Alliance.</p>
               <p>2. We cannot but obſerve how diligent
they have been of late, how full of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and how erect their minds with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of ſome ſucceſs. They hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
walked in Maſquerade, diſguiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſometimes in the habit of one Sect and
ſometimes of another; but of late they have
had the confidence to lay off their diſguiſe
and play a more open game: And ſuch are
the numbers of their Emiſſaries, ſo deſperate
and daring are the Bigots of that party, and
ſo cloſe and crafty are their Inſinuations,
that we have little reaſon to think our ſelves
out of danger, eſpecially whileſt we have
ſuch Diviſions and Diſtractions amongſt our
ſelves as at once both incourage them to
attempt upon us, and alſo furniſh them with
a very popular argument to uſe with ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
and weakly principled Proteſtants to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:45558:141"/>
draw them off from us, namely, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Diviſions in our Church,
and the perfect Unity in theirs.</p>
               <p>For prevention of all which, there ſeems
no way ſo effectual as that we learn, if not
to ſubmit our private quarrels to the publick
Magiſtrate, yet to publick ſafety, leſt whileſt
the Gameſters quarrell, thoſe that ſit by
ſweep the ſtakes. And certainly it's more
adviſeable to ſacrifice our Opinions to our
Safety, than our Religion and Liberty to
our Humours and Opinions. And although
bleſſed be God, we have now a Prince to
whom the Proteſtant Religion came ſealed
with his Fathers Blood, and who in his
own unhappy Exile had however this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to be well aware of the cheats and
impoſtures, as well as the deſigns of that
Faction: yet if ever it ſhould be our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to have a Prince indifferent in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and who preferred his own quiet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Civil or Spiritual Intereſts of his
people; the unreaſonable petulancies we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray,
our untractableneſs by fair means, and
our endleſs diſputes and unneceſſary ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſities
would tempt ſuch a Prince (grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weary of the burden of our unquietneſs,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:45558:141"/>
and deſpairing otherwiſe of bringing us to
obedience) to put us under the inſolence of
that hard-hearted <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whoſe little Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
would prove heavier than the Loyns of
all our preſent Governours, and ſet <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
Task-maſters over us to break our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
by bitter bondage; which Gods Mercy
and our Wiſdom for the future will I hope
prevent.</p>
               <p>But if we ſhould eſcape both theſe dangers,
yet our Diviſions and Diſtractions continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there is a third danger that I do not ſee
how it is avoidable. And that is,</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Fanaticiſm.</hi> For it is not imaginable,
but that the Church growing into contempt,
and Laws into daily neglect, that things can
long ſtand at this paſs, but ſome change or
other muſt enſue; and if Popery come not
in to chaſtize our follies, nor Atheiſm (that
damp of the bottomleſs Pit) come over us
and ſtifle all our life and warmth of Religion,
but that we muſt (the aforeſaid cauſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
and daily increaſing) fall into a
Religious Phrenſie, or that raging Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
I laſt named. What that is, and what
the inſufferable miſchiefs of it are, I need
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:45558:142"/>
not repreſent. It is, in ſhort, inſtead of
Church Government to have a Spiritual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
where the hotteſt head is made the
higheſt Governour; where Pride and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
are the only qualifications of a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
where Humour is called Conſcience,
and Novelty Religion. This, for ought I
can ſee, is like to be our condition, if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Atheiſt nor Papiſt ſucceed in their
projects. But if any man ſhall be ſo fond
as to hope we ſhall not fall thus low, but
may ſtay in Presbytery, I ſhall ſay but this,
Let ſuch perſon conſider how few and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
that party is, compared with the
vaſt numbers of Quakers, Ranters, Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Monarchy-men,
Anabaptiſts, Antinomians,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and how little acceptable the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
way or intereſt is to any of thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and therefore how unlikly to be ſet
up by their means: But eſpecially let it be
remembred that when that Party had the
Ball at their ſoot, they were not able to
keep it, but loſt it and the Goal too, to
thoſe more numerous and adventurous Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
I therefore ſay again, I cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
but that there muſt be a better union
and complyance with the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
or I do not ſee it poſſible, but we
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:45558:142"/>
muſt fall into one or other of the aforeſaid
dangers. And the calamity will then be ſo
great which way ſoever we fall, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
I think every honeſt minded Proteſtant
ought to be inclined to bear with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
whatſoever burdens our Superiours can
be ſuſpected capable of impoſing upon us,
rather than make experiment of the danger.</p>

               <p>I Have now adventured to ſtretch forth
my hand to ſtay the tottering of the
Ark, and to caſt in my Mite to the publick
Treaſury for the ſervice of the Church,
which I hope God and Good men will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

               <p>Of what efficacy the foregoing Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
ſhall be, is at the mercy of the
Reader. But if it pleaſe Almighty God to
give him ſuch candour and ſo unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
a mind in the reading, as I call him
to witneſs I have been ſenſible of in the
writing, I do not then deſpair but they
will prevail with all <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> that love
the Proteſtant Religion better than their
own humour, to Conform to the Church
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:45558:143"/>
and Laws eſtabliſht; or at leaſt that they
ſhall ſeem of ſuch weight, as that a few
ſcruples ſhall not be thought a counter-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
to them.</p>
               <p>Yet the more to aſſure this ſo deſirable
an Iſſue, I will crave leave for a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
humbly to recommend theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
particulars.</p>
               <p>1. That all thoſe that are zealous of the
honour and intereſt of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
will (the more effectually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
the excellency of it, and to ſtop
the mouth of ſlander,) oblige themſelves
to a ſingular holineſs of life. Let us be
aſhamed that ſince we pretend to have, and
have really, a better way of Religion, not
to have ſo much better Lives as we have
better Principles. Let us diſdain that any
petty Sect whatſoever ſhould outgo us in
that which is the great end of Church
Society. When thoſe that bring prejudice
to our publick Worſhip, reproach it as a
cold Service, Let us labour to have our
hearts invigorated with ſuch a ſenſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
by it, as may not only conſute
the ſlander, but maintain a ſpiritual heat
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:45558:144"/>
and life of Godlineſs in all our converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For let us aſſure our ſelves, this is
that the credit of any Profeſſion depends
upon, when we have uſed all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the beſt Vindications of our
ſelves and our Church, it is Holineſs of
life is the beſt and moſt prevalent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
               <p>2. That ſince for the bringing others to
Conformity, we muſt perſwade them to for go
ſome part of their natural Liberties, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as otherwiſe they can come under no
Government whatſoever, but muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Outlaws or abſolute Princes: To the
end, I ſay, that we may prevail with
them to deny themſelves in ſome things for
the publick good, we ſhould do well to
give them example in our own ſelf-denyal
and abridging our own liberty in conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion
to them in ſuch things as are not
the matter of Law. And that we will not
outrun the Laws to contradict and vex
them, but comply with them in what we
may without ſin. This is that Charity and
avoiding Scandal the Apoſtle ſo earneſtly
recommends, of which I have ſpoken in
the Conſiderations. And the conſequence
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:45558:144"/>
is plain; If it be their duty to reſtrain
themſelves in the uſe of that Liberty God
hath left them, in complyance with the Laws
and Magiſtrate, and for the ſake of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace and Order; then it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to reſtrain our ſelves in the uſe of that
Liberty the Laws of God and Man have
left us, for the ſake of the ſame Peace
and in Charity to our Brethren. Beſides
that nothing works upon mens ingenuity
like Ceſſion and Yielding, and peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> as I have heretofore
obſerved.</p>
               <p>3. That we uſe no provocation or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation
towards Diſſenters, nor counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
thoſe inconſiderable perſons that have
no other way to ſhew their Zeal to the
Church, but by reviling and vexing thoſe
that differ from it. It were good all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Church did (and I hope
they do) imitate <hi>Memnon</hi> the General
for <hi>Darius</hi> againſt <hi>Alexander,</hi> who when
he found one of his Souldiers inſtead of
Darts caſting Scoffs at the Enemy, tells
him, You are not entertained <hi>ut maledicas
ſed ut pugnes.</hi> For beſides that this carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
where ever it is, is but counted a ſtrong
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:45558:145"/>
argument of a weak Cauſe, it ſtirs up the
mud of mens paſſions, clouds their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
and by repreſenting men worſe
than they are, tempts them to be worſe
than they would be: And if I ſee I ſhall
be alwayes noſed with my former Ignorance
and folly, I am deprived of one of the greateſt
encouragements to forſake it.</p>
               <p>4. Though I have as I hope ſufficiently
proved in the foregoing Diſcourſe, that
there is no abſolute neceſſity of making
any abatement of the Legal terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with this Church, foraſmuch as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is required or impoſed by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
thereof, but what may be ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to without in; And therefore I will
not be guilty of the preſumption to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to my Superiours either one way or
other in that matter: Yet I humbly ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
that if any ſuch thing ſhall be
thought fit to be done out of condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Non-conformiſts, and to gain
them to the Church, it may be done free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſpontaneouſly, nor as extorted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by their importunity or the neceſſity
of affairs. For whatſoever is gotten the
latter way, is not accounted yielded, but
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:45558:145"/>
won, <hi>nec amicos parat, nec inimicos tollit,</hi>
it paſſes no obligation upon men, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incourages their importunity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
their obſtinacy. And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that wiſe men do or ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
more, than the miſcarriage of their
favours, ſince thereby they loſe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what they grant, but their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
too.</p>
               <p>The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> therefore would
hearken to no terms nor Propoſitions on
the behalf of the Proteſtants, leſt they
ſhould by ſome few drops of Conceſſion,
increaſe their thirſt of more. But had
they had as much of the <hi>innocency of the
Dove</hi> as of the <hi>ſubtilty of the Serpent,</hi> or
been as <hi>ſincere</hi> as they were <hi>wiſe</hi> in their
generation, they ſhould have prevented all
importunities by a liberal Grant of what
was fit and juſt, and by ſuch an act of
Goodneſs and Charity they might either
have wrought upon the ingenuity and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated
the heat of the other Party, or at
leaſt, having done what became them, they
ſhould then have had good ground perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to have refuſed whatſoever ſhould have
been arrogantly demanded. But they (as
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:45558:146"/>
I have ſaid) wiſely enough in their way,
conſidering that if they once came to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
any thing due to the Proteſtants,
muſt be forced upon the ſame terms to
yield them more than they were willing
to part with, and indeed little leſs than
the whole, reſolved therefore to yield no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all.</p>
               <p>But as the caſe of our Church is not
like theirs, ſo there is no neceſſity we
ſhould make uſe of the ſame Politicks; for
where there is nothing ſinful in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
nothing can be required to be
abated but upon the terms of Prudence
and Compaſſion; and if it ſhall happen
that thoſe Arguments be thought fit to be
heard, it is great pitty in that caſe that
the reſolution ſhould not be ſo carried,
as that it may be evident to all, that
thoſe cauſes only had influence upon the
effect.</p>
               <p>If theſe things be conſidered by thoſe
that favour the Church, and the foregoing
Conſiderations be impartially weighed by
the Proteſtant Diſſenters from it, I for
my part ſhall conceive good hope that the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:45558:146"/>
Clergy of <hi>England</hi> ſhall recover its anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and due Veneration, our Churches
be better filled than the Conventicles, a
bleſſed Symphony in our publick Prayers,
and an Univerſal Peace, Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
be reſtored in this divided and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Church and Nation. Which God of
his infinite Mercy grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
