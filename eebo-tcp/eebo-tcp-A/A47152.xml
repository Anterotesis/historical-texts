            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>IT hath been in my heart once and again from the Lord to write some things unto the people, and especially the Professors of this Nation, concerning this great and weighty matter of</hi> Immediate Revelation, <hi>which they say, (both Teachers and People) is ceased, we say, is remaining, and we know it to be so, from the blessed experience given us of God therein, even that it remaineth, and is of necessary continuance in the true Church, and among the true Saints, and is not only necessary for the preservation, safety, and comfortable walking of the Saints with God, but is also necessary in order to men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens becoming Saints, for through</hi> Immediate Revelation <hi>it is, that any man who is naturally void of the true and saving knowledge of God, and acquaintance with him comes to attain it. The discussing of this controversie is of very great weight, for this error of theirs, concerning</hi> Immediate Revelation <hi>is such a Fundamental one, that the greatest part of their other errors, are built on it, and indeed the whole superstructure of their Church, and Ministry and Worship, at to its outward constitution, so that if this their foundation be found and discovered to be false,</hi> viz. <hi>That there is no</hi> Immmediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>now a dayes, as the common priviledge of the Saints, then down falls the whole superstructure of the outward constitution of their Church, Ministry and Worship, which all of necessity must be false if the foundation on which they are builded be such. And here I shal instance several particulars of great weight which are all built upon this false foundation aforesaid.</hi> 1. <hi>That the Scriptures outward testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is most necessary and that no true and saving Knowledge of God, is to be attained but by the Scriptures being read or heard.</hi> 2. <hi>That there is no immediate furnishing, gifting and fitting, and qualifying men to be Teachers in the Church, by immediate inspiration and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth of the spirit of prophesie, without any respect had to sex, or humane qualifications of better learning such as was frequent in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

All this say they is cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>so</hi> James Durham <hi>(a noted man among the Presbyterians) saith pag.</hi> 471. <hi>in his digression concerning prophecying,</hi> that as it is taken for an immediate revealing of Gospel truths, it is now ceased, <hi>so say they generally, hence their Divinity Schools and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges are come up, both among Papists and Protestants whereby young men (being sent of their Relations in order to a lively-hood) learn the Art and Trade of preaching and praying; and continues so many years,</hi>

Now though we say, that the Scriptures are a full and perfect testimony of all the essentials of the Christian Religion, yet we believe (contrary unto these of the National way) that they are not a Canon so filled up, as no more, is to be added unto them, from the same immediate inspiration and Revelation of the spirit of God, through his servants, of the same authority with them for though no new essentials are to be added, yet a new, and fuller and clearer Testimony may be added, concerning the same old essentials, for indeed less then the one half of the Scriptures is a full and perfect Testimony of all the essentials, yet this proves not the other parts to be useless, and imperfect.</p>
            <p>But though we affirm, that no other essentials, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us, but what are declared in the Scripture, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we say this, that a great many particular things, both by way of precept and prohibition, permission and approbation, and counsel from the Lord, are both revealed, and are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be revealed, unto us, which are not essentials of the Christian Religion, nor principles of the Doctrine of Christ, but things relating to our conversation in the World, and our walking with God with faith and comfort, according to his will, with the knowledge of which we are to be filled in all things, and the word of the Lord is to dwell in us richly, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things that occurre, revealing in us the will of God, as commanding or forbidding, or licensing us, how to carry, and be conversant about them.

It is very evident, that their is a necessity for these under the new covenant dispensation of living in, and walking after the spirit, to have things revealed unto them from the Lord, which are not to be found in the Scriptures, particularly, not so much as by consequence, for indeed the Scriptures point us inward to the spirit of the Lord in our hearts, which is more nigh, then they are Blessed, are they and shall be, who make the testimony of Gods word and spirit in their hearts, the men of their counsel, they know the sure cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Path, wherein the waysaring man, though a fool cannot crie.

(And thus it is with the fallen Angels, and the souls of the damned, and all these whose day of visitation is over) for this effect hath only the mercy in the judgement, which worketh to soften, to melt, to bow, and subject the soul, in true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility unto the Lord, and beget in it a true willingness and satisfaction, to come under the judgement, and drink this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cup, and be baptized with this fire-baptism, to the end it may be delivered from the bondage of corruption, which is the body of sin and death, and may be fitted to put on, the new man, the birth from above of the incorruptible seed, in which only it can injoy, and have fellowship with God, in the love, the peace, the joy, that is unspeakable and full of glory, and passing understanding. And whereas the mercy goeth forth in the judgement, towards man in the fallen state to recover and convert him, their is also some secret manifestation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto him, and of the love, compassion, bowels, and good will of God, that is towards him; which is necessary to be held forth, as a foundation and ground of his faith and hope, that God will be merciful unto him, if he but come under the judgement, and permit it in him, to have its operation of purging and refining. Yet because in the unconverted state, he is only a child of wrath, and not at all a child of love, but only in a capacity to become a child, or vessel of the love and mercy of God; therefore doth the wrath most appear, and manifest it self in him, and the mercy and love as a little seed is shut up as within the wrath and the judgement, which send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth (after some wonderfully secret conveyance, some manifestation of it self their through, which the soul is capable to know as at a distance, and through the judgement and wrath so that as the Lord remembreth mercy-unto lost man, in the midst of wrath, the poor soul can look at the mercy and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it in the midst of the Wrath, but it is so manifested, that it begetteth in the heart a most infallible conviction, that the mercy and love, which it discovereth, as at a distance, and

This fiery wall must be climbed, this sea must be swimed over, this gulf must be shot, before this immediate manifestation and enjoyment of the mercy and love of God, can be reached unto, which is the heavenly prize, the City of refuge, the land of rest and peace, on the other side of the lake or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now if any grant that the things aforesaid, and the divine power, vertue, light, life, and spirit of God, can in itself be felt, and tasted of, that it is sensible by or unto the spiritual mind, such must also grant, that it is objective, for because it is objective, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is sensible, or may be felt, as because outward light and colours are objective, therefore they are visible, or I can see them, and because an outward sound is objective, therefore it is audible, and I can hear it, and so of the rest, for what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is objective is sensible, and whatever is sensible, feelable, or perceiveable in it self is objective, but what is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective is not feelable, cannot be felt, tasted, favoured. And so if the Lord himself be not objectively manifest in us, he cannot be seen, nor heard, nor tasted, nor felt, and thus it is according to the School men and national teachers doctrine, who generally being men void of all sence and feeling of God have in the blindness of their minds, and in the wisdom from below, that is carnal earthly and divilish, framed and invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this perverse doctrine for their own gains and ends, that all seeing, and hearing of God himself; or immediate converse with him, by object ve manifestations is not a thing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, as being ceased, and never given as a general privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge unto the Saints; but only unto some particular persons by way of special priviledg and extraordinary, and some who have both seen and tasted the things of God in themselves, in some small measure, have been staggered through their lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more unto the false Doctrine of their teachers, in this thing, then unto their own felt and known experience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (I am perswaded) some contrary to what they have s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We on the contrary affirm, and I affirm it from the manifold and blessed experience given me thereof from God, and many are witnesses with me in this matter, to the stopping the mouthes of all gainsayers, that God himself, his power, vertue light, life and spirit, his truth, his goodness, holyness, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, his beauty and glory is prelent in us by way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is objectively manifest, so that he can be heard, seen, tasted and felt, if all scripture words were out of our present remembrance, so that if we had not one scripture expression in our veiw, to mind it, or turn it up and down in our minds, we could feel and enjoy the Lord, and have fellowship with him, whose eternal life, vertue and power is present, as a most glorious object in us, so that if we retain this object, God in our knowledge, in our mind in our feeling, in the seed

could not enjoy the spirit of the Lord, nor feel, nor taste, nor savour of his divine power, and vertue, but in or by words, for the power and vertue of Gods spirit can be felt, savoured and tasted in it self, without all words, and depends not on words in order to its being tasted and felt, more then spices, perfumes, or oyntments depends on words to make them to be felt sme'led, or savoured, so that the manifestation of the sweetness and sweet savour of the life and spirit, depends on no words but the manifestation of the words depends on the spirit which have no glory nor sweetness, nor refreshment, but what the spirit makes manifest in them, through his shinings, breathings, quicknings, and living communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>

There is no other way to God, but by the Revelation of his son, he dwells in the light inaccessible, which the mortal or natural understanding cannot approach unto clouds and darkness are round about him, he filleth all things, but is apprehended by nothing, but that which cometh from himself, is begotten of himself, and leadeth unto himself, the eye of flesh cannot see God, neither can it see any thing which is beyond its sphear, the earthly can only apprehend the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nothing can reach further then its proper object, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is bounded and limited.</p>
            <p>Now God is not the object of the eye of flesh (I do not

Now if any should object and say he means an outward Revelation, a mediate not Immediate Revelation, this will be manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by what is said already, and is yet to be said, for that you call the outward or mediate Revelation, write words spoken from without, though the best of words ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from Christ in the dayes of his flesh, or from any of the Apostles, or Prophets, and yet recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, cannot reveal the Father, nor the Son either, they point only at that which reveals, and were spoken and write for that end, that people might come to the principle of true knowledge in themselves, for first let us begin with <hi>Moses</hi> he was a man sent of God, and of Christ, he was inspired with the holy spirit, Christ spoke in him to the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and all these words could not reveal God, nor his Son unto them the vail hung before <hi>Moses</hi> face, and remains upon their hearts to this day in the reading of <hi>Moses</hi> words, and by this

he does all things, he speaks and it is done; God made the Heavens and the Earth, and this whole Fabrick of the Creation by his Word, his immediate Word; and he upholds all things thereby: <hi>God said, Let there be Light, and there was Light.

He had no other means but the word of his Mouth, the word of his eternal Power, which was in the beginning, whereby all things were made, and without it was nothing made. And now does not Man in his being Created again unto good Works, in his being formed again a new Creature, depend upon the same immediate Word of Power, which first Created him; by this is man begotten again by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever: and by this he liveth, by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; so you may see, its the Scriptures testimony, he does all things by his immediate Word; the Word worketh in all things immediately which God ever made, means are but ciphers without this, means opperate but mediately, but the Word immediately; and this Word is Christ, by whom all things are made, and in whom they are upheld; now here is the difference betwixt this noble piece of Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.

the kingdom of God stands; your building is but on the Sand, and that Church whatsoever, which is not builded on this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: Christ Jesus, immediately revealed both in the whole Body, and in every Member thereof; is not the true Church but a Synagogue of Sathan, a vile Harlot, Mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Mother of Fornicators; for the true Church is one in all ages, past, present, and to come; and it hath ever had one Foundation, which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day and for ever; and there is one Body, and one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 4, 5. Now, what was this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church of God, before ever Scripture was writ, before <hi>Moses,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> which came after, who wrot the Scriptures? Was it not Jesus Christ the Word, which was in the beginning, had it any other Foundation; and what gave them the knowledge of this Foundation? and builded them upon it, when they had no Scripture; and whereupon was their faith founded? by the hearing of what word did they come by their Faith, seeing then the Scriptures was not writ; it was even the Word which came from God himself, and taught them, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; and many of them believed, when they had no man to speak unto them. <hi>The Word of the Lord came unto Abraham when he was in his own country</hi> saying unto him, <hi>Get thee out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thy kindred, and from thy Fathers house, out of thy country, unto the Land that I will shew thee:</hi> and there was no man brought this message to him, for, those among whom he lived were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but God spoke to him by his own immediate Word, and he heard and believed, <hi>and it was counted to him for Righteousness.</hi> Thus ye may see how <hi>Abraham's</hi> Faith came by the hearing of the Word of God, proceeding from his own mouth; Now every Believer is the Seed of <hi>Abraham Gal.</hi> 3. 29. And this Faith, is the same Faith with his, (for there is but one Faith) and it hath the same Foundation, the Word of God proceeding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from himself, for no other Word is able to beget it, but the same Word of power which begot the Faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> for Faith is the gift of God, it is a Supernatural thing, and therefore it must have a supernatural Cause; it must stand in the power of God, <hi>(the Word of Power which was in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning)</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 5.

            <p>This being so weighty, and it lying before me so clearly, and it being so useful to demonstrate (so far as words may be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able therein) the matter in hand, I have been driven to insist the more largely upon it, and now to descend to <hi>David</hi> and the Prophets, and Apostles; whereas I might instance many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places in the book of the <hi>Psalmes:</hi> I shall only point at the 119 <hi>Psal.</hi> And desire the Reader in the fear of the Lord, to ponder and weigh what is therein declared concerning this Foundation and fundamental Principle, to witt the Word; and what word is it, he speaks so much, and so frequently of here and else where, when he sayes <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Thy word have I hid in my Heart,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>I will not forget thy Word.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>Quicken thou me by (or according to) thy Word,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>Strengthen me according to thy Word.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 42. <hi>I trust in thy Word.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 43. <hi>He calls it the Word of Truth.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 50. <hi>Thy Word hath quickned me.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 81, 82. <hi>I hope in thy Word, mine eyes fail for thy Word, when wilt thou comfort me.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 89. <hi>For ever O Lord, thy Word is setled in Heaven.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 105. <hi>Thy Word is a Lamp unto my Feet, and a Light unto my Path.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 123. <hi>Mine eyes fail for thy Salvation, and for the Word of thy righteousness.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 133. <hi>Order my Steps in thy Word.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 140. <hi>Thy word is very pure, therefore thy servant lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 160. <hi>Thy Word is true from the Beginning,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 162. <hi>I rejoyce at thy Words as one that findeth great spoil.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 169. <hi>Give me understanding according to thy Word.</hi>

Would not <hi>David</hi> prefer this Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Word, to the Words writ in a Book either from himself, or these before him, and in <hi>Davids</hi> time, there was but little of the Scriptures written, and if he would prefer this Word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately proceeding from the mouth of the Lord, (whereby he was Inspired, and Prophecied, and Prayed, and sung Psalms) to the words writ in a book, which were but the effect of that Word of Prophecy or Inspiration in the Heart: Then is it not clear, that in these places above cited, he understands this Word,

who heard the Ministers and Apostles (sent by him) believed their words, and the things by them declared, for had it not been this, they comeing forth declaring of such unheard of things, and so unlike, so unprobable, so foolish to the wisdom of Flesh and Blood; they could never have been received, nor gained such ground upon the World as they did: This is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what touched before, but is some-what more fully to be treated of here, being so weighty. This was it, that gave to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a proof of their Ministracy, and Call, and message that it was of God, he who sent them; Christ the Word which was in the beginning, and spoke in them to the people, the same spoke and beas Testimony to the same words and things, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the words in the Hearts and Consciences of the hearers; and this made them and their Doctrine Manifest, they had no other proof so sufficient as this, and this without any other was sufficient, and so necessary, that nothing else could certainly perswade them, for many of the Prophets wrought no Miracles, nor did they alwaies tell of things to come, and how many were Converted to the Faith, who never saw any outward Miracle wrought, and these who were past feeling or discerning the witness of God in themselves, would not believe for all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, or other outward appearance, they called them devilry, and the like; for, their hearts were hardned, and the heart that is hardned, hath the ear that should hear stopped, and the eye blinded: so was it with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his servants, yea and many times with the people of the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves, but they who had the ear to hear, the inward ear in the sensible heart did hear; and such a power oft times went along with the Messengers of the Lord, that it rent the hard Rockie heart, and broke it in pieces, and made i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And this is the Testimony of God, which is greater than the Testimony of Man, for which, it is blessed; and so their Faith stands in that which cannot be shaken, let men be shaken, and tossed, and driven to another thing or testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; yet the Foundation of the Lord standeth sure, having this Seal, this Witness in ones self: and the Faith that comes thus, stands in the power of God, the word of Power which witnesseth in them, God speaking himself in them, and this is the (so called) formal object of Faith, <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> so contend for, both agreeing in this, That it is God speaking, which is the formal object: But quoth the <hi>Papists,</hi> It is the speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and so upon the matter, They make it her Tradition: No, quoth the now <hi>Protestant,</hi> the degenerate <hi>Protestant,</hi> (for the pure primitive <hi>Protestants</hi> owned the true Foundation with us, though their discovery of it was but little,) God speaking in the Scriptures, is the object formal of our Faith, or Foundation of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The chief moving cause or medium, <hi>ex parte Objecti,</hi> why the Scriptures are to be believed, which is in effect, to make the Scriptures themselves it; for they deny, that God speaks in Man's heart, or reveals immediately in man, by voice, or word of mouth from himself by way of object: So that that which is heard, seen, or felt, is not any object im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45664:49"/>
and evident therein; only the Vail must be taken off the eye of the mind to see them in the Scriptures: and this is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Doctrine of the Priests, and Teachers in the Natural Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, as I haue discoursed with themselves both South and North; and its the Doctrine generally of the <hi>Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> so called, as they stand at this day; and now they say in their Pulpits and else-where, That we do them great wrong, when we affirm, They deny immediate Revelation, and the teachings of Gods Spirit, for they say, that we maintain, but in such a way, and not in such a way, as is before declared; and I have asked some of them, If they be for an inward Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Testimony, or Teaching of the Spirit of God, then whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the inward of the Spirit, or the outward of the Letter the most evident, certain, or perswasive to me? I have been answered, (though some hath said, That of the Letter, is the greatest, weightiest, most evident, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> They are not two Revelations, the inward and the outward, but they are one and the same Revelation, Testimony, or Teaching, caused by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Mediums, the Scriptures by way of Object, the Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, and the Mind concurring therewith, by way of Power or Faculty; as when I look upon a Lillie, three things concurr to make me see it, the Eye, the Light, and the Lillie; and if one of the three be wanting, there will be no sight of the Lillie, yet the Eye makes not one Vision, the Lillie ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but one and the same Vision is made with both, and so the Revelation of the Spirit, is not to be compared with the outward of the Letter say they: Whether is best or most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, these being not two but one, and each midst being Supream, or greatest in its kind; the one <hi>ex parte subjecti,</hi> the other <hi>ex parte objecti:</hi> and that <hi>ex parte subjecti,</hi> they call <hi>medium in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitum, assentiendi,</hi> that which gives the knowledge of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but is not known itself Immediately, or first known or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and then giving the knowledge of the other, as the Eye is <hi>medium incognitum videndi,</hi> it gives the sight, but is not seen it self; so the fore-cited <hi>Robert Barron.</hi> And I have found it with men th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

are for Immediate Revelation, but it is well known they deny it, both in Principle and Practice, and did they not deny it: Why persecute they such who are for it; and were they for the immediate Teachings of Gods Spirit in man's Heart: Why oppose they such who witnesseth it, and are not better learned? and when they say, They are taught, and called of God to Preach, as <hi>Peter</hi> and many others, who had not book learning. O (they cry out) Fancy, Delusion, Revelation Immediate is ceased: And they are very blind who see not, that upon this Foundations of denying Immediate Revelation, or teaching of Gods Spirit, depends their Church, Ministery, and the whole Clergy, and their so called Theology, and Philosophy, Schools, and Colledges, for if once people were perswaded and convinced, That God did Teach, and would teach them, who wait on him; such and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more things, and in a more excellent way than are taught by them, for such great Summs of Mony then they would turn their backs upon them, and their Colledges would become like the <hi>Abacies</hi> at this day (which lodged that Prophane Rabble of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers,</hi> who pretended to as great Spirituality, as the National Priests do) an habitation for Owles and Ravencus Beasts, and then down should all the Proud, Lording, lofty Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, with their many degrees of <hi>Doctorships, Lordships,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterships</hi> pass; who being strangers to the true knowledge, which is Life, Peace, Joy and Satisfaction in full assurance to the Soul, are vainly puffed up in their fleshly minds, by the form of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Letter; as I was my self, whilst among them, and thought all men Idiots, and unlearned, who were not sk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45664:50"/>
though some of them could not read a Letter, yet I find them wiser than all the Teachers, I ever formally had been under, and now the Lord has brought me into a Measure of the same living knowledge from his own mouth; and if people were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that there is such a blessed and glorious dispensation, and so freely attained, they would turn their backs upon the old rotten Clergy, (for I cannot call it no better,) and waite upon the Lord for knowledge; and these they would only hear who were taught of God themselves: and the condition of their Disciples and Flocks, who generally are more barbarous, wicked, and ungodly than the savage <hi>Indians,</hi> too manifestly declares, they are not brought to the true knowledge and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the principle whereof, is the fear of the Lord, which redeems the mind out of all such practises they are found in. And now I shall lay open a little, this d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now behold the deceit of the Serpent, which lieth alwaies near to betray from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is life, and comes from the Spirit of God; and to snare them with a knowledge, which comes but from the Letter, and their dark minds, together with his suggestions and inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereinto, and so they come to acknowledge which is the brat of the earthly Spirit; this hatches and brings it forth, and the Devil begot it, and is the Father of it: and this wisdome is called by <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 15. Earthly, Sensual, and Devilish, and is not from above; so then ye may perceive, there is a wisdom and knowledge of the Scriptures, that is devilish: such had the Priests, Pharisees, and Lawyers of the <hi>Iews,</hi> much Scripture Letter knowledge, but it was devilish; for they killed Christ. Now these who are endued with this knowledge, think farr otherwise, they think it is spiritual knowledge, and spiritual it is in that sense; as wickedness is called Spiritual, but they are apt to think, it has come from the Spirit of God, whereas it is from the Devil; and here the Devil who gives it them, covers

himself, so that he cannot be seen, and the knowledge cannot be known of what nature it is, till the principle or spring, from whence it springs or flowes, be discovered, known, seen, felt, or perceived; and now he having so deceived them, as to make them believe, this is not attainable; the spring or principle, which gives the knowledge, is not immediately to be known: This was the Prophets and Apostles priviledge, who had a knowledge of the Principle in its immediate Manifestation, which taught them, they could perceive the Fountain clearly, from whence it flowed, it was Revealed to them Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but this is now ceased, and we must gather only the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Principle that indues us by consequence; (and what a poor uncertain blind knowledge, is this I may afterwards demonstrate when I come to examine that they call their assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) and thus they continue in the dark, though they have a knowledge; yet they cannot certainly tell, who is the Father of it, who begot it, who inspired it, they feel not the principle, nor seeth, nor perceiveth it, its <hi>medium incognitum assentiendi,</hi> that is, an unknown midst of assenting, and yet they think all is well, and their knowledge is true and good enough; as a Man that has the Jaundies, which seeth the object, let it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so White, he judgeth it to be yellow, and thinks he see well enough, not seeing the yellow vitious humour in his eye that beguiles him; but now if he could see his eye, to compare it with another Man's eye, than he would be convinced, his sight was not the right sight, for he would perceive, that the Principle is vitiated, and that vitiates the sight; and so they not knowing the Principle clearly and distinctly in it self, when any motion or operation comes in upon their minds; let it be although concerning such or such things, some Scriptures brought to their remembrance, or some thing bearing it self in, as duty; were it to pray, or give almes, or read, or hear, or the like; and finding some inclination begetting a bentness in them, and driving them by way of impulse to such or such a thing: Now, they not knowing manifestly the ground or principle from which these thoughts, suggestions, motions and inclinations arise; what a loss are they at? and how great is the danger they are in? as if a man at midnight were walking amongst Coal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45664:51"/>
he is as ready to fall in the pit, as keep the right way, and much more, having no guid certainly to direct him in this thing; and now these Motives, Thoughts, and Inclinations, and workings, arising from the wrong Spirit and Principle, though they had never so great a shew, to be good and duty, yet they are not to be cherished, received, or obeyed, and he who obeys them, serves the Devil, and not God. Again, a Motive or Inclination, or opening, concerning such or such a thing, proceeding from the spirit of the Lord, if it be not received, followed and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this becomes fin and grieves, and provokes the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; and so man in this state, not knowing certainly and infallibly, the spring and principle that moves him, is equally ready to serve the Devil as God, yea much more, for he being captivated in the darkness, the Devil rules in him at his pleasure; for certain it is, what ever is moved in Man's heart, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds either from the Spirit of Satan, or from the Spirit of God; now he who has the true eve opened in the sensible part in him, perceives manifestly the Spring, whence the motions arise; if it be of God, it feels it to be so, and is refreshed with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly vertue and power that moves him, and it fills his heart with joy and peace unspeakable, the nature of which joy, is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be pure in the Light which manifestes it. Again, if the motion be of the Devil, the eye in the sensible part mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly discernes it in the Light, and feels the Spring or Principle from which it arises, and he is burthened with it, and that of the Lords begetting in his heart, hath no union with it, nor can close with it; and power from God arises and resistes it in the heart; and thus when the enemy would come in as a flood, the Spirit of the Lord sets up a standard and bullwark against him: and O what a sweet blessed and comfortable condition is this, to know every Motion that moves in the Soul; to have Judgment so set up, the pure Judgment from the Lord in the heart, which passes an infallible sentence upon every thought and inclination, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Nature, and stamping as it were upon the face, a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription shewing whose it is. This is the spiritual Man which judges all things, and is judged of no man; he is a Child of the day, and walks in the Light where is no occasion of stumbling; and he knoweth whither he goeth, and whom he serveth, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45664:51"/>
whose work he doth; and this man doth all in Faith, from a full unshaken perswasion, that he is allowed and approved of God in what he does, and so he serves God in all things, and glorifies him in his Body and in his Spirit, which are the Lords; and till Man return to this state, which was the pure state of his first Creation, he shall never have true Peace, or Content, or Joy or Rest, but find Judgment from the Lord pursuing him, if he be not past feeling; and this was my own condition in a day, O how did I lament before the Lord because of the thick Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness wherein I was so choaked, that I had no manifest or infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible feeling of that which is my life to day, the blessed Spirit of God; and when many things moved in me, and thoughts come in upon my mind, how was I ground as betwixt two Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones with doubts on the one hand lest they were of God, and fears on the other to the contrary, and I had no certainty of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and so what ever I did, I was Condemned, and full well I knew the truth of that Scripture, <hi>He that doubteth is Damned:</hi> and I never came to the full and manifest Perswasion what Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Principle moved in me, till I came to a cessation of all my own works, in the self will, and then in the stillness I learned the Judgment of God, concerning every thing in me; and in that day I cryed out and questioned in my heart saying, Is such a thing possible at this day, (for I had no doubt, but the Prophets and Apostles, and Saints of old have it) for me to know that Spirit that moveth in me, to have a feeling or sensation of it, which would put me out of doubt; as when I taste Wine or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Vinegar, I discern each of them Manifestly, and has no doubt concerning them; and by the Lords merciful Providence and his good hand that led me, in a way I knew not; I met with a People who told me there was such a blessed Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they were brought into it in their measures, and they said to me, God was to be known and his holy blessed Spirit, by a sensation or feeling, which begot a ravishing unspeakable Joy, sweetness and delight in the Soul, such as I never concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, neither could it enter into my heart, till it were Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the; and as I keeped to that which judged me, gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it raised up a pure sense and discerning in me, and begot a birth of Life in me, which could feel its Spring or Principle:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45664:52"/>
And this is man's happiness, and till he come hither, he is in Darkness, and walks he knows not whither, and works, he knows not whose work it is, or whom he serves; for now these thoughts motions, or inclinations of the mind being so secret, what can judge them? but the Word of God alone; that Eternal Word of Power Jesus Christ, before whom, all things are naked and bare, which is quick and powerful, and sharper than a Two-edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-Sword, to devide betwixt the Soul and Spirit, and is a discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; all Scripture words come short here, infinitely short, for the Devil can, and oft doth, Transform himself into the likeness of an Angel of Light, and puts on the sheeps cloathing, the good words, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture words he can suggest them, and teach man to spin out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny subtil notions &amp; interpretations about them, which things also may be true upon the matter being known and received from, and retained in the false spirit, is but an Idol and not the Truth. Again, there are many things which a man does, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves considered, may be done, or not done; and so they being considered meerly in themselves, are neither good or evil, and become only so according to the Principle which moves in mens hearts thereto; good, because from the Spirit of God Man is moved thereto; and evil, because from the wrong Spirit Man is moved to do them: and so it comes oft to pass, that two Men doing the same things upon the matter, or speaking the ame words; suppose the giving of almes, or speaking of some swords by way of exhortation, or prayer, or the like; the one may be justified of God, doing the same from the movings of his Spirit, the other Condemned, doing them from the wrong Spirit, or Principle; and yet doth so far go playing together as Scripture words can go with them; and here the words fall short to judge them, both useing the words or things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, allowable by them; but now the one doing in the Faith, which gives the feeling of the Principle of God which moves him, is accepted; and the other doing but in the form and immitation, and from the wrong Spirit and Principle is reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his service abomination before God: And if one would say, These inward secret Motions may be judged by their fruits, which afterwards outwardly appear? I answer, That is too late,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45664:52"/>
and the enemy may proceed so great a length, before the fruits outwardly appear, as to have wholly captivated Man into his snares, so as he cannot get rid, and then he will readily teach him to Justifie the Fruit also: But though they were seen to be evil it is too late; according to the wise saying of the Poet,

Evil is to be resisted in its first appearance; (the Serpent is to be crushed in the Egg,) And how shall it be resisted, if it be not manifestly known: And hereby it may further appear, how absolutely necessary it is for man to know the guidance of the Lord Immediately by the Revelation of his Light and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to order him in the stepps of his conversation, for it is not in man to direct his stepps; and he is in all his waies to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Lord, and to be found in his will in all things, doing all in his name; that is, in his Power, in the leadings of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, to walk after that in all things, else he cannot do all in Faith, having in all he doth, either the express Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord thereanent, or at least his approbation; feeling in his Spirit, the Lord giving him liberty: and how far short do the Scriptures fall, to tell a man, what he is to do in all the circumstances and emergencies of Providences which fall out in his life time, no rational man but seeth; a World full of Books could not contain, rules and directions to a man in all things, which yet are all to be done in Faith, the Foundation whereof, is the Word of God, and his Revealed Will; and if one should plead, that general rules of Scripture, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples may serve the turn, who see not, they cannot but fall short, there being no rule immaginary so generall concerning things in themselves indifferent, but suffer thousands of exceptions and examples also; yea, and many times these things which in the general look as duty; when the particular comes to be weighed in the ballance of Righteous Judgment, it is Sin; As for instance, Parents are to be obeyed, but now, what if they command that which God forbids, then they are to be denied therein, and many times the case is so doubtful, whether the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45664:53"/>
thing commanded be against or with the command of the Lord: one sayes it is, and seeks to Justifie it by Scriptures; another sayes it is not, and condemns it from Scriptures, and what can be a touch-stone in such cases, but the Light of Christ which makes all Manifest, and many have seen this, how general rules the best of them all, as they lye in words fail to determine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, as in that and the like, <hi>Fus suum est cuique tribuendum,</hi> every man is to have what is proper, or belonging to him; and yet this suffers many exceptions, as if a Mad-man would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his own knife from another that has it, to cut his own Throat, it is to be denied; and oft times the case in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cloathed with such and such circumstances is exceeding doubtful, when the general is clear; and therefore they make a vertue, they call <hi>Epieikeia</hi> in Greek, and to this, they give the Office of Modifying, and Judging in such cases, how far the general rule of equity is to be kept to, or receded from, in such cases as requires exception; as for instance, mans right must yield to Gods right, and the right of particulars must yield to the right in general; and this is the work of that vertue <gap reason="foreign">

Now observe what he makes the object of a Christians sight, knowledg or discerning, not words, but things; and how far short words fall of the things, is above manifested: next he makes this object, not things temporal, things visible, that falls under the preception of the carnal eye, or ear, or whatever is of this corruptible World; now though the things reported of in Scripture, be eternal, yet the words of the Scripture as they can be read, or heard with the eye or ear of flesh are not eternal, for nothing they can perceive is such; now again, see how far the Apostle shuts forth words, or the best of conceptions, or thoughts, or speculations of Mans heart, or whatever can be perceived that way, from being the object of this eye or sence of the Lords begetting in man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> Now all the words of the Scripture, the eye hath seen, or may see; the ear hear, and they may enter into the heart of man to conceive the words, and form many conceptions on them; but the things have never entred, which the Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port off into his heart, it is true, he may form one image or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of them in his mind as if I should form a likeness of such a Man or Countrey I never saw, but only heard off; this were not the true representation, no more is that, its but an Idol, and Revelations 2. 17. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, and will give him a white Stone, and in the stone a new Name, written, which no man knoweth, but he that receives it.</hi> Lo, here is the object of his knowledge that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh,

and none knew this object but he: The hidden Manna, the white Stone, and the new name, and what is this object but the Son of the Fathers Love Jesus Christ, himself, not only revealing, but revealed in the Soul; not only causing a man to know, but being himself known. The eternal Life it self ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested, He is this hidden Manna, this white Stone in which the Name is written, and now is not a sight of him manifested, seen, heard, handled, more than all words; is not this one object re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, which onely himself can reveal: Oh, what an indignity do ye to Christ, and to that holy, pure, chaste, birth of his beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in man, who deny, that any more of the glory of Christ is to be known; but what letters of Sylables, or sounds in the Air, can contain, they give indeed a true report of him, and of his glory, but infinitely falls the report short of a sight of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; one glimpse of his lovely Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But, the Natural Man receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned, Lo how he makes them impossible to be known to the Natural Man, or understanding, because the knowledge of them stands in an other Principle, in that which is born of the Spirit of God, the Seed of God, that can only know them; they are spiritually discerned: And this further Consideration will yet make it more appear, That man of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self without the Revelation and Inspiration of the Spirit of God cannot understand the things of God, and so cannot Interpret the Scriptures, declaring of them, because Man as he stands in the Fall, and not come to be Regenerate, lives, and is quite sunkinto a Wisdom, Knowledg, and Understanding that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together contrary to the wisdom of God, and the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God; it is true as is already said, there is somewhat in man, which Judgeth truly, and pertinently of things Natural, and this of it self, is not contrary to the wisdom of God, but a gift of God, and is of good use to Man, were it in its right place, and by this, man properly is a Man, he has a rational Principle in him, whereby, in this he excells the Beast of the Field; but now man in the Fall, stands not in this Principle, it rules not in him, there is another birth in man, which Lords it, and rules in him, and this birth is of the Devils begetting, and hereby Man is a Child of the Devill: For this Seed whereof this Birth is begotten, was sown into mans heart when he Fell, and it has ever propagated and spread it self through <hi>Adams</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity since, and this Seed and Birth has a Wisdom, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is Carnal, Earthly, and Devilish, and is direct, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, and contrary to the wisdom of God, as every thing of this birth, is contrary to every thing of the birth of the Spirit of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17.

So it is clear, That the reasonings of man standing in this wisdom which is altogether contrary to the true wisdom and knowledg of God; are so far from being a help to him, to further him in the true knowledg, that it is a strong hold against it, and therefore is to be cast down ere a man can come to the true knowledg which proceeds from the meek and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of Jesus Christ, the beginning of which wisdom, is the fear of God, and so the more that a man is indued with the knowledg of Letters, and other parts, (which might be of use to him, were he come to have his mind Redeemed into Gods fear, and so to have the wisdom of God to rule in him) while he remains in the natural unregenerate State; the more these things are a loss and snare unto him: and this is that wisdom the Apostle speaks of, when he sayes <hi>The World by wisdom knew not God,</hi> and this Wisdom being a Type in the learned Doctours, Rabbies, Scrybes, and Phtises, among the <hi>Iews,</hi> led them from the knowledg of Jesus Christ, so that they not only did mistake him, notwithstanding, of all the Scripture skill, but said, he had a Devil, and prevailed with the Rulers to Crucifie him, and Persecute all his followers; and this wisdom in them, taught them to reason against Christ, from the Scriptures, this Man cannot be of God say they, because he breaks the Sabbath, and despiseth <hi>Moses</hi> Law; but now the eye of that wisdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open in them, which cannot but judge amiss of the things of God, they misunderstood the Scriptures, and wrested them to

Now all this while I have not denyed, that there is any thing in man, who may be in a Natural State, that can in any way, or manner know any thing of God; the Natural Man cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that is to say, that Principle which in man, makes him a man, and Distinguishes him from a Beast; That of it self can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know the things of Gods heavenly Kingdom, because they are above its reach; and then far less can that Man or Birth of the Devills begetting, called the old Man know them, for its wisdom is contrary thereto; but now there is a Seed of God in Man, even in that State which is shut up in Death, or Darkness, under this earthly Wisdom, which as a vaile blinds it, yet the Light of Christ shines so thorow the Vail in this State, as that it reaches the Seed, and ministers some knowledge to Man in this State, whereby he knows he ought to be righteous, and sober, and godly in a Measure, and knows some things to be good, and some things to be vile; and were man faithful to that which gives him this knowledge, it would redeem his mind out of the false wisdom, and increase in him the true knowledg, but man remaining Disobedient, the earthly wisdom getteth dominion in him, and the more it rules him, the more it blinds

him, till he be altogether past feeling, and then it is so with him, as with these, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 10. Now whereas it is commonly said, that Scripture is the best Interpreter of Scriptures for what is obscure in one place, is plain in another; and so the obscure is to be expounded by the plain, and there's as much of the Scripture plain, as is necessary for any man to know: to this I answer in the words of <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>They are all plain to him that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth,</hi> to him who is endued with a measure of the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that gave them forth, which has revealed to him, the things by them declared; so a man knowing the things, the words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them stand open and clear, and plain to his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for they are plain and manifest to that eye and ear which can read, hear, and understand them; but now the plainest Scripture in the Bible treating of the things of Gods Kingdom, which are most necessary to be known, is dark, and obscure, and mysterious to the Natural Man, and foolishness to the fleshly wisdom, for that the things are not known by him, and so he cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the words concerning them; for the knowledg of the things, is as it were, a key to open up the words, but the plainest words that are, cannot give the knowledg of the things, which are onely known by a Spiritual discerning: Is not that a plain Scripture, <hi>Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.</hi> But what learned man with all his Letter knowledg understands it; not having that love by the Spirit of God shed abroad in his heart: The man who cannot read a letter, and has a feeling of this Love, abiding in him, a thousand fold more knows that Scripture, and can speak more pertinently concerning it, from the feeling thereof, and what it has wrought in him; than the other can do from his housefull of Books, and other helps of Learning. Now I acknowledg, that some Scriptures are more plain and open than others, and the spiritual man, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing man who has revealed a true Judgment, and pure dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning from the Lord, he can know what Scripture is more plain, and what more obscure; and so standing in the wisdom of God and in his Counsel, he may compare Scripture with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Spiritualls with Spiritualls, and so he may open up, the obscure from the plain, and reason and reduce consequents From the more plain to open up the more obscure, and this which

               </gap>, which judges in him of Scriptures, and what consequence may be drawn, must be that of the Spirit of the Lords begetting in him, which cannot judge amiss, but it alwaies judges righteous Judgment; and so the opening up the Scripture more obscure from the more plain, will be of good service, in its place, to the hearer, for the speaker opening Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the wisdom and Power of God reaches the seed in Man, and the plainest Scripture is apt to reach; and the Lord stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth near to testifie to the words so interpreted, and this witness in Man's Conscience answers to the truth, of what is declared; and so I acknowledg, there is great use and service in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting of Scriptures, when the interpreter hath his gift of God, and keeps within his measure, and speaks according to the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie or proportion of Faith, according to what is revealed to him, the measure of the gift of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 7. This is that, which <hi>Paul</hi> makes the rule of interpretation, See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>We will not boast</hi> (said he) <hi>of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule, which God hath describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us:</hi> see further, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 18. 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. compared with <hi>Phil.</hi> 6. 3, 15. 16. Lo how in this place he presses no man further to believe him, or be of the same mind with him; then according to what God hath revealed to him, if any man be other wayes minded, God shall reveal even this to him; nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule; see how he makes the measure of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; The Rule; but now a man medling with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture in his own wisdom, out of the wisdom of God, how can he but err, if he come to read and compare, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Scripture; and so to open up one Scripture from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with that eye which cannot but Judge amiss; the Light of the Body is the Eye, if therefore the Eye be single, the whole body is full of Light, but if the Light in him be Darkness, how great is his Darkness; the Eye of that wisdom in him, which is contrary to the wisdom of God, being Judge in him, it must of necessity Judge amiss, especially, seeing that Scripture words in themselves (abstracting from the mind of the Spirit of Christ, which such have not) are admittable of different Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not only different readings, according to the Translations
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45664:60"/>
which differ, but the same word being rightly Translated; may in themselves rightly considered, have different meanings; how then shall the meaning of the Spirit be had without its own reaching, what an impossible thing were it, to hit right upon the true sense, or interpretation, without the Spirit of God, though there were nothing in m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>n that had a byass, or prejudice against the Truth; but now that Spirit which is of this World, and is contrary to the Spirit of God, and his truth, being Judge in him: this makes it far more impossible. So it's a thing of great weight and concernment, for a man to know of what Spirit he is, what Spirit is Judge in him, what Spirit leads him, what eye is open in him, for according to this, so will be the interpretation of Scripture; for although they say, that Scripture expounds Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet at best, it's but that, by which it is expounded; but now that Spirit, or Principle, or Wisdom in man, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares Scripture with Scripture, which reasons and draweth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, and judges of them; that is the interpreter: So the result of all is, such is the Judgment, and Interpretation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the right or wrong Spirit, which rules in him, and the wrong Spirit cannot but wrest, add to, and take from Scripture, and the Curse is pronounced against it, and the right Spirit, the Spirit of God, and the eye which it opens in man, cannot judge amiss, it passeth alwaies Righteous Judgment. And O that men would consider this, so weighty a thing, who go on so rashly to meddle with Scripture, and give meanings to it, what Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit they are of, what is that in them which gives the meaning of it, if it be not the heavenly wisdom it cannot but wrest, and what is the reason that there are so many different Religions in the World, and opinions, one contrary to another; whereas, the Truth, and true Religion is but one, and so many hundred different interpretations of Scripture, but that mens minds are gone from the Spirit of truth, which would make them all of one mind, and open the like eye in all, and then all would judg as unanimously of Scripture; as now the bodily eye judges of things visible, men make no contest or jarring about what they see, looking upon the same objects, through the same midst, with the like eye, which being sound, makes all their judgments one, and till men come to the one Spirit, which opens the like
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45664:61"/>
eye in all they can never be of one mind, and whereas people so much, ask at us whom made ye judge of interpreting of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I say, the measure of the gift in every one, the measure of the wisdom given of God; and till Man come to this, and judges in it, or rather it in him; he steps up into the place of Judgment, which belongs not to him, and he ought not to Judge. And I may shut up all concerning this particular, with a word of advice to such, who are so ready to meddle with Interpretation of Scriptures, giving meanings on them, and are so confident they are right, and yet many of them are not come to the fear of God, which is the beginning of that wisdom, which only can judge aright of Scriptures: To such I say, Take heed to your Spirits, be jealous over them, know what Spirit ye are of, for on this thing depends all; if this be not known, if ye be in the doubt concerning this, ye know nothing yet truly, for the Principle being doubtful, the foundation being uncertain, so much of necessity be the whole superstructure.</p>

               <hi>Argument,</hi> 13. And now as I have demonstrated, how that by the Revelation of the Spirit of Jesus Christ in Man, he only can know God and the things of his Kingdom, and the Scriptures with their interpretation: so I am to show, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by can man only know himself, and the state he stands in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, whether Justified, or Condemned; without this, he can have no true, nor infallible assurance of Gods love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: That there is such a thing attainable to every Believer, and necessary for him to know, as to his comfortable walking with God, the Scriptures manifestly declare, and it's general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged, it's to become to, and sought after, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I shall not insist on the proveing of it being granted, only the way how it is attained; that is it I plead for, That it is only by the Immediate Revelation of the Spirit of Christ, Justifying the man in his heart; <hi>He is near that Iustifyeth,</hi> saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, so near that he is in him, and justifieth him in his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and without this, man can never have true assurance, till God justifieth him; mans justification, or words only spoke without, can do nothing) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>The Spirit it self beareth witness with our Spirits, that we are the children of God:</hi> Not the words of Scripture, or the words of the Spirit spoke to, or in

It's true, some works are so manifestly evil, as Cursing, Swearing, Drunkenness, Lying, Stealing, Killing, Whoreing, that they are readily known by all to be such; and that which makes them known, is the Light of Christ in their hearts, but now these works, which carry in them an appearance to be good, and yet are not good, but dead works, empty, without Life, though they have a fair show, yet they are rottenness within, as its reported of some Aples, that have a very pleasant colour, but are poyson within; how shall man judge of these, now he who has Life in himself, the birth begotten of God; he has a Spiritual sence, and discerning, whereby he can savour, smell, and taste of the works, the fruits of the good tree, for they have a good favour, a living spiritual savour, they smell, and taste of the Tree of Life, on which they grow; hence they are called living works, and these in the Light which reveals them, and makes all manifest, or seen to be good: And the works have but the appearance, they are also seen and discerned to be such, and being evil, they cast an evil favour, by which in the Light, which begets the discerning, they are felt, and he can have no union with them, nor with the tree, on which they grow; and this man discerneth in the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Light, both his own, and his neighbours works, of what nature they are, by the casting and smelling of the fruit, the Tree is known, both in himself and his neighbour, and this is a great Mystery, and hard to be received with such, who have not got that taste, and discerning, begot in them of the Lord, which tasteth words, and works, as the mouth tasteth meat; but hereto I give my testimony, that there is such a thing, and I do witness it in my measure, and so I confess there are Signes, and Characters of a mans state, the fruits infallibly manifest the tree, but the fruits cannot be certainly and infallibly known, but in and by the Light, which reveals them, and begets a tast

And this further makes it the more impossible; for a Man without Revelation to know his state, especially, according to our Advessaries Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; for, whereas Christ said, <hi>Whereby shall ye know, that ye love me, if ye keep my Commandements.</hi> Now they say, that is impossible, we must break them every day in thought, word, and deed, and we must remain in a necessity of sinning while we remain in the body; and this Principle, takes every wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane wretch to cover his wickedness: O sayes he, the Children of God have their infirmities, <hi>David</hi> fell, in Murther and Adultery, <hi>Noah</hi> into Darkness, <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Master, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the common Swearer, Drunkard, Whoremonger, Backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Cheater, Worldling say, This is my infirmity and the best have their infirmities: I have a good heart and am sincere for all this, and I approve not my doings, and I may have true faith for all this, and be in a Justified condition: Now passing this Decept of theirs, which their Teachers have caused them to drink in, I shall only at this time use it so far against them, as to demonstrate all their signes and marks, come short to give them assurance; for now according to their own Confession, their keeping the Commandments, cannot be a Sign to them, for they cannot come up to keep them, and their evil works are many, and much more than their good; how then shall the good Tree be found by its fruits, seeing the good Tree cannot bring forth evil fruits, and how shall the good in this mixture be known from the evil; and this yet increases the difficulty in the point of Tryal, that not the quantity, or the measure is to be looked into, of goodness, or grace in Man; but the quantity, kind, or nature, and it's true that it is so: Now where there is so much of the evil, and so little of the good, like a dust of Gold, a little grain, in a dunghill of evil, whose nature is to hide the good; how can it appear, or be infallibly known, but by the Revelation of the Light of Christ, which searches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The contrary is above Demonstrated in many places, And Immediate Revelation, and the Spirit of Prophecy, was before them, even from the beginning, and continued after them; and Church History reports, it continued till after the first Century, and was known in the Church; and it has alwaies been in the true Church, (though not in the false) and is a Priviledge belonging to every Saint, for that which makes one a true Christian and Saint, is the Spirit of Christ, the anoynting in him.</p>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> That working of Miracles, and the guift of Tongues, is altogether Ceased, and never any more to be in the Earth, cannot be proved, and it's a rash assertion; for, though these things be not to be found among the National Christians (who have the name, but want the thing, the anoynting, which Christians, or makes the Christian, and not the sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of water on a Childs forehead) yet they may be found among the true; and we Witness the Power of God, which wrought all these outward Miracles, working Miraculously in our Hearts, opening the blind eye of the mind, and deaf ear, raising to life, the dead Soul; causing the Lame, to leap as an Hart, and the Tongue of the Dumb to speak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And these are the greatest Miracles, and the outward, were but a Figure of them; and were for the sake of the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who believed not except they saw, but now, though Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and gifts of Tongues were ceased altogether, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not, That Revelation Immediate is Ceased: This being more necessary, yea, altogether necessary, and belonging to the very substance of the Covenant, and promises of the Gosel, as is above Demonstrated.</p>

Obj. 3. <hi>Men may be mistaken, and take that for the Inspiration of God, which is but the Inspiration of the Devil; and it is Impossible to know the one from the other, but by the Scriptures, which ye deny to be a sufficient touch-stone, or rule of Tryal of Spirits, and there hath many formerly risen up, who has pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Inspired of God, and were but Deceivers; and this makes us fustly suspect all others.</hi>

And such who plead against Immediate Revelation, or Impiration from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, as a thing impossible to be infallibly discerned from a delusion of <hi>Satan,</hi> shew the <hi>Atheism</hi> of their hearts, for if it be impossible, then was not <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> Inspired, nor knew God by Revelation; but if Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was possible then, it is possible now, for that which is once possible, can never in it self become impossible; and what though some have falsely pretended thereto, and from a pretence of the Spirit, have done wickedly, will this prove man has not the thing in reality; there were pretenders in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah's</hi> time to the Spirit of God, and did wickedly under that pretence, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23. 25, 30, 31. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 28. 1, 2, 3. 4. And so there were many false Prophets in all ages; but this is no argument against the true Prophets, nor against Immediate Revelation, but for it; for this only can discover

the Deceiver, and Spirit of deceipt, both in Man himself, and in another: and many has pretended to Mortification, Self-denyal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but never knew these things in reality; none do therefore now know them in reality; and many has done wickedly, under a pretence of Scripture, is therefore Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be denyed?</p>
            <p>4.

And <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 19, 20. What do they prove, that no more Scripture was to be, writ after
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:45664:70"/>
them? whereas, they themselves acknowledg the most part of Scripture was written afterwards, and in the by, I would only have the Reader observe, how like these men who talke of the Scripture Canon being filled up, so that the Spirit of Prophecy is Ceased, are to the <hi>Iews</hi> who had such a fancy among them concerning the Scriptures of the Old Testament, their being filled up, and their becoming a Rule to them, so that when Christ and his Apostles came and spoke from the same Spirit, the Scriptures were writ from, they would not hear them, but cryed up the Scriptures, We have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and God spoke unto <hi>Moses</hi> and our Fathers, but this Man, <hi>we know not from whence he is,</hi> Joh. 9. 28, 29. And as for Prov. 22. 19, 20, 21. There is wisdom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ught in speaking to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and making known her words and writeing unto him; but that proves nothing, That the speaking of that wisdom or spirit in others, as in <hi>Solomon</hi> is Ceased: Nor yet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 19, 29. <hi>To the Law and to the Testimony, if they speak not according to this word, &amp;c.</hi> Now could this be a good Argument for the <hi>Iews,</hi> against Christ and his Apostles, and their Writeings? No, nor is not now against writeings, or words proceeding from the Inspiration of the same Spirit; for that which was writ after, or is to be writ from the Spirit of God, is not contrary to any thing writ before from the same Spirit, but according to it, for all the words of truth accord, and agree together; and there was a Law and Testimony writ in Men's Hearts, before a Line of Scripture was ever writ in a Book; and they who spoke not according thereto, were but deceivers, and had no morneing in them as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> carries it. And now I come to that Scripture they lay so much weight upon, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. 16, 17. But what? Does the Cannon close here? is not the next Chapter writ from the Inspiration of the Spirit of God, and the other following Books, if they were writ after this as they follow after it? or if these words prove not, but that <hi>Paul</hi> and others both spoke and wrot afterwards from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of the holy Ghost, how will it prove that there is no such thing now? O say they all new Revelations are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstuous, there needs no more Scripture; that which is writ
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45664:71"/>
is writ, is able to make wise unto Salvation, from a <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17. But I say, <hi>Paul</hi> and others wrot Scriptures afterwards. But to come to that Scripture, It is to be considered, there is a writeing by the Spirit of God upon Man's heart, See 1 <hi>Chron,</hi> 28. 12. Compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 19. and with <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31. 33, and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 33. And so this is Scripture or Writeing, (for both are one) by the inspiration of God; Scripture or writeing with Pen and Ink upon paper, but with the Spirit of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, upon the heart; and these holy writeings, are able to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> unto Salvation: And Scripture given unto a Man by Inspiration of God is profitable, (and the words should be thus Translated; All Scripture given by Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, or all Writting given by Inspiration of God, profitable for Doctrine, for Reproofs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Man of God may be perfect, for the word <hi>(is)</hi> is not in the <hi>Greek,</hi> and it's false, that all writeing is by Inspiration of God, for much has been writ from the Inspiration of the Devil; But I acknowledge these Books set down in our Bible, to be writ from the Inspiration of God, and when any man receives them by Inspiration, that they be given him by Inspiration, as to these who wrot them, then they are profitable to him; but if he come not to that Spirit which inspired the first Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and there-with to be Inspired, they cannot of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves profit; for the Letter kills, but the Spirit giveth life, and the Inspiration of the holy Spirit giveth understanding, as saith <hi>Elihu;</hi> so who come not to this Inspiration, they come not to an Understanding of the Scriptures; And our very Adversaries dare not plead from this Scripture, that there is nothing more required but Scripture, to make wise unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for they acknowledge the inward Illumination of the Spirit to be necessary thereto, and if they make one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, why may not we make another, That inward Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:45664:71"/>
Salvation, without the inspiration of the same Spirit that gave them forth, which can only give the understanding of them: But why do they plead that Scripture is able to make the Man of God perfect, seeing they deny Perfection; and cannot abide to hear, that a man can be perfect? And that Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ure, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 3, 4. Does it prove, That no more Scripture is to be written, nor any after <hi>Luke</hi> spoke or wrot from the inspiration of the Spirit of God? Was not much writ afterwards? Or could <hi>Luk's</hi> word? cause <hi>Theophilus</hi> to know the certainty of these things of themselves: Nay, they were a Declaration of what he most surely believed himself, and <hi>Theophilus</hi> reading it, having the Spirit of God, would find that witnessing in him to the truth of these things, and this gives the certainty or assurance, See 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 5: Their next Scripture is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. For whatsoever things were written afore-time, were written for our learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What then? is Revelation or the Spirit of Prophecy ceased for all this? yet <hi>Paul</hi> himself had it, and he sayes, The Scriptures were wrot for his learning, and he points here at a Scripture in the old Testamen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, but this proves not there was no more Scriptures to be added thereto; and <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were writ, that we should learn only by them, or stick to the Letter learning, for he had a learning beyond them, even that of the Spirit; and in this same Epistle, he points them to the newness of the Spirit, beyond the oldners of the Letter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. which compare with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. Their next Scripture is <hi>Math.</hi> 4. 4, 7. as for <hi>ver.</hi> 4. It fighteth Manifestly against them, <hi>Man shall not live by Bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> Now say they, The word proceeding from Gods mouth is Ceased, he speaks not from word of mouth now, as he did of old, but from the Scriptures, but if God himself speak not, Man lives not; And what does this prove, that Christ used the Scriptures Testimony against the Devil; is there not therefore any Inspiration or Revelation; was not Christ inspired himself; and was not <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apostles Inspired, who used the Testimony of former Scriptures writ before them against their adversaries; but yet they wrot
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45664:72"/>
Scriptures themselves from the same Spirit; and why may not it be so now? Their next proof is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>We have a more sure word of Prophecy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Answ.</hi> Supposing but not at all granting, hereby he meaned the Scriptures writ or spoke from without; he points them to this, <hi>but till the day dawn, and the Day star arise;</hi> Now some were come to the day, and were Children of the day, and had the day star arisen in them, and then they needed not the Light of the Moon, or night starrs. But I have shewed before this word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, is the word in the Heart, which was in the beginning, before Scriptures was; and is that word that came to <hi>David, Isai, Ieremiah,</hi> and inspired them, from which the Scripture came, and this Word in my heart maketh me believe the Scriptures, and is the more sure and Manifest Word; or the most sure, as its in <hi>Beza's</hi> Translation, even surer than Scripture Words, which outward violence can rob me off, or I may forget them; but this remaineth for ever: and here lyeth a great deceipt in them, where Scripture speaks of the Word, and it's Vertue, and Excellency, and Sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; O say they, This is Scripture, whereas I have shewed, though the Scriptures declare of that word, yet they are not it, but came from it, and point to it again; for the word is Christ, which was in the beginning. The next proof <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2. This directly proves against them, as I have shewed before; God spoke to the Fathers in the Prophets, but to us in the Son, that is more Immediately. The next proof <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 29. 31. This proves that <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets Testimony is of greater weight then if any should arise and testifie from the dead, but it proves nothing, that we should stick only to what is written by them, for much was writ af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; nor does it prefer <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets Testimony, to the Testimony of the Spirit of Christ; this is more certain and satisfactory, and the end of their Testimony. Their next proof is, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 20. Hereby they would prove, That the writeings of the Prophets and Apostles were the foundation of the Church; but this Scripture sayes nothing of that kind; for Jesus Christ is the Foundation of Prophets and Apostles, and the chief or undermost Corner-Stone; he is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:45664:72"/>
both Foundation-Stone, Corner-Stone, and Cop-Stone also, the First and the Last, and there is no other Foundation saith <hi>Paul</hi> himself, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. and that Scripture is fully cleared above. Their next proof 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. 16. 17. But of all the Scriptures they have brought, this proves least for them, but much against them, for it mentions <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, and Writings which we own, and their usefulness also in their place; but it sayes nothing, that either his Writing or any other, are a compleat Cannon or Rule, or that Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Ceased, but it sayes some things in them, are hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then I say, there is the more need of Revelation to make a man Learned, and to open up these hard things, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation, can suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently do it, as is above Demonstrated. The next proof is <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. <hi>If any man, or an Angel from Heaven Preach any other Gospel unto you, let him be accursed. Answer,</hi> The Gospel was Preached unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> saith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. as well as unto us; and it was Preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi> and to all believers, who lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Scripture was writ in a book; and it was spoken into their Hearts, by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the Saints who then lived, and were Inspired of God, preached the Gospel; and the Gospel is the same in all Generations, for it is the everlasting Gospel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 6. But now the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Discoveries, and Manifestations of this one Gospel, hath been many and different, under the Law; more dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the time of the Prophets; more Manifestly, in the time of the Apostles yet more Manifestly, and yet all one Gospel, and we Preach no other, but the same everlasting Gospel, which is the Power of God unto Salvation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. The last proof is, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 2. Wherein <hi>Paul</hi> beseeches them not to be shaken in mind or troubled, neither by Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nor Word, nor Letter as from him, as that, that day of Christ, were at hand; but this proves nothing against the Inspiration of the Spirit of God, as if it were then ceased, or to cease; for it continued with him, and many others long afterwards, only it proves, they should not recite any such

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This Doctrine ought not to be suspected by any-honest hearted Man or Woman, for it will never teach any to slight the Scriptures, but on the contrary; They will never know how to use, or esteem the Scriptures aright, till they come to that Life and Spirit which gave them forth, and to which they point; and these who were formerly Inspired of God, and were taught of him Immediately used and esteemed the Scriptures, nor slighted any Ministry, Worship, or Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Jesus Christ, as neither do we; and we acknowledge the Ministry who are sent of God, is both useful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to us, and we are bound to hear them, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them; and at all times have we found their Ministry, usefull and refreshing unto us, having Ministered of the Life; and their Gospel came unto us, not in Word only, but in Power, and in the holy Ghost, and in much Assurance; as <hi>Pauls</hi> did unto them, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 5. And we have also been refreshed with their Prayers in the heart, and found the fruit of them, and now in our measures are brought to the same Life; and yet their Ministry will alwayes be dear and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to us, but not absolutely necessary; being come to a Teacher, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ, that cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into a Corner from us, when all men may, and be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from us, and we from them as to bodily presence; but indeed, who come to the Teachings and Ministry of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45664:73"/>
Spirit of Christ, in themselves; this will lead them, as it hath done us, from the Natural Ministry, Worship and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for that they neither Worship, nor Minister from the Spirit, nor have received any ordinance there-from, as is Manifest both from their Principles and Practises.</p>

of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the formal Object, or Foundation of Faith, or believing of the Scriptures, cometh at last to refute their Doctrine (which he calleth Errour, and saith, that it is most easily refuted,) who maintain the formal Object of Faith, <hi>(i. e.</hi> its Foundation) to be the inward Revelation of the holy Spirit properly so called; and for the Revelation of this Dectrine (which <hi>Num.</hi> 6. he most of all condemneth) he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth five Arguments, <hi>Num.</hi> 8. <hi>Punct.</hi> 6. <hi>Tract.</hi> 9.

B.</hi> (called Doctor of Divinity in <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and of great fame for his learning at home, and abroad) it is most of all condemned, even more than the <hi>Popish</hi> Doctrine, of resolve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Faith in the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> so that Scripture is fulfilled upon them. <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 13. 14. His Arguments are as followeth, To every one of which, as they ly in order; I shall return a few words of answer, which I hope shall satisfie the discerning, and indeed they are so weak, fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, and vain, that little or no answer is required; were it not that fools some times are to be answered in their folly, least they should seem wise in their own eyes, as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaketh,</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> (saith he) This way of knowing the Truth of the Doctrines of Faith, <hi>(viz.</hi> By the internal Revelation of the holy Spirit, properly so called,) is Extraordinary, and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical; as is Manifest of the aforesaid, and consequentially the truth of the Christian Doctrine formerly and commonly, is not so made known unto the Faithful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This way of Internal Revelation, Prophecy so called,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:45664:75"/>
hath alwayes been, not only Extraordinary, but altogether, shut up from the unbelieving, and such who stuck in the Letter; but it h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>h alwayes been common to the true Christians and Saints in all ages, being the New Covenant Dispensatory which l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That it was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical, <hi>i. e.</hi> Imparted to the Prophets is granted, but it follows not, that therefore it is not the common priviledge of all Saints who were to have the like precious Faith with them; and though it was rare in the days of old, yet God hath poured cut ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Promise, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 28, 29.

            <p>

               </gap>nd of prophetical Revelation, is that which is by Intellect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual speaking, or illumination as <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> teach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Who imbrace this supposed Err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ur, but indeed Truth; Do not confound the gift of Faith, and the gift of Prophecy, the spirit of Faith, and the spirit of Prophecy is one, but the opperations different, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6. Now if by the gift of Prophecy he understand (as he seemeth to do) the inward Manifestation or speaking of God Immediately to the mind, Faith is hereby wrought, <hi>viz.</hi> God this speaking or Manifesting the truth Immediately in the Mind, is the cause of Faith; and so as the cause and effect are different, so the Prophetical Revelation and the Faith of what is Revealed are different opperations; For because God Revealeth in Man these he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth. But if he or any other, would thus reason, then every one who have the gift of Faith, must have the Prophetical Revelation; and so all believers are Prophers and do Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. All Saints have the same Spirit and Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy in some measure more or less, that the Prophets had, who ever directed people to the same Spirit and Word in their hearts, from which they spoke, that they might in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves hear the same Word and Spirit, whereby the true Faith comes; and such who turned in their minds to this Word and Spirit in them, (or rather, by the drawings thereof, were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it) believed the Prophets Testimonies; and all others
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45664:75"/>
did not believe, but rejected their Testimony as false and seign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I shall not need to cite Scriptures for this, or produce reasons, having done both at large in the fore-going Treatise; but whereas they say, then all should be Prophets and Prophecy, who believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. All the Saints must know the sheepherds voice in them, and witness Christ Jesus the great Prophet Prophecying or speaking in them, and must carry his Testimony which is the Spirit of Prophecy, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 10. compared with 12. 17. But we do not say, neither followeth it from our Doctrine, That all are called forth as Prophets to Prophecy, or Minister, or Teach, or have the gift of utterance given them; only this we affirm, That none ought to Minister or Teach, but who witness the Internal Call, and furnishing of the holy Spirit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them what to speak Immediately from it self, and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealing the truth of these things in them, whereof they declare, and they who Prophecy or Preach of Faith, ought to believe themselves, and to have the same Spirit of Faith accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. We having the same Spirit of Faith believe, therefore we speak, and so speaking, a Prophecying of the effect or consequent of Faith, in all whom God calleth thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> (saith he) This opinion too openly favoureth the <hi>Swendefieldians, Anabaptists</hi> and others, vaunting of Internal Breathings, or Inspirations, and enthusiasms; for saith he, that Internal Revelation which is upon the part of the object, and which is ever by Supernatural and disjoynedly Infused re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations, truly and properly is Enthusiasme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Lo! how the fleshly denies the Inward Breathings, or Inspirations of Gods Spirit, whereby alone the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is opened, and the true Wisdom and Life received; but what saith he here against it? but that the <hi>Swendefieldians,</hi> and <hi>Annabaptists</hi> maintain this Doctrine, and vaunt themselves to be Inspired, but this will not prove it false, though they had not been Inspired more, than when the false Prophets in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah's</hi> daies said, They were Inspyred by the Spirit of God, that therefore <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> (saith he) Hence it followeth, that the whole
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45664:76"/>
Church, that is, all the faithful, are ruled by new Revelations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> What evil is this? or rather, is it not a blessed dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation for all who believe, to walk after the Spirit, and to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness God, dwelling and walking in them, as he hath promised. It is observable, how both this man, and all his brethren take it for granted, rather (it hath passed all along among them as a Principle) then that ever any of them could prove it, That there no Immediate Revelation; and upon this sandy Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have built their Church, Ministry, Worship, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances which is now a falling, and great is, and shall be the fall thereof; but this we say, and certainly know, (such who can receive it let them) all true Christians have the dayly, and hourly Manifestations, Revelations, and Influences of the Life eternal fresh and new from the Fountain, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Manna,</hi> new from Heaven every day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, (saith he) Internal, or Immediate Revelations cannot make us more certain of the Divine Authority, than the outward Revelation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scriptures; therefore, if the outward is not to be believed for it self, neither the inward, and so either an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite progress, or vitious Circle must be committed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Antecedent is Manifestly false, and therefore it concludes not truly, for what man of the meanest discerning will not acknowledge, that God Immediately Revealing, or speaking in Man, (whose voice is full of heavenly vertue, sweetness, and holiness, which his Sheep by their heavenly nature, hear, and discern from the voice of a stranger) maketh him more certain, than when he has but a report from another.</p>
