         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE
Truly Noble and Honourable,
NICHOLAS WITSEN,
Burgomaſter and Senator of
Amſterdam, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>THOSE two very things, Right
Noble and Honourable Sir, to
wit, the greatneſs of your Name,
and the ſmallneſs of this Work, which
might diſſwade me from ſuch an Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
do both of them invite, and in
ſome ſort engage me, to adventure, not
only to make a Preſent of this Book, but
alſo a particular Dedication thereof unto
you. And ſeeing that it is a thing moſt
certain, and that the very ſight of the
Book doth immediately ſhew it, that
what I here offer is a Piece that is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
new, but yet neither over bulky nor
prolix, I was perſwaded that this my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
would not prove unpleaſing to
you, becauſe that as the Great are very
much taken with the Novelty of other
things, even ſo they are of Books; and
as a conciſeneſs in ſpeaking is very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:50388:3"/>
to them, a ſhort and compendious
way of Writing is found to be no leſs ſo,
which has given occaſion to that old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial
Adage, <hi>Little things are pretty.</hi>
To this I may add, that this Book briefly
treats of things tranſacted up and down,
and for ſome time in that Nation, where
in the Name of <hi>the Renowned States,</hi> you
have been firſt Envoy to the Moſt Potent,
and moſt Serene Princes, King <hi>William</hi>
and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> (to that great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Queen, alas, lately raviſhed from Earth
by inexorable Fate, of whoſe Vertues there
are at this time ſo many Teſtimonies in
the funebrous Orations of great and moſt
Eloquent Men, who for all that, had
they never ſo much exhauſted their brains,
and been profuſe of their Abilities in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
and magnifying the Excellencies
of this Queen, had yet nee'r been able
to form a true Idea of them in their
Thoughts, much leſs repreſent them as
they ought to be, to their Auditors, than
which nothing more can be ſaid of Man)
and after that, for ſome time <hi>Reſident</hi>
there, where you were to Congratulate
Their Royal Majeſties Acceſſion to the
Throne, and the Deliverance of ſo many
Countries and People, as alſo to confirm
that Ancient League and Amity that was
between both Nations: In which Time
and Place, ſeeing that perhaps ſome but
<pb facs="tcp:50388:3"/>
not all theſe things came within the
Verge of your Knowledge; this new
and ſmall Treatiſe, but (Pardon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion)
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, may gratifie
that deſire, which your Honour, and
even moſt Men have, who have lived or
come from abroad, of having a perfect
Knowledge of ſuch Tranſactions, as have
happened in thoſe places during their
time, or near unto it, by exhibiting as in
a little Table-Book, the firſt Riſe, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
and End of all theſe doings: But
yet this is not all the Reaſon I had for
ſuch an Undertaking; I muſt confeſs,
Illuſtrious Sir, that as to the matter of
this Work, it is ſuch as may ſeem to
them that are not very curious, needleſs
and unneceſſary, and that it is ſuch a
way or method, as may eaſily induce
ſome who are not over-skilful, but given
to ſcoff and chatter, to look upon it as
very mean and contemptible, becauſe
that having regard only to the ſingle
Relation of Things, and to Truth, I
treat thereof in a Style and Language
that is plain and ordinary, free from all
manner of Affectation, and do not (which
is a thing very common, and much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of and prevalent among the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar)
either ridicule, or proudly ſcoff at
and proſecute in Writing, thoſe things
which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

Manners of thoſe Men, who are treated

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en. Neither do I, though there
may be ſome among thoſe very Perſons,
who look with an evil Eye upon, and
bear ill will unto us, for that Reaſon,
retribute the ſame, and make the like
return unto them, as ſome are pleaſed
to do, who think ſuch reciprocal doings
ought always to be. But ſeeing that it
many times ſo happens, that they who
write with ſuch Moderation, are liable
to fall under I know not what Suſpicion
of crack'd Credit from theſe Men, ſo as
that I found my ſelf under a neceſſity
of ſeeking out for ſome Patronage and
Refuge-place upon this Account, I was
fully ſatisfied, I could meet with that
principally in you, Great Sir, who know
as well as any Man alive, what, amongſt
ſuch a multitude of Writers, and itch
of Writing, is moſt fit to be writ, what
an Hiſtorian's ſcope ought to be in ſuch
a Work as this is, and over and above
that, what on the one hand Religion,
and what in the mean time alſo Nature
and the Power of Humanity require and
call for. And becauſe I have fallen upon
this Head, I earneſtly wiſh the Temper
of the preſent Times was not ſuch, that
this were not the ſad diſtinguiſhing mark
of the Age we live in, as that there
ſhould be ſo many Men, ſuch ſtrangers
<pb facs="tcp:50388:4"/>
to and devoid of Charity and Modeſty,
and hurried with that unrulineſs and
outrageouſneſs of Mind, that as ſoon as
they diſcern any Heterodox Opinion in
matters of Religion, and eſpecially if
any Hereſie be ſmelt in the caſe, they
immediately ſuppoſe that it is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of Religion to ſcoff at, perſecute,
and afflict ſuch Men; ſome going ſo far
as to urge, there ought to be a preciſion
or a cutting off of the ſame, by violent
Methods, Fire and Sword, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Bonds, Racks and Torments,
and even by the moſt dreadful and cruel
Deaths. For the Good and Peace of the
Church and State (for ſo they Argue)
cannot otherwiſe be preſerved, nor the
Chriſtian Faith and Humane Obligations
ſubſiſt. Were it not for this, we ſhould not
ſee againſt ſo many Reformed Churches,
ſo many Hundred Thouſand Chriſtians,
ſuch and ſo great and nefandous Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
contrived and offered, ſuch lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
yea, unheard-of Calamities and
Slaughters, (and even if they could, make
entire Extirpation, Rulne, and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
by thoſe who go by the Names of
Chriſtians and Catholicks, but are in
truth the moſt bitter and implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the True Religion. I'll go yet
further; I heartily wiſh there were not
<pb facs="tcp:50388:5"/>
ſometimes amongſt others, and even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, who have withdrawn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the Papacy, that immodera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

no manner of Hereſie, no Fundamental
Error, yea, not the leaſt difference but
in words and way of Expreſſion only,

doth enſue. And that thoſe, who lay
theſe things to Heart, who ſhun them,
and who being mindful of Humane
Frailty, and of their Duty enjoyned
them by God, and being intent and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt alone,
bear with ſuch things as are to be born
with, and ſtudy to promote Peace and
Unity, and hate every Name of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
impoſed by Man in the Church
of God, and deſire neither to make nor
follow Parties, are branded as if they
were ignorant and ſlothful, having no
regard to their own Matters and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns;
ſo far forth, as if to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and of neither Party, were become
now as it were a new Sect, and that Law
of <hi>Solon</hi> revived, who commanded <hi>him
to be puniſhed, who in the time of Sedition
joined himſelf to neither Party.</hi> Which
ſort of Men are <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:50388:5"/>
of themſelves, puffed up, (as they are
called in Scripture) turbid, and boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hot (neither is this a Foreign Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation,
but ſuch as is alſo applyed to
them in the Sacred Code) when they
raiſe more Commotions about a thing of
nothing, than there are Storms in the
<hi>Aegean</hi> or moſt boiſterous Seas; but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there is fully enough ſaid to the wiſe,
but to you, Great Sir, too much. And
this I judge my ſelf obliged further to
ſay, that perhaps there may be ſome,
who, having a juſt Eſteem, and right
Judgment of this Work, would for the
further Eſtimation thereof, have me here
and there quote and ſet down in the
Margin of the Book, the Authorities and
Teſtimonies whereon I ground each Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
to which Perſons ſeeing their
Conceptions hereon are not without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
I make this Anſwer, That if I ſhould
not do it, I do not thereby ſwerve from
the uſage of Hiſtorians in all Ages, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there indeed any need that a Man
ſhould gain a belief of what he offers,
this way, when he is not conſcious to
himſelf of any falſity, and that there is
nothing that can derogate from or leſſen
his Credit therein: Neither was I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in this Work, which I was deſirous
ſhould prove acceptable as much for the
<pb facs="tcp:50388:6"/>
Brevity as Truth of it, ſo without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to interrupt and break off the Thread
of my Story, or to diſorder and delay
my Reader. But yet I do not always
omit ſuch ſort of Teſtimonies. But
otherwiſe I can be bold to affirm, that
there is nothing of any moment, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Work, that hath not been
done in the face of the Sun, that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the preſence of Men, or in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Judicatories, even where there has
been no excluſion of the Populacy, and
ſuch as has not been frequent in the
mouths of many, laid open by the chief
Magiſtrates, and Printed, for the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of ſuch as were abſent, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate
the ſame to Poſterity; as for
other things, I take but little notice of
them, and if at any time I recount any
ſuch, I do it in ſuch a way as may gain
certain Credit: But no more of this; to
return therefore to you, <hi>Right Noble and
Great Sir.</hi> As to the Reaſon that induced
me to Preſent and Dedicate this my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
to Your Honour, it was this, That
there might remain ſome ſort of Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
upon Record, not ſo much of the
knowledge I have had of you, which is
as far backwards as I can remember, as
of the Favour you have always ſhewed
me, and of thoſe Benefits you have made
<pb facs="tcp:50388:6"/>
it your Buſineſs to heap upon me both
at home and abroad, and which I have
deemed both Juſt and Honourable for
me to accept, being freely offered, and
by no means to reject, and withal of the
Gratitude, Propenſity, and Devotedneſs
of my Mind towards you. And though
I have here a great Opportunity offered
to me to Celebrate your Vertues, yet I
ſhall forbear, leſt I ſhould incur the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
either of being unskilful in Praiſes,
or what is baſe, the Name of Flatterer;
beſides that your Name has long ſince
gained ſuch Eſteem, and is ſo Famous
among all, that it has no need of any
Encomiums and Embelliſhments of mine,
the things themſelves beſpeak it. For
to ſay nothing of the Endowments of
your Mind, as being ſuch, though moſt
rare, eſpecially in ſo propitious and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
a Fortune, as are not conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to all Men, and are more private;
thoſe Famous Monuments that you have
partly publiſhed even in your blooming

                     <p>AMongſt the many and <hi>great Conflicts of the
Church</hi> while ſojourning here on Earth,
there is none more uſual, and withal more
difficult and hazardous than that ſhe is
engaged in for Vindicating the <hi>Truth of her Religion</hi>
from the Falſe Doctrines of her Inſulting and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
Adverſaries. The Reaſon of all which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be unknown to any who conſiders that thoſe
who are lovers of, and zealous for the Truth deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by God, neither ought, nor can conceal and
hide the ſame, but make it known to the Praiſe and
Glory of God; whereas others who are fond of
Falſhoods, that they may the better compaſs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſeems good to their own Appetites, or condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
to their Intereſt, do not uſually fail to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
and defend their own Inventions, and to accuſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50388:9"/>
and condemn the more Pious and Honeſt Doctrines
of others, as being too oppoſite to them and their
Deſigns. It is likewiſe manifeſt that the Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it ſelf clear and evident, is content with <hi>a
ſimple diſcovery,</hi> dealing candidly and openly with
all; whereas <hi>Lyes and Falſhoods,</hi> as having no ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
or weight in themſelves, muſt be adorn'd with
a multitude of fair and boaſting Expreſſions, uſing
<hi>a hundred little Tricks</hi> and Cheats for enſnaring the
unskilful and unwary; in which they are oft-times
ſo ſucceſsful, that even the wiſer ſort of People, and
thoſe who on other occaſions are circumſpect enough,
do ſometimes chance to be entangled, and do find
it a matter of difficulty to extricate themſelves
from the ſame. Moreover though it be Natural for
Mankind ſtill to complain of the Iniquity of their
own Times, inſomuch that all Men are ready to fly
out in <hi>Panegyricks upon the Ages paſt,</hi> while they
condemn that they live in, yet I can ſcarce think
that there are any who are not convinc'd that the
days in which our Lot is fallen are ſuch, as in them
<hi>all manner of Errors and Falſhoods are broke in upon
Religion, all ſorts of mad and unheard of Hereſies,
the moſt terrible and fouleſt Blaſphemies,</hi> have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run,
and (as it were) delug'd the Church. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that ſhe is now oblig'd not only to encounter
Profane and Wicked Men for the defence of the
Truth and Integrity of her Religion, but to oppoſe
her ſelf to the Arms of her Bloody and Cruel Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
for the maintenance of her Liberty and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
It is not ſufficient for her to engage with
Men, but ſhe is conſtrained to fight even with Beaſts.
But there is no Affliction can overtake the Church
of the Living God, that does not admit of ſome
Relief and Comfort. Wherefore ſince this is now
the condition of the Church in theſe evil days, it
is likewiſe her great Happineſs that ſo many able
and skilful Men have in theſe ſame very days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirr'd
themſelves on her behalf for oppoſing and
confuting the Erroneous Sentiments of wicked
Men, occaſion'd partly by Ignorance and Folly,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50388:9"/>
partly by a reſolute and furious Madneſs; and thus
aſſiſting the diſtreſſed Church, have ſucceſsfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
both their Tongues and Pens, furniſhing her
not only with means of Knowledge, and Spiritual
Weapons for inſtructing and confirming her ſelf
againſt the Aſſaults of her Enemies, but even for
gaining, convincing, and vanquiſhing the ſame. In
proſecuting this their laudable Deſign ſome have
contented themſelves with the bare mentioning the
horrible and monſtrous Aſſertions vented by thoſe
cunning contrivers, as accounting it a ſufficient
Confutation to have nam'd them, which bewray
their weakneſs at the firſt view. But I cannot gueſs
at the Reaſon why ſo very few have for ſo long a
time made mention of the <hi>Quakers, whoſe riſe is
dated from a little before the middle of this preſent
Century,</hi> and have ſince that time wonderfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
in number of Proſelytes, beyond what is
commonly thought of; theſe Men, I ſay, accounted
by ſome Superſtitious and followers of Old Wives
Fables, by others the worſt ſort of Fanaticks, and
in the next degree to Lunaticks and Madmen, have
been quite paſt over in ſilence by moſt Writers, ſo
that not ſo much as the <hi>Hiſtory of their Riſe and
Progreſs is yet on Publick Record;</hi> at leaſt wiſe
if any there be that have touch'd upon this Sect,
they have done it in ſo ſlight and tranſitory a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that they would rather ſeem to have made
Publick their own Ignorance, than to have left on
Record the <hi>Actions, Doctrine, and Religion of theſe
Men:</hi> Unleſs perhaps this may be imagin'd for a
Reaſon of the ſilence of Writers, that they account
of theſe Men ſo little, as that they think it fitter to
paſs them in a negligent and diſdainful ſilence, than
to ſpend words or time upon them: Others there
are indeed who have wrote ſomething of them, but
to no purpoſe, who being themſelves altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
what manner of Men they be, and having
only heard of them by Report, as being <hi>Prodigies
and Monſters of Mankind,</hi> choſe rather to put in
Print whatever they heard, than to have juſt nothing

to ſay of 'em; reckoning the danger not to be great,
whether the Relation prov'd true or falſe; for if
true, it is well; if falſe, it falls upon ſuch <hi>a Tribe
of Men</hi> (think they) of whom nothing can be ſaid
ſo ill, that would not Quadrate to them. My Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the matter is this; that, while I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that <hi>England</hi> (the Native Country of theſe
Men) <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> abounds ſo much with
thoſe called <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſince their number in thoſe
Countries does daily increaſe, nay, and elſewhere
they have propagated their Doctrines, making and
gaining Proſelytes; (for that it is they bend all their
force to, having for this purpoſe for a long time
publiſh'd many Books, and theſe not little ſmall
Treatiſes, but large Volumes, well digeſted, and
handſomly dreſs'd with fit Expreſſions.) Since we
may obſerve that others (no deſpicable Sects) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diſcovered in them their own Image, have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
them for Brethren and Kinſmen (ſuch as the
<hi>Quietiſts,</hi> that not ſo long ago did firſt appear in
<hi>Campania</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Pietiſts,</hi> ſo lately ſprung
up in <hi>Germany;</hi> of which laſt we know certainly
they are daily inſinuating themſelves and their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
into the hearts of the People, and influencing
their Minds even in this our own Land) and ſince
it is uncertain what may be the iſſue of all this: I
ſay, upon all theſe Conſiderations I count it <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary to make a narrow ſearch after them,</hi>
in order to underſtand what manner of Men they
be, <hi>what Actions have been done by them, from what
beginnings, and by what progreſs they have riſen to this
height, and what are their Tenets and Sentiments</hi>
that have ſo long lain in Obſcurity. And this is the
more neceſſary to be done now in this <hi>Interim</hi> of
time, while the Memory of theſe things are freſh
in our Minds, leſt by the progreſs of time that being
worn out and defaced, there be no means left of
atteſting what went before; and thus ſhould we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
doubtful and uncertain of their Actions and
Tenets, not knowing where to fix the Controverſie;
and whoever would pretend to examine any of theſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50388:11"/>
Matters, muſt after the manner of the <hi>Andabatae,</hi>
fight hood-wink'd; of which ſort of procedure
ariſing from the ſame defect we have a great many
Inſtances both in the ancient and later Churches.
Since therefore I have had the Fortune of a long
time to be familiarly acquainted and much conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
with theſe Men call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> and that in
many places; and have thus had occaſion to know
ſo much of them both from themſelves and their
chief Teachers, and alſo from Men of our Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
who were well acquainted with <hi>all their Deeds
and Actions;</hi> and beſides many of their Writings
and Manuſcripts, of which ſome are in Print, ſome
not, having fallen into my hands, I thought it
would be an acceptable Enterprize, calculated for
the exigency of theſe our Times, and alſo uſeful to
Poſterity, to write upon this Subject. In perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of which I ſhall pick out what ſeems moſt
neceſſary and directly conducive to the management
of the ſame, and that with all brevity and conciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
imaginable; not determining any thing <hi>through
Precipitancy, Love to a Party, Prejudice of Opinion,
or the influence of any Paſſion whatſoever;</hi> leaving it
for every Man to judge as he thinks fit of their
<hi>Actions, Tenets, Cuſtoms, and manner of Worſhip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Men are called <hi>Quakers</hi> in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
Which Name was given 'em by their mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Enemies as a note of Ignominy and Contempt,
for that when they are about contemplating Sacred
things, that ſame very moment that the Spirit over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
'em, through the commotion of their Minds,
and agitation of their Bodies, they preſently <hi>fall a
trembling,</hi> throwing themſelves on the ground,
oft-times froathing at the mouth, and ſcrieching
with a horrible noiſe. And though they ſeem to
reſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Reproachful Title, yet they are not ſo
averſe either to the Name or to the Thing it ſelf,
but that they'll acknowledge that both do in ſome
meaſure quadrate to them. For they confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be <hi>Quakers;</hi> nor do they deny that while
they go about Sacred Things, ſubmitting themſelves
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50388:12"/>
wholly to the Divine Will, and quietly waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, praying within themſelves for the Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Operation of his Spirit, and with deep
ſighs and groans are importunately waiting the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of the Spirit; that upon his <hi>firſt approach
they fall a trembling,</hi> and are hurried out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by the commotions of their Minds, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances
of Body, occaſioned by the reſiſtance of
the ſinful ſtubborn Fleſh; which when they have
overcome, and are return'd to themſelves again, and
begin to be ſenſible of the <hi>Illuminations and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of the Spirit,</hi> then they are tranſported into
Raptures of Joy, which occaſion theſe <hi>Quaking</hi>
and Extatical Motions of Body and Mind. They
add likewiſe, that the Spirit of God while ſpeaking
in the Scriptures, denominates the ſincere fearers of
God, and lovers of his Spirit and Word, <hi>Tremblers,</hi>
requiring of them ſo to be, and pronouncing them
bleſſed if ſuch. Wherefore ſince they do not reject
this their Name, but rather account it honourable,
if rightly underſtood, I ſhall define them after the
ſame manner; eſpecially ſince they have not yet
obtain'd a peculiar and proper Name whereby they
can be diſtinguiſh'd from all others.</p>
                     <p>Another Name generally given to them is that of
<hi>Enthuſiaſts.</hi> Where it is likewiſe to be obſerved,
that many do reckon them among the number of
thoſe <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> that in Ancient Hiſtory are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to have been among the Primitive Chriſtians,
as alſo in the laſt Century. But theſe Men are not
ſatisfied to be ſo called in any ſenſe; for beſides, ſay
they, that this name of <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> is oft given to
thoſe that by the Calumniators themſelves would
be accounted Men of Worth and Dignity, and that
even thoſe who are ſo buſie in fixing this Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Name upon them, do oft-times come to be
branded with the ſame themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beſides all this,
ſay they, this Name tends openly to the diſcredit
and diſhonour of all Chriſtians, whom the Spirit
of God in his Word declares to be influenc'd by the
Spirit; nay, and requires it ſo ſtrictly of them, as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50388:12"/>
that without this irradiation of the Spirit they can
be none of Chriſt's. Now theſe <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> that
were of Old Times, and likewiſe thoſe that have
been ſince, did arrogate to themſelves a peculiar fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Spirit, and contrary to the dictates of the
Holy Spirit, would under the conduct of that break
forth into Tumults, Seditions, and Wars; whereas
theſe Men called <hi>Quakers</hi> pretend to be poſſeſs'd
and guided by no other Spirit than what is common
unto all Chriſtians; nay, and are ſo far from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Evil upon any Man, that they will not ſo much
as reſiſt force by force, aſſerting all manner of <hi>Self-defence
to be unjuſt,</hi> except what is meerly Verbal;
and even that muſt be free from Anger. For this
is uſual amongſt all, that even thoſe who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<hi>a new Model of Doctrine and Life,</hi> though
what they maintain be never ſo new and lately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
yet they publiſh it for an Opinion of the
Ancients, or at leaſt, founded on their Doctrines;
for though none pretends ſo to confine the Truth,
and ſet ſuch Bounds to Goodneſs, that no new thing
ſhould be accounted true or good; yet Antiquity
adds a value and reſpect, for that we commonly
judge the ancienteſt Opinions to be the trueſt and
beſt; and hence it is that even thoſe Tenets that
are of themſelves intrinſically good, do purchaſe
more reſpect, and a better reception by pretended
Antiquity and Cuſtom, than by all their real worth.
The <hi>Quakers</hi> therefore ſay, they derive their Name
(though not very ſollicitous what Name be given
them) Doctrine, Religion, and way of Living,
from God himſelf (whom his own Infallible Oracles
term <hi>The Ancient of Days,</hi>) and from his Word
firſt delivered from Heaven, and then committed
to Writing by the inſpired Men of God, which is
the only Rule and Ground of all Truth.</p>
                     <p>They likewiſe Appeal to the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> or
to the Teſtimony of thoſe Books that we hold for
true, unanimouſly conſenting to and aſſerting the
ſame very things that they with the Holy Scriptures
maintain. When I ſay, <hi>Fathers,</hi> I ſpeak after our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50388:13"/>
way of ſpeaking, not after the <hi>manner of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
who admit no ſuch Names; But by thoſe,
called by us Fathers, they underſtand the Writers
who lived in the <hi>firſt and ſecond Centuries after
Chriſt.</hi> For they conceive thoſe who lived nigheſt
to the Times of the Primitive Apoſtles that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled
the Holy Writings, to have deliver'd their
Doctrine with more Integrity than thoſe who lived
later, who the further diſtant they be from the
Times of the Apoſtles, the more is their Sincerity
and Integrity to be called in queſtion; like Water,
that the further it runs from its Fountain, the more
muddy it grows. And therefore it is that they pay
but little deference to thoſe who lived in the later
Ages of the Church, freely acknowledging many
things to be contain'd in their Writings that are
juſtly to be rejected; nor do they ever quote their
Teſtimony, except it be very conducive to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of what they advance. If therefore at
any time others who are unacquainted with their
<hi>Doctrines and Converſations,</hi> or poſſeſs'd with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
Envy, or Hatred againſt them, do at any
time go about to brand them with theſe ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and opprobrious Names, they, if called to give
a diſtinct Account of themſelves, do aſſume the
Names of <hi>Chriſtians; Evangelick, Apoſtolick, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiek</hi>
Men; as if the Doctrine and Religion prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by them were the ſame as was delivered at firſt
<hi>by Chriſt himſelf to the Apoſtles,</hi> publiſh'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole World by the Miniſtry of theſe his
Apoſtles, and embrac'd and retain'd by all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Godly of all Ages, whom Cuſtom has term'd
<hi>Catholick.</hi> And upon this Account in all Debates
they recur to the Scriptures, not declining the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of their Tenets with thoſe of the Ancienter
Fathers, nay, nor thoſe of later times.</p>
                     <p>It follows next, that unto what I have ſaid, I
ſhould ſubjoin ſome Account of the <hi>Sect that theſe
Men ſo much follow,</hi> inviting all Chriſtians to do the
ſame. Their Sentiments therefore run in this ſtrain;
That ſince the Doctrines and Manners of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50388:13"/>
as alſo and conſequently of thoſe called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
likewiſe, have been for ſo long a time cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
and perverted, it would ſeem that Apoſtacy
and Defection from the Apoſtolick Doctrine and
Diſcipline had its firſt beginnings in the Times of
the Apoſtles themſelves; and from thenceforth did
by degrees increaſe till it came to its perfect height
in the <hi>Sixth and Seventh Centuries;</hi> and from that
time forth having confirm'd and harden'd it ſelf
through the firm and conſtant continuance for ſo
many Ages, ſo that no hope of its removal was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
did ſo continue till this very Age we now
live in. Though (add they) in all this <hi>Series of
Time</hi> there was always one or other in every Century
that appear'd and declar'd againſt this their General
Defection, but without any Succeſs, as alſo to their
own diſadvantage and detriment. And thus do they
imagine of thoſe great Men, called by us the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,</hi>
that all their Endeavours for the Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion and Purity, tended indeed to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Falſhood, Lightneſs, and Vanity of Men,
but not to eſtabliſh Truth, or introduce Gravity of
Life and Manners, by reſtoring theſe Vertues to
their Primitive Luſtre and Splendor; much like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe that throw down their old Habitation, and
never think of building up a new one. Moreover,
their Opinion of thoſe who came after the <hi>Firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,</hi>
is, that while they imagin'd to themſelves
that what they did tended to the advancement of a
Reformation, it proved diametrically oppoſite to
the ſame; for that in lieu of the Vices and Errors
which polluted and defiled the Church, that were
corrected and rooted out by them, they introduced
other <hi>new ones of their own Invention,</hi> like Men
cleanſing a Houſe, that caſt out the Filth ſo as to let
more come in. So that theſe Men Preach up their
Religion for the ancienteſt, as having flouriſh'd in
the firſt Golden Age of the Church; which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
from the very firſt riſe of the Chriſtian
Name, even unto this our Age, miſerably mangled
and corrupted, and in fine, quite demoliſh'd; until
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50388:14"/>
at length it was retriev'd and reſtor'd to its Ancient
Purity by them, being incited and raiſed up by the
Divine Spirit to recover fallen Religion, for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of all Men. Wherefore 'tis that in all their
Writings this is diſtinctly treated of, having prefix'd
as a Title to their Chapters, that, <hi>They as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Jeſus Chriſt, are called and raiſed up by God
for diſpenſing the Goſpel, which after ſo long and dark
a Night of Apoſtacy, is now again come to light, to be
preach'd unto all Nations.</hi> And thus do they Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
Condemn, and ſet at nought the Doctrines,
manner of Worſhip, Rites, Ceremonies, nay, the
whole Life and Converſation not only of all theſe
general Chriſtians, but of the Proteſtants, who
boaſt ſo much of their departing from that great
Apoſtacy, and cleanſing themſelves from the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh</hi>
and Papal De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ilements. Unto whom they
oppoſe their Doctrine, Worſhip, and way of Life,
which indeed are ſuch, that their Doctrine is for a
great part of it new, or taken from ſome Ancient
Opinions condemn'd and rejected by the Church,
which having lain ſo long dormant, are revived
anew by them; and as to the reſt, 'tis a <hi>Medley</hi> or
<hi>Hotch-potch</hi> of the ſeveral Opinions of Proteſtants,
though not radically agreeing with them, <hi>their
Worſhip is diametrically Oppoſite to that of ours;</hi> and
their manner of Life ſo ſingular, that between their
Converſation and that not only of Proteſtants, but
of all Chriſtians, there is as vaſt a difference as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
can be. And theſe are the Tenets they have ſo
buſily ſpread abroad both at their <hi>firſt riſe,</hi> and in
the further progreſs of the Sect; and all of 'em that
are capable either of ſpeaking or writing Publickly,
do diligently apply themſelves in all places to the
Explaining, Defending, and Propagating their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
inveighing and railing againſt the contrary
Opinions of others, with as bitter and reviling Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
as they can invent; and ſuch their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſatory
Libels are diſperſed abroad into all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
eſpecially thoſe where they expect to meet
with ready Compliants with their Doctrine and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50388:14"/>
Way, or at leaſt ſuch as would be fond of new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations
and Changes in Religion, being thus in
ſome meaſure prediſpoſed to receive and entertain
their Advances.</p>
                     <p>Having thus ſpoken in <hi>General</hi> of the Conditions
of theſe Men, I come next to give a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Account of their <hi>Riſe, Progreſs, various Viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,</hi>
and <hi>Events</hi> befalling them. The Original
Mother and Nurſe of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is <hi>England,</hi> a
Country once Famous for baniſhing and extirpating
Hereſie, <hi>now the Seat and Centre of all manner of
Errors.</hi> The Quakers themſelves Date their firſt
Riſe from the <hi>Forty Ninth Year</hi> of this preſent Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury;
and 'twas (ſay they) in the Fifty Second they
began to increaſe to a conſiderable number, from
which time unto this day they and their Party have
daily acquired more ſtrength. For while that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
before the middle of this Century was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in an Inteſtine War, occaſioned by the
Differences of Church-Government, in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
and diſmal Juncture, when both Church and
State were miſerably ſhatter'd and rent, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Diſcipline were quite overturn'd, innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
multitudes of Men did on all hands ſeparate
from the Church; and afterwards when their greateſt
Eye-ſore, and the imaginary Source of all their
Evils, the Epiſcopal Government of the Church,
was aboliſhed, and the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Form of Church-Government
(which was what they ſo impatiently
wiſh'd for, and grounded all their hopes of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and Peace upon) was eſtabliſh'd in its place,
yet even there were ſome whom nothing would
ſatisfie, that divided themſelves into an innumerable
Company of Sects and Factions, of which this of
the Quakers was one.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Ringleader, Author, and Propagater of
Quakeriſm was one <hi>George Fox.</hi> Some of that
Party have not ſtood to give that Man after his
Death) the Title of <hi>The firſt and glorious Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Work, and this Society, the great and
bleſſed Apoſtle.</hi> So that, as the Diſciples and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50388:15"/>
of any Sect derive their Names from their
Maſters, ſo might we call theſe Men <hi>Foxonians,</hi>
were it not unbecoming Chriſtians to denominate
themſelves or others profeſſing the Name of Chriſt
from the Names of Men. I have many Accounts
of <hi>George Fox</hi> in Writing in my hands, partly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated
from his own Mouth to his <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> a
little before his Death, partly obtain'd from his
Friends and Followers, and partly from others that
were ſtrangers both to <hi>George Fox</hi> and all his Society.
Which becauſe they differ among themſelves, I ſhall
only pick out what ſeems to be moſt probable, and
generally atteſted, for it is difficult in ſuch a caſe to
diſtinguiſh between what is true, what falſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>George Fox</hi> was Born in the Year One Thouſand
Six Hundred and Twenty Four, in a Village called
<hi>Dreton</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire.</hi> His Father, <hi>Chriſtopher
Fox,</hi> and his Mother, <hi>Mary Lago,</hi> were of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Fortune, but gain'd their Living by Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
They lived devoutly and piouſly, were of
the Reformed Religion, and great Zealots for the
Presbyterian Party, which then obtain'd in <hi>England.</hi>
And this their Zeal for Religion was accounted He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
to the Family, eſpecially on the Mother's
ſide; whoſe Anceſtors had in the days of Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> given Publick Teſtimony to their conſtant
and unmoveable Zeal for the Truth and Purity of
Religion, not only in giving their Goods and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
to be confiſcated, and patiently undergoing
the loſs of the ſame, but in yielding their Lives for
a Sacrifice to the flames of devouring Fire, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the undefiled and laſting Crown of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to a ſinful Life. This <hi>George Fox,</hi> while yet
a Child, diſcovered a ſingular Temper, not coveting
to Play with his Brethren or Equals, nor giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to any of thoſe things that take with Children,
but ſhunning their Company, and diſdaining their
Childiſh Cuſtoms; he loved to be much alone, ſpoke
but little, or if at any time he chanc'd to ſpeak,
both his Countenance and Speech bewray'd a ſadneſs
of Spirit; his words were more Interrogatory,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50388:15"/>
ſhewing a great deal of Attention and Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and making many Obſervations; unto all
which was added Modeſty in all his Actions, and a
diligent purſuit of the early Rudiments of Piety
and Devotion; ſo that even in his Infancy his
Actions and Demeanor ſeemed to preſignifie thoſe
Qualities of Mind, which in progreſs of time he
diſcover'd on the Publick Stage of the World. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſpent his Infancy at home, he was then ſent to
School to learn to Read <hi>Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſh,</hi> and to Write. In
which Study he ſucceeded as the other Country
Boys and thoſe of the meaner ſort uſe to do, having
attained ſo much as that he could read Print pretty
well; but Writing he could read but little of, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could he write, except very rudely. And this
was the only Piece of Learning the attain'd to all
his Life long. For neither then, nor any time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
when arriv'd at greater Maturity of Years, did
he ever apply himſelf to any Liberal Study. So that
he not only knew no other Language ſave his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Tongue,
but even in that he was ſo little expert,
and ſo ill qualified either for ſpeaking or writing, all
the whole courſe of his Life, that what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
perfectly well he could not explain or enlarge
upon in any tolerable good <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and far leſs
could he deliver it in Writing; in ſo much that he
oft-times made uſe of <hi>Amanuenſes</hi> and others, who
being well acquainted with his Thoughts, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Maſters of Language, might put them into a
better Dreſs. And this I thought worth the Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
becauſe a great many Books are extant in <hi>George
Fox</hi>'s Name, writ not only in terſe <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but
alſo in <hi>Latin,</hi> and interlarded with Sentences of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Languages, which are but little known to
the Learned World; the Names of the Interpreters
or Methodizers being concealed. Which whether
it was an effect of great Simplicity in him, or of his
Ambition and Oſtentation, I ſhall not determine;
only it is plain that he had not the gift of Tongues.
<hi>George Fox</hi> having ſpent this part of his Life at
School, began then to look out for ſome way of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50388:16"/>
Living, and providing for the future part of his
Life; and accordingly concluded to betake himſelf
to ſome Mechanick Trade, that being neceſſary for
the uſe and accommodation of Man, could never
be wanted, and conſquently never fail of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the end he undertook it for; ſuch as making
the Ornaments, and cloathing of Humane Bodies.
Amongſt which he choſe to himſelf the Making of
Shooes, applying himſelf to that Art the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part of his Life in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> the chief Town
of the County of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> bordering upon
<hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> the place of his Nativity. He being
then a Young Man, did behave himſelf Honeſtly
and Modeſtly amongſt Men, walking devoutly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, keeping cloſe to that ſenſe of Religion
and Worſhip taught him by his Parents. He dwelt
much upon the Scriptures, and when at leiſure from
the Exerciſe of his Trade (as alſo when about it,
taking this advantage of his ſedentary Work) he
Meditated upon, ruminated in his Mind, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected
what he had read. He had an Infallible
Memory for retaining any thing he knew, eſpecially
what he read in the Bible never ſlip'd out of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.
And having thus inceſſantly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the <hi>Study of the Scriptures</hi> from his Infancy
to his latter end, he became ſo exactly verſed in
them, that there was no Remarkable Saying in all
the Holy Writings that eſcap'd his Knowledge or
Remembrance. I have heard ſome of his Friends
ſay (and thoſe not of the Vulgar ſize, but Men of
Learning and Knowledge) that though the Bible
were loſt, it might be found in the Mouth of <hi>George
Fox.</hi> Hence it was that as every one's Perfection
and Talent diſcovers it ſelf in their Diſcourſes and
Writings, ſo all the Diſcourſes he ever had to his
People, and all the Writings left on Record behind
him, were nothing but a train of ſeveral Texts of
Scripture ſewed and patch'd together. Now after
he had thus ſpent ſo much of his time in ſtudying
the Scripture, Meditating on Religious Things, and
ſeriouſly weighing the condition and ſtate of his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50388:16"/>
own Soul; he could not contain himſelf within the
Bounds of his Trade and Station, but began to
aſpire after higher things, and tranſgreſſing the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of his Sphere, would needs attempt ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
Enterprize, that might be Serviceable both to
himſelf and others. And accordingly, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
himſelf with the private uſe of what he
had acquir'd, he took occaſion oft-times to Diſcourſe
of theſe Matters to his Fellow-Tradeſmen and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
exhorting and admoniſhing them to be
much taken up with theſe Concerns. And in theſe
his frequent Exhortations he was ſo officious and
importunate, that he would never give over, till
at length it came to ſuch a height, that neither they
would any longer give ear to his ſevere Diſcourſes,
nor could he any longer bear with the Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Reproaches, and Affronts he met with on that
account: Which obliged him then to withdraw
himſelf from all manner of Society, either Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alone in ſome hidden corner of his Shop, or
(becauſe even then there was frequently ſome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Fellows coming to hear of him what he had
to ſay, who ſince his ſevere Diſcourſes could never
pleaſe them, were ſtill creating more trouble) when
he had done with Working, he preſently forſook
the Shop, getting up into ſome Garret or other,
where being remov'd from all manner of Company,
he might both be free from the Moleſtations of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and give Offence to none.</p>
                     <p>It happened in the Year of our Lord 1643. that
this <hi>George Fox,</hi> being then in the Nineteenth Year
of his Age, was walking alone in the Fields, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly
Meditating upon the Nature, Mind, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
Inſtitutions, and Diſcipline of Mankind; of
their Societies and Converſe one with another, but
eſpecially bending his thoughts upon the condition
and ſtate of Young People; conſidering what Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were required at their hands, what Diligence,
Care, and Circumſpection was neceſſary in one and
all of them for leading Lives while here worthy of
the Goſpel, and becoming Men, and for obtaining
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50388:17"/>
an Everlaſting bleſſed Life when this is come to its
Period. All which things he ſeriouſly and frequently
ponder'd in his ſolitary Breaſt, fervently applying
himſelf to the Throne of Grace, that it might
pleaſe the Almighty God to Teach and Inſtruct him,
a Young Man, in this ſtate of Humane Affairs, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
him with the knowledge of his Duty, and
ability to perform the ſame; upon which there
came a Voice from Heaven, dictating unto his Spirit,
that, <hi>All Mankind was only and altogether Vanity,
that Children and Young People grew up in Lyes and
Vanities as they did in Years, thoſe of middle Age ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
ſtill more and more in the ſame manner of
Vices; ſo that when arriv'd at Old Age, they were
harden'd and confirm'd in the Cuſtomary Practice of
the ſame; and when they come to be ſtricken in Years,
and their Blood and Spirits to fade, they loſe all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Senſe, becoming again meer Children, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
extinguiſh'd that light of their Minds which
ſhould then be ſhining moſt brightly, and giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up to nothing but Doteries and Childiſh Trifles,
Death creeping upon them inſenſibly, which Cites all
before the Vniverſal Judge and Lord of all things.
Therefore it was his Duty and Intereſt, as being a
Young Man, to ſeparate himſelf from that polluted
Multitude, keeping no Commerce with them, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtrating
himſelf to a ſolitary Life far remov'd
from all manner of evil.</hi> This Divine Reſponſe did
he many times report to his fellows. Whether it
was really a Voice from Heaven, or only the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
of his own Breaſt, I do not ſay; only this is
to be remark'd, that both this <hi>Fox</hi> and his <hi>firſt Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers</hi>
did at their firſt appearance, and for a long
time after, account all the Motions of their Spirit,
or Inclinations to Good, which they found in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon ſerious Meditation, or upon any new
Occaſion, to be the effect of the Holy Spirit of God
working the ſame within them, and whenever they
were ſenſible of this Commotion within them, they
uſed to ſay, that a Voice was ſent down from God
by his Spirit unto them, uttering ſuch and ſuch
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50388:17"/>
Diſcourſe; and to this purpoſe they uſher'd in all
their Diſcourſes to the People with a, <hi>Thus ſaith the
Lord and his Spirit, by his own mouth,</hi> (this
was, that they might ſeem more nighly to reſemble
the Holy Prophets and Apoſtles, that were inſpired
from above by the Divine Spirit, and ſent by it.)
But of late they abſtain from ſuch high-flown Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
calling what thus comes upon them, the
Impulſe and Motion of their Minds. <hi>Fox</hi> uſed to
tell how that Heavenly Oracle did ſo effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it ſelf to his Youthful Spirit, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
he betook himſelf home, not being able to
expreſs what he had heard. Nay, the Image of
this Voice was always ſo before his Eyes, not only
all that day, but all the ſucceeding Night, that he
could not go to bed. And from that time he obey'd
this Heavenly Admonition. And though he had
always been diligent in Reading and Meditating on
the Holy Scriptures, and had frequently ſet times
apart for Faſting and Praying unto God; yet then
being engaged in ſo difficult and important a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in complyance to the Divine Will, he went
about the ſame Chriſtian Duties with more Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
Fervour, and Frequency: Eſpecially having
by Experience learned that there was no means more
effectual than theſe for taming Man's vicious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ſuppreſſing his unruly Appetites, ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to Humane (though hurtful) Society, and
the Corruptions of a polluted World. And though
before this he had abſtain'd ſufficiently from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with Men, yet from that time forth he was
more ſtrict in ſhunning all manner of Humane
Converſation, being only intent upon the Exerciſe
of his Trade as much as was neceſſary for purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a Livelihood, and ſpending all the reſt of his
time in Holy and Religious Exerciſes. Nor did he
only ſhun the Company of, or meeting with thoſe
he knew or ſuſpected to be given up to the Vanities
and Luſts of this World, but even thoſe that made
large ſhews of Religion and Vertue. For he did
not deny that there were many who ſeemed to be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50388:18"/>
very Religious and Devout, pretending the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Word of God for the Rule and Ground
both of Faith and Manners; but this he complain'd
heavily of, that there was ſo many who extoll'd
the Holy Scriptures, paying all Honour and Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the ſame, who yet would cry up and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol
that Profeſſion of Faith and Manners that they
had ſuck'd from theſe very Scriptures: And that
they were ſo deſtitute and ignorant of that Holy
Spirit that endited them, and ſo great ſtrangers to
that Purity of Life and Converſation which is ſo
oft recommended in the Scriptures. <hi>Fox</hi> in this his
<hi>Solitary Retirement</hi> propoſed nothing elſe to himſelf
but doing Service to others, deſigning and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſome time to be uſeful in Informing and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
not a few, by undertaking <hi>a Publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi>
for the Salvation of many. And thus he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
with himſelf, (nay, he ſaid, it was demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
to his Spirit from God himſelf) that though
School and College Learning, the Natural and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
Qualities and Gifts of the Mind, thoſe Arts
Men call Liberal and Ingenuous, and the Knowledge
of Tongues, were very uſeful Accompliſhments and
Adornments for a Theologue, or any inveſted with
that Sacred Office, yet the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> was to <hi>be
their chief Teacher</hi> and Conducter; and the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Divine Spirit, though without Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is of more avail, than Learning without the
aſſiſtance of the Spirit. However he did not ſo
totally baniſh himſelf from all Company, but that
he admitted ſometimes thoſe that came to him;
nay, and would ſometimes of his own accord go to
thoſe he thought Men of Integrity, and who ſeem'd
to walk reverently towards God, and confer with
them. Sometimes he called on the Miniſters of the
Goſpel, ſuch as he thought fit, or that he heard did
excel in Doctrine and Piety, and communicated to
them his Sentiments. He always ſo ordered his
Diſcourſe, that what he ſpoke was about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or ſtate either of Men in general, or of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
and this was the whole, and the only Tenor
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50388:18"/>
and Context of all his Diſcourſes, that the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all thoſe we call Chriſtians was ſuch, as that
all their Religion was in their Tongues; in ſo much
that their Miniſters and Paſtors who diſpenſed unto
them the Divine Word, were Men that minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but making a diſcovery of their Learning
and Knowledge, and a ſlight diſcharge of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
nay, that propoſing nothing to themſelves but
the bare external Reward, were very Hirelings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Men. This his way of Diſcourſing occaſioned
his unwelcom Reception among many.</p>
                     <p>There was at that time one <hi>Nathanael Stevens,</hi>
Miniſter of the Church at <hi>Dreton,</hi> where <hi>George
Fox</hi> was born, who uſed not only to exſpect <hi>George</hi>'s
coming to him, but oft-times prevented him, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on him as one of his Flock, and ſubject to his
Diſcipline. Whom therefore <hi>Fox,</hi> as his Cuſtom
was, had made his Reflections on him and his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
accuſing both the Miniſter and the Flock, for
being ignorant of Chriſtianity, and far eſtranged
from it in their Lives; vindicating himſelf to be
the Reſtorer and Conducter appointed for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of fallen Religion. Mr. <hi>Stevens</hi> would never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
leave him to himſelf, as being neither grieved
nor angry at him. This ſame Year <hi>George</hi> went up
and down from Town to Town, ſupplying his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
in every place he came to, with the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of his Trade, contenting himſelf with a little,
and not apprehenſive of Poverty. He was much
troubled with Melancholy, a Diſeaſe very incident,
and in a manner Natural to all that Nation; which
at that time increaſed mightily among them, and
was now become very common. <hi>George</hi> complain'd
that he was tormented without intermiſſion with
the terrible and mighty Tentations of Satan, which
drove him almoſt to deſpair, inſomuch that he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wiſh'd for Death rather than Life. And in
every place he came to he made his Addreſs to the
Pious and Godly, and ſometimes to the Miniſters
of Churches, complaining of his miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
imploring ſome help and comfort from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50388:19"/>
them. But when he had thus made known to
them the anguiſh of his Soul, ſome were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to undertake ſo difficult a Cure, or thought it
neceſſary to uſe Medicine for his Body as well as his
Soul; others adviſed him to have recourſe to the
Word of God, Faith in him, and ſerious and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Prayer for the removal of his Malady; <hi>in fine,</hi>
he could meet with none that could give him any
Satisfaction or Relief; then would he (as all ſuch
afflicted People uſe to do, when they cannot meet
with their deſires) rail againſt them, brand them
for unskilful and ignorant Phyſicians, ſpreading
Slanders and Reproaches againſt them up and down
the Country.</p>
                     <p>From this time forth he wholly withdrew from
all Society or Communication with the <hi>Viſible Church;</hi>
and on Religious days went alone into the Fields,
or ſome retired place, carrying along with him his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and ſpending the day in Reading and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating.
Nay, he ſpent the beſt part of his time in
Study and Contemplation. And both at that time,
and in the ſucceeding part of his Life, he frequently
told how he was at ſometimes poſſeſs'd with the
<hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> how many Dreams and Viſions came
upon him, what Anſwers he had from Heaven to
his Petitions; as alſo that many things foreſeen by
him, and foretold to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were lock'd up in his
Breaſt. <hi>And that he was daily taught from above,</hi>
and inſtructed in what relates to the Doctrine and
Life of a Chriſtian; ſometimes in one part of it,
ſometimes in another; ſometimes what was wicked,
and diſallowable; at other times what was good,
and to be ſought after; and all theſe things was he
to teach and explain to Men, as being ſent of God
for that purpoſe. After this he grew and increaſed
daily.</p>
                     <p>It happened, not preciſely at this time, but a
little after, when he was Teaching at <hi>Nottingham,</hi>
(for ſome things though diſtant in time are to be
connected together, having deſigned to compriſe
this <hi>Hiſtory in as compendious Bounds</hi> as is poſſible)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50388:19"/>
that he was raviſh'd into Paradiſe by the Spirit with
a Flaming Sword, where he was <hi>form'd like unto</hi>
Adam, <hi>ſuch as he was while yet in Innocence,</hi> ſo that
he clearly perceived and underſtood the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
and obſcure things, having the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
laid open and explain'd to him, how that Names
were given to every Creature ſuited to their Natures,
Vertues, and Perfections; which made him adviſe
with himſelf, whether or no he ſhould undertake
the <hi>Profeſſion of Medicine,</hi> bending his thoughts and
care to the exerciſe of the ſame for the good and
benefit of Mortal Men. For it happened in <hi>Leice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
that God diſcovered to him, how far the
<hi>Galenical</hi> Tribe was eſtrang'd from Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that Wiſdom which contriv'd and fram'd all
things, ſo that it was impoſſible for them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Natures and Conſtitutions of things.
But withal the Heavenly Oracle did likewiſe inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
that it was poſſible to reform this corrupted Art,
and ſettle it on a ſurer Foundation, if ſo be that
Artiſts, before they undertake to Adminiſter Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
to the Sick, would firſt apply themſelves to
Divine Wiſdom, and then accommodate their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
according to its Rules. <hi>Fox</hi> did in every
thing give ſhrewd Evidence that he was one of
thoſe ſort of Men who covet to have both themſelves
and all things belonging to them taken notice of;
and that he accounted it no diſgrace, but rather matter
of glorying, to be pointed at, and obſerv'd by every
body. So far was he from hiding or concealing
theſe his Revelations, and the ſingular Eminency
of his Gifts, or imagining that they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
and derided as vain empty ſhews in the
Eyes of an ill-temper'd Mind; ſo far was he from
ſuch a ſtrain as this, that on the contrary, as being
impatient of ſuch wonderful Secrets, he never
ceaſed to relate and communicate them unto his
familiar Friends and Followers, and that with the
greateſt ſtrokes of Confidence, and huge expreſſions
of Joy, but withal not forgetting to return unto
God thanks for ſuch ſingular Mercies. And theſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50388:20"/>
his Friends and Followers did no leſs believe them
things to be true, and propoſe them to the World,
as worthy to be accounted true by all; taking all
care to Trumpet forth the Praiſes of the Renowned
Author: All which was very acceptable to <hi>George,</hi>
ſo that if any body gave a favourable and reſpectful
Judgment of him and his Enterprizes, he preſently
apply'd it to himſelf with a great deal of Self-applauſe.
Of which we have an evident Inſtance
from a ſaying of one <hi>Brown,</hi> on his Death-bed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>George Fox,</hi> That he would be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the hand of God for doing great Works;
which <hi>George</hi> interpreted and affirmed to be a Viſion
or Prophecy foretelling Infallibly what great things
were to be verified in him. All his Friends were of
the ſame ſtrain with himſelf; for they gave it out
(to Inſtance in one thing) that <hi>Nathanael Stevens</hi>
(whom I formerly mentioned as Paſtor of the
Church of the place of <hi>George</hi>'s Nativity, and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and Inſtructor to him in his Childhood) did
give this Teſtimony unto him before a Remarkable
Perſon; That <hi>England did never produce ſuch a
Bud as <hi>George Fox,</hi> that he began to be ſuſpicious of
his falling upon ſome new Methods, and carving out
new ways not hitherto found out:</hi> As alſo that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, in preſence of all the People, and of
<hi>George</hi> himſelf, the ſame Perſon ſaid, That <hi>George
Fox had penetrated to the Light of the Sun, but that
he went buſily about to Eclipſe and darken the Light
of his old Pedagogue</hi> Stevens, <hi>by the greater Light
which through the Sun was in him.</hi> Which theſe
Men accounted to be the higheſt Elogy could be
given. And it ſeems very wonderful to me while
I conſider that <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf did at this time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
that <hi>Stevens,</hi> who formerly expreſs'd ſo much
Love and Kindneſs to him, and was in a manner a
Father to him, (for 'tis true indeed, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
his Piety and Ingenuity at the beginning)
was now become his Adverſary; having publickly
proclaim'd out of the Pulpit in his own Preſence,
that he was a Young Man toſs'd about with <hi>mad and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50388:20"/>
unruly Fancies.</hi> It would ſeem that theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory
Expreſſions were rather ſpoke by <hi>Stevens</hi>
with Indignation and Diſdain, ironically inſinuating
that Inſolence and Haughtineſs that reign'd in him,
which by the People were ignorantly underſtood to
be properly and truly deſign'd for Proclaiming the
Merits of <hi>George Fox.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having for a conſiderable time addicted himſelf
entirely to his Studies, he now began to try and
make the Experiment, whether he was able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
what he wiſh'd and hop'd for; to which effect
he attempted to <hi>Methodize and Collect his Thoughts
and Meditations,</hi> that at ſeveral times had poſſeſs'd
his Mind, concerning the General <hi>Corruption and
Degeneracy of Man's Nature, the Reſtoration of fallen
Mankind, the Love and Grace of God, the Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Men by the Holy Spirit,</hi> and ſeveral other
Heads; in order to make a Treatiſe or entire Work
of the whole. In this ſtate he continued for three
Years, which was to him as an Academical courſe,
he ſpending that time with no leſs Induſtry and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
both in Nocturnal Lucubrations, and Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Exerciſes, (ſitting up late, and riſing early to
compaſs his Deſign) than is uſually given by thoſe
who ſpend all their time upon Univerſity Learning,
and dedicate their whole Lives to the proſecution of
their Studies. But ſo ſoon as ever he began to peep
out from his lurking Solitude (which was in the
Year One Thouſand, Six Hundred, and Forty Seven)
and to Publiſh unto the World what he was, and
what Deſign he was upon; it is incredible to think
what a conflux of People followed after him, &amp; after
having heard him frequently, and became acquainted
with his Thoughts, with what Unanimity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
they all joyn'd iſsue to what he ſaid and taught,
and that in a very ſmall compaſs of time. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
looking upon the deſire and nod of the People
as the Voice of God, inviting him to dedicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
wholly to them, and take upon him the Office
of a Teacher, that ſo he might freely communicate
and impart to all Men whatever was in him, bending
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50388:21"/>
his Wit and Abilities to their uſe and advantage,
he thought himſelf obliged to give ear to this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Command. And accordingly from that time
forth he abandon'd the <hi>Shooe-maker's Trade</hi> (in
which he had never been as a Maſter, but as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
or Journey-man; not purchaſing any mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
things, but withal not living ſordidly or too
meanly) and now all his care was to undertake the
<hi>Office of a Teacher in this new Church.</hi> And becauſe
he was thus deſtitute of a Livelyhood, which he
formerly had by his Trade, there was not wanting
of his Followers who afforded him whereupon to
relieve his Neceſſities, leſt his being reduced to ſtraits
had cruſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d ſo glorious an Enterprize in the bud.
But withal it is not to be omitted, that he never
either asked any thing of his own accord, nor when
he got, did he ever take more than was ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for his ſuſtenance; nay, nor afterwards when
his condition was better<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, in ſo much that he could
have afforded a ſplendid and coſtly Entertainment,
did he ever allow himſelf a larger abundance of
good things; but continued all along very moderate
both in Diet, Cloathing, and all other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Body. And, as if either he could
not, or would not forget his <hi>Ancient Trade of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Leather,</hi> for a long time he cloathed himſelf
altogether with Leather; and in this Garment he
went about Preaching and Teaching, which gave
ground to the Name given him, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Leathern
Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus he daily converted many to be of his Sect,
and was accounted amongſt the People for a Man of
ſingular Piety; his Name and Fame was ſpread
round in the Counties of <hi>Leiceſter, Nottingham,</hi> and
<hi>Darby;</hi> ſo that People came on all hands to hear
and be taught of him, who when return'd to their
homes, extoll'd him among their Neighbours for a
Heavenly Man. But there were at this time others
who became Colleagues and Partners with him in
the work of the Miniſtry; and in all corners of the
Land were Men to be ſeen going about, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50388:21"/>
up this <hi>New Doctrine,</hi> either ſeverally, or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively
in one Body. Theſe <hi>Acceſſory Preachers</hi>
made it their buſineſs firſt to Preach unto thoſe who
had already made defection from the Church; and
afterwards to them who continued embody'd in the
ſame, whoſe Religion and Manners were more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to and different from theirs, which made
them teſtifie their abhorrence of that Church both
in words and deeds. But they unanimouſly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
among themſelves, that they ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to perſwade all Men, that all Chriſtian Churches
were long ago quite overturn'd; that nothing either
of <hi>Doctrine, Diſcipline, Life, or Manners,</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted
or ſound; and that therefore a new
Church was to be rear'd up from the Foundation,
according to the Model and Platform carved out by
them. This they all ſet about, taking all occaſions
of ſpeaking with the People, talking of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
complaining of and expreſſing their grief for
the Corruptions of Religion, tatling this and that
privily into the ears of the Vulgar; nay, when their
number increaſed, they became bolder, going into
Peoples Houſes, when not invited, intruding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into Companies either of more or fewer, and
preſently without any Introduction beginning ſome
new Diſcourſe, either advancing ſomething new, or
oppoſing the Sayings and Diſcourſes of others, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigiouſly
ſtarting Controverſies, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
diſſention, or any previous Enquiry into the
ſtate of the Queſtion; thus would they under the
pretence of diſcovering and vindicating the Truth,
beleh out ignominious Reproaches and Slanders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Religions of Men, and eſpecially the
<hi>Miniſters of the Church.</hi> Others there were who
only mov'd Queſtions in Company, and affirmed
nothing themſelves, or of a ſudden turned the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
another way, cunningly deſigning by their
tedious repetitions, turnings, and windings, and
frequent interruptions of Diſcourſe by bringing in
a new Subject, to irritate their Antagoniſts, that
when they through Paſſion ſhould chance to ſpeak
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50388:22"/>
roughly and loudly, they themſelves might conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
calm and moderate with a ſlow ſeverity (as it
oft-times happens, and is eaſily compaſſed) which
might occaſion their Adverſaries either not to ſpeak
laſt, or to be paſſionately ſilent at their Obſtinacy;
from whence they conclude themſelves Victors, and
amongſt the Ignorant paſs for ſuch.</p>
                     <p>And now would they publickly appear on the
High-ways, ſtanding in the <hi>Market-places,</hi> or any
place where multitudes of People uſe to aſſemble
together, promiſcuouſly Admoniſhing and Exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all they met, by-ſtanders, and others, to a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
purſuit of Repentance, Frugality, Juſtice, and
Equity.</hi> Nay, they came to that length that they
did not ſtick at entring into the Churches, not only
of thoſe who diſſented from the Publick Church-Eſtabliſhment,
but even of them who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
to it; ſome of 'em caſually falling into the
Church, and appearing as if afraid; others deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
and boldly went into them, finding fault with
the Diſcourſes and Prayers of the Miniſters, diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
and defaming both them and their Actions
with all manner of Inſolence and Impudence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe were the firſt beginnings.</hi> But in the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
part of this Book I ſhall ſhew that many
(nay, moſt) of 'em have afterwards by degrees
omitted, changed, or reformed many of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiatory
Principles. <hi>Fox,</hi> as he was the firſt Author
of this Sect, ſo was he the chief Actor, Counſellor,
and Conductor of others in all Affairs relating to
the ſame. His firſt Succeſs was in the Town of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi>
from whence his Doctrine did iſſue forth
into all corners of that County, and afterwards the
whole Kingdom. For having confidently appear'd
in the Church, and boldly vindicated his Doctrines
in <hi>Face of the whole Aſſembly,</hi> he was thereupon caſt
into Priſon; but was not ſo cloſely confin'd, but
that Liberty was given to his Friends to viſit and
converſe with him: So that many of the Citizens
went frequently to Priſon to Diſcourſe him, and
among the reſt <hi>John Reccles,</hi> Mayor of the Town,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50388:22"/>
with his Wife and whole Family, with whom <hi>George</hi>
did ſharply Expoſtulate, treating them with ſome
ſeverity of words; however they became his Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,
aſſociated themſelves to his Sect, and began
publickly to Preach his Doctrines among their own
People and Neighbours. This Impriſonment of
<hi>George Fox</hi> was of a very ſhort continuance. This
was in the Year of our Lord, One Thouſand, Six
Hundred Forty Nine, in the Five and Twentieth
Year of his Age. Which Year was Sacred to him,
for that in the ſame he both commenc'd the ſtate of
a Man, being come to perfect Age, and alſo the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Miniſtry: This ſame Year was alſo Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
amongſt the Quakers, for being the Year
of the Nativity of their Church, which now began
to increaſe and be confirm'd. And from this Year
it is that they commence all the Miracles of the
New-born Church. <hi>Fox</hi> remain'd yet a while lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> and reſided for ſome time
at <hi>Mansfield,</hi> where having entred an Hoſpital, he
ſpy'd a Woman, who beſides the diſtraction of her
Mind, was miſerably tormented with intolerable
Pains: The Phyſician ordered her a Vein to be
open'd, that by taking away ſome of her Blood,
her pain might be abated, for which end her hands
were bound up. <hi>Fox</hi> opportunely draws nigh,
views the Woman, and what they were about to
do to her, preſently affirms and maintains, that ſhe
was afflicted with an Evil Spirit; which he did not
ſay, as the Vulgar uſe to do, who when they are
ignorant of the cauſe of any Evil, aſſign the Devil
for its Author: He continues ſtedfaſt in affirming
what he had ſaid, and orders the Woman to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty'd,
which being accordingly done, and ſhe being
over-wearied with the Torment, and Reſiſtance ſhe
had made, he deſires her to <hi>Reſt and be ſtill.</hi> She
obeys, recovers her loſt Reaſon, and is reſtor'd to
her former and ſo long interrupted Temperature of
Body. Upon this, <hi>Fox</hi> Taught, that the Sick were
cur'd, and unclean Spirits caſt out by that Divine
Vertue which works in his People. His followers,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50388:23"/>
who were as <hi>Rattles</hi> and <hi>Cymbals</hi> to blaze about his
Fame, diſguis'd the matter thus, That the Woman
was poſſeſs'd with a Devil, who had troubled her
for the ſpace of Two and Thirty Years, that being
brought unto him, after many hideous ſhrieks and
outcries, and motions like to the <hi>bellowing of a Cow,</hi>
and a moſt noiſome ſtink breath'd from her mouth,
ſhe was freed of that Malignant Spirit in preſence
of a great multitude of People. <hi>Fox</hi> did likewiſe
boaſt that he cured a certain Man in a Village called
<hi>Trikoſſio</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> after he had been given
over by the Phyſicians, only by uttering ſome few
words to him, and ſtretching forth his hand to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
His Friends added yet another, that having
ended his Diſcourſe to the People, he happen'd
once to meet with a Woman (accompany'd by her
Husband) all over Scabby, Ulcerous, and covered
round with Cataplaſms; upon which he enquired
of the Husband if he had the <hi>Faith of Miracles;</hi>
but while he was heſitating, and delaying to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
he asked the ſame Queſtion of the Woman,
and ſhe having anſwered affirmatively, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
pull'd off the Cataplaſms, and ſhe was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
reſtored to her Health. Both himſelf and his
Followers do likewiſe pretend that on ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
he performed the like Miracles by the <hi>ſimple
touch of his hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But beſides <hi>Miracles, the Quakers</hi> did after this
time pretend to <hi>Viſions and Prophecies,</hi> which they
ſaid was a ſingular Gift vouchſafed only to them.
Yet they were more ſparing in their Diſcourſes on
this Subject, and except one or two Examples which
are very ſpecial, and depending on the diſtinction
of Places, Times, and Perſons, they alledge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but General Examples, which therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be of any certain Authority, ſo as to merit our
belief; and I do not find their ſpecial Inſtances of
ſuch weight as to be worth our inſerting. Nay, this
I chooſe rather to ſay, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
theſe firſt beginners, do not make ſo much
noiſe either of Miracles or Viſions, nor do they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50388:23"/>
ſpeak or write of thoſe of their Sect that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
them, unleſs very cautiouſly and warily; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
and owning that ſince the old Goſpel
preached by Chriſt and his Apoſtles was ſufficiently
confirmed with Miracles and Predictions, this new
Goſpel which they now advance, being in ſubſtance
the ſame with that of old, does not need theſe Helps
and Miracles: That they do not make their Religion
depend upon them; that they neither hope nor wiſh
for Praiſe and Glory from Men, nor expect to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a favourable Reception from them upon any
ſuch account. So that it ſeems this is their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to boaſt of ſome of the Signs of the Primitive
and Apoſtolick Church, but withal to take care, leſt
if theſe Signs be not clear and manifeſt to all, they
ſhould come to be deſpiſed and laugh'd at: Unleſs
they propoſe to themſelves the Example of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
who ſometimes took pains to conceal his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
and Prophecies.</p>
                     <p>The Quakers commemorate it that their Sect did
ſo multiply and increaſe after this Year, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
ſo much Concord and Unity among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that now they became <hi>an orderly and ſettled
Church,</hi> conſpicuous not for external Splendor and
Magnificence, but for eminent <hi>Innocence and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.</hi>
And whereas moſt of them had heretofore
continued ſtill Members of the Churches they were
formerly joyned to, or if at any time they went
aſide to follow their New Model of Worſhip, it
was very privately, and with a few Companions;
but now they ſeparated from them in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and with open and undaunted boldneſs, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into one Body among themſelves with <hi>one Voice,
and one Mind,</hi> profeſſing themſelves to be all incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
into one common Society, entring into an
Eccleſiaſtical Covenant one with another, that as oft,
and in whatever place, as an Opportunity offered it
ſelf, they ſhould joyn and aſſemble together for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about Religious Matters. And all their Religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Confeſſions were of this Nature, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
more on the received Tenets of other Churches
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50388:24"/>
which they were to reject and condemn, than in
delivering poſitively what Articles they were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and maintain. As to other things their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
were ſhort and plain: They contain'd few
neceſſary Articles of Faith; none of them related
to the contemplation and ſpeculation of abſtruſe
and difficult things, which are more curious than
uſeful to Piety and Goodneſs; they were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Light which ſhines in every Man's Soul,</hi>
and the Word of God within them; of inward
Communion with God; of the Reverence, Love,
and Obedience due to him and his revealed Will;
and of the Relative Duties of Men one to another.
When they aſſembled together for Divine Worſhip,
their manner of Worſhipping, and all ſort of
Sacred Exerciſes were free from any External Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements,
Rites, or Ceremonies; all was wrapt
up in <hi>a deep ſilence,</hi> and tacit waiting upon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
till it raiſed them up to ſpeak; and when they
ſpoke, their Diſcourſes were Exhorting of every
Man to Self-Examination, and a ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Operations of the Spirit, the Light
within them, and the Word of God which was in
their Hearts; admoniſhing them to ſtudy to deny
themſelves, ſubject themſelves to God, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to Repent and amend their Lives; to be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
Temperate, True, and Conſtant in their Words
and Actions; and to be diligent and chearful in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
all ſuch Actions as became Men to do, and
were fit for reconciling Men to one another, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
Peace and Concord in the World. And ſo
far as could be obſerved by the ſtricteſt Enquirer,
they ſeemed to lead Lives conform to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
for both in their promiſcuous Converſation,
and likewiſe in one anothers Company, their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
and Temperance was ſuch, as that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
their Character, whereby they were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from all others. In the Management of
Commerce and Trade with the reſt of the World,
they were <hi>Meek, Mild, and Moderate;</hi> in their
Countenances ſevere, and ſlow in ſpeech; they were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50388:24"/>
but mean in their Cloathing, and their Houſes not
richly furniſhed, though there was among them
Men of large Subſtances. The moſt conſpicuous
Vertue of all was a diligent Love, Care, and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
over thoſe of their Faction, eſpecially as to
their Religious Concerns; for they narrowly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
how every one behaved himſelf in Religious
Matters. As to the ordinary Actions of Humane
Life, they were <hi>free from Pride or Oſtentation,</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable,
Familiar, Bountiful to thoſe of an inferiour
Station, ſo that it was no ſingular or new thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them to ſee the Rich and Powerful Courting
and Careſſing the Poor. They were Merciful, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral,
and Compaſſionate to the Miſerable and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
either in Body or Mind; every one helped
another, either with his Subſtance, Counſel, or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
as his Capacity allow'd, and the Neceſſity
of his Neighbour requir'd, ſo that none of them
wanted for any thing. Their chiefeſt care and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
was ſo to accommodate all their Actions, as
that they might ſeem not to introduce any new up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart
Religion, but to reſemble the <hi>Ancient Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church,</hi> imitating their Simplicity, Gravity,
and Vertuous Demeanor. By all which it came to
paſs that many were added to them, every body
being aſtoniſh'd at the ſingularity of their Carriage.
I my ſelf am acquainted with <hi>a very learned worthy
Man,</hi> who having heard ſuch great things of them,
had the Curioſity to undertake <hi>a Voyage to England,</hi>
in order to ſatisfie himſelf of the verity of what
was reported; and after having arrived there, and
converſed with them, and ſeen their Actions, which
far ſurpaſs'd his expectation, he was ſo much taken
with them, that he forthwith yielded <hi>himſelf a
Member of their Society.</hi> But the reſt of the World
who did not joyn with them, abhorred them and
all their Actions, believing all their fair Pretences
to be but vain ſhews diſguiſed with ſmooth coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances
and deceitful words, inſomuch that they
would not hear, nor be witneſſes to any of their
doings, of which they could not entertain the leaſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50388:25"/>
favourable thought; nay, they inveigh'd againſt
them with the moſt reviling Expreſſions, ſpreading
this Report of their Life and Manners (tho' with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Author to atteſt it) that they were the
veryeſt Rogues of all Men alive, Exorciſts and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers
(as the Vulgar calls them) who under the
covert of ſuch ſpecious Doctrines opened the Gates
for all manner of Wickedneſs and Roguery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
only to catch and enſnare ſimple Men by
their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uggling Enchantments. Unto which Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Reproaches, all their Reply and Comfort was,
That this their Treatment was nothing worſe than
what the Ancient Chriſtians and Holy Men of all
Ages have unworthily, and unjuſtly met with on
the ſame Account. But now I return to <hi>George
Fox.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He remained for ſome time at <hi>Mansfield,</hi> where
he went into the Church, while the Miniſter was
Preaching, and begun to oppoſe and contradict him
publickly; upon which the People being incenſed,
fell upon him with Hands and Feet, dragging him
out of the Church into Priſon; and that ſame very
day towards the Evening he was ſet at Liberty and
diſmiſs'd, and the Mobb again encountred him with
Affronts and Stripes, beating him out of Town.
The ſame Treatment he met with elſewhere. But
he continued ſtill the ſame Old Man, becoming ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more conſtant and confirm'd (as it were) in
defending and maintaining his Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
not refraining from that Tumultuating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
he had now begun of appearing in the Publick
Churches, and oppoſing the Miniſters of the ſame;
not ſuffering either the remembrance of his paſt
pain and trouble, nor the fear of what might enſue,
to abate his Fervour and Zeal in proſecuting his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
for one Minute of Time; and thus undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
he puſh'd on for the two or three ſubſequent
Years.</p>
                     <p>But before I proceed further, it is requiſite that
I firſt give a diſtinct, though ſhort, Account of
the chief Articles that he litigiouſly wrangled about
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50388:25"/>
(I do not ſay diſputed, or diſcourſed) in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Aſſemblies and Congregations, the Sermons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either ended or interrupted through his Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency.
Theſe Articles related either to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
themſelves, who (as he ſaid) were only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by love of a Reward or Hire to Preach the
Goſpel, which ſhould be Preach'd <hi>gratis</hi> unto all
Men; or to the Inſtrument or Source from which
they ſuck'd the Doctrines they taught their hearers,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Sacred Scriptures, or Word of God, which
he thought an improper name; or to this part of
their Doctrine, that the Saints, while in this Life,
cannot attain to that fulneſs and perfection of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
and Holineſs which the Law of God requires;
which he ſaid was a Principle that encouraged Men
in their ſins, patronizing and defending the ſame.
But in all theſe Controverſies he never conſidered
how near a-kin his own Caſe was unto theirs who
maintain'd theſe Doctrines; for though he pretended
to take all this pains and trouble in running about
to Preach the Goſpel gratuitouſly, and without any
Reward, yet thoſe he preach'd to ſupply'd his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,
before he ask'd it of them; at leaſt-wiſe
he was never deny'd the Liberty of coming uncalled
for (as the Flies) and (like Mice) feeding upon
others Proviſion: He might have alſo remembred
his uſual Preface and Introduction to all his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
when about to inform the People of ſome
Secret hid from the World, <hi>This is the Word of the
Lord;</hi> and that he ſeldom diſcourſed to his People
of the Internal, Spiritual Force and Obligation of
the Law, but only of External Vertues; thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
many real ſins repugnant to the Law and
Perfection of God.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Fiftieth</hi> Year of this Century, he being in
<hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> in the Town of the ſame name, went
into a <hi>Presbyterian Church,</hi> where, after Sermon
ended, he boldly diſcovered his Thoughts and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
to the whole Congregation; upon which
he was brought before the Magiſtrate, who after
ſome Debates paſt betwixt <hi>Fox</hi> and the Miniſters of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50388:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Churches, ordered him to be taken and put into
Gaol, as being a troubleſom Fellow, putting all
things into Confuſion, where he remained for Six
Months.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is to be Remark'd, that theſe Men are
not altogether averſe or unwilling to be denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Chriſtians;</hi> though they ſay, that Name was at
firſt given to Chriſt's Diſciples by the wicked Jews
and Gentiles out of Contempt and Deriſion; others
ſay, it is of too narrow a compaſs, not including
all the Godly, who are worſhippers of God, and
partakers of his Grace, being confined only to thoſe
who acknowledge and profeſs the Name of Chriſt.
But becauſe the Quakers have always in their
mouths the name of <hi>Light,</hi> Preaching Chriſt as a
<hi>Light</hi> enlightening every one; and exhorting all
Men to walk in that <hi>Light,</hi> as Sons of the <hi>Light,</hi>
they were called by ſome Mockers, <hi>The Confeſſors
and Sons of the Light;</hi> which denomination did not
altogether diſpleaſe them. And at this time the
opprobrious Nickname of <hi>Quakers</hi> was firſt given
them, the occaſion of which was this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fox</hi> being detained in Priſon, was ſometimes
called before the Magiſtrates to be examined; where
he took occaſion oft-times to admoniſh the Judges
who examined him, to reverence and fear God, to
<hi>Tremble at his Word,</hi> and to work out their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with fear and trembling; (which was not only
an uſual Expreſſion to him, but to all his abettors)
one of the Judges, by Name <hi>Jeremy Bennet,</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him talk ſo frequently of <hi>Trembling and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi>
gives him and all his Sect the denomination of
<hi>Quakers.</hi> Beſides, all the People having obſerved
that in performance of Sacred Services they trembled
and ſhook, thought this new Name the more proper,
ſo that ever ſince they have been known all over
<hi>England</hi> by the Name of <hi>Quakers.</hi> They by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
dexterity they have of putting favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
on Names, apply this and all other Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names
formerly mentioned, to themſelves, in their
own ſenſe and meaning; as I hinted in the beginning
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50388:26"/>
of this Treatiſe. But the Quakers tell us, that this
Judge <hi>Bennet,</hi> in the mean time that he was ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and troubleſom to him, was afflicted by God
with a Remarkable ſtroke; that the Keeper of the
Priſon, or Gaoler, who had formerly been fierce
and ſevere againſt him as a Lion, after having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
what ſort of Man he was, became meek
and peaceable to him as a Lamb. Now ſix Months
being expired, he is let looſe from Priſon, and was
carried to the Market-place to thoſe that were there
levying Soldiers (for the Difference betwixt the
<hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> was not yet put to an end)
in order to enliſt himſelf a Soldier; and being
brought thither, he was tempted of them by large
offers to engage in the Service, but he was ſo far
from yielding to their deſire, that he accoſted them
with this ſhort, but tart Diſcourſe: <hi>What! do you
think to wheedle me into your Service by your large
Promiſes? I would not give my ſelf for a Soldier, tho'
you ſhould threaten to inflict the greateſt Evils upon
my refuſal. What! am not I now a Soldier already?
Do not I now wage War and Fight? But the War I
am engaged in is not ſuch as brings certain Deſtruction
both to the Conqueror and conquered; to the former
the certain ruine of his Soul, and to the latter a risk
of loſing his Life; but my Fighting is to abſtain from
all theſe Quarrels, Wars, and Arms; nay, not only
to abſtain from them, but to conquer and ſubjugate thoſe
Paſſions and Luſts, from whence they ariſe. I am a
Soldier, waging War, and fighting, but ſo as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the Peace and Safety of my ſelf, of you, and
all Men, both here in this Humane Society, and alſo
with God. Which Practice would to God both ye and
all the World would ſtudy to imitate. Wherefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of you that ye give me no more trouble of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and that ye be aware of running your ſelves
into a worſe condition than ye are in already, leſt by
indulging your ſelves this liberty of ſinning against
God the Emperor of the World, his wrath be kindled
againſt you, and when the time for Vengeance ſhall
come, and the Door of Mercy ſhut up, ye periſh for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50388:27"/>
ever.</hi> This Diſcourſe was ſo far from putting a
ſtop to the fury of his Adverſaries, that it ſpurr'd
on their fierceneſs and cruelty the more, which
they expreſs'd not in Impriſoning him as before, but
in caſting him into a naſty, ſtinking Dungeon, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
under Ground, where Thieves and Malefactors
were kept. But after other ſix Months he got out
from thence alſo. And this Affliction did not in
the leaſt ſcare him from proſecuting his Deſign,
but he ſtill became bolder and brisker, Propagating
his Doctrine, not only in the Counties of <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Darby,</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter</hi> (which were the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre
and Stage where this great Engine did firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear)
but through all <hi>York-ſhire, Lancaſter,</hi> and
the vaſt Tract of Lands called <hi>Weſtmorland;</hi> in all
which places he unweariedly preached his Doctrine
and Diſcipline, being followed by vaſt numbers of
the People. This is certain, that none of all the
Quakers ever preached or diſcourſed ſo often, and
unto ſo many different Hearers, as <hi>George Fox;</hi> and
he himſelf never made ſo many Diſcourſes as in theſe
places, and at this time. But becauſe he could not
be preſent every where to ſpeak Face to Face, he
now began to write Letters to ſeveral Societies, and
likewiſe to particular Men; Inſtructing and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
them in what he imagined moſt neceſſary
to be known and practiſed. And to this day are to
be ſeen in many peoples hands whole bundles of
Letters wrote by him to the ſame Perſons: Though
he did not expreſs any great ſtrength of Diſcourſe
or Reaſoning in theſe his Letters, for that he both
wrote ſuch Characters as were not eaſie to be read,
and alſo in ſo rude and ſimple a Style, ſometimes
moſt difficult and intricate, that it is a wonder any
Man ſo much exerciſed in ſpeaking and diſcourſing,
ſhould have been the Author of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt Letter he wrote was in the Year Fifty,
to his Friends, which I ſhall here inſert. It was
wrote Originally in</hi> Engliſh, <hi>and is tranſlated from
the Original into</hi> Latin, <hi>which done from the</hi> Latin
<hi>into</hi> Engliſh <hi>again (for the Original is not in our
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50388:27"/>
hands) runs thus.</hi> The Lord is King over all the
Earth; wherefore all ye Nations praiſe and magnifie
your King in true Obedience, purity of Holineſs and
Sincerity. O! conſider in true Obedience, how ye
ſhould know the Lord with Vnderſtanding; mark and
conſider in ſilence, in ſubmiſſion of Mind, and ye
ſhall hear the Lord ſpeaking to you in your Minds.
His Voice is ſweet and pleaſant. His Sheep hear his
voice, and will give ear to no other. And when they
hear his voice, they rejoyce and obey, and alſo ſing for
joy. O! their hearts are filled with Eternal Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.
They ſing forth and praiſe the Eternal God
in <hi>Zion.</hi> Their Joy ſhall none take from them. Glory
be to the Lord for ever. <hi>G. F.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this ſame Fiftieth Year <hi>Elizabeth Hooton,</hi> born
and living in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> a Woman pretty far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in Years, was the firſt of her Sex among the
Quakers who attempted to imitate Men, and Preach,
which ſhe now (in this Year) commenced. After
her Example, many of her Sex had the confidence
to undertake the ſame Office. This Woman after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
went with <hi>George Fox</hi> into <hi>New-England,</hi>
where ſhe wholly devoted her ſelf to this Work;
and after having ſuffered many Affronts from that
People, went into <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and there finiſhed her
Life. But I return again to <hi>Fox.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While he thus continued ſo forward and zealous
for Preaching his Doctrines, his condition was very
various; ſtrange Events and Accidents falling out,
of which I think it convenient to give you a ſhort
Account. It happened in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> in a Town to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Eaſt Part of it, called <hi>Beverlar,</hi> that he
went into the Church, being <hi>mightily mov'd in Spirit:</hi>
where he firſt kept himſelf ſilent, till the Miniſter
had finiſh'd his Sermon; then before all the People
he thunder'd out his extemporary and reviling Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues,
and preſently convey'd himſelf away;
thus he eſcaped ſafe and unpuniſh'd. Some few
days after that, at <hi>Crantſick,</hi> as the Miniſter had
juſt read the Text of his enſuing Diſcourſe (being
a Man of conſiderable Worth and Fame) he fell
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50388:28"/>
upon him with a Diſcourſe, the only purport of
which was to expreſs his contempt of the Dignity,
Order, and Religion of this worthy Divine. Which
Action might have brought him into extream dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
for every body almoſt accounted it a ſignal of
ſo great Impudence and Inſolence, that they thought
no Vengeance too great, nor no Reſentment too
high for ſo villainous and injurious a Crime, yet he
eſcap'd unpuniſh'd. But I come to give you a
larger Account of a certain Sermon of his. Being
in <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> his Native Country, he had occaſion to
Travel in that Country with ſome of his Friends.
He ſpyes from afar a certain Town, not knowing
which it was; but having asked of his Friends, comes
to underſtand that it was <hi>Lichfield.</hi> Thither he
preſently reſolves to go, and pronounce Curſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all the Citizens, high or low, or of whatever
degree; for they were all equally unknown to him.
While I call to remembrance the Ancient Annals of
the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Affairs, it comes into my Mind, that at
this very Town, in the time of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
there was a great many Chriſtian Martyrs
miſerably afflicted, and tortured with all manner of
exquiſite Torments: And then in the Reign of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, King of <hi>England,</hi> there was a
Battel fought betwixt the King and the Earl of
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> near to this place, in which great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Men were ſlain on both ſides, and the King's
Army almoſt totally routed. So that on both theſe
occaſions this Ground was covered with the Blood
of ſo many Men. And beſides, in <hi>Fox</hi>'s own time,
while that Fatal Civil War was raging in <hi>England,</hi>
betwixt the King and the People, in the ſame Fields,
and this very ſame Town, there was a great deal of
Humane Blood ſhed; all which <hi>Fox</hi> was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of. Thither (I ſay) did he preſently direct
his courſe; and becauſe he did not know the right
Road (for he had now parted from his Friends)
being impatient of delay, he follow'd the ſight of
his Eye, moving in a ſtraight line, without winding
or turning to either hand, leaping over rugged
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50388:28"/>
uneven places, Hedges, Ditches, and all that came
in his way. But before he arrived at the Town, he
ſees ſome Shepherds, to whom he approaches, and
ſtays a little with them. It was now the Winter
Seaſon, and very cold, yet he was burning like a
Fire: Therefore he throws off his ſhooes, leaving
them with the Herds; and thus bare-footed (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Shooes) he made haſte to get at the Town,
where running up and down, he cries, <hi>Woe! Woe!
to this bloody City, <hi>Lichfield;</hi>
                        </hi> not adding why or to
what purpoſe he had ſaid ſo, or what had been done
there, or what was to come to paſs; or with what
Deſign and Signification he had ſaid ſo, what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
he would give them for amendment of
their Lives, or what other Caution was fit and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
on ſuch an Occaſion. Of all theſe he could
give no Account, neither then, nor any time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
neither would he ever interpret or explain
this any further, than that God had revealed it to
his Spirit. But a little after, he came to know of
ſome Friend of his, that in this City, and adjacent
Country had been ſeen ſome Bloody Spectacle.
While he thus continued running up and down,
crying the ſame words, the Citizens ſuffered him to
paſs, imagining him to be a Mad-man, rather to be
pityed or laugh'd at, than called to an Account.
At length becoming cold all over his Body, and his
Joynts ſtiff with cold, and being weary with run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
he goes out of Town, and returns to the
Shepherds; and when he had come at them, he was
now ſo inſlam'd with a Heavenly and Divine Fire,
that he mattered not whether he put on his Shooes
again or not. But being admoniſh'd of God, he
puts them on, and leaves that place. It frequently
fell out, that Men believing him to be a Mad-man,
ſuffered him to go unpuniſh'd. But his Confidence
and Conſtancy did not always eſcape ſo. For in
other places he was forbid acceſs, or Lodging, or
Refreſhing himſelf in his Journey, to ſatisfie Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and Thirſt; ſo that he was ſometimes forced to
lie whole Nights in the open Fields, without Meat
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50388:29"/>
or Sleep. And if he came to a place unawares, or
of a ſudden, he was ſometimes repulſed with threats
and hard words; and if he adventur'd to enter a
Church, and make any Publick Diſcourſe, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the Preacher, the Congregation frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
him, not only with words, but with good
hard blows, and that ſometimes very cruelly: As it
happened in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> at <hi>Warnsfort</hi> and <hi>Doncaſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At <hi>Tickhill,</hi> while he was yet ſpeaking in the
Church, they beat him ſo ſeverely, that the Blood
ſprung out of his Face; then having caught him
by the Neck, they dragg'd him out of the Church,
Caning him, till at length he got into ſome Houſe,
and from thence convey'd himſelf privily out of
the Town. But he was no where ſo hardly and
cruelly dealt with, as at <hi>Vlverſtown</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire;</hi>
where he entertain'd a ſharp Debate with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
for ſome time; after which the Mobb (not
all the Congregation, but the ignorant and meaner
ſort, Youths, Children, and ſuch like) did imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
attack him, thumping him with their Fiſts
while in the Church, then dragging him from thence,
they trampled him under foot, ſo mangling and
tearing him, that he was in danger of his Life; but
in the mean while neither did he refrain from beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and wounding ſome of them; which, though
againſt his Conſcience, yet was not much blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.
The reſt of the Congregation endeavoured
by words to mollifie the enraged Mobb, and to reſcue
the diſtreſſed poor Man from their mercileſs hands.
At another place in this ſame County, when he
was making towards them, they aſſembling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into Companies, and being ſlightly armed,
came out and met him, denying him acceſs into
their Bounds. But he ſtill remained conſtant, with
an unmoveable Patience, doing the ſame Actions
ſtill, maugre all the danger that ſurrounded him.
And while theſe Evils and Sufferings were ready to
grieve and pierce his Soul, he took it to be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
and Exhortation from God to adventure
upon every thing; he imagined that God ſhewed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50388:29"/>
him <hi>large Countries in the top of a high Hill, in which
he had choſen a peculiar People to himſelf.</hi> He boaſted
that he found in the declining of that Hill a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
whoſe Waters were moſt comfortable and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
for quenching Thirſt, after he had wanted
Meat and Drink for ſome days; that a little while
after he ſaw a multitude of Men cloathed in white
Raiment approaching unto God, towards the gentle
and gliding ſtreams of theſe Waters. All theſe
things he diligently remark'd, writing them down
in his Papers, and communicating the ſame to his
Friends.</p>
                     <p>Now was the Year of our Lord, One Thouſand,
Six Hundred, Fifty Two, after which this Sect did
wonderfully increaſe, having been ever before but (as
it were) in its Birth and firſt Appearance. There
be two things that uſually concur to procure an
eaſie Progreſs and honourable Reception to any
new Undertaking: The Dignity and Fame of thoſe
who engage in it, and the Conveniency and Opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of their Place of Meeting and Aſſembling
together. Now, whereas heretofore <hi>Fox</hi> with his
Adherents and Followers had none to be of their
Society ſave thoſe of the meaneſt and loweſt Rank;
nor any to Preach and Teach, ſave thoſe of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
Ignorant ſort of People; now were added to
them many Opulent and Conſiderable Men, of good
Reputation and Dignity in the World, who not
only made up the number of their Hearers, but
likewiſe ſupply'd the place of Doctors and Teachers.
And, whereas before they uſed to Aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
together promiſcuouſly in any place, whether
in Town or Country; and he of 'em who had a
mind to ſpeak or diſcourſe to the People, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to take occaſion of the caſual Conflux and
Congregations of the People, either in Churches,
Courts, Market-places, Fields, Streets, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
occaſion ſerved; from which oft-times follow'd
Inſurrections of the People to beat and ſtone them;
ſometimes to caſt them in Priſon, and bind them
with Irons and Chains; now they began to Meet in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50388:30"/>
Houſes, and there to Teach and go about Sacred
Things, which was a much ſafer way, for that thus
they were freed from many Inconveniencies, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
that of lying open to the Fury of the
Mobb. Both theſe Advantages accrued unto them
by degrees, and ſometimes by wonderful chance.</p>
                     <p>I have already told what Countries <hi>Fox</hi> did moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſort to at this time, <hi>Yorkſhire, Lancaſhire,</hi> and
<hi>Weſtmorland.</hi> The firſt in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> that became his
Diſciple, and afterwards his Colleague, was <hi>William
Densbury,</hi> born in that County, who had once been
a dealer in Wool in <hi>Wakefield,</hi> and afterwards a
Trumpeter in <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi>s Army. This Man
heard <hi>Fox</hi> Preach one day; and when towards the
Evening of that ſame very day <hi>Fox</hi> went out into
the Fields to Meditate, he followed after him, and
told him, that of a long time he had bended his
Mind upon the ſame Deſign that he had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
and that now he was ſo mov'd with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
that he wholly gave up himſelf to be his
Diſciple: Upon which <hi>Fox</hi> and he conſulted ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
together about their Deſign. A little while
after, <hi>Densbury</hi> became a Preacher, performing
the Office of a Trumpeter of the new Doctrines to
this new Church with a great deal of Applauſe.
And though he ſpent the beſt part of his ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Life in Priſon, becauſe of his Boldneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in ſounding this Religious Trumpet; yet this
Affliction he patiently endured, not ſuffering Trouble
or Anguiſh to invade his Mind, but continuing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and chearful in receiving the Injuries he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for the ſake of a good Conſcience, and of that
Holy Office he had undertaken for the Salvation of
Mankind. His very Enemies acknowledge that he
was Eloquent, and every way fit for managing
what relates to that Society.</p>
                     <p>The next that followed him in this Office was
<hi>James Naylor,</hi> once a Country Boor not far from
<hi>Wakefield,</hi> afterwards a Soldier in the Parliament's
Army, who not long after he had undertaken this
Office, met with wonderful Accidents, as I ſhall
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50388:30"/>
relate, when I come to that Period of Time. After
him followed <hi>Thomas Aldham,</hi> who oft-times co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted
the Company of Eccleſiaſtical Men, for to
Diſcourſe and Diſpute with them; nay, he affected
alſo to converſe with the Politicians, and <hi>Cromwel</hi>
the Protector himſelf, whom he went to, partly to
manifeſt his Learning and Knowledge, and partly
to obtain his Conſent and Belief to their Articles;
ſo great Confidence and Hope he placed in that
Man. Next to him was <hi>Philip Scafey,</hi> Miniſter of
a Publick Church at a little Village in this ſame
County, near to <hi>Whitby,</hi> called <hi>Robin Hood</hi>'s <hi>Bay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
upon the Sea-ſide.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> the firſt that apply'd himſelf to
<hi>Fox</hi> and his Society, was <hi>Richard Hubberthorn,</hi> born in
the Northern Parts of that County, of good Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and liberally Educated, who was at that time
a Captain in the Parliament's Army; and ſo over-Religious,
that oft-times at the Head of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
he would make Diſcourſes to them, as if he
had been a Preacher. And not long after he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Preacher among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> which Office
he diſcharged ſo well in their Eyes, that they all
unanimouſly gave him a very high Teſtimony. His
Writings left behind do teſtifie him to have been no
contemptible Diſputant, but too violent and tart,
and ſometimes bitter and reviling. Next were <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Taylor,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Chriſtopher Taylor,</hi> both
Publick Miniſters in that Country. Next was <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Farnſworth,</hi> Author of a Book which treats
of the Pronouns <hi>Tu</hi> and <hi>Vos,</hi> or <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Ye;</hi>
wherein he proves by Examples pick'd out of the
Holy Writings, that it is unlawful in our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Diſcourſes one with another, to uſe any other
compellation than <hi>Thou.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> the firſt that joyn'd to this Society,
and became Preacher among them, was <hi>John Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance;</hi>
then <hi>Francis Howgil,</hi> formerly a Taylor at
<hi>Appleby,</hi> at that time a Sectary Preacher to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant
Congregation, who returned the Money
he had formerly received of his Congregation for a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50388:31"/>
Reward of his Service; a Man of Learning, and as
well qualified as many of that Sect. After them
came <hi>Edward Burrough,</hi> a Young Ruſtick Fellow,
of Sixteen or Seventeen Years; but equall'd to a
Man, and deſigned for great things. Laſt of all, I
ſhall mention one <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> who at this
time joyned himſelf to this Sect, taking upon him
alſo the Office of a Teacher; he was then Miniſter
to the Church of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> talked of among the
Learned for his skill in both Tongues, his Piety and
Modeſty; and Famous at this very day, though
ſtricken in Years, for his dexterity of Diſputing
and Managing Controverſies, both with Tongue and
Pen. I omit the Names of others. But it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
here to Remark, that the chiefeſt and greateſt
part of thoſe who engaged in this Society, were
ſuch as were either Members of Presbyterian
Churches, or Independants, or Browniſts, or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts;
of which latter a great many bore Arms for
<hi>Cromwel</hi> and the Parliament; for the moſt part of
their Army conſiſted of ſuch kind of Men: And
not only theſe Sectaries themſelves gave themſelves
to this Society, but even their Doctors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
whoſe Example and Influence induced many
of their Congregations to do the like. So that the
firſt Congregation of Quakers was a multitude of
People, not ſo extravagant or faulty in their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
as fluctuating and unſettled in their Religions,
which were very various and diſcrepant one from
another; and of which <hi>England</hi> had now great
ſtore, Thoſe of them that were better accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
than others, fitted their Houſes, and other
Private places for receiving their Aſſemblies when
congregated for Divine Worſhip. They did not
exclude even thoſe who were not of their Party,
if they came in Peaceably, only to hear and ſee,
without intermedling with any thing; unleſs they
ſuſpected or underſtood 'em to be Spies, coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome ill Deſign to trap them, or hatch ſome Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
againſt them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:50388:31"/>
                        <hi>Fox</hi> was very diligent in inſinuating himſelf and
his Doctrines into the Affections of thoſe who were
Men of Dignity and Power; who though they were
not fitter to Judge of his Deſign, yet were more
capable to advance and propagate that Intereſt, and
he gain'd not a few of them. Among whom were
ſome Magiſtrates greater or leſſer, who like Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones
drew many of their underling Inferiours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them. But there happened likewiſe at this time
a memorable Inſtance of the Progreſs and Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Fox</hi> and his Adherents in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> which
is not here to be omitted. There lived in <hi>Lancaſhire
Thomas Fell,</hi> (one of the Judges) who with his
Wife <hi>Margaret Fell,</hi> were famous and renown'd
for Religion and Piety. <hi>Fox</hi> having made himſelf
acquainted with them, became ſo Familiar in their
Houſe, that it was always open to him, when he
pleaſed to come there, and all things in it at his
Service. But the Husband continued ſtill ſteadfaſt
to the Reformed Church, being a true Lover, and
ſincere Practiſer of the Reformed Religion all his
Life long; ſo that he was not fond of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Church-Conventicles,
nor would he joyn himſelf to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;
yet he was not ſo averſe from it, but that
he thought it ſhould be ſuffer'd, and enjoy its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
ſo that he reſolved to defend and vindicate
the ſame from all Injury. And afterwards when
<hi>Fox</hi> was accuſed by many Miniſters of the Church
before the Judges at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> for having uſed ſome
horrible Expreſſions in his Diſcourſes to the People,
ſuch as, That God taught Lyes and Fallacies, and
that his Word, the Holy Scriptures, contained many
Lyes; this Judge with ſome others defended him,
aſſerting all theſe Slanders to be injuriouſly affix'd
upon him, and maliciouſly feign'd without any
ground: Thus he relieved him, not only from the
danger of his Life, he had otherwiſe been in, but
alſo from all fear and apprehenſion; and after this
time he always appeared a great Enemy to the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
of <hi>Fox</hi> and his Society, rendring all their
Efforts againſt him ineffectual. But when the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50388:32"/>
Hatred and Envy of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Antagoniſts grew to ſo
great a height, that he could no longer reſtrain
them, and fearing they ſhould become his Enemies
likewiſe, he ſeldom went to the Publick Meetings,
ſhunning to hear their Voices, whoſe different Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
Deſigns, and Contrivances he ſo much abhorr'd.
So much for the Husband: But as to the Wife, ſhe
totally forſook the Reformed Churches, dedicating
her ſelf entirely to be a Member of the Quakers
Society, and ſpending all her time in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
Her Husband loved her exceedingly, and
was much taken with her Piety, ſo that ſhe could
eaſily obtain of him this favour, that her Houſe
might be a Receptacle for <hi>Fox</hi> and his Colleagues,
and alſo a place of Meeting for all the Society to
Aſſemble in together, as oft as they would, for the
Publick Performance of Sacred Duties; as indeed it
was, and continued ſo after his death, till the death
of <hi>Fox</hi> her ſecond Husband. Not long after her
Converſion to this new Religion, ſhe began to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
her Diſtaff and Womanly Inſtruments, beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her ſelf to Preach and Teach, Inſtructing the
People not only <hi>Viva Voce,</hi> but by ſeveral Books
wrote and publiſhed by her; by which means ſhe
gained many Proſelytes. And after this time her
Houſe and Family became, as it were, a School and
Nurſery for all that Sect, both Hearers, Preachers,
and Students, of both Sexes; and accordingly ſent
out about this time one <hi>William Caton,</hi> a Young
Man of Pregnant Parts, conſpicuous for his Modeſty
and Learning, whom Judge <hi>Fell</hi> had taken into his
Family, for a Companion to his Eldeſt Son, that
by his good Example he might Encourage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
him to a Vertuous Behaviour. This worthy
Young Man became afterwards very Famous and
Renown'd for his great Accompliſhments, both at
home and abroad (in <hi>Holland.</hi>) But this was not
all. <hi>Leonard Fell,</hi> a Son of the Family, followed
his Example, as one Comrade imitates another, or
a Diſciple traces the foot-ſteps of his Maſter; being
fondly loved and careſſed by his Father, for that he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50388:32"/>
introduced into his Family that Sacred Office of a
Miniſter: His Brother, <hi>Henry Fell,</hi> imitated his
Elder Brother. They both became Great and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Teachers, and tenacious defenders of that
Sect. After the Males of the Family followed <hi>Sarah
Fell</hi> their Siſter, undertaking the ſame Office; whom
theſe People do ſo much extol, that they ſay, ſhe
was not only Beautiful and Lovely to a high degree,
but wonderfully Happy in Ingeny and Memory;
ſo ſtupendiouſly Eloquent in Diſcourſing and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and ſo effectual and fervent in her Addreſſes
and Supplications to God, that ſhe raviſh'd all her
beholders and hearers with Admiration and Wonder.
She apply'd her ſelf to the ſtudy of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Tongue, that ſhe might be more prompt and ready
in defending and proving their Doctrine and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
from the Holy Scriptures; and in this ſtudy
the Progreſs ſhe made was ſo great, that ſhe wrote
Books of her Religion in that Language. This is
that Family which <hi>Fox</hi> came afterwards to be a
Member of, when upon the Death of <hi>Fell,</hi> the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
he married <hi>Margaret</hi> his Widow; of which
I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak afterwards. I now
return to the Order of Times and Places that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds
to the Actions of <hi>Fox</hi> and his Colleagues.</p>
                     <p>While <hi>Fox</hi> is propagating his Doctrine in the
Countries above-mentioned in the Year Fifty Two,
of a ſudden there appeared ſome in <hi>Cambridgeſhire</hi>
(a place conſiderably diſtant from the Countries
where <hi>Fox</hi> was now reſiding) who owned themſelves
Members of this New Church. Among whom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
<hi>James Parnel,</hi> a Youth of Fifteen Years of
Age, well skilled in the Tongues, and of no obſcure
Birth or Condition. Becauſe the Hiſtory of this
Youth's Life and Actions is but ſhort, I ſhall here
inſert the ſame in one perpetual thread of Diſcourſe.
This Young Man having ſo boldly adventur'd in ſo
tender an Age on ſuch an Enterprize, was diſown'd,
diſinherited, rejected, and ſhut out of Doors by his
Parents, Friends, and Relations, all upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
Being thus forſaken and left to himſelf, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50388:33"/>
receiving but ſorry aſſiſtance from his new Friends,
he was obliged to live ſparingly and meanly; yet
nevertheleſs he continued ſteadfaſt and eager in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
the ſame Deſign. And after having frequently
debated with his Condiſciples and others concerning
their Religion and his own, and in this condition of
Life ſpent two Years, he comes into the County of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> and Cloaths himſelf with the Office of a
Preacher, which accordingly he performed in the
Fields. Then in the Year Fifty Five he goes to
<hi>Colcheſter,</hi> and the next day after his arrival Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
there, and entertains many Diſputations and
Dialogues with the Doctor and Reader to that
Church, both publickly in the Church, and in his
own Lodgings, and elſewhere; by which one day's
work he converted many to his Religion. Having
ſtaid here ſome few days, he goes to <hi>Cogſhall,</hi> where
he went to Church, and heard the Miniſter Preach
a Sermon againſt the Quakers; upon which when
Sermon was ended, he anſwered and reſuted him in
Publick Church. Then retiring from Church, he
was caught, and brought to <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> and there
put into a Caſtle or ſtrong Priſon. Afterwards he
was taken to <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> to appear before the Judges,
but they, becauſe they could not finiſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Buſineſs, remitted him back to <hi>Colcheſter,</hi>
where he was block'd up in a Cave, in ſome high
craggy place, where having endured Hunger, want
of Sleep, and Cold, for a long time, becoming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numb'd
in this naſty Dungeon, and at length miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
falling, and bruiſing his whole Body,
he finiſhed his unhappy days, notwithſtanding all
the Complaints and Addreſſes he made himſelf, and
all the Entreaties and Sollicitations made to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
by his Friends for relieving him out of all
theſe Miſeries. It is reported that before his Death,
he ſometimes was heard to ſay, <hi>One hour's ſleep ſhall
put an end to all my Troubles.</hi> When Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
he ſaid, <hi>Now I go away;</hi> then he fell
aſleep; and about an hour thereafter he awaked,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50388:33"/>
and yielded up the Ghoſt. His Body was tumbled
away to the place where Malefactors are executed,
and interred</p>
                     <p>In this ſame Year this Doctrine and Scheme began
to diffuſe it ſelf beyond the Countries where <hi>Fox</hi> was
now making his Terms with the Neighbouring
County of <hi>Cumberland;</hi> in which great numbers
aſſociated themſelves to this Party. Amongſt the
more Remarkable of theſe new Converts, the firſt
was one <hi>Thomas Lawſon,</hi> at that time Publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
to a Church at a Village called <hi>Ramſide</hi> in
<hi>Weſtmorland;</hi> afterwards he continued both the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of this Function among theſe People, and
likewiſe gave himſelf to the ſtudy of Herbs; and
after he came to <hi>London,</hi> became the moſt noted
Herbaliſt in <hi>England.</hi> Next after him followed
<hi>John Wilkinſon,</hi> Paſtor to a Church at <hi>Embleton</hi> in
<hi>Cumberland,</hi> who afterwards proved a Famous
Preacher among the Quakers, both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and
<hi>Ireland.</hi> All his Hearers had deſerted him, and
joyned to the Quakers; upon which being forſaken,
he followed after them, and became of the ſame
Profeſſion with them. And now both in <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Northumberland,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhoprick of Durham,</hi>
a great many of all Ranks and Degrees embraced
this New Religion. So that having thus over-run
all the North of <hi>England,</hi> it began to ſpread it ſelf
towards <hi>Scotland.</hi> But as the multitudes of their
Followers increaſed, the Envy and Malice of their
Adverſaries was ſpurred up the more againſt them.
For they were not only laugh'd at and derided every
where, but many Reproaches and Calumnies were alſo
thrown upon them, and many Wicked and Impious
Principles and Practices imputed to them. In ſome
places Orders were given to the Conſtables and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
to detain <hi>Fox,</hi> or any other Quaker, in firm
Cuſtody, whenever they could meet with them, or
elſe to hinder them acceſs into their Precincts. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<hi>Naylor</hi> and <hi>Howgil</hi> of <hi>Appleby</hi> are taken
and put in Priſon: As alſo <hi>Fox</hi> is apprehended and
impriſoned at <hi>Carliſle</hi> in <hi>Cumberland;</hi> whom they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50388:34"/>
looked upon as an Heretical, Blaſphemous Arch-Impoſtor
and Deceiver; the Head and Ring-leader
of this deceitful Crew. And it was confidently
reported, that the Judges were conſulting among
themſelves, whether they ſhould put this Man to
Death for his inceſſant Frauds and Enormities. But
it happened quite otherwiſe, for <hi>Fox</hi> was abſolved
and diſmiſſed, without any other Affront or note
of Ignominy, ſave that they ſeverely check'd and
reprov'd him. <hi>William Caton</hi> and <hi>John Stubs</hi> were
whipp'd at <hi>Maidſton</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> their Meetings were oppoſed with
great violence. At length becauſe the Doctrine and
Sect of the Quakers was not yet known in the other
Parts of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>London,</hi> the chief
Seat and Compend of the whole Kingdom, where
they knew nothing of this New Religion, ſave what
they heard by the wandring Reports that were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured
about: Thoſe who were the principal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators
and Managers of that Church, thought
fit to ſelect ſome of their Number that excelled for
dexterity of Speaking and Teaching, who ſhould
go into theſe other Parts of the Kingdom, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Office of Converting and Convincing the
People. Theſe were the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles
of the New Church, who were ſent out in the Year
Fifty Four. Accordingly they directed their courſe
firſt into <hi>Wales;</hi> firſt, <hi>North-Wales,</hi> then <hi>South-Wales,</hi>
and the adjacent Countries; and at length to
<hi>London,</hi> the Capital City (though far diſtant from
the places of their firſt Pilgrimage) from whence,
as from the Head, they might diffuſe their Doctrines
through all the Members, and infect the whole
Body of the Kingdom with their Religious Tincture.
<hi>Howgil</hi> and <hi>Burrough</hi> were at that time Men of great
Authority and Eſteem among them. Theſe were
the two chief Miniſters appointed to Preach their
Doctrines in <hi>Wales,</hi> and at <hi>London;</hi> though <hi>Burrough</hi>
went afterwards to <hi>London</hi> alone, being invited ſo
to do by a ſtrong itch and deſire he had to be there.
When they came together to <hi>Wales,</hi> and had begun
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50388:34"/>
to ſow the Seeds of their Doctrine, they found ſome
who received them readily. Among thoſe who
embraced their Religion, in that Country, and even
among the firſt, were ſeveral Juſtices of Peace, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
one <hi>Peter Price,</hi> a Famous Preacher among
them from that time to this very day. Moreover
there happened a very wonderful Converſion of one
<hi>John Vp-John,</hi> a Member of an Independant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
who was ſent by his Paſtor, <hi>Morgan
Lloyd,</hi> into the North, to inform himſelf, both by
ſeeing and hearing, what ſort of a Man <hi>Fox</hi> was,
(who was then in thoſe Countries) what for People
the Quakers might be, and what were the Doctrines
they Taught, and to bring him certain word of the
ſame; for he had heard many things of them which
he doubted to be falſe. He performs the Journey,
and returns poſſeſſed with their Principles; and
ſhortly thereafter undertakes the Office of a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
among them, oppoſing himſelf vehemently to
his Ancient Paſtor and Doctor, and to all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
reproving and accuſing them and their
Religion, exhorting all to follow him; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
many to ſeparate from them. Some few Years
after, he travelled through all <hi>Wales,</hi> Preaching and
teaching every where he came to, in Towns, in the
Fields, in the Publick Roads and Streets, Market-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Inns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> exhorting Men to Repent; ſometimes
he had <hi>Fox</hi> for a Companion and Witneſs of his
Actions. And though he was ſometimes caſt into
Priſon, yet when releaſed again, he ſet about his
old Trade as vigorouſly as ever. <hi>Howgil</hi> ſtays in that
Country for ſome conſiderable time; but in the
mean time that he is Preaching there, and the other
Evangeliſts buſie at the ſame work at their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Poſts in the ſeveral places of the Kingdom,
<hi>Burrough</hi> goes for <hi>London,</hi> where few of his Sect
had gone before him, that being the place he loved
and longed mightily to ſee. The time of his abode
there, though he went ſometimes to other places
and returned again, yet he moſtly confin'd himſelf
to the City, till at length in the Year Sixty Two,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50388:35"/>
when block'd up in Priſon, and having patiently
and conſtantly grappled with many Tormenting
Evils that ſurrounded him, and with a Grievous
and Mortal Diſeaſe, he yielded up the Ghoſt. While
he was in <hi>London</hi> he bended all his Thoughts and
Cares how to be moſt Serviceable to that Intereſt,
and ſo to diſcharge his Office, that he might not
diſappoint the Hopes and Expectations which his
Aſſociates had conceived of his Succeſs. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he could not always meet with fit and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
Places and Occaſions of Preaching, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
promiſcuouſly improved every occaſion (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeaſonable or not) to that effect, thinking no
time or place unſeaſonable or improper for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Salvation of Mankind, of which I ſubjoyn
one Example. All that are acquainted with the
City of <hi>London,</hi> cannot but know that vulgar and
frequent Cuſtom among the meaner Tradeſmen,
Shooe-makers, Taylors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their Apprentices and
Journeymen, of getting together into ſome by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
where they ſtruggle and wreſtle with one
another, till either by pulling them down, or trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
them up, they throw them. <hi>Burrough</hi> acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
paſſes by the place, where a whole Band
of them were at this Exerciſe. He draws near,
looks on, and waits to ſee what the iſſue of the
Spectacle would be. At length a luſty Young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and dextrous Wreſtler, appears in the Field,
who throws them all round; firſt one, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and at length a third; yet even then he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied,
challenges any fourth to encounter him.
The whole Company ſtands amazed at the boldneſs
and dexterity of the Fellow, none of them daring
to enter the Field, ſave <hi>Burrough;</hi> who ſteps into
the Ring, and moves towards the Triumphant Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
who was inſulting over all the reſt. He think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Burrough</hi> meant alſo to try his Skill in Wreſtling,
makes ready to receive him. But <hi>Burrough</hi> looking
auſterely and gravely upon him, in ſome few ſevere
words checks his Fury and Fortitude, ſo that both
his Courage and Strength were overcome and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50388:35"/>
Then turning himſelf to the Circle of
the By-ſtanders, addreſſes himſelf to them thus:
<hi>It is a barbarous and cruel Spectacle to ſee Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
ſo much in this Exerciſe, fitter for and more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Brutes than Men; which the wildeſt of the
irrational Creatures abſtain from, unleſs provoked and
irritated to the ſame. We have another Conflict to
mind, which is more conſonant to our Natures, and
allowed of God; nay, which both the Law of Nature,
and the Common Law implanted within us by God,
and his Divine Word revealed from above, do Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
Command, and Encourage. I mean that fight
wherein we are all engaged, as being the Soldiers of
Jeſus Chriſt, and fellow-ſoldiers one with another;
ſtriving with all the endeavours of our Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to encourage and invite one another to purſue this
fight of Faith and Piety, that at length we may become
Victors, and obtain Eternal Life.</hi> Which being
ſpoke, though moſt of the Multitude gave little
heed to what he ſaid, yet ſome of them being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with a ſudden heat of Reverence and Fear of
God, and afterwards bethinking themſelves more
diligently of theſe words, began to underſtand their
Duty aright, and abſtain from ſuch vain Exerciſes
and Spectacles, altering the whole Scene of their
Lives, and afterwards conforming to the Doctrine
and Religion of the Quakers, incorporating, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into their Society. Thus was it that <hi>Burrough</hi>
by his indefatigable diligence pick'd up ſo many
Followers and Adherents both in City and Country.
The number of the Proſelytes at <hi>London</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
much increaſed when <hi>Fox</hi> came to that City:
For he was the Man among them all who purſued
his buſineſs with the greateſt Application and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
maugre all the Difficulties and Dangers
ſtood in his way. I may freely ſay, that there is
not one Church in any County <hi>Fox</hi> came into (from
the beginning of his Miniſtry to this very time)
nor any place of Religious Worſhip frequented ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by thoſe of our Profeſſion, or others, that he
did not viſit, taking occaſion there to diſprove the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50388:36"/>
received Principles, and advance his own; not one
day on which they uſed to Congregate for Religious
Service, that he did not punctually obſerve, beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himſelf to ſome Congregation or other, and
diſturbing their Services with his Accuſatory Libels.
Nor did he refrain from uſing the ſame Importunacy
with the Military Men, among whom, though the
greateſt part of them differed vaſtly from our
Common Soldiers, ſince they only carried Arms for
the Liberty and Religion of their Country, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
innocent and harmleſs Lives, yet there were
many light vain Fellows, diſſolute and corrupted in
their Converſation, who loved rather to be enjoying
themſelves in Taverns or Alehouſes, than hearing
Religious Diſcourſes. <hi>Fox</hi> uſed to be running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, boldly and freely reproving them to
their faces, not only for what he found faulty in
their Religion, but for the Vices of their private
Lives. So that by his courage and boldneſs he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
all that ſtood in his way; neither did he take
it ill to be called bold and forward, but rather glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in being ſuch. Nay, he came to that length,
that oftner than once or twice in midſt of great
crouds, he would brand ſome Women, that he had
never ſeen in his life before, for being Witches and
Sorcereſſes, which he pretended to do by a diſcretive
Spirit within him. But in all theſe his Accuſations,
I do not find that ever there was any Experiment
made of the Art of theſe Women, or any Tryal
made of it, or any Credit given to him, unleſs by
ſome that were prepoſſeſs'd with the ſame Fancy of
the Women before. Wherefore it is no wonder that
he met with ſuch Indignities and Affronts every
where, inſomuch that ſometimes ſeveral of the
People would joyn together and Aſſault him open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
others would lie in wait to take Advantage of
him. It is much more wonderful that he who was
ſo oft ſought after, apprehended, impriſoned, and
delivered into the hands of his Enemies, ſhould
have eſcaped ſo oft, or ſurvived ſo great and many
Troubles. However he always acknowledged and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50388:36"/>
returned thanks to the Almighty for that Divine
Aſſiſtance which he ſaid he never wanted in time of
his bittereſt and ſevereſt Afflictions; nay, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
ſo oft in his behalf, taking Vengeance after
a wonderful manner of his Injurious Enemies, and
ſuch as contrived or executed ſuch Wickedneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. Among many Examples which might
be adduced, I know none more wonderful and
worthy to be related, than this following, which
he uſed ſo often to make mention of among his
Brethren, and confirm with many words. At <hi>Olican</hi>
in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> a Band of Men had combined together
to kill him, and for that end came ruſhing into
the Convention where <hi>Fox</hi> was; but ſo ſoon as they
caſt their Eyes upon him, they were all ſo aſtoniſh'd,
and filled with Fear and Confuſion, that none durſt
to move or attempt any thing. Not long there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
one of theſe Men happened to kill another
Man, and was ſeized as guilty of Murder: Another
of them, who uſed as he paſſed by the Quakers, to
put out his Tongue and ridicule them, expoſing
both himſelf and the Quakers to the Deriſion and
Laughter of the Multitude, had his Tongue ſwell'd
ſo big, that it hang'd out of his Mouth, and he
could not draw it in; which new ſort of Diſeaſe in
a ſhort time cut the Thread of his miſerable Life.
But I return to ſpeak of <hi>Fox</hi>'s coming to <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There happened a Memorable Accident both at
<hi>Weſton</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and at <hi>London. Fox</hi> was
yet remaining in that Country, and chanced to be
in that place; where he was in a Congregation of
his Brethren going about Sacred Service, when in
the mean time ſome Miniſters to Independant and
Presbyterian Congregations Addreſs <hi>Francis Hacker,</hi>
an Officer in the Army, deſiring of him that he
would ſend of his Soldiers to ſuppreſs that irregular
Meeting; accordingly the Soldiers are ſent, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<hi>Fox</hi> in the middle of the Aſſembly, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him Captive to the Officer; who having exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
him, ſends him away Priſoner for <hi>London,</hi>
to be Judged there, and undergo the condign Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50388:37"/>
of his Offences. After ſome Years <hi>Hacker</hi>
acknowledged that he did this by the Inſtigation
and Influence of theſe Miniſters; which Confeſſion
he made the very day before he was hang'd, having
been found guilty of the Murder of the King. <hi>Fox</hi>
arriving at <hi>London,</hi> is laid up in Priſon; and after
having lain ſome time there, is carried to Court, to
appear before <hi>Cromwel,</hi> then <hi>Protector. Cromwel,</hi>
after having entertained long Diſcourſes with him
backwards and forwards, and given many Evidences
of his Benevolence and Good-will towards him and
his Faction, abſolves him; ordering him to go into
a large ſpacious Cloſet, whither he ſent ſome of
his Domeſticks to entertain him with Diſcourſe,
and to invite him in the Protector's Name to Sup
with him. But he refuſes, and as having now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
all the Liberty he ſought after, went away.
Unworthy he was to have ſuch an Opportunity put
into his hands of Engaging and Obliging ſo great a
Man, and of promoting both his own, and his
Church's Intereſt, and alſo inconſiſtent with himſelf,
who could not obſerve the ſame Meaſures with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
People that he did with thoſe of an Inferior
Rank. When the Protector's Domeſticks told him,
that <hi>Fox</hi> had refuſed to ſtay, he expreſs'd himſelf
after this manner: <hi>It ſeems therefore that this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is a Sect which no fair means, nor courteous deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
can gain, whereas by theſe I have ſubjected all
other Men to my ſelf.</hi> In this courſe of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Life
and Miniſtry, which was properly nothing but a
perpetual Pilgrimage, he began now to publiſh
Books, in which he was more intent upon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
the Religions of other Churches, than in
building up a new one, or explaining and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe Doctrines that he preſs'd all Men to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace:
He wrote alſo many Letters, ſome to his
Colleagues, admoniſhing and ſtirring them up to
their Duty; others to thoſe of a different Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
inviting and exhorting them to receive and
entertain the Doctrines which he taught. And he
carefully diſperſed both the Books and Letters
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50388:37"/>
(which he likewiſe cauſed to be Printed) through
all the Counties of <hi>England.</hi> But as <hi>Fox</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and diligent in his Office, ſo his Adherents and
Diſciples imitated their Maſter, Preaching up and
down with the greateſt ſervour and alacrity,
converting great numbers of Men, who not only
aſſociated themſelves to them, but alſo ſignalized
their Courage and Conſtancy in the patient endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of all manner of Labour, Fatigue, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
it ſelf, that they might not ſeem to recede
from the Example and Pattern of their Ring-leader
<hi>Fox.</hi> They met frequently together in every City
or Town, either in Houſes in the Night-time, or in
the Fields, Deſart Places, and Mountains, where
the top of ſome riſing Ground ſerved for a Pulpit
to the Preacher. Being therefore that they thus
perſiſted in their irregular courſes, the Magiſtrates,
whoſe Duty it was to prevent them, cauſed them
to be Apprehended, caſt into Priſon, and kept there
for ſome time. In the mean time <hi>Cromwel</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
by an Edict diſcharges the Quakers to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
or Congregate together Publickly, having
obſerved that to be the mind of all the Publick
Churches; but withal forbids either the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
or any other Men to do the leaſt Injury or
harm to them, while they committed nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Government and Publick Conſtitution of
the Kingdom; and when any ſollicited him to uſe
greater Severity againſt the Quakers (as <hi>Hugh Peters</hi>
his Chaplain frequently did, that Famous wrangler,
that thought he could not exerciſe his Function of
the Miniſtry aright, unleſs he filled all with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
and Diſorder by his Tumultuous Complaints)
he returned this Anſwer, That, <hi>That Sect the leſs it
was perſecuted, the ſooner it would fall and decay of
its own accord.</hi> But this Order of the Protector
had little or no Effect, for their Adverſaries never
wanted occaſion of Accuſing them of this Crime,
and they themſelves became daily more bold and
reſolute in celebrating theſe forbidden Aſſemblies.
Hence enſued many Miſeries upon the Quakers, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50388:38"/>
oft-times Bonds; which they endured with the
greateſt Conſtancy imaginable, of which I give you
one Inſtance. <hi>Fox</hi> continuing to diſperſe his Books
and Letters, and keeping Conventicles and Meetings
notwithſtanding the Protector's Edict to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
chooſing rather to undergo the greateſt
Miſeries, nay, the loſs of Life it ſelf, than to deſert
his Office, or deſiſt from this his wonted Courſe; is
caſt into Priſon at <hi>Launceſton</hi> in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and bound
with Chains, under which Affliction he continued
for a long time, as I ſhall afterwards ſhew, deſigning
now to treat in order not only of the Actions of <hi>Fox,</hi>
but of all the Society. While he was thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ined,
and uncapable to do any Service to his Church,
one of his Friends and Relations, who preferred the
publick Good of his Sect, and of his Friend in
particular, to his own Safety and Peace, goes to
the Protector while ſitting in Council, and deſires
of him that <hi>Fox</hi> might be exempted for his Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Bondage, and he himſelf put into his ſtead;
engaging himſelf to anſwer for his Crime, as if he
were guilty of it himſelf. Though <hi>Cromwel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the Requeſt, yet he could not ceaſe to wonder,
and looking to the Council, ſays, <hi>Is there any of you
would do ſo kind an Office to his Neighbour,
though it conduced never ſo much to his and the
publick Advantage?</hi> But neither did the Adverſaries
of the Quakers want Occaſion of accuſing and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning
them for being guilty of raiſing Tumults,
and rebelling againſt the Civil Magiſtrate, and
Publick Government, as this one Example can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
There was at that time a great many
fooliſh ſilly Men who were great pretenders to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that uſed to raiſe their Spirits by wonderful
Motions of their Bodies, and antick Geſtures, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it Piety and Sanctity: But on the other hand
there was alſo many turbulent and factious Spirits
ſtriving to innovate and confuſe all things, either
upon a religious or civil Pretence; and if any ſuch
kind of Crimes were committed againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by theſe turbulent Fellows, the Quakers
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50388:38"/>
were accuſed as being the Authors, or at leaſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors
and conſcious of the ſame. But the Quakers
did ſo enervate and nullifie this Calumny, that all
Judges pronounced them innocent. It was true
indeed, nor did they deny it, that many who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
to be of their Society, were ſimple and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
moroſe and impertinent, and not ſo poliſhed
in their Temper and Converſation, as their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Profeſſion required; who made it their
Buſineſs to run up and down the Streets, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
Roads, ſhouting and crying with a hideous
Noiſe and Clamor, exhorting the People to ſuch
Endeavours as they themſelves knew nothing of;
and who oft-times committed many Incivilities
and Impertinencies. But they denied that this
was peculiar to their Sect or Diſcipline; for they
who had Authority among them reproved and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
check'd ſuch as were guilty of the like E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities,
and threatned to expell them from their
Society, unleſs they amended their Ways; of which
more afterwards. About this time many Converts
of various Stations and Profeſſions were added to
this new Church, and were afterwards inveſted
with the Miniſterial Function among them, who
became famous, not only enlarging their own
Credit and Reputation, but that of their Sect,
both in the Iſland of <hi>Britain,</hi> and in the United
Provinces of <hi>Holland;</hi> ſo that it ſhall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
in this place to give ſome account of them,
ſuch as the deſigned Brevity of this Work may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
<hi>William Ames</hi> flouriſhed at this time, a Man
of an acute Ingeny, and indefatigable Induſtry
both in Teaching, Preaching, and Writing; and
ſo much admired by theſe Men in this Country
(<hi>Holland</hi>) that they do not ſtick to proclaim him
a perfect Doctor. He was born in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi>
near <hi>Briſtol,</hi> but was ill educated in his Infancy
and Youth, having applied himſelf to nothing that
could be uſeful to humane Life. So that being of
a lazy Temper and diſſolute in his Life, he betakes
himſelf to the Soldiery, that common Refuge for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50388:39"/>
Sluggards, and Covert to all manner of Wickedneſs,
joyning himſelf unto the King's Army, which in
thoſe days was the moſt debauch'd and wicked Crew
upon Earth. He firſt ſerv'd therefore in the King's
Army till the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. Then he
becomes a Marine Soldier under Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> in
the Admiral's own Ship, in which were many
Dutchmen, by whoſe Converſe he acquir'd Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that Language: In the mean time he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to return to his right Wits, and repent of his
by-paſt Actions and manner of Life. But becauſe he
was not capable of exerciſing any other Trade for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
a Livelihood than that of being a Soldier,
though he now deſpis'd a Military Life, as being
liable to many Inconveniencies; yet he continued
in the ſame Condition of Life ſtill, even after his
Mind was thus alter'd, joyning himſelf to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
Army then in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which he was
made Serjeant to a Company of Foot in one <hi>Ingoldsby</hi>'s
Regiment. He preferred being in this Army than
elſewhere, becauſe he thought there was many good
Pious Men in it, and Military Diſcipline better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.
Moreover, many in that Army, both of
Officers and Centinels were of the Sect called Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
(who do not differ from the Presbyterians
ſave only in this one Point, that they do not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
the Members of their Church, till they give
publick Confeſſion of their Faith, and engage for
their own behaviour) of whom <hi>Ames</hi> entertain'd
very favourable Thoughts; and having joyn'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to their Church, became firſt an Elder, and
then a Miniſter in the ſame. It happened, that
while <hi>Ames</hi> was reſiding at <hi>Waterford,</hi> a Town in
<hi>Munſter, Francis Howgil,</hi> and <hi>Edward Burrough</hi>
came into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to that ſame very Town,
in order to meet and converſe with the Baptiſts,
whom they they thought, of all Men, the moſt
accommodated and diſpoſed for reception of
their Religion, and accordingly came into their
Meetings, and diſcours'd unto them of thoſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
<hi>Ames</hi> gave great Ear to all their Diſcourſes;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50388:39"/>
for his Mind was yet fluctuating and unſettled in
his own Religion, the Cares and Thoughts of his
by-paſt Life afflicting and diſtracting his Mind;
and in a ſhort time apoſtatizes from his own Church
to the Quakers, among whom he became a
Preacher, diſcharging that Function to the great
Satisfaction and Contentment of that Party. He
wrote a Tractate entituled <hi>A true Declaration of
the Witneſs of God in Man;</hi> in which he relates
and explains what Senſe he had of the Divine
Light within him from his Infancy to his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and what Reſiſtance he gave to the ſame.
Contemporary with him was <hi>Stephen Criſp,</hi> an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
and polite Meeter, who if he had added the
Study of thoſe Arts and Sciences call'd <hi>Liberal,</hi> to
the Promptneſs and Agility of his Wit, he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
wonderful Specimens of Learning: He lived
in <hi>Colcheſter</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> a Weaver by Trade; he
ſerv'd in the Parliament's Army ſome Years, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
abandoned his Trade, not ſo much for love
of a Military Poſt, as for the Defence of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Religion; ſo that he did not ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be tainted with the Vices of Soldiers, but
lived honeſtly and devoutly; at length wearied with
Fatigue and Labour, he returns again to his old
Trade, having profeſſed himſelf a <hi>Baptist;</hi> at
which time <hi>James Parnel</hi> came to this Town (he
was the firſt of the Quakers that preached their
Doctrine in this Place) where he taught and
diſputed publickly. <hi>Criſp</hi> and his Father hearing
him and being moved with his Diſcourſes, turn
Quakers; but the Son becomes a Preacher: He
died at <hi>London</hi> in <hi>September</hi> 1694. Contemporary
with them was <hi>Thomas Green,</hi> in his youth a
Coachman, but now a Dealer in Merchandize at
<hi>London,</hi> and <hi>John Higgins</hi> a Cobler at <hi>Dover;</hi> both
Men of brisk Ingenies, and much eſteem'd by their
Aſſociates: Alſo <hi>John Crosby,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi>
and Juſtice of the Peace, famous for all
manner of Learning, an eloquent, neat and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Man, both in his Diſcourſes and Writings: Alſo
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50388:40"/>
                        <hi>Joſiah Coaly</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> a Gentleman, who in his
youth having come with his other Companions to a
Quakers Meeting to ridicule and mock them, was
ſo taken with their Diſcourſes, that he forſook that
Courſe, and was afterwards ſo much affected and
mov'd by the Counſel and Advice he received from
two of their Preachers, that he incorporated into
their Family, undertaking the ſame Office with
them of teaching others, while he was yet but
twenty Years of Age: It is ſaid of him, that in
Prayer and Supplication he did it with ſo much Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy,
with ſuch a Grace and Mode of Speech,
tho' without Affectation, that he infinitely ſurpaſſed
many of his Brethren. He ſpent moſt part of his
Life in Travels, extending his Doctrine to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts of the New-World, reſolutely encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
all Dangers, even that of his Life it ſelf.
Another Contemporary was <hi>Iſaac Pennington</hi> the
younger, a Gentleman alſo of good Birth, whoſe
Father was Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and a Man of eminent
Vertue, civil and humane to all, and much belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the Citizens, had not he by his Conſent
embru'd his hands in the Blood of the King. His
Son had added to the Splendor and Nobility of his
Birth, a diligent Study of all Liberal Arts, and was
much exerciſed in Learning, not that he might
gain or live by it, for he had whereupon to live
with a handſome and magnificent Port; but that
he might adorn and beautifie himſelf, and be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to help and aſſiſt his Brethren. He ſpent not
his Youth as many do, whoſe Fortunes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
are l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rge and magnificent, in Idleneſs
and Debauchery, or in pampering his Belly, and
living intemperately; but in purſuing eagerly and
diligently his Studies, exerciſing his Ingeny with
ſuch Exerciſes as might be profitable both to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and others. He had wrote and publiſhed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Books, full of Learning and Eloquence before
the Name of a Quaker was ſo much as heard of.
After he became a Quaker he wrote ſeveral Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Tractates in a grave, plain Scriptural Style.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50388:40"/>
The laſt, I ſhall mention, that liv'd about this
time, was <hi>Charles Marſhal</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> a noted Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
then at <hi>London.</hi> Theſe were the Men that
have over-run all <hi>Britain</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> not
as Emiſſaries, but as Ringleaders and Heads of the
Party. I forbear to mention the <hi>Carews,</hi> the
<hi>Bailzies,</hi> the <hi>Smiths,</hi> and many others. I have
ſelected theſe, not as the Periods and Order of
Time conjoyn'd them, but as they were noted
and famous both among the Quakers and others.
But I cannot paſs by <hi>Samuel Fiſher,</hi> whom they all
extoll for the Credit and Pillar of their Church,
and never ſpeak of but with the greateſt Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks:
a Man ſingularly learned, and wonderfully
eloquent, becauſe of his accurate Knowledge of
the Greek and Latin Antiquities, which ſtuck ſo
to him, even after he changed his Religion and
Life, that the Writings which he publiſhed ſince
that time, reliſh much of the ſame; though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it fell out ſo contrary to his Will and Deſign;
at leaſtwiſe it is repugnant to the Natures, Cuſtoms
and Practices of theſe Men. His Parents had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
him for a Miniſter to the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and kept him (while a Boy) at Schools and Colleges,
in which his Diligence and Progreſs was ſo great
that he ſurmounted moſt of his Fellows. His
Mind led him moſtly to the Study of Eloquence,
Rhetorick and Poetry, which were the Sciences he
put the greateſt Value upon; ſo that, as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Orators uſed to ſay, he kept Commerce with
all the Muſes, that is, he read and peruſed all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
and Poets. Having ended this Academick
Courſe, he was made a Presbyter of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and became Paſtor to a Church in the
Houſe of ſome Nobleman, who was likewiſe a
Man of Eminent Piety and Vertue: He demean'd
himſelf in this Function ſo well, that the Report
of his Fame invited thoſe who knew how to Judge
of his Ability and Skill for greater things to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
him higher, to ſome more dignified Place;
accordingly he obtains a Living in <hi>Kent,</hi> of five
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50388:41"/>
hundred Pounds a year. While he lives there, one
of his own Acquaintance and Friends, called <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
ſolicits and diſturbs him frequently about his
Religion and Profeſſion and many Rites and
Ceremonies uſed in the Church: This made <hi>Fiſher</hi>
begin to doubt and fluctuate within himſelf, what
he ſhould make of his Hearers. There came to
him, much about the ſame time, a Baptiſt, (a Man
of no Learning, at leaſt what is properly accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Learning, but of a ſternly Countenance, and
ſupercilious Looks, of a ready but flattering and
deceitful Tongue, which knew how to brand all
the World beſides with an infinity of Vices, but to
conceal or diſguiſe thoſe of his own Society; extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and commending all their Actions, gilding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Errours and Deluſions with counterfeit
Gloſſes) who ſeeing him waver and fluctuate in his
Mind, accoſts him with many fair and ſpecious
Words, and thoſe frequently turning over the ſame
<hi>Crambe,</hi> till at length he could endure his Diſcourſes
no longer; as we ſee it frequently fall out, that when
Men cannot enervate the Objections of their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
or diſcover their Fallacy, they yield to them, and
forſake the Truth; and accordingly he caſt off his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
diveſts himſelf of his Office, and returns to the
Biſhop <hi>Diploma,</hi> which he had got for to confirm
his undertaken Office, and joyns to the Church
of the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> becoming a <hi>Diphabus,</hi> or true bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd;
believing That the only true Means to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
into the City of God, and numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his peculiar People. Being thus deſtitute of
ſo good a Living, he contented himſelf with a
little he had of his own, and Farm'd a little piece
of Ground in the Neighbourhood, by which he
had enough to live upon, exerciſing this innocent
and pleaſant Trade of Life, till at length he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Baptiſt Miniſter. About which time <hi>Caton</hi>
and <hi>Stubs</hi> came to that Country, and went to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
<hi>Fiſher,</hi> who receiv'd them in his Houſe very
kindly, treating them as his Friends and Intimates,
though he had ſcarce known them before. But they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50388:41"/>
did not preſs him much to comply with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
for this firſt time, leſt by their prepoſterous
Haſte, they had ſeem'd to encroach upon his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
yet when they returned again a ſecond time,
they inculcated and repeated more vehemently, and
frequently what they had ſpoke to him before: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this he began to waver and conſulted his Collegue
<hi>Hammond</hi> upon the Matter, who was much wrath
with him, expoſtulating the Matter very ſharply
before the whole Congregation: At length <hi>Fiſher</hi>
forſakes both the Baptiſts Society and the Office
he was cloath'd withal, becoming, in a ſhort time,
not only a Profeſſor but a Preacher and a zealous
Propagator of <hi>Quakeriſm.</hi> He wrote many Books
in Defence of that Religion, among which is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one entituled, <hi>The Country-man to the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity-Scholar;</hi>
in which he refutes the Arguments of
his Adverſaries with many pretty and cunning Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.
So much for this Man. But becauſe I
have already ſpoke of the Writings of this Man, it is
to be remark'd, that all theſe Men I have hitherto
mention'd from the beginning of this Treatiſe, did
write many Books, nay, great Volumes, if they
were all gathered together, which were publiſhed
after their Deaths: For it is a Cuſtom among the
Quakers, that when any famous Writer dies, they
pick up all his Writings and print them together,
prefixing for a Preface the Teſtimony of ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Men of their Society, of the Integrity and
Worth of the dead Authors; that ſo thoſe who are
bereav'd of their Natural Life may ſtill live in the
Memories of their Followers.</p>
                     <p>Theſe new Miniſters, and many others not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
divided themſelves into ſeveral Provinces,
ſome of them going up and down <hi>England,</hi> others
travelling into Foreign Countries, all diligently
ſolliciting and inviting Men to be Converted;
while, in the mean time, <hi>Fox</hi> the Head and Prince
of that Society, was inceſſantly proceeding in the
Exerciſe of his Miniſtry in <hi>England,</hi> not daunted
or diſcouraged by all the Evils he grapled with.
He had a Cuſtom, when he deſigned a Viſit for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50388:42"/>
City, Town, or Village, to premoniſh and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe
them, by Letters and Emiſſaries, of the Time
of his coming, and Place of abode, that all who had
a mind to hear him might have timous Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to reſort thither. In the Years fifty ſix, and
fifty ſeven, he traverſed <hi>Somerſetſhire, Wiltſhire,
Dorſetſhire, Devonſhire</hi> and the neighbouring
Counties. At <hi>Briſtol</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> there was at
one time a Meeting of above a Thouſand of the
Inhabitants and Neighbours of that Place, in ſome
Woody Place near-by. A little thereafter, above
Two Thouſand aſſembled in one Place in <hi>Wiltſhire.</hi>
So much Footing had this Sect taken in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
and ſo many Followers and Adherents had
<hi>Fox</hi> in all the Countries he had been in, among
whom were many not ordinary or mean Perſons,
but noted and conſpicuous Men; ſome of them
Men of Authority and Truſt in the Nation, who
ſhook off that Dignity and the Honour that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it, and part of whom became Miniſters to
the Sect. And the more Reſiſtance or Oppoſition
was offered to them in their Meeting and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the more reſolute they were in purſuing their
wonted Courſe. So ſome were ordered to watch
and obſerve them, keeping Watches and Guards in
the Streets and Roads near to the Houſes and
Places where they uſed to aſſemble; and as many
as were catch'd were impriſon'd, inſomuch that
the Number of the Priſoners and Captive Quakers
was ſeldom under a Thouſand. By this time <hi>Fox</hi>
had purpos'd to go for <hi>London,</hi> and communicate
the Light of his Doctrine to the great Crowds and
Confluence of People in that great and populous
City, thinking that the moſt probable way of
promoting his Deſign. And in his Journey thither,
ſtay'd ſome time upon the Road, loſing no Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of propagating his Religion; taking Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in the Inns and Taverns, to apply himſelf
to the other Lodgers, admoniſhing them to take
good heed what Religion they profeſs, alſo to ſend
hither and thither to invite all that feared God to
come into the Inn and hear him ſpeak or diſpute
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50388:42"/>
about religious Matters. In which Courſe he gave
the People Occaſion of putting Tricks upon him,
and was ſeveral times ſo ſerv'd, as the following
Examples can Teſtifie; which I ſhould have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for Fabulous, and thought unworthy to be
here inſerted, were they not confirm'd, not only
by the Relations of People that were preſent, but
by his own Mouth to his Followers, and handed
down to Poſterity by his own Writings, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
and true. At <hi>Farnham,</hi> after having
preach'd ſomewhere in that Town, he retires to an
Inn, deſiring the Maſter of the Inn if he knew
of any pious, good People, to give them Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
to come to him in the Inn: According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
many came, ſome Men of Honeſty and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
others more ſubtile and cunning than good
or religious. They all heard him preach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
himſelf with a great multitude of Words.
After he had ended, moſt of them go away; and
ſome few ſtay, deſiring the Maſter of the Inn to
cauſe a Fire to be made in the very ſame Room,
(where he had preach'd) for it was now cold Weather,
and to bring them ſomething to drink. In fine
they ſate there drinking all the reſt of the day,
notwithſtanding all the Entreaties and Solicitations
<hi>Fox</hi> us'd to perſwade them to be gone, and demean
themſelves as good and ſober Men; and at length
went away without paying their Reckoning which
they left upon <hi>Fox</hi> who had invited them thither.
The Tapſter came and call'd for the Reckoning
from <hi>Fox,</hi> who declin'd ſuch an unjuſt thing, uſing
many Reaſons to the contrary. The Man, who
minded his Money moſt, preſſed him the more
to pay it. At length, <hi>Fox</hi> ſeeing that he could
not perſwade him to deſiſt, paid the whole Sum,
writing a Letter to the Magiſtrates, full of Wrath
and Indignation, warning them to take notice what
manner of Citizens they had, and to take ſome
Meaſures for reclaiming them from the like Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
The next day he lights at an Inn in <hi>Lemnan,</hi>
which he found full of Stage-players, Muſicians, and
Quack-doctors: After he and his Companions had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50388:43"/>
put up their Horſes, and refreſh'd themſelves, they
agreed upon ſome Problems among themſelves of
the Natures of Diſeaſes, and the uſe of Medicine,
and towards the Evening preſented the ſame to that
Company, in order to be conſider'd upon and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
while they lodged in the Houſe. They reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
their Propoſal, flouting at them for Mad-men;
but <hi>Fox</hi> and his Companions took this ill, and
cauſed the Theſes to be ſtuck upon the Mercat-Croſs,
to be ſubjected to publick View after they
were gone. At <hi>London Fox</hi> was not ſo forward as
elſewhere, for he did not diſturb the Publick Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
nor raiſe any Tumult or Crowd in any place,
but behaved himſelf more cautiouſly than he uſed or
deſired to do. Before his coming thither, many of
great Note had been converted by the Miniſtry and
Influence of <hi>Burrough:</hi> And theſe frequently aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
together with <hi>Fox,</hi> who had many Diſcourſes
among them, and to the People; but after all his
utmoſt Efforts he gain'd but very few new Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
which was much contrary to his Expectation,
having fill'd himſelf with great hopes of the Succeſs of
this Journey. However he contents himſelf to ſtay a
while longer in this City, where he could ſee and hear
ſo many things, and be inform'd of every thing done
in the whole Kingdom; as alſo ſee and obſerve what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
Men entertain'd concerning the Progreſs and
State of his Religion all over the World. At length ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
view'd enough of that City, and ſatisfied
himſelf, he makes for the Country. There was
about this time a great Multitude of People in
<hi>Wales,</hi> who being of an unſettled and fluctuating
Temper, and fond of every thing New or Singular,
abandon'd their former Religion, and profeſſed
Quakeriſm; which Converſion was chiefly wrought
by <hi>Howgil, Vp-John, Wilkinſon,</hi> and others. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did <hi>Fox</hi> direct his Courſe, though quite igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Welſh Language. At firſt when he
came and happened to preach ſeparately from his
brethren, his Labour was all or moſt part in vain
ſince ſo many of his Auditors either underſtood not
his Dialect, or were quite ignorant of his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50388:43"/>
(for his Mother-Tongue was the only
Language he knew.) But afterwards, when
he took into his Society ſome of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of that Country, all the Progreſs he could
make, was, that he preached ſometimes among
thoſe of his own Perſwaſion; and thoſe of his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates
that underſtood <hi>Engliſh</hi> explained it in
<hi>Welſh</hi> to the reſt. So that theſe his Interpreters were
more Inſtrumental in propagating this Intereſt than
he; among whom the chiefeſt was <hi>Vp-John,</hi> who
had for a long time reſided in this Country, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf diligently to the Converſion of thoſe
People, of whom he perſwaded not a few to be
Quakers. Theſe Interpreters were <hi>Fox</hi>'s Predeceſſors
in this Country, who being back'd by him, run up
and down in the Country, the Cities, the Streets,
the High-Roads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inviting and exhorting all
Men to repent, and theſe their clamorous Harangues
had ſo much effect upon theſe People, that no
Country in <hi>England</hi> was ſo fertile of New Converts
to Quakeriſm as <hi>Wales.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus did the Sect, Doctrine, and Religion
of the Quakers in ſo ſhort a time ſpread over all
<hi>England,</hi> to the year one thouſand ſix hundred
and fifty eight, in which Year theſe Men proceeded
to that height of boldneſs that they appointed a
<hi>General Aſſembly</hi> out of the whole Realm to be held
in the Houſe of <hi>John Croſs,</hi> being a Place that was
large and capacious for that purpoſe, in the County
of <hi>Bedford;</hi> thereby, as it were, ſhewing and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding
their Enemies to what increaſe both of
Number and Strength they were now arrived, and
ſeeing that they had not before deſpaired of the
Progreſs, and Improvement of their Affairs, that
they were alſo now full of hopes to bring them to
perfection, and altogether aſſured thereof. There
did the Meſſengers of each particular Congregation
meet, being accompanied with a great number of
others, who came not to ſpeak, but to ſee only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Here were ſuch Matters tranſacted as referred to
their ſpiritual Laws, and tended to the upholding
of their Communities; and the Council was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50388:44"/>
for three whole Days: I have ſaid a little
before, how <hi>Howgil</hi> and <hi>Burroughs</hi> were the firſt
that brought the Opinions of the Quakers into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and particularly to <hi>Waterford:</hi> This was done in the
Year fifty five. In the very ſame Year were theſe
Men followed towards the carrying on the ſame
Work by one Man, whoſe Name was <hi>Lancelot War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi>
and three Women, <hi>Rebecca Ward, Elizabeth
Fletcher,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Marſhal:</hi> But thoſe for a
long time made ſo little Progreſs in their Affairs, that
the Religion of the Quakers was univerſally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
there, that the very Name it ſelf came not,
or at leaſtwiſe nothing but the Name within the
Verge of their Knowledge. The foreſaid <hi>Burroughs</hi>
was now the firſt Man that introduced theſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> who a little while after was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by <hi>Alexander Parker,</hi> who before he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him this new Function, exerciſed the Trade of a
Butcher; which came to paſs in the Year fifty four;
but by the Means of theſe Guides and Teachers
there appeared a greater Concourſe of People in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that eſpouſed the Quakers Cauſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
frequenter Meetings of them, whom when
the Nobility and Magiſtrates, who from the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
and uſage of the Nation, do not eaſily admit
of a ſtrange Religion, oppoſed them, they did the
more firmly and intenſly hold to it; until at length
a Perſecution enſued, and that Perſons were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
into their Houſes, to diſturb their Meetings,
and hale the Men to Priſons, and ſome they detained
and handled ſeverely for a long time; but for Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity's
ſake I ſhall add no more hereof: But of <hi>Fox</hi>
I have this further to ſay; in the year fifty ſeven he
lived in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> upon the Borders of <hi>Scotland</hi>
and ſo went thither, who, though he were ignorant of
the Tongue, yet knowing and confiding in his
Companions, which he took along with him, and
whom he was about to meet with there, he made
uſe of them for his Interpreters; this man with
his Friends have frequent Conferences in Houſes
about the Unity of Religion, often preaches amongſt
them, and goes about all Places, ſeeking to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50388:44"/>
find out, or to make known, if he could, more of
his Mind. The which he endeavoured to effect
with much Labour and Toyl, yet he failed of
his purpoſe; for when he ſometimes ſent out his
Meſſengers to invite Men to hear him Preach, and
appointed both Time and Place for that purpoſe,
it ſo happened now and then that there was
not one Man came near him: Beſides this, he
made it his buſineſs here and there in the Streets
where he found a concourſe of People, to allure
Men to him, but with the like ſucceſs. <hi>Fox</hi> alſo
with a few Followers directed his Courſe to the
Highlanders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who are Men of rude and
unpoliſhed Natures, which when they came to hear,
they came down from the Hills to meet them, and
drove them back with their Weapons: Upon this,
<hi>Fox</hi> goes to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Capital City of the
Kingdom, which when the Council came to know,
who were not ignorant of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Methods, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
he would not be wanting there alſo to play
his uſual and giddy Pranks, they cite him to appear
before them, and gently require him, if he had no
Buſineſs in thoſe Parts, thence to depart. <hi>Fox</hi>
withdraws, but very ſlowly, viſiting in the mean
time other Towns and Places, and trying to bring
over Men to his Party, but, as I ſaid, to no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
<hi>Fox</hi> and his Companions during the time of
his ſojourning in <hi>Scotland,</hi> endeavoured both by
Libels, which <hi>Fox</hi> together with his Followers and
Aſſociates wrote, and by their Railleries to render
the Doctrine and Articles of Faith of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
Church as odious and hateful to Men as poſſibly
they could. Wherein they ſo demeaned themſelves,
that the <hi>Scots</hi> thought nothing enough to be ſaid
concerning the Impudence, Revilings, and Cheats
of thoſe Men; for they charged the Miniſters of
that Church, and perſwaded their Followers, that
that Church taught ſuch Articles of Faith, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
concerning Divine Election and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Providence of God, concerning the
ſins of Men, according to their ungrounded Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and fardled Conſequences, as that Church not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50388:45"/>
only never taught, but ſuch alſo as ſhe abhorred.
Moreover as the <hi>Scots,</hi> as well as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
alſo divers of the Reformed Churches, called the
Lord's Day, whereon Chriſtians abſtaining from
their daily Labours, give up themſelves to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, as 'tis vulgarly phraſed, the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
or day of Reſt, according to the Appellation of
the Ancient Sabbath of the Jews; and ſeeing it did
manifeſtly appear, that all the <hi>Scotch</hi> Churches did
ſtrictly obſerve that day, and during the whole
time abſtained from their Labours, and demeaned
themſelves as reverently and decently as they could,
<hi>Fox</hi> and his Companions wrote and preach'd every
where, that the <hi>Scots</hi> did wickedly Profane the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day,
by keeping of Fairs, and doing of many
other momentous things appertaining to their
daily Labour and Buſineſs; the which when they
were enforced to explain themſelves, they did it
in this manner: That the <hi>Scots</hi> did thoſe Works
on the laſt day of the Week, but that that day was
truly the Sabbath-day, according to God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
delivered to the Jews. Moreover, <hi>Fox</hi> had
this up in the whole courſe of his Miniſtry and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrination
even to this time, in what place, at
what time and part ſoever of the day he ſate any
where, and diſcourſed with Men of his own Sect,
though there were but two or three preſent, and
that they only ſaluted one another, this he
called, to have had, to have found an Aſſembly, as
it were of Men, for the Profeſſing of their Religion;
and that the number of their People had ſo much
increaſed. But if there were any of his Auditors
who did not cry out againſt them, but were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
to what was delivered, and took any thing
under conſideration, them he called convinced Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and Aſſociates; and when it happened that at
any time he met with ſome who preſt him with
ſome ingenious and ſharp Anſwer or Queſtion, or
Argument; when he was not able to make Anſwer
again, or reſolve the Queſtion, or enervate their
Arguments, he went his ways, or thus put off the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50388:45"/>
matter; That it was a weighty and dangerous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,
that there were ſome Perſons who made
it their buſineſs to wrangle, that it was a thing he
did not care for, and that he was very unwilling to
Diſcourſe with ſuch Men: And whereas there were
not a few of the number of thoſe that joyned with
<hi>Fox</hi> and the Quakers, who were part of that vaſt
multitude that diſſented from the Publick Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and ſuch alſo as exerciſed the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Preachers, and that ſome of theſe Men were
of ſcandalous Lives, Tiplers, and Alehouſe-keepers,
<hi>Fox</hi> when he acquainted his Party with his Progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
among Men, all theſe without any diſtinction
did he call by one and the ſame name of Profeſſors,
Presbyters, Teachers, and by ſuch other names, as
were commonly uſed to be given to the Members
and Miniſters of the Publick Church, thereby drawing
no ſmall Envy and Scandal upon that Church. And
all this <hi>Fox</hi> hath carefully ſet down in his Journal-Books,
and wrote to his Friends, who believed, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and publiſhed it all. Moreover, <hi>Fox</hi> as often as he
made mention of any buſineſs that was tranſacted
conjoyntly by himſelf and Friends, if any thing
was well managed therein, there was no Name ſo
much celebrated as his own, and he was more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
a great Publiſher of his own Affairs; but theſe
things I ſhall not purſue at large, nor the Hiſtory
of <hi>Fox,</hi> as ſtudying brevity; the Order both of the
Thing and the Time requires that I ſhould ſhew
more particularly, what has been the Cauſe, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
and Original, wherefore ſo many Men ſhould
ſo ſuddenly, which is a very hard thing, fall away
every one from his own Church and Religion to
that of theſe Quakers. The Principal Reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſeems to be, in that Men, among whom there
were really many who were deſirous to live Piouſly
and Religiouſly, and to lead a truly Chriſtian Life,
did imagine, that they ſaw ſo much Corruption every
where, if not in Doctrine, yet in Rites, and moſt
aſſuredly in the Manners of all Societies, that
would be accounted and called Chriſtians, and even
Proteſtants, that if any one perſiſted in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50388:46"/>
with any of them, he might very well diffide
and deſpair of his Salvation; and that indeed there
was at this time either no Church, or that this
Church which theſe new Teachers pretended was
that wherein a Man might and ought to render his
ſelf ſecure, and come into a ſaveable ſtate. And
though many who joyned themſelves to this new
Sect, did not give ſuch exact Accounts of their
Thoughts and Affections, yet they who were found
to be more wiſe and intelligent than the reſt, judged
they were able to give ſuch Reaſons as were moſt
valid for this their departure and new Confederacy.
And ſeeing that thoſe who had never been without
the Bounds of their own Native Country, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
ſo ill an Opinion chiefly of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Churches; thoſe who alſo paſſed into and travelled
Foreign Nations, paſſed the ſame Judgment upon
the reſt of thoſe other Churches; therefore did theſe
chiefly and in the firſt place charge the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Churches with ſuch great depravedneſs and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and of theſe they did more eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
thoſe, that to this time under the Kingly
Government did prevail by Publick Authority,
which from the Biſhops their Authors and Rectors
they called <hi>Epiſcopal;</hi> that is, they did ſo blame
and revile this Hierarchy, or Spiritual Power, Order
and Degree, Rule and Lordly Juriſdiction; yea,
their Harſhneſs and Tyranny towards thoſe who
diſſented from their Religion, or ſeemed to be in
the wrong, who yet out of no Obſtinacy, but only
from a tender Conſcience, could not joyn with
them; the Magnificence and Pomp, groſs Idleneſs,
Remiſsneſs, and Delicacy both of their Prelates,
and all the reſt of their Clergy or Miniſters of the
Word that were under them; moreover ſuch a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of Ceremonies or Rites in their Churches and
Sacred Communions, and Collection of Leſſons,
Singings, and Prayers, the forms whereof to be ſo
ſtrictly followed, with the Obſervation of Holy
Days. Laſtly, beſides this, the Sloth, Incontinency,
and Laſciviouſneſs of the whole People in words
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50388:46"/>
and deeds, that from hence it came, that not only
the Quakers now at length, but many other Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Men, long before the Quakers were born or
known, ſeparated themſelves from the Communion
of that Publick Church. And thus did they heap
up as much ſuſpicion of Corruption upon that
Church as they could, and ſtirred all Men to Envy
and implacably to hate her: Now as theſe Men did
chiefly by this blot and cenſorious Diſcourſe vilifie
the Epiſcopal Churches, and ſo fiercely and violently
inveigh and bellow againſt them, ſo did they next
fall upon accuſing of them, called by the name of
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> in as ſevere and harſh a manner, who
notwithſtanding had not only long ſince withdrawn
themſelves from under the Government, Order,
Rites, and Methods of the Epiſcoparians, but alſo
ſharply oppoſed them, and were now after the
Abolition of Epiſcopacy, and the taking away of
all that Ceremonious Worſhip, and after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading
of the King, and almoſt an entire extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Regal Name, intenſly bent upon the
Reformation of the whole Church: Theſe from
the firſt beginning of their Church they did own to
be no bad Chriſtians, and that ſome of them did
excel, and continued to be ſuch, as all ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to be, both in the Faith and Rule of Life,
but that afterwards they became by degrees more
and more changed, and that for ſome time neither
that Care and Attention to God's Spirit, no, nor to
the Word which they profeſſed to have, was to be
met with amongſt them, but that they were found
to be puffed up with much confidence, hope, and
aſſurance in their own even External Performances,
and that many of them had more the ſhadow
than real Vertues of Chriſtians, and more Vices
under a ſhew of Vertues. Now, though among all
the Parties they entertained the moſt eſteem for
thoſe Independants, which they call <hi>Browniſts,</hi>
yea, and for thoſe whom they call <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> yet
they objected againſt theſe, that they had indeed
great Love and Affection for their Religion, but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50388:47"/>
that they were very much wanting in a Spiritual
and true Love to God, and in Unanimity and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
amongſt themſelves; and that they were
very raſh and moroſe towards ſuch as diſſented
from them, and ſometimes full of Cruelty and
Harſhneſs. For as to thoſe others, who alſo would
be accounted Independants, them they looked upon
as Hypocrites, who had a ſhew of Religion in
their Countenances, and at their Tongues ends,
and who while they ſaw many Vices with great
clearneſs, and reſented them in others with much
clamour and a ſcornful contempt, were themſelves
inwardly full of the moſt ſecret and worſt of Vices.
Moreover, as the Quakers did cenſure ſo hard of the
Churches of <hi>England,</hi> they did moſt grievouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
againſt thoſe, whom theſe Churches looked
upon as their Guides, Teachers, and Paſtors; and
did conclude that the Original Stock and Seed of
all that Calamity did ariſe from them; to wit, that
while they profeſt it to be their buſineſs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
that Office of Teaching and of Guiding-Men
in their Spiritual Concerns, and ſeemed to give up
themſelves entirely thereunto, did ſome of them
deſert their Work, others were ſlothful and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
others did indeed publickly diſcharge their
Office, and many times with a loud Voice, but had
privately no regard to their Work, but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
their own Profit, and ſerved their own Turn,
preferring the ſame before the Common Good of
the whole Church, and that ſo indeed they fed
their Peoples Ears with words; but in like manner
to ſtick to their Manners, and to that which comes
to paſs by their Examples, this they thought by
the ſame Doctrine to be honeſt and not unlawful.
There were more eſpecially two things, which theſe
Men could not bear in thoſe Rulers and Miniſters of
the Publick Churches; one of which was this, In
that they in lieu of their Labours in Preaching of
the Goſpel, and diſcharging of their Office amongſt
their People, did not only receive a Reward, which
they did indeed bear with, but ſuch an one as was
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50388:47"/>
certain and by Compact, almoſt always a great,
ſometimes a greater, now and then the greateſt
Sum, not only from the Publick Annual Profits,
but alſo from the Incomes of Private Perſons, and
that even of ſuch, who had ſcarce of their own
whereon to ſet their Foot; from the Fruits, Cattle,
Services, Annual Profits, Marriages, Chriſtenings,
Funerals, and other things; which ſame if any
alike were not, yet ſome in gathering of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
were ſo ſevere and hard-hearted, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the poorer ſort to beggery; ſuch as were able
and not willing, and whom they could not bring
to Reaſon, they ſubdued by Force, of whom they
ſaid, they were driven thereunto from the only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of Lucre and Gain, and ſo lived upon their
Miniſtry, worſe than Porters, Watermen, and ſuch
ſort of rough Fellows; and that they were always
craving, and that they went as often as they could
to other Aſſemblies of Men, and to them eſpecially
from whom they hoped to receive moſt Advantage.
Another thing againſt which theſe Men were very
Angry, and highly complained, was this; That
there was, and is ſtill, ſuch among thoſe Men, who
ſome of them cannot endure ſome of their own
People and Citizens, differing from them in Matters
of Religion, though very docible, and upon better
Information, ready to obey, but throw them out,
and eject them; others they vexed, tormented, and
fined; and thoſe ſame Perſons did this, who for
ſuch ſeverity had themſelves called upon God and
Men to bear Witneſs, and when they were able
ſhook off that Yoke from their Necks, and eſteemed,
and do ſtill eſteem this Liberty as a great Bleſſing
of God; of which two things the Quakers did ſo
much the more complain, becauſe they were at this
time moſt touched and afflicted therewith. To
this came to be added afterwards the Complaint and
Lamentation of their Fellows and Companions in
<hi>New-England,</hi> That there were <hi>Browniſts</hi> there,
who injured them various ways, and put ſome of
them to Death: Theſe being the ſame things, which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50388:48"/>
theſe Men did more particularly diſcommend, and
ſo much charge upon the Churches of <hi>England,</hi>
their Native Country: But thoſe things which they
generally and univerſally blamed, as well in theſe
ſame, as in other Proteſtants abroad, were theſe:
<hi>That this indeed is the Doctrine, Faith, and Profeſſion
of all thoſe who are called by this ſpecious Name, and
love and take delight to be ſo called; that upon the
differences being taken away by the Coming of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, and the bright appearance of the Goſpel,
that was between the beloved Nation of the</hi> Jews, <hi>and
the reſt of Mankind, whom by way of ſingularity and
diſtinction, they called</hi> Gentiles; <hi>the Grace of God
hath ſhined upon all Men, and that this coming of
Chriſt, and thoſe deſireable and ſaving Tydings ought
now to be preached throughout the whole World, and
that this one thing was propoſed unto all Men, who
are made partakers of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel, that
as much as lies in them, both by Words, and good and
pious Works, they gain over, and preſent unto Jeſus
Chriſt and to God, and bring into a ſalvable ſtate, all
thoſe who are yet Chriſtleſs. And moreover, that all
would have and teach this, that Circumciſion being
taken away from among the People of God by Chriſt
Jeſus, which was of Old obſerved by the Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that the External Worſhip of that Nation
being overthrown, to which this ſame Circumciſion was
annext, that now theſe are circumciſed, who have that
which Circumciſion did then prefigure and typifie, and
that which External Worſhip did repreſent, and that
which all the Law and the Prophets did preſignifie and
promiſe, ſhould be brought to paſs and accompliſhed
by Jeſus Chriſt; and that there muſt needs have been
thoſe then who were true and real Jews, and ſuch as
were in Covenant with God, and that there are even now
true Jews, that do heartily and ſincerely Worſhip God;
and that theſe are truly Chriſtians, choſen by Chriſt,
and made one with thoſe Ancient Jews, that were ſo
united to God, and therefore accepted with him, who
ſerve God in the Spirit, and glory in Chriſt Jeſus, and
put no confidence in the Fleſh; and that this now is pure
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50388:48"/>
Religion, and undefiled before God and the Father,
to bridle the Tongue, ſo as to ſpeak ill of, vilifie, ruine
no Man, but charitably to Teach, Edifie, and Help
ones Neighbour; and beſides this, to viſit the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and Widows, and to help as much as may be the
poor, miſerable, and diſtreſſed, and over and above
to keep ones ſelf undefiled from the World.</hi> But here
did theſe Men interpoſe, and raiſe a clamour and
noiſe, ſaying, That the Proteſtants did nothing leſs
than any one of theſe things; neither did they
ſtick to ſay, that all that Multitude was a dead
Body, or a living Carcaſe, bearing only the name of
Chriſtians; and this they ſaid, they would demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
thus pretending, <hi>That all Proteſtants, their
Rulers, each Member of their Churches, were ſo little
concerned about that Grace of God that was brought
in by Jeſus Chriſt, and is daily offered by him in the
Goſpel, that they had ſcarce one ſerious thought of
their own, and not at all of the Salvation of others;
and that they either declined to do any thing, or did
what they could moſt ſlightly towards the Inſtructing
of their own People, confuting of others, convincing
of Strangers, and enlightning of Foreign and Remote
Countries and Nations, where a groſs Ignorance of
Mind, and a debauched Life cauſed hideous Darkneſs,
and for delivering of them out of the Jaws of Death,
for the deſtroying of the Kingdom of Satan, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of the Kingdom of Chriſt in all the Parts of
the Earth, as if the name of a Chriſtian, which they
avouch, were enough, and that that Happy Life were
granted and tyed to them by a certain, private, and
ſure Law, and that others were to look unto themſelves.
Moreover that all of them did follow in thoſe things,
which belong to the Knowledge and Obſervation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
things, not the Holy Spirit, who is the true and
genuine Maſter and Guide, whom indeed they knew
not, but their own and others Inſtructions, or their
own Vnderſtanding and Senſe, drawn, if it happen
ſo well with them, from the ſingle and bare Reading of
the Scriptures; moreover that they did herein flatter
themſelves, that they bare in their Mouths the Name
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50388:49"/>
of Chriſt, held Communion with him, and partaked
of his Benefits, but were therein miſerably miſtaken,
in that they knew not who this Chriſt is, what it was
to have Communion with him, and what his Benefits
were, or that they by no means ſpake from their hearts
thoſe things they talked of, neither were they actuated
in thoſe things that were done by them, or which befel
them, from an inward Principle, Motion, and Inſtinct;
and moreover that they put their truſt in Ceremonies,
External Rites, Sacraments, and bodily Exerciſe,
Publick and Private, which profiteth nothing, and that
ſo they embraced a Shadow, neglecting the Thing it ſelf.
Laſtly, That all of them, laying aſide the Love they
owed one to another, and paſſing by that Pity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
which they ought to have for the adverſe and
troubleſome Concerns of their Brethren and Friends,
they were ſo divided and diſtracted among themſelves,
as well privately, with wranglings, Strifes, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and that often-times for things of no moment,
and often by reaſon of the difference of ones Opinions,
as Publickly with Wars and Devaſtations, and that
many times for Trifles, and now and then becauſe of
the Diverſity of Religions, and that they gaped after,
and ſtrove to accommodate themſelves for the attaining
all Honours, Riches, Pleaſures, and ſuch ſorts of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and were at the leaſt ſo conform to the Faſhion
of the Men of this World, that they could not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be the true Diſciples, and ſincere Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And theſe things, they ſaid,
were ſo clear and manifeſt, that if any one was
converſant among ſuch ſort of Men, he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
find work to interrogate his Eyes and Ears
thereupon. Moreover they did blame, and lay this
to their Charge: <hi>That there was ſcarce any foot-ſteps
left among theſe Proteſtants of that Ancient Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Diſcipline, as well in reſpect to the Rulers and
Miniſters of the Church, as to the whole Church her
ſelf, and ſo from the Practice thereof they have all
ſwerved to depraved diſuſe of ſuch Diſcipline; ſo that
now any Teacher that Publickly in his Pulpit does that
work not altogether negligently and undecently, is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50388:49"/>
reputed a good Paſtor; as to the reſt, as long as any one
owns his Religion with his Mouth, and ſerves the
Shadows and Images of Godlineſs, though he be given
to worldly and vain Luſts and Deſires, this ſame is
accounted to be a good Member of the Church, and is
eaſily admitted to participate of all the Myſteries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
From hence they went on to <hi>Doctrinals;</hi> and
when they had particularly reproved many things
in ſingle Perſons, this came generally to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in all, as if it were a common and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Opinion: <hi>That Chriſt did all things for Man,
and that this only is to be done by Man, That when any
one ſins moſt in the courſe of his Life, he muſt lay hold
on Chriſt as a Mediator and Saviour, and lay claim
to him without Works, and do his endeavour to follow
the Command and Example of Chriſt in his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
according to the meaſure of his ſtrength, and
that thus it ſhall be well always with every one, and
when Death cometh, that the Bands of the Body
muſt be looſened, there is a way opened for him into
Heaven, wherein he ſhall enjoy Life Everlaſting, where
are all things, and that now is fully conſummate, which
was that very moment to be conſummated.</hi> Finally, theſe
Men went up higher, and came to the Schools and
Univerſities, thoſe Seminaries of the Church-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
and future Props of the Church, of all which
this was their Complaint: <hi>That theſe Places were as
vitious as might be, and that this was almoſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Practice of all Students, that they either did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or but very little of thoſe things that conduced
thereto; and that they either alone, or one with another,
as much as they could, purſue Pleaſures, or that they
who endeavoured to excel the reſt, were only taken up
with more remote and ſubtil Meditations and Diſputes,
and with the Methods and Arts of declaiming, and
exerciſed their Minds therein; and did not improve
the domeſtick Knowledge and Diſcipline of their own
Minds, and cultivate their Thoughts and their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
with the true and abſolute Knowledge and Vſe
of Godlineſs and a Spiritual Life; but that by ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
and Occupations as theſe are, ſome were ſet at
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50388:50"/>
nought, and looked upon to be Foreign from ſuch Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Scholaſtical Documents, and beneath the cares
of ſuch Wits and more Learned and Eminent Places.
And that from hence ſome apply themſelves to Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Offices, and attain thereto, others come in by
begging of Suffrages, others by other Methods, whoſe
Promotion is rendred difficult through the dulneſs of
their Vnderſtandings, and want of Elocution. Others
who have a diſtinct Voice, and the knack of ſpeaking,
and are furniſhed with Oratorical Sentences, though
they have no other Commendable Quality, do prevail,
and ſo the People are indeed taught ſome things, yea,
ſometimes many things, but not ſuch, or but very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
and negligently, as ought moſtly to be inſiſted upon,
as appertain to the Faith it ſelf, tend to the amending
of Life, and to Holineſs; and ſo the People are as it
were thus defrauded of their juſt Right.</hi> But though
the Quakers accuſed and condemned all Proteſtants
of Theft and ſuch ſorts of Vices, yet they granted
that the firſt of them, of whatever Profeſſion, were
the beſt of all of them, as being ſuch as were more
upright than the reſt, and ſet themſelves in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to thoſe Corruptions, and did moſt prudently
and gently adviſe and warn their Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and ſtudied to amend and heal ſo great a
Diſeaſe and Contagion as was crept into the Church,
and for this purpoſe gave in their Help, Counſel,
and Aſſiſtance. But they ſaid, that this Diligence,
Intention, and Study, fell but to the ſhare of a few,
and that the multitude reſiſted, and forthwith
made a noiſe, and gainſaid, gave them an ill name,
and endangered their Eſteem, Buſineſs, and Fortune,
and were ſo beſet and hemmed in, that all their
Labour was in vain, and they neither could, nor
durſt ſtir further. So things came now to that paſs,
that Men could eaſier and ſooner bear Vices, and all
manner of Evils, than Remedies for the ſame; and
there was no way left then that thoſe who were
concerned for the Good and Salvation of their Souls,
ſeeing there was ſo great, inſuperable, and deadly a
Plague, withdraw themſelves and depart; from
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50388:50"/>
hence therefore ſprung theſe Quakers Grief, hence
their Tears; firſt, by reaſon of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches,
and eſpecially of the Epiſcopal, then of other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
ones, and this chiefly becauſe of the Rule,
Order, and Diſcipline, and the Lives and Manners
of the Men, not ſo much by reaſon of Doctrine,
yet ſo, as that they themſelves acknowledged, that
there were in theſe ſame Churches many Teachers,
who reproved, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ailed, and endeavoured to amend
ſome things which the Quakers ſo much carped at,
ſo as that the thing which the Quakers wiſhed for,
was not to be deſpaired of. And this was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of the Schiſm of theſe Men, or their with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
from the Church, and from an hatred
ſprung-up, heat and burning againſt the whole
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and afterward againſt the reſt
of the Reformed Churches, and at length againſt
all Proteſtants; which cauſe they ſo laid hold on,
not that every one ſhould continue in his Church,
no, not in thoſe whom they confeſt to be leſs cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
than the reſt, and their endeavour to ſet
things to rights, as ſtated Reformers, who ought;
and knew, would and durſt, as being of a great
Capacity, and moſt patient of Labour, and alſo of
Injuries; but that they ſhould forthwith forſake
all the Churches, and as it were, pluck down ſuch
as they could not change and renew, and leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for Charity, Hope, and Patience, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering
Good often overcomes the Evil. But and
after they had thus forſaken thoſe Churches, many
of them did not with Grief and Compaſſion diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thoſe Vices, neither did they as became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
gently, and diſcreetly adviſe the wandring,
and ſuch as were out of the way, and bring them
kindly back again, but did moſt bitterly and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly
relate all things, and caſt all manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
upon thoſe Churches, and as it were ſet
upon the Men in an Hoſtile manner, and drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
and united into a Mutual Confederacy in
this War, though no ways injured, nor provoked,
nor indeed entertained with an hard word; and this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50388:51"/>
in ſuch a manner, as that all were frightned by
them from the Community of ſuch Churches, and
from the entrances into them, and ſet them ſuch
Examples, as were much to be ſhunned, that there
is no doubt to be made as concerning them who
thus raged, but that they acted more from a deſire
and ſtudy of Novelty and Glory, than from a ſincere
and pious Mind; ſo that that Man who blames the
Works of another, ought to take heed leſt he be
deceived himſelf, and to ſee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> while he is apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Remedies for one Evil, other Evils ariſe
therefrom; thus it was with the <hi>Browniſts</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants</hi>
many years before, who firſt ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe of the
many Defects and Abaſes therein, and afterwards
from the reſt of the Reformed Churches, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
alſo of the unworthineſs and want of Diligence
which they imagined they ſaw in them; and even
ſo now the Quakers, ſuppoſing they had the ſame
Cauſes and Reaſons for what they did, undertook
the ſame thing, and that in ſuch a manner, that
ſuppoſing thoſe fore-runners had not done enough;
they began a new Schiſm, and did altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
and purſue a new Doctrine among themſelves,
a new way of Living, and a new Church; theſe
they teſtified to be the cauſes they had, whenever
they ſpake of their Undertakings, or conferred with
others, or appeared before the Magiſtrates, and that
in plain and direct words; and upon this Head did
many of them write Books and Pamphlets (which
upon ſuch an occaſion are much more efficacious
and prevalent than larger Tracts) among which
the moſt remarkable were publiſhed by <hi>Fox</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor
and Introducer of theſe things, and <hi>Howgil,
Pennington,</hi> and <hi>Whitehead,</hi> which laſt three were
however more moderate in their Writings, than <hi>Fox</hi>
was, to ſay nothing of the reſt of them. Theſe
Pieces they alſo tranſlated into other Languages,
and diſperſed through other Countries. Now I am
come to that which has occaſioned me to dwell ſo
largely upon this Subject. And becauſe I have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50388:51"/>
ſpoken of that Religion and courſe of Life, which
theſe Men went about to overthrow, I have alſo
deemed it ſeaſonable and neceſſary, diſtinctly to
ſet forth, what manner of Life and Doctrine that
was, which they (after that they were increaſed to
a Multitude, and ſo much poliſhed and inſtructed
under ſo many Maſters and Teachers) then ſet up,
and which is now maintained by all their Followers:
For the Tenour of their Doctrine was the ſame as
that of others, that they who framed it, ſhould in
proceſs of time, from ſmaller beginnings poliſh and
reduce the ſame into a greater <hi>Decorum</hi> and Order.
Eſpecially, in that they were more intent at firſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the deſtroying of the Religion of others, than
upon erecting any new one of their own, and that
they were at this time more given to an Active
than a Contemplative Life, or than to that which
conſiſts in much Meditation, Enquiry, and ſtrength
of Underſtanding; thus judging with themſelves,
that to be a Chriſtian, was not to underſtand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
things, nor to ſpeak of great Matters, but to
live; from whence, as in former times, ſo alſo now
theſe Men can no otherwiſe be compared, than with
moſt Profeſſors of Religion, be it what it will,
that they are endued with greater Love and Zeal for
their Religion, than a knowledge of it, and even
many Teachers of the Quakers themſelves not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted:
But yet there were ſome from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as there are many at this day, that gave a
good Account of their Religion, and explained it.
Now the Doctrine of theſe Men conſiſted chiefly of
four kinds; the firſt whereof was the Principle of
Religion; another the Subject of the Divine Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits;
the third, the embracing of them; the fourth
and laſt, the way and manner of Communion. The
firſt ſort therefore was that which belonged to the
Principle and Foundation of true and ſaving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
this with them was a clear and diſtinct Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of the Holy Ghoſt, either without the
written Word, to wit, by Speech, or ſome Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition,
or Dreams, or by the written Word, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50388:52"/>
either this or that which we call the Holy
Scriptures, or by ſome other; or elſe ſome certain
way which is equivalent to the Word. For the
Holy Scriptures, as we take that Word, is not to
them a perpetual <hi>Medium,</hi> and ſuch as is abſolutely
neceſſary, and the only and compleat Rule and
Form of Faith and Manners; and here you may
eaſily ſee, how far they differ from thoſe, who while
they own the Scripture, take away the Spirit, and
ſubſtitute Reaſon in the room thereof; and how
much from thoſe, who acknowledge the Scripture
as the only neceſſary Inſtrument, and the ſole Rule
of Faith and Manners: And that the Aſſiſtance of
the Spirit is required towards our having a certain
knowledge of the Divine Will, and performing of
the ſame. The Second Head contained the Subject,
on which the Divine Benefits are beſtowed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which they thus judged and determined;
That all Mankind, by the Sin and Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi>
were utterly depraved and loſt, ſo deſtitute of
ſtrength, and in ſo deſperate and forlorn a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as that they were unable to think of that
which is good; but that God did ſo univerſally love
Mankind, as that he gave his Son Jeſus Chriſt,
and conſtituted him to be a Peace-maker between
God and Man. Hence God beſtowed upon all Men
a new Birth, Himſelf, his Son, his Holy Spirit, the
Light and Word within, and did by the ſame ſo ſtir
up their Minds, even every one of them in his
true Way, and peculiar Meaſure ſo as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
and perceive their Miſery, and did ſo excite
them, as that they at length ſought God, and were
converted unto him; which Light was yet effected
ſometimes by the Word from without, and lively
Preaching; but then it was (they ſaid) that that
Light and Word was to be received of Men, when
they did not reſiſt the Divine Operation, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it, and being ſtirred up by God, they gave
way to his Impulſe and Incitement; but here, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there was none to whom the Doctrine of the
purer Proteſtants upon this Head was known, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50388:52"/>
to whom the Opinions of ſuch as ſavoured of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianiſm,</hi>
or in ſome part inclined to them, were
not unknown, who did not think that the Quakers
alſo purſued and imitated ſome ſuch thing as theſe
laſt mentioned; the Quakers hereupon cryed out,
that they were much in the wrong, ſince indeed
their meaning was, that either the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was not ſo depraved, or that there was ſome
Natural Light remaining, whereby they may free
themſelves from that Vitioſity, and that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
joyns himſelf to ſuch as do their endeavour,
and helps them; ſo as that it is not the meer Grace
of God, but in ſome ſort Merit in Man, and that
either ſome Word, or ſomewhat elſe is beſtowed of
God to this end, whereas the Quakers have no ſuch
thoughts. The next Article conſiſted of ſuch Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
which are peculiar to thoſe, whom they
ſaid did not reſiſt the foreſaid Illumination, but
obeyed it; for when this Article is known, and that
which all Proteſtants teach concerning this matter,
none will deny, but that there is a great deal of
difference between the Opinion of Proteſtants, and
theſe Men of whom I now ſpeak apart; for this
is that which they would have, that Chriſt having
performed his Obedience, and ſuffered Death, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for all Men indifferently to be brought into
ſuch a ſtate, wherein they are capable of receiving of
Chriſt into them; which when it comes to paſs,
that then Chriſt, who is altogether Holy and Juſt,
exiſts in that Perſon, and lives, and operates, and
that by that means the ſame Perſon, the Juſtice of
Chriſt exiſting and operating in him, becomes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Juſt, to wit, that the Depravation and Malice
of his Nature is gradually unlearnt and laid aſide,
and greater proficiency daily made in Juſtice and
Goodneſs, but yet ſo as that he may always ſin,
backſlide, and fall into his former Darkneſs: But
he may alſo arrive at that Perfection, ſo as not to
ſin at all, neither can that conſtancy in Good fail
and ceaſe; and ſeeing no one is happy but he that
knows himſelf to be ſo, this ſame Man is even then
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50388:53"/>
fully conſcious of his own Felicity. The laſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of this their Doctrine was this, and which
conſiſts in the Meaſures and Mediums of receiving
the Benefits, by which how much alſo theſe Men
differ from thoſe of whom I have ſpoken, will from
hence be no hard matter for us to Judge: For they
would allow no other Mediums and Aids herein,
than watchfulneſs of Mind, and attention to that
Light, which ſhines in the Heart of every Man,
and to the Oracles of the Holy Spirit in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or the Admonitions and Exhortations of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Perſons. And thus indeed did they receive
and admit of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, but ſuch
a Miniſtration as every one ought to undertake,
though in a different degree, being impelled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by the Holy Spirit alone, without the Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Men, without Price and Reward, and that
even Women themſelves ſhould not be excluded
from Teaching: This they would now have and
require, that all Chriſtians ought frequently to
meet at certain Times and Places, to the end that
they might Worſhip God and the Father with Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
and united Minds, and Inſtruct and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
one another to the Obſervation of the Laws of
God and Men, and to the exerciſe of Vertue and
Modeſty; but yet not ſo, as that their Worſhip
ſhould be confined to thoſe Places and Times, ſo as
that it muſt neceſſarily be undertaken, begun, and
finiſhed there and then, according to the Decree
and Limitation of thoſe Men; for that Worſhip
ſhould be performed by the Impulſe and Aſſiſtance
of the Spirit alone, who Acts freely, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to no ſpaces or limitations; now they would
admit of no Sacraments, Signs, or Seals of the Grace
of God that were perceptible by the Senſes, whence
they aſſumed the Notion, that Baptiſm and the
Lord's Supper is ſomething that is inward and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
and that thoſe external Rites continued in
the Apoſtolical Churches but as Figures for a time,
until the ſubſtance of the thing it ſelf was obtained.
The Quakers ſpoke and wrote many things from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50388:53"/>
the very beginning of their Sect concerning God,
and Chriſt, as they were in Men, and that Men ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in them, and almoſt all their Diſcourſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
hereon, but ſo as that it was hard, yea, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for a Man to underſtand what they meant
thereby, or to cauſe any other to underſtand it.
They began in proceſs of time to explain their
meaning more clearly upon this Head, and to be
more open concerning it, and therein as it were
placed the Foundation of their whole Doctrine,
which ſhall be ſpoken of at a more convenient time:
This therefore was the firſt Form and Deſcription
of their Doctrine; but as the Doctrine and Faith
of theſe Men was admirable and ſingular, their <hi>Life</hi>
and <hi>Converſation</hi> was no leſs; for this chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in Abſtinence and Continency; they ſaid, all
publick and private Wars were forbidden by the
Law of God, and they ſhunned all Acts of Revenge,
and Reſiſtance alſo, neither would they when they
had any concerns with other Men, though before a
Magiſtrate, and that the matter might require it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
their Aſſeverations with any Religious Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
much leſs with an Oath, and ſuch ways, they
ſaid, were altogether forbidden: Moreover, they
abſtained from Pleaſures, gay Cloaths, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
Attire, and hated ſuch ways and artifices as
tended to Vanity and Paſtime, as alſo Shews, Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes,
Plays, and all manner of Joking and Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and beſides theſe, they declined to uſe ſuch
Voices, Faces, Geſtures, Motions, Salutations,
Blandiſhments, Obſequiouſneſs, and the like, which
are commonly practiſed in the Societies and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views
of Men, and go by the name of Vertues, or
of Good Manners and Breeding, and did require
this, That every one look after, practiſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
in a ſerious, prudent, ſparing, ſober, grave,
and ſevere manner, all that which the Dignity, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and Excellency of a Chriſtian did require,
and this both in words and deeds; and that they
conformed themſelves as much as might be to that
way of Living. This is that Method of Living which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50388:54"/>
the Quakers from the very firſt riſe of them have
retained conſtantly to this very day; and they did
indeed ſo extol this their Theology, as if this at
laſt, and no other, did agree to the Conſtitution and
Condition of the New Covenant between God and
Man, and of the Inſtrument thereof the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
and as if it were the only one adapted to
convince and lead all ſorts of Men to the Reception
of the Chriſtian Faith, and to ingenerate true Piety
towards God and Men. And as to what apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the Life and Manners of them, they were
themſelves very ſenſible, how the Men of this World
hated them, made a Laughing-ſtock of them, and
accounted them as it were the ſcum and off-ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Men, for the auſtereneſs and ſeverity of their
Manners, as being ſo oppoſite to the Converſation
of Men, and as it were upbraiding the Folly of
all of them. But as they bare this Misfortune with
great Conſtancy of Mind, and ſaid, that they ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
nothing, feared nothing, beſides what was really
a ſin, either againſt God or Men; ſo they alſo retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this, that all good Men, who own, that the
Chriſtian World hath long ſince groaned, and as it
were, been fatigued with ſo many, and ſo great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſities,
Fooleries, and Juglings, ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their Vertue, in that they durſt batter and
break through ſuch common and inveterate Pravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Perverſeneſs with ſo much Inconveniency to
themſelves; though theſe Men did not deny, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
doth now alſo force them to confeſs, but
that ſome of them were not ſuch as they would
have, and wiſhed themſelves, and all other Men to
be, and that indeed there were at firſt, and are at
this day ſome among ſo great a confluence of theſe
Men, who hiddenly and craftily inſinuate themſelves
into their Societies, and do follow rather their words
than deeds, and not only paſs over the Limits of
that their ſo great Severity and Gravity, but do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
themſelves commit thoſe Vices, which they lay
to the charge of others; and more eſpecially do
carry themſelves maliciouſly and fraudulently in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50388:54"/>
their Negotiations and Dealings with Men, and ſet
their Profeſſion to Sale, and ſerve Perſons and not
Offices, and alſo accommodate themſelves to the
preſent times; but they ſay, they hate, deſpiſe,
and are angry with ſuch Men, yea, that they are a
loathing to them, and that they make a diligent
ſearch after them, and if they find they will not be
reclaimed, nor repent, that then there are ſevere
Chaſtiſements reſerved for them, but and if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
they do not return, they order them
to be caſt out of their Community: But, as I have
long before begun to ſay, there was ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of Men to the Inventors and firſt broachers
of Quakeriſm, and after they had aſſociated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto them, there was ſuch a Zeal from time
to time for this ſame Religion, and this Sect or
way of Living, and on the other ſide ſo great an
Emulation and Strife of other Men againſt theſe,
that both ſides ſeemed to ſtrive, who ſhould moſt
fatigue and ſooneſt overcome the other; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which matter I have now at length determined
to ſpeak at large. This is that which thoſe Men
have profeſſed of themſelves, and ſuch is the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
they gave unto them, who daily joyned
themſelves to their Communion, that they were,
and indeed had been of the number of thoſe
Men who had a great deſire for and ſingle Love to
God, and their own Salvation; wherefore as Birds
of a Feather do eaſily flock together, there were
thoſe of the multitude of every Religion, eſpecially
ſuch, who had moſt Piety towards God, and were
moſt deſirous of the bleſſedneſs of their Souls, than
which nothing is more deſirable to Man, that betook
themſelves to their Society; they did confeſs they
were now ſenſible of and bewailed, with what neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
ſloth, indifferency, and perverſeneſs they
had ſought God before, and ſtudied their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
for which they ſhould have been moſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
and that they were deſirous now to make
amends for and compenſate this Evil with ſo much
the greater and more vigorous diligence in doing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50388:55"/>
good. Hence they had frequent Meetings together,
and with united Minds turned to God, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
themſelves unto him, and ſtirred up one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to do the ſame: Thus they loved nothing ſo
much as their Meetings, and did ſo exerciſe mutual
Offices one towards another, that they were reſolved
rather to ſuffer any thing, yea, rather Death it ſelf,
than not do ſo. And now they affirmed that they
pitied others, the wretchedneſs of all, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
deſtruction, becauſe that they were affected
with no manner of care, no thoughts of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and that they had no other deſire than to
deliver them from ſuch great danger and hazard of
their Souls; hence it was that they uſed many
words to ſuch as they thought to be within the
compaſs of ſuch danger; whence many were daily
enticed and brought over by them, and ſeveral were
taken by no Word, but only Example; and ſeeing
that all of them were of the ſame Mind herein, there
was none or rarely any Diſſention between them in
regard to their Sermons or Speeches, no contempt of
any Man's Parts, Condition, and Gifts; and thus
every one, as gifted one way or another, beſtowed
upon and diſpenſed to one another, and divided his
Talent among all, which is indeed the real Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints; ſo alſo did the younger Men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Offices of a full Age, as did likewiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
and Maidens, and neither did Women confine
themſelves to the diſcharge of their Duties towards
their Husbands, which was only in uſe to this time,
but publickly Taught and Preached; wherefore
many of both Sexes were daily moved to betake
themſelves to this ſide, where they might have an
Opportunity to ſhew what they were, eſpecially
Women, partly through the Inconſtancy of their
Natures, partly from a ſuper-abounding Zeal and
Love of Religion, and partly for to have a Publick
Tryal of themſelves, and alſo to Inſtruct Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Church; which only thing ſeemed yet to
be wanting in this part of the World to make up
the licentiouſneſs of the Female Sex: Moreover, as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50388:55"/>
in <hi>England</hi> this Sex is looked upon as having a great
power and aſcendency by their blandiſhing demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
over their Husbands, and ſuch as belonged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, hence it came to paſs, that many Families
by their means did often joyn and unite themſelves
to theſe Quakers, though they were not ſo ready
to receive and admit of theſe Men into their Society,
and they did try each of them with all the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
they could; and though in the beginning a
leſs number of Men joyned themſelves to them,
and that afterwards, and at this day, there is a
much greater increaſe of them, that Cuſtom of
Womens Teaching and Diſcourſing publickly, did
then, and more and more by degrees, and at this
day almoſt univerſally wear out, and grow into
diſuſe: Now their Aſſemblies, and the Worſhip
performed in them, were without any charge to
them, and if there were any of their number, poor
and needy, theſe held the ſame Rank, and were
had in the ſame Eſteem with them as the reſt, and
them they relieved, according as their Wealth and
Subſtance would bear, ſo as that laying aſide all
Ambition and Pride, its Price and Reward might
be equally diſtributed to Vertue alone, and that
every ones Probity might be only his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
and Praiſe; wherefore there were many,
who were either not ſo much eſteemed, or not ſo
well relieved among their own Societies, who fled
to theſe; among whom there were not a few found,
who according to the old and common Contagion,
made Religion only a Cloak for their Humility and
Obſcurity, and the nouriſher of their Idleneſs;
but there was a far greater cauſe than all this, and
indeed there is nothing ſo oppoſite to Religion and
Godlineſs, ſo much an Enemy to Reaſon, common
Senſe and Humanity, than to deſire to Rule in
ſuch things as appertain to Religion over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of Men, much more, to conſtrain Men in
a violent manner, not to follow their Religion,
which they believe they have received of God, and
to compel and force them to embrace that Religion
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50388:56"/>
which they loath and ſhun, and if they will do
neither of theſe, to torment, oppreſs and deſtroy,
and not to allow them a being among Men; for
another thing is, if there are ſome, who ceaſe not
to be troubleſome unto others, but are buſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, to ſpeak ill of their Religion and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
to diſturb and infeſt them, and to ruine
and deſtroy their Churches; and theſe if they be
reſtrained and corrected; which not to do, and to
tolerate ſuch, eſpecially if they be ſuch, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
this to belong to their own Religion and
Church for to overthrow the Religion and Churches
amongſt which they live, were the ſame thing, as
knowingly and wittingly to enſnare themſelves, and
to make way for and run headlong into their own
voluntary deſtruction; and a great many People in
former times in theſe Kingdoms have felt the ſmart
of ſuch a Perſecution, and an innumerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the beſt of Chriſtians have felt the ſame
from thoſe very Perſons, who had before under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
themſelves that ſevere Tyranny from others;
but in reference to the manner how this befel the
Quakers in theſe Countries from the initiation of
their Religion, Ways, and Manners, and by what
right or wrong, theſe Men did afterward ſo bewail
their hard uſage, we ſhall take upon us a little more
diſtinctly to ſet forth. For as the Doctrine of theſe
Men was ſo oppoſite to the Doctrine of others;
hence the ſame was every where charged with
divers Accuſations and Reproaches, as alſo Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
eſpecially by them, who, as it uſually happens,
followed only vulgar Reports, and were in the
mean time ignorant of the Doctrine that theſe Men
held. And ſince their manner of Living was ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
oppoſite to the Cuſtom and Manners of all,
and more eſpecially in that they appeared very ſad
both in gate and countenance in the Streets, and in
Company, and that ſome of them were very naſty
in their Habit, and all of them ſilent, or of few
words, and when they ſpake, uſed many other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
Expreſſions, and them delivered ſlowly and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50388:56"/>
by piecemeals, and as it were by points, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if they treated of any ſerious matters, they
made uſe of ſuch ſort of Protractions, Heſitations,
and Delays, and expreſſed every word by ſyllables,
and did not only not ſalute Men in the Streets, but
utterly diſuſed Salutation both in their approaches
to and departures from Men, by which things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as it were the Enſigns of this Sect, they were
commonly known; hence it was that they were
envied and hated of all that had to do with them.
The Principal thing which drew upon them much
Envy and great Calamities, was their firſt Violence
and fierce Incurſions both in their words and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
againſt the Doctrine and Faith of others,
eſpecially of them, who were within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Publick Church, even becauſe of
certain names and words that were uſed by the
whole Church, and that for a long time, which if
not literally contained in the Scripture, yet did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in the thing, and were conſonant to other words
and names in the Scriptures, but ſuch indeed as
ſeemed to be fooliſh unto them. Another thing
was, their raſhneſs and boldneſs in Judging, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning,
Sadding, and Curſing of all and ſingular
Perſons, who did not agree with them in their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and ſuch beſides who were unknown had not
been heard, made no defence, and ſo innocent as to
any Injury done them, in the doing whereof, they
were moſt forward, who held the firſt Rank amongſt
this Sect of Quakers; but beſides theſe, there were
divers others, but of a different condition, and who
had this Property, to have little Wit, and to be
thoughtful of nothing, but furniſhed with Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Impudence, that began ſome ſort of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
in Publick Places, where there were moſt
People, in a kind of clamorous manner, but with
a very unpleaſing Noiſe, and even ſtood in the
Churches (which now the Quakers in general cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Steeple-houſes by way of Reproach) while Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service was performed, with their Hats on,
ſometimes during the Sermons of the Miniſters and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50388:57"/>
Common-Prayers (but ſuch as they called Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
diſagreeing with themſelves, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what they ſaid) and ſometimes after they were
ended, ſuddenly uttered ſome uncouth words, and
without ſhewing any previous Reaſons, reprehended
the doings of the former; yea, and deteſted them,
as if they were wicked and accurſt; and thus did
they do thoſe things themſelves which they had
blamed ſo much in other Men. There were ſome,
who in a Mimical and Fool's Habit and Geſture of
Body, did as it were either deſcribe the Actions of
Men in the open Market-places, or deride them, or
did take upon them to fore-tell the Fate that ſhould
attend them. Theſe were commonly ſuch as were
of meaner Parts and Fortune than the reſt, and
more eſpecially of the Female kind; and even they
who did theſe things, ſaid, they did them by the
Inſtinct of the Holy Ghoſt, and according to the
Example of the Prophets, and of Chriſt and his
Apoſtles, whom they contended to have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to have done ſuch things openly in crouds
of People, in the Temple, and other places, from
whence the Fame thereof might paſs into all places,
and that there never was any Law made in <hi>England,</hi>
that did forbid ſuch things; thus over and above
defending themſelves with their Quibbles and alſo
Law-Sophiſtry, to which alſo others of them, even
their Leaders, added their Conſent, there were
others who neither approved of this Practice, nor
blamed it. But this in proceſs of time they all
left and avoided; and hence it was that all Perſons
were not only alienated in their Affections from
theſe Men, but alſo moſt enraged againſt them, and
as often as they durſt do any ſuch thing, they were
aſſaulted and had violence offered unto them.
Though they notwithſtanding all, were by no
means deterred from it, but did continuedly repeat
the ſame, having this their Opinion as a Brazen
Wall unto them, neither regarding herein the words
and deeds of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and of thoſe
Holy Men, that we ſhould beware of Men, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50388:57"/>
ſhould not provoke them, but ſo admit of thoſe
things which we may avoid, and run our ſelves
into danger. Now, when the Quakers were brought
into Courts of Juſtice, and put upon anſwering for
themſelves, they would not off with their Hats,
nor call the Judges by Names ſuitable to their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(which Honours they thought unlawful to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
upon Men, and that it was a Worſhip that
appertained to God alone) and when they were
asked ſome things, as ſolemnly, deſcreetly, and
mildly as might be, many of them ſhifted back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and forwards, and made ſuch Anſwers as
were no ways to the purpoſe, and when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further hearing of the Cauſe than this,
they have been often thruſt into Priſons, the ſame
Perſons have ſlighted and blamed their Judges to
their faces, as the framers of ſuch Laws, whereby
they omitted what God and a good Conſcience di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated
to them, or did that which was contrary
thereunto; and others of the ſame Kidney did
every where in their Sermons and Libels caſt all
manner of Reproaches upon thoſe Magiſtrates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Men, and imprecated all Evils upon them,
and did as it were pronounce them by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, forgetting the Monitor and Author
of that ſaying, That in ſuch a caſe we ſhould not
delay to confeſs all our own failings, and alſo love
our Enemies, and bleſs and do good unto them,
and ſo be perfect as our Heavenly Father is perfect;
whence it came to paſs, that not only they who
were thus deſervedly committed by the Judges, but
alſo ſuch as thus maintained their Obſtinacy, were
laden with more and greater Evils, and the ſame
thing ſometimes fell upon the Heads of the whole
Multitude. But thoſe who were of a more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Temper, blamed the immoderation of theſe
Men; but the Quakers were never univerſally trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and perſecuted at any time during the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum</hi>
and <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Protectorſhip, in <hi>England,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there was no particular
Perſecution of them, by the appointment of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50388:58"/>
Authority, unleſs it were that theſe Men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to Aſſemble together in too unwary and
audacious a manner, or to diſturb the Publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
of others with their chatterings, or leſſen
the Reputation of them by their invidious Speeches,
Invectives, and Writings, or did ſome ſuch thing
by ſpeech or geſture: Neither was there any of
them puniſhed or put to Death either by Publick
Authority, or Tumultuouſly by the Multitude;
but ſuch indeed otherwiſe was the ſeverity of the
following Times, and the calamity of theſe Men,
that all were commanded every where to abſtain
from their Meetings; and when they urged that
they could not do that for Conſcience ſake, and that
therefore they would do it in no wiſe; then there
was a very heavy Perſecution, and not of one ſort,
raiſed as much as might be againſt all of them in
general, and in other places againſt each in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
as began to be turbulent and introduced any
Novelty in the Churches. And this afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
an acceſſional Crime, in that they would not
Swear before a Magiſtrate, pay Tythes, nor do and
ſuffer many more things, by reaſon of ſcruple of
Mind, and fear of God; by which Practice of theirs,
though none of the Quakers were at any time put
to Death publickly or privately, by Officers, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants,
and Executioners, by the Magiſtrate's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
yet many of them were ſo handled in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and ſo injured with Stripes and Wounds by
wicked and villainous Men, that they died miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
thereof; yea, and ſeeing the boldneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
of theſe Men was ſuch, that whatever they
begun, that they would go through with, and omit
nothing of ſuch things as I have ſpoken of before,
and the more they were chaſtiſed, the more obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
they would be againſt ſuch as cenſured and
chaſtiſed them. This was their daily Fate, that ſome
of them were committed publickly to Priſon by
the Magiſtrates, ſome fined, ſome baniſhed, and
reproached ſufficiently by the Common People, and
were cuffed, kicked, cudgelled, and ſtoned out of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50388:58"/>
the places where they were. Neither were there
any of the Teachers and Guides of the People, who
was not ſome where or other impriſoned; and many
times while they were gathered together they had
Information given againſt them, and thereupon
Officers, Guards, and the like Men were ſent, who
under the colour of their Office, fell upon, beat,
and carried away all that were preſent. Again,
there were many Private Perſons, and of the meaner
and vulgar ſort, born, brought up, and trained to
Miſchief and Rapine, that either came under ſuch
Leaders as theſe now ſpoken of, whither alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt their own greedineſs had led them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this, or alone and of their own accord, like
Theives and Robbers, and broke in where they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to gain moſt Pillage and Plunder, and forced
the Doors open, and firſt of all laid hold on, ſtripped,
and beat the People with their Hands and Sticks,
and ſcattered and diſſipated all of them, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they could not carry away, they waſted and
ſpoiled, the reſt they ſtole away, and every one
carryed his Booty to his own Houſe; by which fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
doings thoſe mad and wicked Men did often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in a moment deprive as well the Poor as the
Rich of all their Subſtance, which they had been
gathering for many Years, and of all the Houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff
they had, and to that degree, that they did
not leave the poor People as much as their Tools
and Utenſils which they made uſe of for to gain
their Livelihood. Sometimes it ſo happened, while
theſe Men did not meet covertly, that theſe Villains
all of a ſudden ruſhed into the midſt of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
put out the Candle, and of thoſe they
caught, ſome of them they dragged by the Hair of
the Head, others, tyed Hand and Foot, they carryed
into the Fields, and there left them, where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
continued all Night, to the endangering of their
Lives; and thus many of them did at laſt periſh,
both in Priſons, by Sickneſs, and the want of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
Stench, and other Inconveniencies, as alſo
in their own Houſes, becauſe of the Miſeries they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50388:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuſtained through the rage and violence of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
neither yet did theſe things alone at once ſeize
upon theſe People, but by degrees, and one after
another; in the mean time the Quakers ſuffered
and endured all theſe things from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
with ſo much Patience and Reſolution of
Mind, that they not only wearied many of their
Enemies, but alſo excited and enclined many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to become of their Communion; thus judging
with themſelves, that Men neither would nor could
undergo and ſuſtain ſuch intolerable Troubles and
Miſeries, unleſs they were very well aſſured in their
Conſciences of the truth of thoſe things for which
they ſuffered, even as the Quakers themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that this their Patience for their Faith,
which they turned to the Glory of Martyrdom,
joyned with their ſingular way of Life and Manners,
was the principal Seed of their Church both then
and at all times: Yea, I have heard ſome of them
Preach, that it would certainly come to paſs, that
their Religion would be a new Reformation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration
of the World, but that this would be
very unlike unto that Reformation which happened
in the Age before, as being partly ſupported by an
Arm of Fleſh, whereas this would be the only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of theirs, to be perfected and accompliſhed
by Faith alone, and the Patience and Long-ſuffering
of the Eſpouſers thereof.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Quakers complained very
much of the Miniſters of the Publick Churches, as
alſo of the Independants, but more eſpecially of
the Baptiſts; (to which Baptiſts themſelves there
was at that time granted great freedom both to
ſpeak and act what they pleaſed) that they above
all others were injurious to them, called upon the
Magiſtrates, and ſtirred up alſo the People to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
their Ruine, by reaſon that they leſſened their
Number and Dignity by ſhaking and medling with
them more than other Men. I have ſpoken of theſe
things in general; I come now to particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
as being them alone wherein the Proof,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50388:59"/>
Teſtimony, and Truth of things do lie; for the
Quakers did not deny, but did Object, that there
were many things which they reprehended in the
Doctrine and Religion of others, inſomuch that
they harped much upon this ſtring, That there
were many and great Scandals and Reproaches caſt
upon their Doctrine and Converſation by many,
and that from hence it was that great Injuries were
offered unto them every where. The Quakers did
indeed Muſter up ſeveral Petitions offered by the
Publick Prieſthood (let me make uſe of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
words of that People) who were in Publick
Power, which tended to the expelling and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Quakers for thoſe Reaſons, which, if they
had been true, they themſelves did confeſs that they
deſerved, having thus carried it in reſpect to the
Chriſtian Religion, not only to be thruſt out of
one Province, or the whole Kingdom, but from
the face of the Earth, and the number of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
if as theſe Men did deny, it was Lawful for
any Humane Power to inflict ſo ſevere and violent
a Puniſhment upon any for any wickedneſs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
Such an Humble Petition as this, if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
not, was preſented in the Year Fifty One, by
ſeveral Paſtors of Churches, and Citizens and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the County of <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of the Peace for that County, wherein they
deſired, <hi>That</hi> James Naylor, <hi>and</hi> George Fox, <hi>and</hi>
Francis Howgil, <hi>and the reſt of their Companions,
which Men, they ſaid, were generally unknown unto
them, from whence they came, where they dwelt, what
their buſineſs was, and whom, they ſaid, came by their
own Authority into theſe Places, and did miſerably
diſtract all ſorts of Men, and ſet them at diſſention,
and together by the Ears, and had wickedly ſeduced
many People with great Efficacy from the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
into dangerous, pernicious, horrible, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Ways and Errors, and brought things to ſuch a
paſs, as that they perverted and diſturbed all Peace
and Order in the Common-wealth, when in the mean
time they are, notwithſtanding any egregious and even
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50388:60"/>
Divine Reaſons offered by them to the contrary, wicked
Men, Impoſtors, the Miniſters of Satan; wherefore
they pray, they may be driven away, and commanded
to go into their own Countries, and confine themſelves
within thoſe bounds to their own Occupations and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments:</hi>
The Effect and Prevalency of which
Petition was this, that <hi>Naylor</hi> and <hi>Howgil</hi> were
thruſt into Priſon, though one of the Magiſtrates,
to wit, <hi>Gervaſe Benſon,</hi> did bear open Teſtimony
againſt his Brethren, that <hi>Naylor</hi> did not deſerve to
be cenſured for what he had done, as if he were
guilty of Blaſphemy, and that he as a Criminal
ſhould be admoniſhed and laid under ſuch a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for violating of the Law againſt ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and ſo great Villains. To which this muſt be
added, that the ſame Juſtice, <hi>Gervaſe Benſon,</hi> and
<hi>Anthony Pearſon,</hi> another that was Judge in that
matter, did afterward turn Quakers, and wrote
ſeveral things for thoſe Men: Another Example of
this Petitioning was, One two Years after preſented
to the Council of State (ſo they call'd it) by many
Noblemen, Iuſtices of the Peace, Miniſters, and
Citizens of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> in which Petition you have
theſe words; <hi>That</hi> G. Fox, <hi>and</hi> James Naylor, <hi>and
their Aſſociates and Companions, did not ceaſe both to
diſſolve the Bond and Vnity that was between all ſorts
and ranks of Men, as alſo between the People and
God, and brought their own Followers to ſuch a paſs,
that all of them, Men, Women, Children, and little
Ones were in their Conventicles agitated with ſtrange
and ridiculous motions, trembled, foamed, ſwole with
their Bellies, and that ſome of their Teachers did not
ſtick to ſay of themſelves, beſides other abominable
Hereſies, that they were equal to God.</hi> To this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
was ſubjoyned a Catalogue of their Hereſies,
with the Witneſſes hands to it, in theſe words;
That <hi>George Fox</hi> confeſs'd, and did perſiſt therein,
<hi>That he was equal to God, the only Judge of the World,
Chriſt, the Way, the Truth, and the Life; and ſo if
that any one took upon him in his Sermon to the People
to explain any Text of Scripture, be was an Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50388:60"/>
and his Preaching an Enchantment, and that the
Scripture was carnal; that</hi> James Melver <hi>confeſſed
that he was God and Chriſt, and that the ſame Man
gave out theſe Prophecies, that the Day of Judgment
was at hand, and farther, that there ſhould be no
more a Judge in</hi> Lancaſhire, <hi>and that he would ſhortly
pull up the great Aſſembly of Parliament by the Roots;
that</hi> Leonard Fell <hi>profeſſed, that Chriſt never had
any other Body but the Church; that</hi> R. Hubberthorn
<hi>had ſaid, that the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh was
only a Type and Figure.</hi> But though the Quakers did
thus determine among themſelves, that theſe things
which were laid to their charge, were ſuch, that
even the thing, if they held their peace, would
totter of it ſelf; but yet as they left nothing that
was objected againſt them without ſome Anſwer,
ſo did they alſo confute this in their Writings in
ſuch a manner, and with ſuch Reaſons, that it was
very apparent, that they were wicked Men who
invented theſe things, and that thoſe who believed
them, were Fools, excepting the Prophecies of
<hi>Melver,</hi> the Vanity of whoſe words they willingly
acknowledged and reproved; yea, and ſeeing it was
the Fate of theſe Men in all Judgments, to have
many Actions and Opinions full of Scandal and
Diſgrace laid to their charge, beſides their Doctrine
and way of Living, they anſwered and overthrew
theſe charges, not in one Pamphlet only, and ſet
forth what they had expounded concerning any
matter, what their Opinion was, and whoſe it was,
but they alſo ſent theſe Pamphlets to all the Judges,
and alſo to the Protector <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and did more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
Publiſh them among the People, ſo that all
and every Perſon might be throughly acquainted
with their Doctrine and Life, with the cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and plainly weigh thoſe things that might come
to be controverted, and if any ſuſpicion inſinuated it
ſelf into the Minds of ſome Perſons, they might
remove it, and that they might no longer lie under
ſuch falſe Accuſations as theſe; but whether it came
to paſs from ſuch an imputed Crime, or from
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50388:61"/>
Reſiſting and Oppoſing in an over violent manner,
or rather wickedly and imprudently impugning the
Doctrine and Fame of the Miniſters of God's Word;
<hi>Hubberthorn</hi> from this time forward did not ſuſtain
one only Impriſonment at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> but was alſo
confined in <hi>Norwich,</hi> and that to the Year Fifty
Five; but of this briefly, and by the way: Let's go
on; there are ſome Inſtances of theſe Men being
accuſed by their Adverſaries falſly, even then when
they went to them for to clear themſelves of that
Ignominy, either they challenged them to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in ſome place, and to hear how theſe Accuſers
proved and made the thing good, after they had
given them leave to ſpeak, or they did ſuddenly
and at unawares, or after ſome fooliſh Expreſſions,
enſnare them with ſome words, and ſo haled them
to Priſon: This was the Lot of <hi>William Desborough,</hi>
in a Town of <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> called <hi>Welling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough.</hi>
A certain Miniſter met him in that Town
(but what Miniſter it was, and of what Church, I
paſs over, and theſe things I ſpare becauſe I would
ſpare the Order and Dignity) at a time, when he
was going to Church to Preach to his People; he
ſets upon the Man, threatens and ſeverely charges
him to give over to deceive the People, before God's
Judgment overtook him; the Quaker asked him,
wherein it was that he deceived the People? To
which the Miniſter replyed, That <hi>Desborough</hi> taught,
that there was no Original Sin, and when <hi>Desbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>
would fain know, whether he had heard him
at any time ſay ſo, he, whether out of choice, or
that he was unprepared and ſtraightned for time,
held his Tongue, and went his ways into the Church,
<hi>Desborough</hi> follows him, and keeping cloſe to the
manner and way of his Party, ſtood there all the
time that the Miniſter Prayed and Preached, with
his Hat on, and waited for the end of his Sermon,
and an Opportunity to ſpeak himſelf: Therefore
when the Miniſter came down from the Pulpit, he
drew nigh, and asked him that he ſhould now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the People prove and demonſtrate what he had
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50388:61"/>
before ſaid to him to his face; but here the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
went his ways, and left the Man in the midſt
of his Congregation: And thus <hi>Desborough</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that it was his part now to ſpeak, there he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to make a ſort of a Speech to the People, in
which they affirmed he ſhould ſay, that all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the People were Hirelings, who, only for
Gain gave their Labours to the People; hereupon
he was hurried away, firſt, before the Magiſtrate,
and afterward into Priſon, and laid among Thieves,
Murderers, and Cut-Throats; in which place after
he had continued almoſt for the ſpace of Seven
Months, he was carryed to the Grand Aſſizes, then
held at <hi>Northampton,</hi> the County Town of that
County, before <hi>Edward Atkins,</hi> a Man endued
with great Modeſty and Moderation of Mind: But
ſeeing there was no more but one of his Accuſers
preſent, and that the Judge was now to determine
the matter, he did it in theſe words; <hi>Common Fame is
indeed a good Accuſer, but not therefore a good Proof:
And thus far I am ſatisfied as to thoſe things I have
heard of thee; but yet becauſe thou art brought out
upon a Common Report, that you are a dangerous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the diſturbers of the Publick Peace, I'll ſend
thee back into Priſon, unleſs thou wilt give in Bail,
that thou wilt demean thy ſelf well, and appear next
Aſſizes.</hi> But when <hi>Desborough</hi> ſaid, that he look'd
upon that unreaſonable, and that he ought not to
give Bail in ſuch a caſe, he was again committed to
Priſon; and when in the next Aſſizes, where <hi>Hales</hi>
was Judge, the ſame Action was brought againſt
him, and that there was yet no Accuſer there, the
Judge did alſo acquit him of the Charge in this
Place, yet commanded him to be carryed back to
the ſame place, and kept there till another time:
Another Inſtance of this kind was this; ſome of the
Quakers had a Meeting together, and were at their
Worſhip in <hi>Mancheſter;</hi> a certain Miniſter of the
Publick Church goes in to them of his own accord,
and challenges all that would oppoſe him, and ſaid,
that he would ſhew that their Spirit they pretended
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50388:62"/>
to, was the Spirit of the Devil, and ſo appoints
both time and place, where, if they pleaſed, they
might hear him demonſtrate the ſame by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
There was then preſent there <hi>Leonard Fell</hi>
afore ſpoken of, who, more eſpecially being not
able to hear, nor endure ſuch an heavy Objection
and Charge, he promiſed to be preſent, and having
taken ſome of his Companions along with him,
appears at the time and place appointed: There
the Miniſter being more animated, than ready and
furniſhed for the Work, protracts and defers the
Buſineſs to another time, but they did then offer
themſelves, and came briskly to the matter in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie;
which while that was done, ſome rude and
impertinent Fellows break in, and fall upon them
with great violence and ſharpneſs, give them many
blows, and pull them not only out of the Houſes,
but alſo hal'd them out of the Town, crying that
they were ſent by the Officers of the place to do ſo.
There were indeed ſome wicked Fellows at <hi>Beverley,</hi>
who while <hi>Iſaac Gate</hi> was Preaching to his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
ſet upon them in the Houſe, crying out, that
he vilified their Miniſters, and pull'd him out by
the hair of the Head into the Street. It were a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and almoſt an endleſs thing to declare how
many Aſſemblies have been diſturbed, how many
Men tormented, and what and how great Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they have endured in their own Habitations,
how many have been burdened and fined, wearied
with Impriſonments, forbid their own Homes, and
driven into Baniſhment, only for that cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they held their own Conventicles, ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſtood about ſuch places as thoſe, ſome
becauſe they went to viſit their Companions and
Friends, as they called themſelves one among ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and named themſelves to other People, though
they were otherwiſe free from any Offence, and
though there was no manner of Sect except the
Popiſh one, which had not as much freedom as
they pleaſed to meet and come together. There is
an Obſolete Law in <hi>England,</hi> which contains, That
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50388:62"/>
if any one as a Labouring-man betake himſelf ſome
where to get his Living, and cannot ſhew and
prove who he is, from whence he comes, whither
he goes, and what his buſineſs is, by a Paſs under
ſome Juſtice of Peace his Hand, that ſame Perſon
as a Vagabond, an Idle and Raſcally Fellow, is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
among ſuch as are ſo, and there made to
beat Hemp his belly full, and to earn his Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
Wherefore as often as they found any of
the Quakers, when they met together, they haled
them from thence before a Magiſtrate, and if they
were not ſo well known, or but Poor and could not
pay, theſe they puniſhed in this manner; and this
indeed ſeemed to adminiſter juſt matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
to the Quakers againſt their Adverſaries; for
it is an Old Maxim taken from the very Marrow of
the Law, That one ſhould not do to another what
he would not have done to himſelf. And this is
the Golden Sentence of our Saviour, fetched from
the Holy Law of God, and from the Prophets, <hi>That
whatever any one would have done to himſelf by Men,
let him do the ſame unto them;</hi> wherefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
in vain, of having wrong done unto him,
who does the ſame unto another. And it's a moſt
wicked thing, and not to be endured, to deny that
to another, which one would have to be given to
himſelf. Moreover, ſeeing that the Quakers ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo much after the Severity of the Old Laws,
and the Primitive Religion, and Chriſtian Faith,
did complain ſo much of the hard dealings of thoſe
whom they looked upon as their Enemies and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
and as they could not deny, but that
many of their own People did often-times ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
and carry themſelves towards them, who
eſteemed them alſo in like manner to be their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
of whom they ſo far complained, as that if
their Complaint were not unjuſt, even that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
which their Adverſaries made againſt them,
was juſt and right alſo; and ſeeing that thoſe Men
would be eſteemed as altogether Innocent, they
gave occaſion for Perſons to believe, that there were
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50388:63"/>
wicked ones amongſt them, who practiſed Evil
Arts, and who intimated, they would do any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
if they had Power to their Will. Examples
hereof were theſe, to wit, ſome of them caſt Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
and many vile Reproaches upon the Miniſters
of the Goſpel, and their whole Churches, at the
very time, wherein they were performing their moſt
Religious Duties, and ſo endeavoured to ſtir up
againſt them, yea, the whole Society, the Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Magiſtrate, the Rage of the People,
and the ill Will and Perſecutions of both, ſo that
now thoſe few Perſons might deſervedly be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Tormentors of all the reſt, and the Betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the whole Multitude; of which outragious
doings, ſeeing they who were Authors and Actors
thereof, or doubtleſs their Friends and Favourers
have in their Libels publiſhed by them given us
Examples, glorying in ſuch their Actions, there is
no doubt to be made but that thoſe which I ſhall
gather and pick out of them, are ſuch, as that there
cannot be had the leaſt ſuſpicion concerning them:
One <hi>Boſwel Middleton,</hi> a Shooe-maker in the City
of <hi>York,</hi> was the firſt that cut out, and, as it were,
fenced the way for the reſt of them, crying out
againſt <hi>Edward Bowles</hi> while he was Preaching in
the midſt of his Sermon to the People, and in the
hearing of all, <hi>Thou art the Servant of Antichriſt,
and ſo is thy Flock;</hi> for which words he was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
put in Chains: The like bold and impudent
Example we have in the ſame Year done at <hi>Oxford</hi>
by two Women, <hi>Elizabeth Havens</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth
Fletcher,</hi> theſe did firſt chatter and talk in their
way of Cant to the Students in the Streets, and
then in the Publick Churches, and laſt of all in the
Univerſities, but with more hazard, and greater
danger than they imagined, and yet they might
eaſily have done it. For theſe Perſons being as it
were taken with ſuch Polite Conceits as theſe gave
them forth, with a more pleaſant Entertainment, or
that I may be in earneſt, and tell the truth, as theſe
Waggs are more eſpecially exceeding arch and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50388:63"/>
they draw them into their Colleges, Pump
them, and throw them into the Privy, and did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
afterward take one of them, to wit, <hi>Elizabeth
Fletcher,</hi> and threw her into a Grave, that was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
for the burying of a dead Corps, with ſuch
violence, that ſhe received ſuch hurt by her fall, that
ſhe afterwards died thereof: But when they were
got free from this hardſhip, they go again to the
Church, and while one was ſilent the other ſpoke
there openly; ſo that both of them were taken
away and thrown into Priſon amongſt Rogues and
Burglars; and afterward when they were brought
to a Tryal before the Mayor, and that he had tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them over to ſome other Magiſtrates of the
City, and to the Vice-Chancellor, they were by
their Command thruſt out of the City as Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds;
but ſeeing we have many of theſe ſtrange
Examples, and them done not in one place, nor at
one time; it will not be improper to ſet forth what
have been done by theſe ſort of Men all this time
in the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and which has been recorded
by their own Companions, and real Defenders, as
being famous and worthy Performances; and the
rather, becauſe that in this Relation ſome other
things like unto theſe do offer themſelves unto us,
and others alſo are not to be omitted and paſt
over. This City, after theſe mens Dogms and
Opinions were broached in that Country, was as it
were the Seminary, Receptacle, and Refuge-place
of theſe Sectaries, and as it were the Theatre of
thoſe things, which was proper and peculiar for
theſe Men both to do and to ſuffer. Which thing
did very much nettle all Men of all Religions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the City was full: And though theſe ſame
Men diſſented one from another in reſpect to their
various Religions, and many other buſineſſes, and
were at very great and almoſt deadly Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves, yet they all agreed in this one
thing, for to oppoſe and reſiſt the Quakers: At this
time came <hi>John Audland</hi> and <hi>John Camie,</hi> and ſoon
after them <hi>Francis Howgil</hi> and <hi>Edward Burroughs,</hi>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:50388:64"/>
Names that were well known and dear there, into
the City: <hi>Audland</hi> and <hi>Camie</hi> in a ſhort time after
departed; but the other two tarryed and were ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before the Magiſtrates; they appeared; the
Magiſtrate commands them to depart out of the
City; they refuſe, and added, that if the Magiſtrate
would exerciſe Power, they would not reſiſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was impoſed upon them: Upon this the whole
City was ſo chafed, agitated, and exaſperated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Quakers, that where ever they ſaw them,
eſpecially when they were gathered together, and
as they went to the place, and departed from thence,
all People almoſt of all degrees, kind, and Age,
derided, mocked, threw dirt upon them, thumped,
kicked, and caſt ſtones at them: But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all this, the Quakers were not repreſſed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from their Undertakings; but ſome of them,
even as if they were intent upon that very thing,
for to increaſe and heighten the Anger and Rage of
Men againſt them and all their Party, undertook
alſo ſome new ways and Methods, from which they
could not only hope for and procure no good, but
from which they might eaſily know it might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
further to their hurt; for <hi>Elizabeth Marſhal,</hi>
during the time that the Miniſter of the Church,
<hi>Rodolph Farmer,</hi> and the whole Church were met
together to preach and hear the Word of God, to
pray to him, and to celebrate the Lord's Supper,
ſtood all the while over againſt <hi>Farmer,</hi> and when
he was going about to Adminiſter the Lord's Supper,
ſhe cryed out, <hi>Wo, Wo, Wo, hangs over thy Head
from the Lord, O</hi> Farmer, <hi>who takeſt the Word of the
Lord into thy mouth when the Lord never ſent thee;</hi>
at which words all the People being in an Uproar,
and many of them enraged againſt her, they fell
violently upon her, and thruſt out the Woman,
dragging her headlong out of the Church, and the
Boys without threw ſtones at her, and purſued her
until ſhe got into and ſaved her ſelf in her own
Habitation, and there remained ſecure from more
Outrages. This Fact might have been ſeverely
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50388:64"/>
puniſhed by the Magiſtrates, but they choſe rather
to forget, or to defer it to another time. But ſhe,
as if ſhe had done a good deed, undertakes the ſame
thing on the next Lord's Day, and in the ſame
Church, ſpoke theſe words againſt <hi>John Knowles</hi>
the Preacher, after he had pronounced the Bleſſing
upon the People: <hi>This is the Word of God to thee,</hi>
Knowles, <hi>I command thee to Repent for what thou
haſt done, and to hearken to the Light of Conſcience
that is within thee;</hi> and ſo being again puniſhed
with many blows, and thrown out of the Church,
ſhe was firſt confined by the Watch of the City,
and afterward committed by the Mayor into the
Common Priſon, and had no heavier Puniſhment
inflicted upon her. From whence almoſt all ſorts
of Citizens grew enraged, and cryed out, that theſe
Men ſought nothing elſe by their Inventions and
Undertakings, but occaſions of Reproaches, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances,
and Confuſions, as alſo matter of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and Revenge againſt them. Now <hi>Audland</hi>
and his Companion were returned into the City,
who when they were a going out of the City to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a place where the Quakers intended to keep
a Meeting, they were like to be in great danger
from the Boys that aſſaulted them; and its very
like they had periſhed, if they had not been ſaved
by the Care and Induſtry of ſome of the chief Men
of the Place. Which when the Common People,
and ſuch like unto them, came to know, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
thoſe Principal Citizens had not done their
Duty as they ought, they broke out againſt them,
and ſome threatned the Magiſtrates, and made a
Clamour, <hi>That this new, baſe, and partly flagitious
and wicked People, the Quakers, had paſſed over the
Bounds of Modeſty, and proceeded ſo far; that they
could not arrive to a greater Audacity and Impudence,
than they were come to; and that the Magiſtrate ſaw
and bore with all this, to whoſe care it was committed
to maintain the Honour and Dignity of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
whom they repreſented, and to take heed, leſt
the whole People ſhould at laſt be endangered in their
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50388:65"/>
Religion; ſo that ſeeing now, when ſo great a matter
is in agitation, the Laws are ſilent, Judgments dumb,
Puniſhments ceaſed, all things both Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
lie unregarded, and the extream Fate of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Liberty of the City was at hand; it was high
time that the People themſelves ſhould watch, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the neglect of the Magiſtrate, thoſe whom it moſt
concerns, are to be Magiſtrates to themſelves, and
muſt ſeek after their own ſafety, which they cannot
otherwiſe procure. This, though it may not be Lawful
at another time, yet at ſuch a time as this is, it's both
right and juſt, and ought, and there is need it ſhould
be done; but before they would enter upon it, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
that an Account of the whole matter might be
tranſmitted to</hi> Cromwel, <hi>who was the defender of the
Common Law and Liberty.</hi> The which was done
without delay, for there were ſome who tranſmitted
their deſires forthwith in this matter to <hi>Cromwel:</hi>
And ſo while theſe Men thought that they acted
the part of Citizens bravely, yea, that they like ſo
many Viceroys imagined they diſcharged the Office
of Judges well, the Magiſtracy winked hereat, or
contemned it, eſpecially becauſe things were brought
to that paſs, that the Guard of Soldiers that was
placed in the City, did no ways deter them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.
This Tumult laſted for the ſpace of two
days, and then was appeaſed of it ſelf: But lo,
while the Magiſtrates were ſtudying to aſlay this
great outragiouſneſs of the Times, by reaſon of
ſuch Inſolence in their own People, (and upon this
Conſideration did not afterwards call the heads of
the Rioters to an Account for ſuch their doings)
another Quaker, <hi>Henry Warren</hi> by Name, had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exaſperate the matter, and was as it were the
poiſoned Nail in this Altar of the City, for he had
ſuch a Luſt, as I may ſay, for it, and proceeded to
ſuch a height of boldneſs, that in the Church, and
that even when there was a very great Aſſembly,
he ſpake theſe words to the face of the Miniſter,
after he had made an end of his Office and Work,
<hi>The Prayers of the Wicked are an abomination to the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50388:65"/>
Lord;</hi> with which opprobrious ſpeech, than which
nothing could be more contemptible, all were ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up and provoked ſo as that they violently drave
the Man from the Church, and lead him before the
Mayor and Sheriffs of the City, who, that they
might not go unpuniſhed, commanded them to be
thruſt into Priſon; but ſuch was the intenſeneſs and
deſire of theſe Men to talk at this rate in theſe
places, and they were ſo much tickled with the
Glory which they placed therein, that they ſeemed
to deliberate one with another, and to determine
with Judgment for to purſue this matter, whatever
Hatred, Trouble, or Miſchief befel them and
their Companions; therefore it was not only one,
but many of them broke out in this manner, who
were ever and anon aſſaulted and violently beaten
for it, and indeed wounded in the croud, until they
were thruſt into Priſon. At laſt the Magiſtrate
calls all theſe Priſoners to an Account for their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which till then by reaſon of the Times and
other neceſſary Circumſtances, was omitted, but
ſo, even as now things ſtood, their Examination
was done in a mild, tender, and gentle manner, the
Magiſtrate ſuppoſing, that many harſh things might
be alleviated by gentle Animadverſion and Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
but thoſe Priſoners made their Anſwers to
the Magiſtrate not at all more ſubmiſſively, but in
a ſharper manner, and as often as their Crime was
laid to their charge, they would acknowledge and
confeſs no Crime, and ſtifly vindicated what they
had done, as what was Lawful and decent, and that
they did not do them things of their own will, but
according to the Will of God, and the Inſtinct and
Admonition of his Divine Spirit, and the Examples
of Holy Men, inſomuch that the Obſtinacy and
Obdurateneſs of theſe Men prevailed; wherefore
the Judges commanded them to be kept in Bonds
by reaſon of their cauſing theſe Moleſtations and
Diſturbances, and for their perverſe Manners and
Obſtinacy (and not for any other cauſes, as theſe
Men by way of Complaint did alledge) Moreover
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50388:66"/>
the People were generally ſo irritated and exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with hatred, wrath, and rage againſt them,
that they ſet upon the Quakers every where, laid
hands on them, beat, knock'd, and kick'd them,
and that ſo far, that ſome of them ruſhed into their
Houſes, and haled Men out from thence, ranſacked
all that was therein, and omitted nothing that
might gratifie their incenſed Minds. Of them that
were at this time in this City, were <hi>Audland</hi>
and <hi>Camie, Howgil</hi> and <hi>Burroughs,</hi> and <hi>Naylor</hi> and
<hi>Fox,</hi> whom we ought to have named firſt, as being
always the firſt and with the foremoſt, as if there
had been a Council called here, and that this were
done about moſt weighty Affairs; which when the
Magiſtrates came to know, becauſe there was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
made unto them, and that ſome had made
Oath of it, that there were certain <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Fryars
come from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> who concealed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
under the name of Quakers, and deluded
ſimple Men, and that there were many in this City
of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who under colour of being Quakers,
lurked there, and did pervert Men by their Artifices,
they commanded theſe Men to appear before them:
But they declared, that they did not know any
thing concerning the coming of thoſe <hi>Franciſcans,</hi>
and had nothing to do with thoſe ſort of Men, their
Studies and Cheats, and complain grievouſly that
they were laid under ſuch vile Slanders and invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Crimes, and that ſuch vile Perſonages as theſe
were affixt upon them, who were honeſt Men, and
who had ſo far withdrawn themſelves from thoſe
idle Monks, and the whole Papacy; ſo they were
diſcharged, till the Judges had got further Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of this Truth, than what they had heard
from the Reports of others; but becauſe this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
ſtuck in the Minds of moſt of the Citizens,
that it was moſt certain, that ſuch fallacious People
wandered in theſe Places, the City Guard, and alſo
many of the common People, run about, and ſearch'd
all places to ſee if they could light on any of this
new ſort of Men. Which thing did one day light
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50388:66"/>
upon many of the Quakers, among whom was
<hi>Joſiah Cole,</hi> a Perſon of Note in that Country. But
here it was on the very ſame day that <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
Birhead,</hi> an Inhabitant of this place, a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright
and Mariner, a Man according as Time and
Opportunity ſerved, of a rude and rough diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as thoſe Men are wont to be, as if he were
minded ſtill further to ſtir up and exaſperate the
Populacy, that were already ſufficiently moved and
obſerving all things, and rather than extinguiſh
their Fury, blow up the Coals, and raiſed it up,
goes to the Church, and ſtands and loyters during
the time of Prayer with his Hat on, which when
a conſiderable Man of the City beheld, knowing
what ſort of a Man he was, he takes care to have
him conducted from the Church to his own home,
as fearing ſome Tumult might be raiſed by him;
but he immediately returns, and when all things in
the Church were over, cries out with a loud voice,
pointing to the Miniſter, <hi>O thou Son of Pride,</hi>
and ſo had gone on if ſome had not ſeized upon him;
they therefore carry this Raſcal before the Mayor of
the City, who even for that time ſuffers him to go
his ways, but commands him the day after to come
before him, and when he came, he asked him, why
he was yeſterday ſo notoriouſly Impudent? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
That he had not done it imprudently, but
juſtly, and defends the Fact with many hard and
rough words, but winded them about that he might
not come cloſe to the matter in hand; ſo great was
the Clemency of the Magiſtrates, that they would
have even pardoned the Obſtinacy of this Man, if
he had but promiſed and received what they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of him, that he would do no ſuch thing any
more. To which Propoſals when he had detained
and illuded the Magiſtrates for a long time with
many impertinent words, and foreign from the
matter in hand, and was no more moved with
gentleneſs than with threats, they would not ſuffer
ſuch great Impudence and Obſtinacy to go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
and therefore they remanded the Man back
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50388:67"/>
to Priſon. And becauſe the Actions of thoſe that
were now in uſe and ordinary amongſt them had
eſcaped ſome time; others not content herewith,
invented other unuſual and extraordinary ways and
actions; thus did <hi>Thomas Murford,</hi> a Man among
the meaneſt degree of Men, of ſome account and
underſtanding enough in his own Concerns, but
ignorant of all others, had made for himſelf a
Garment of Goats hair and Sheeps wool, and walked
about in it up and down every where, and this with
a deſign to rebuke the Pride of the People in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel
and Dreſſes of the Body, and as a ſign of the
Puniſhment to enſue from God for it, unleſs they
ſaid the ſame aſide and gave it over. Such another
Garment did <hi>Sarah Goldſmith</hi> procure to be made
for her ſelf, to the end that being cloathed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
having her Hair diſhevelled, dirt upon her
Head, and ſo ſufficiently naſty, ſhe might go to
every Gate of the City, and paſs through all the
Streets, and afterward ſit in the Market-place in
the view of all People, and that the Truth might
be publick and made known there, and the true
and real cauſe of the full and certain wrath of God,
and an Example be given all People for the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
thereof, and this for the ſpace of ſix whole
days: And ſo on the firſt very early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and being accompanied with two more, ſhe
goes to the Gates of the City, and paſſes through
ſeveral Streets, but finding many People excited
hereat, and purſuing of her, ſhe turns home, and
afterward at Nine of the Clock goes to the Market-place,
being accompanyed only with one of her
Companions afore ſpoken of, and a great croud of
People at her heels, and ſtands ſtill as a ſtock for
half an hour, ſaying never a word; all ſorts of Men,
eſpecially Boys, flock to her, and every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Judgment, wonders, conjectures, enquires,
what Woman was there, what new Habit that was,
what ſhe meant and would have by ſtanding there,
and by and by the mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>r ſort, eſpecially Boys, did
every one together with their tongues uſe their hands,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50388:67"/>
and did ſo jeer and entertain this Spectacle, that
was thus adorned and furniſhed to receive the ſhock,
(for ſuch a Dreſs was of Old in uſe among Legier
Ladies) that ſhe did not know what to do, or which
way to turn her ſelf. At length comes a certain
Perſon, who uſing all ſhifts, got her from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place
and Croud into a Shop, from whence ſhe
was by the Sergeants carried into the Court, whither
ſome of the Aldermen came by and by, who, after
they had examined her, why ſhe had done ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
things? and when ſhe had anſwered, That
ſhe obeyed the Light of her Conſcience; and ſeeing
that ſhe ſeemed without all doubt to be Mad, and
out of her Senſes, and not fit to walk about in the
Streets, they commanded her to be ſhut up in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
but the Quakers did again defend this Fact by
the Examples of the Saints of the Old Teſtament,
who according to the Command of God himſelf, by
various and ſtrange Methods informed the People
of their Sins and the Divine Judgments: After this
interval of time, the Quakers did again, and as it
were, ſtrive to gainſay the Preachers of God's
Word in the Churches, ſome asked them Queſtions,
and did interrupt them in the midſt of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
of theſe laſt <hi>Benjamin Maynard</hi> was one,
that brought up the Rear, in theſe words; <hi>In God's
Name, Preacher, hold thy peace;</hi> ſo that where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſtood the ſhock but of a few People, now
it became an Habit in almoſt all to Aſſault them,
and all theſe were thrown into Priſon; with which
Priſons ſome of them were yet not ſo far terrified,
but that they uſed their way of babling and reviling
even there alſo, and made it their buſineſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame,
and heap up ſcandalous Reproaches upon the
Credit, Fame, and Reputation of the Magiſtrates
and Paſtors of the Church, in their moſt bitter
Letters to their Friends; ſuch Practices as theſe
might alſo be ſeen in other places; and theſe things
did the Quakers of thoſe Times extol as noble do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and glorious actions, and to be imitated by
others, and on the contrary did in their Pamphlets
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50388:68"/>
repreſent thoſe things which theſe Men ſuffered for
ſuch Practiſes, as the moſt Criminal and bloody
deeds of their Enemies. And indeed theſe things
were done by Men of a depraved diſpoſition, and
not by the beſt of them, who may juſtly be called
Ideots, for all of them were not guilty of it, they
who were of better quality and diſpoſition, their
Leaders and Rulers, ſaving perchance one or two,
or the like, and ſaving always <hi>Fox,</hi> did neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nor commend theſe ſorts of little Fooleries,
even as all this day, as far as they can avoid it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do, nor admit of the ſame, and when they
hear of ſuch things tranſacted by their Sect, they
ſay, they do eſteem ſuch Actions as the impulſes
and ſingular motions of thoſe Men, and as it were
the burning ſparks of their Zeal, Love, or Deſire,
whereof there have been many inſtances in this
kind in the Church, both in Ancient times, and
within the memory of our Fathers; theſe things
were tranſacted in the Years Fifty Four and Fifty
Five; but ſome Quakers this laſt Year met at <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham</hi>
in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> in the Houſe of one <hi>Thomas
Cartwright,</hi> to Celebrate their Divine Worſhip;
when this came to be known, a certain Conſtable
ruſhes into the Houſe, and brings out <hi>Cartwright,</hi>
and together with him under one labour, <hi>Humphrey
Smyth,</hi> and carries them before certain Juſtices that
were together in the ſame, and in company
with <hi>Haphinch,</hi> the Miniſter of the Church, theſe
after a long Debate and Contention with them, did
at laſt promiſe to diſmiſs theſe Men, if they would
engage and ſwear, that they would not meet again,
but when they denyed that they neither would nor
could do ſo, but would meet for ſuch juſt ends as
they had in hand, and would not confirm any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of thing with an Oath; theſe Juſtices ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
they had ſufficient cauſe againſt them, they
commanded them, as Perſons intent upon Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
and diſturbance of the Peace, to be lead to
Priſon: But ſome Quakers were ſo affected with
the Miſery of their own Impriſoned Friends, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50388:68"/>
mindful of them, as if they had been in Priſon
themſelves, that they betook themſelves to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and when they were not permitted to go in,
they ſtand ſtill without mute, to ſee if they could
at leaſt by their Sighs and Prayers obtain any relief
from God; but whether <hi>Smyth</hi> by receiving of ſome
ſign, came to know that they were there preſent, or
that he was ſtirred up thereunto of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
he at the ſame time with a loud voice falls
to Prayer in the Priſon; which when the Keeper
and others that belonged to the Priſon that were by
chance there preſent, heard, they run to him, and
being ready to do the Man a miſchief, hal'd him
from thence, and drive him down into another
place under Ground, of the Nature of a Dungeon;
thoſe who were without repeat the ſame thing next
day, and ſeeing that before they had held only a
ſilent Meeting, one of them now, <hi>Thomas Woodren</hi>
by Name, began to ſpeak; the ſame Keeper, when
he perceived this, goes out unto them in great
Rage, and Commands them in a very rough and
angry manner all to avoid the place, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part:
This they did, not becauſe of his words, but
of their own will and accord, and return again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a few hours after they had departed. The which
as ſoon as <hi>Smyth</hi> in his Cell came to know, he calls
and ſpeaks to them, and they Diſcourſe together:
It was on a day wherein the Townſmen had been at
their Religious Worſhip in the Church, and the hour
wherein they were to depart from thence to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
homes, and ſo ſome of them paſſed by that
way where the Quakers were gathered together, and
<hi>Woodren</hi> was ſpeaking to them about their Concerns;
but a certain Colonel lays hold on him, and brings
him before the Mayor, and was thereupon by his
Command ſent into Priſon to <hi>Smyth,</hi> and this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
was ſo angred and enraged againſt theſe
Meetings, that he threatned them, if they offered
to come together in that manner again, to Pillory,
hang them, and what not; and becauſe they were
afraid, leſt the Quakers perſiſted in that their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50388:69"/>
they keep a Watch; but yet they proceeded
to do as they were wont to do, and therefore they
alſo were puniſhed with Impriſonment; <hi>Smyth</hi> had
ſome Pamphlets of the Quakers in his cuſtody,
theſe were taken from him, and burnt in the ſight
of the People in the Market-place. There had
been a Law ſome time before made by the Protector
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> wherein it was enacted under a ſevere
Penalty, That none ſhould Swear profanely, and
more eſpecially, not only to ſwear falſly, but that
none ſhould ſwear ſlightly, and for no cauſe, and by
no means Profane the Holy Name of God. This Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
was read before the People, but not ſet up,
as the Cuſtom was, on any Publick Place; the
Quakers hence took occaſion to Complain, that
there were ſome among the Magiſtracy of this City,
and ſo of the Nation, who themſelves did grievouſly
offend more than one way againſt ſo Holy a Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;
for one was to be met with, who drove
Men moſt lightly to take an Oath, when he muſt
needs know, how great the wickedneſs of ſome
Men was, and how that many might, and were
wont to be brought to ſwear falſly, and to Perjure
themſelves with no more Conſcience, than if they
told an officious Lye; another there was, who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
had no Religion, but confirmed ever and anon
what he ſaid, with an Oath, another that was a
Drunkard; wherefore a certain Quaker fixt that
Decree of the Protector on the Poſt of the Court,
that it might be read by all; but this was pluck'd
off by another: The Quakers did hereupon ſend
their Petition concerning theſe things to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
and then was a Letter ſent by the Mayor,
Subſcribed by Forty Hands beſides, to him; they
urge, that he would do them Juſtice, and that
<hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Decree might be put in execution, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
to which, both theirs and other mens Vices
might be puniſhed; but their Petitions had no ſuch
Effect as they expected, for they did indeed but
diſturb the Ears of the one with them, and ſo irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
the Minds of the others, that they brought a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50388:69"/>
new Misfortune upon themſelves, and did alſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Cauſe of their Friends and Familiars the
more difficult, and did beſides aggravate the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of the ſame; upon which they afterward choſe
rather to contain themſelves, and ſtir the leſs, and
ſo be the leſs liable to danger. Towards the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

end of this Year, and almoſt the whole Year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<hi>George Fox</hi> and <hi>Edward Pyot,</hi> who had
been a Captain before, and a Perſon well skilled in
the Law of the Land, and could Argue well, and
<hi>William Sault,</hi> underwent an hard and troubleſom
Impriſonment at <hi>Lanceſton</hi> in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> becauſe
they had diſperſed ſome Pamphlets concerning
the Religion and Diſcipline of their Sect: For
when at every Quarter Seſſions they refuſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their Heads, and to Swear Allegiance to the
preſent Government (though they ſaid, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the ſame in their Minds, and did not ſhun
to declare it in naked works) out of a ſcrupulous
and meerly an anxious care of Conſcience, the
Judges for theſe ſlight matters commanded them as
often to be detained till the next Quarter Seſſions.
The Priſoners made grievous Complaints of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
done them by the Juſtices of that Country,
by whoſe Commands they were brought into that
place, aggravating their words and deeds above
meaſure by their captiouſneſs, calumny, and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſame. In the mean time, as if Priſon
had not been appointed for to confine Men, but to
puniſh them, the Gaoler, a mercileſs and inhumane
Wretch, that never was taught Humanity, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
converſant among Thieves, and for that reaſon
ſtigmatized, than whom there was no one fitter for
ſuch a Servile Office, did treat and entertain theſe
his Priſoners all the time in a barbarous and wicked
manner; for he did not only defraud them of Food,
and hinder their Friends to come to them, leſt they
ſhould bring them any Victuals, which might ſeem
to be the ſame thing as if he deſigned to deſtroy
them, but alſo when he was ſwoln and frantick
with Drink, would in a Rage fall upon them with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50388:70"/>
his Hands, inveigh, inſult, give them blows, and
threaten to kill them. There were many other
Quakers confined to this Priſon, ſome becauſe they
came to Viſit their Friends that were detained and
confined in this place, others becauſe they carryed
their own Prohibited Books either about them, or
gave them to others; ſome becauſe they would not
pull off their Hats with their own hands before the
Magiſtrates, for ſome of them were brought to
that paſs (but what did little agree with their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Diſcipline, ſeeing it matters not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Perſon does that himſelf, or ſuffers another
to do it) that when they did themſelves refuſe to
uncover their Heads, they did ſuffer the Officers,
Sergeants, and others to do it: And theſe Quakers
were uſed by this ſame Keeper in the ſame manner
as the reſt of them. But when theſe Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
to the Magiſtrates of their Uſage, and made
known unto them the wrongs that were done them,
and that the Keeper did not only deny the whole
thing, but brought a quite contrary Accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, as if the Priſoners ſtudied to oppreſs
and kill him and his whole Family: It was he, and
not they that was believed, and ſo he went free and
unpuniſhed, but theſe were more ſtrictly confined
and afflicted with more ſtripes, ſo that ſome of
them, beſides what they might have done through
want, the ſtench and filthineſs of other naſty and
unclean Priſoners (for it was a Common Priſon,
full of ſuch Naſtineſs, as is not to be named with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſaving your Reverence, and had not been emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
for a Year's ſpace) contracted Sickneſs through
theſe new Miſeries, and one of them, called <hi>John
Iagram,</hi> fell ſo ill, that at length he died there. At
laſt, when the Quakers complained, that the Minds
of the Magiſtrates were ſo prejudiced, that there
was no room left for their Lamentations, no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
for Truth, and that that Tormentor, the
Gaoler, dealt with them as he pleaſed; General
<hi>Desborough</hi> (by this Name alone do the Quakers,
who have compoſed this Hiſtory at large, diſtinguiſh
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50388:70"/>
and notifie the Man, being herein a little ſubtil or
civil, and officious, in that they have not rendred
the Name of a Perſon that was moſt kind to them,
and one of their Patrons, more explicitly and at
large) interpoſes himſelf for the deciſion of the
Cauſe and Controverſie in hand, and having ſearched
into all Matters relating thereunto, he ſo unravelled
the buſineſs, that it was ordered, the Quakers ſhould
not be injured nor wronged, and that they ſhould
have greater Enlargement and Freedom; and not
long after this, they were freed from their Bonds
and Miſery: But notwithſtanding the remembrance
hereof among ſo great a multitude of People,
there were not ſome wanting, who through their
Levity and Fooleries, contracted to themſelves and
the whole Society of them great Envy, Trouble,
and Affliction: For at <hi>London,</hi> on the Morning of
a certain day, there were ſome of them, but ſuch
as were of the meaner and more abject ſort, that
went half naked, and only clad with a Shirt, and
preached to the People; from whence aroſe the
Suſpicion, Fame, Diſcourſe, and Accuſation, that
the Quakers were all of them ſuch a ſort of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
naked, fantaſtical People, like unto the Old
Anabaptiſts of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and this gave cauſe and
occaſion for their being handled ſeverely more than
once, as ſuch uneaſie and turbulent Perſons. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
ſeeing there was in theſe Times not a few be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Quakers, that expected, though they ſcarce
knew what that Fifth Monarchy, and the new
Reign of Chriſt alone was, which ſhould deſtroy
all the Kingdoms of Men, and made themſelves
ready for it, and who had their Arms in a readineſs
for to Invade this Kingdom (which ſort of Men,
even our Country of <hi>Holland</hi> and Church hath ſeen
to ſpring up from it ſelf, and we do very well know
and remember it) there were alſo ſome found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Quakers, who, whether knowingly, or
unwittingly, began ſome ſuch thing as looked like
ſuch an Imperious Mode; from whence the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
were again brought under Suſpicion, that they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50388:71"/>
alſo were ſuch a ſort of Men, and hence they came
to be called, if not univerſally, yet many of them,
by the Name of <hi>Monarchical Men,</hi> and if any ſuch
thing happened amongſt them, they were ſeverely
uſed for it. And that I may ſay this by the by,
it's moſt certain that the moſt learned Men in our
Provinces have attributed and aſcribed ſuch Errors
as theſe the Quakers, and could not be driven
from it, notwithſtanding all the Endeavours of the
Quakers by word and writing to divert them from
harbouring ſuch an Opinion concerning them; but
becauſe I would paſs over ſuch Inſtances of the
Matter in hand as are of leſſer note, I would give
you a Narration of the true Hiſtory of <hi>James
Naylor,</hi> which ſome have related not as an Hiſtory,
but as a Fable, being uſed to lay hold on every
twig, and to make a ſtory of the matter: The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
happened in the Year Fifty Six, and thus it
was. <hi>Naylor</hi> had been firſt a Foot Soldier, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
an Horſeman in the Parliament's Army;
when he was weary of this ſort of Life, he began
to look about for an eaſier way of Living, and ſo
retiring to his Native City, he betook himſelf to
the Communion and Fellowſhip of the Quakers,
wherein when he had in a ſhort time, together with
great Commendations of his Knowledge, gained a
great Opinion of his Probity among his Party, he
became very dear unto all of them: But ſuch is the
Weakneſs and Imbecillity of almoſt all Men, that
after they have wiſhed for and coveted the Applauſe
and Obſervance of others, and have obtained it,
that they bear the ſame immoderately: <hi>Naylor,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he ſaw the Love and Good-will of his Party un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, was ſo much taken up with it, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued
himſelf hereupon. He was invited by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from <hi>John Stranger</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi> his Wife, as alſo
by <hi>Thomas Simonſon</hi> and his Wife <hi>Martha,</hi> to come
into the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and to dwell with them;
in which Letters they dignified him with theſe very
Elogies, which every body knows to whom, and
to whom alone they do belong; which was to this
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50388:71"/>
purpoſe, <hi>That he was the faireſt among Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
the only begotten Son of God, the Prophet of
the moſt High, the King and Judge of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Son of Righteouſneſs, the Prince of Peace,
Jeſus, in whom was the hope of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Naylor</hi> with
a few Friends go on Horſeback towards <hi>Briſtol;</hi>
and ſo theſe Friends coming to hear of his Journey
and Approach, as did alſo ſome other Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
they, while the reſt waited for him in the
City, and in their Houſes, go out of the City full
of Joy and Gladneſs for to meet him, ſome on
Horſeback, and others on Foot, and ſo marching both
before and behind him on foot, bring him into the
City; thoſe Women which I have named before,
as alſo <hi>Dorcas Erbury,</hi> ſpreading part of their
Clothes on the way, and crying aloud, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Sentence, which the Multitude uſed as the
Scripture witneſſeth, to our Saviour, as he entred
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Hoſanna <hi>to the Son of</hi> David, <hi>bleſſed is
he that cometh in the Name of the Lord;</hi> as alſo, The
<hi>Holy Jehovah and Lord of Hoſts;</hi> while one of their
Fraternity, <hi>Jurian Witgorley</hi> by Name, was in the
mean time chiding and blaming of the reſt of them
for their Ignorance and Folly, in worſhipping of
the Man; <hi>Naylor</hi> being thus accompany'd, is brought
into the City, and goes into the Houſe of two Men,
who were already before entred into his Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and Society; there manifold Honours are done
him by the whole Company, and <hi>Ann Stranger</hi> with
a few more, being forward to do their utmoſt in
Entertaining of the Man, fall down before him,
and ſtretching out their hands in a ſuppliant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to his Feet, kiſs them; all which doings <hi>Naylor</hi>
was ſo far from rejecting, that he took much Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
therein. When theſe things were known through
the City, and that a Concourſe of People came to
the Houſe from all parts of the Town, there were
Perſons forthwith ſent by the Mayor, who hal'd
<hi>Naylor</hi> to Priſon, as contemning the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which muſt not go unpuniſhed, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
Novelty, and carrying the marks and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50388:72"/>
ſemblance thereof before him. And that I may
paſs over what intervened between, I ſhall rehearſe
briefly what followed: <hi>Naylor</hi> was ſent to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
who appointed a Committee to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
into the matter. <hi>Naylor</hi> being ſummoned
to Anſwer for himſelf, and asked concerning the
Epiſtles and Titles aſcribed unto him in them, as
alſo concerning the Submiſſion and Supplication of
the Women to him, being not willing to deny the
Fact, he conſtantly and boldly anſwered as to the
way and manner how theſe things might be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to him, to wit, not as he was a Creature,
but as Chriſt dwelt in him, and maintained that
God had ſo far enjoyned thoſe Perſons to do it, and
that he had permitted the ſame to be done to him;
theſe things being over, the Committee bring him
in Guilty in their Report to the Parliament, which
when they had expended the matter again with
great care and diligence, they adjudged <hi>Naylor</hi> to
be guilty of great Blaſphemy againſt God, and of
Seducing Men, and ordered the Puniſhment of ſuch
Wickedneſs in this manner: <hi>Naylor</hi> was brought
into the <hi>New Palace-Yard</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there
aloft ſet in the Pillory, ſo as he might be ſeen of all
that were there, for the ſpace of two hours, and
then he was from thence carryed to the <hi>Old Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi>
and between both the places was well whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
and then two days after, was in this ſame
place Pillory'd again for ſo many hours as before,
and had his Tongue bored through with an hot
Iron, and his Forehead marked with the Letter <hi>B.</hi>
as a Mark and Teſtimony that might always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
there of his Blaſphemy; and after he had
been thus handled at <hi>London,</hi> he was ſent to <hi>Briſtol,</hi>
and there in the open Market-place ſet on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
but with his Face to the Horſes Tail, naked,
and whipped alſo as before; and at length after all,
was carryed again to <hi>London,</hi> and there committed
to <hi>Bridewel,</hi> where, if he was minded to eat, he
was obliged to earn it with his own hands: He had
the firſt day of his Whipping three hundred laſhes
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50388:72"/>
given him, and them ſo ſeverely, that his Sides and
all his Waſte was ſo ſlaſhed and torn, that his
Bowels did almoſt guſh out; for that very day
wherein <hi>Naylor</hi> ſuffered his Puniſhment, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
of ſeveral Counties had put up their Petitions
to the Parliament, that the Quakers might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,
as moſt troubleſom and intolerable, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they were, whitherſoever they came, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
all places. On the contrary, many of <hi>Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>'s
ſtedfaſt Friends in this uncertain Affair Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Parliament on the ſame day, that they
would be pleaſed to remit what remained yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
of their Sentence, in reſpect to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Naylor:</hi> And thus far they did prevail,
that the Puniſhment he was to ſuffer the next day,
ſhould be protracted. The Parliament ſent to
<hi>Naylor</hi> five Miniſters, one of which was <hi>Edward
Reynolds,</hi> afterwards the Famous Biſhop of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
to ſound his Mind, and to induce him to
confeſs and acknowledge his Offence, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
it, but he with the ſame Conſtancy and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
as he had uſed before in making his Defence,
did now alſo perſevere in his Opinion; from whence
when he might otherwiſe have procured Favour in
the ſight of the Houſe, he was now by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ordered to ſuffer the remainder of his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
while theſe things were tranſacted, there
were ſome of <hi>Naylor</hi>'s Friends, both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who were puniſhed with Impriſonment at
<hi>Exeter,</hi> becauſe that all of them, as <hi>Naylor</hi> had
done, endeavoured to divert the Crime laid to their
Charge with their frivolous Excuſes and Exceptions.
But to return to <hi>Naylor,</hi> the ſecond time that he
ſtood in the Pillory, one <hi>Robert Rich,</hi> from among
the great multitude of Spectators, who was a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Friend of <hi>Naylor</hi>'s, with two Women, get up
to him, and ſtand about him; then <hi>Rich</hi> pulled a
Paper out of his Boſom, and ſet it upon his Head,
wherein was written theſe words, <hi>This is the King
of the Jews. Rich</hi> being thruſt from that place
with the Women who were his Companions in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50388:73"/>
that mad Prank, when <hi>Naylor</hi> was ſtigmatized with
an hot Iron in the Forehead, and not running of
his own accord, but haled, held <hi>Naylor</hi> with his
hand while the Brand was a doing, and preſently
after licks the Wound with his Tongue, as if it had
been ſome Sacred and Religious thing; though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Naylor</hi> always excuſed himſelf herein, that
he did nothing to an ill intent and purpoſe, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to be done unto him; but did always, and
particularly then, when that was done unto him,
condemn him for his Folly, that he had ſo much
vain and fooliſh Honour done him by the People,
and that he ſuffered juſtly and deſervedly for that
Crime and Offence, and acknowledged that he was
under the Vindictive hand of God for it; and 'tis
a wonderful thing that amidſt ſo many, and ſuch
great Torments, he was not heard to pour out the
leaſt ſigh or groan: Beſides, while all theſe things
were doing, many of the Quakers ſent Letters daily
to <hi>Naylor,</hi> and did inceſſantly rebuke him, that he
would be ſo audacious, as to do ſuch a Wickedneſs,
and to adviſe and exhort him, that he would do
his utmoſt to correct and amend his Fault, and at
length forſake it. Though either theſe very Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
or others of that Society, did again as well as
<hi>Naylor,</hi> defend all that was done of <hi>Naylor,</hi> by
publick Papers, and concerning <hi>Naylor</hi> by his
Friends, and for this purpoſe they alledged divers
Sayings and Examples of the Holy Scripture, and
would adapt them for the Proof hereof. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Naylor</hi> did continue all the remainder of his
days in the ſame manner affected towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of the Quakers, and alſo wrote Books, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he endeavoured to promote his and their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
among other People. I have ſaid before, that
<hi>George Fox</hi> and his Followers were clapped up in
Priſon, and detained there for a long time, becauſe of
their publiſhing and diſperſing of their Libels and
Pamphlets among the Common People: <hi>Fox</hi> in
another Pamphlet did ſo clear himſelf of all Crime
herein, that he affirmed, that there was nothing elſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50388:73"/>
taught in thoſe Pamphlets, but that it was the Duty
of all Men aright to conſider the Light that ſhone
in their Conſciences; and that he might extenuate
the Suſpicion had of them, he ſo exaggerates and
amplifies their Sufferings, as if the cry of his and
his Friends Blood reached up even as far as Heaven,
and drew on the Anger and Vengeance of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
upon them for it. Juſt at this time, when
<hi>Fox</hi> was not yet ſet free from his Impriſonment and
the Afflictions he complained of, which he cryed
out were ſo hard, and not to be endured, came a
Pamphlet abroad at <hi>London,</hi> without any Name
indeed to it, yet without all doubt <hi>George Fox</hi> was
the Author thereof. That Libel opened and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
the cauſes why, and for which the Quakers
ought to refuſe, deny, and reject theſe Earthly
Teachers, by whom they meant the Miniſters of
the Publick Churches: The Author did in that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
blame and accuſe all Paſtors and Teachers upon
the ſame foot without diſtinction, as of other
Vices, ſo of Falſity, Deceivings, Frauds, Lyes, in
as much as that they purſued Lyes for Gain or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and for Covetouſneſs ſake brought Men to
their bow with hypocritical words, and adulterated
the Holy Scriptures; yea, that they were guilty of
Enchantment, Magick, and Necromancy. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer
ought to have a good Memory, and take heed,
leſt while he is falſly and fooliſhly Accuſing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
he do give occaſion for himſelf to be derided
of Men, and be very nigh a-kin to the very ſame
Crime he lays to their charge. The thing it ſelf
manifeſts that the Author of this Libel had an evil
purpoſe therein, in that they alſo blamed, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
carped at theſe things in their Adverſaries,
becauſe they ſaid, that the Goſpels of <hi>Matthew, Mark,
Luke,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> were the Goſpel; that they ſaid,
the Goſpel was light, the Scripture ſaying, that
Chriſt was the Light; the Apoſtle taught, that the
Bodies of Believers were the Temples of God, and
of the Holy Spirit, but that they taught, that thoſe
Temples were Steeple-Houſes, and material Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50388:74"/>
which were made of Stone and Wood; and
many ſuch things there were, not ſpoken, but writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
cunningly for to ſtir up the ignorant Multitude,
and provoke Men of a wicked and evil Diſpoſition
by theſe Practices, which were not much different
from a Malignant Spirit, and flagitious luſt of
Mind, or furious Rage and Madneſs; and thus did
theſe Men again and again ſtir up the Envy, Wrath,
and Hatred of their Adverſaries. Moreover, ſeeing
that the ſame Men, eſpecially being encited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by theſe Heralds and Enticers, did not only
not ceaſe, but went on more and more in their raſh
ways, and inconſiderate boldneſs, not only to Preach
about, and to direct their Diſcourſes to People in
the Markets, and ſuch like places, but alſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
the Miniſters Preaching in the Churches,
with their inveighing Interruptions and Bablings,
or afterwards to make a noiſe, excuſing themſelves
at the ſame time, according to their uſual manner,
with this one Sentence conſtantly, That they were
excited by the Spirit hereunto. Hence all ſorts of
Men increaſed in Indignation and Bitterneſs againſt
them, and Severity in Puniſhing of them. This
happened from the Year Fifty Six, for the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Years. For ſo indeed it came to paſs, that
not only they who ſpoke what they pleaſed in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
places, but even they alſo who were not wont
to go hear the Sermons uſually preached in the
Churches, or had Sermons of their own in their
own Houſes, were ſome of them fined, ſome caſt
into Priſon, ſome whipped, and then forbid their
Homes, and thruſt into Baniſhment, of whom
ſome were ſo ſtiff and obſtinate, being as it were
Conquerors over Fear and Pain, that they returned
again (one was <hi>George Bayley,</hi> who came back
twice) who were as often whipped for the ſame;
the ſame was done in the Towns of <hi>Sherborn, Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horton,
&amp;c.</hi> and in <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> the chief Town of
the County it ſelf. The Quakers wrote, that the
Miniſters of the Churches themſelves did not only
in their Sermons that were adapted to ſtir up and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50388:74"/>
inflame the People, excite the Magiſtrates, and
more eſpecially the credulous and headlong Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
ſo far, as that they ſhould either drive away the
Quakers, or hinder them to hold their Meetings,
but alſo that they did come themſelves among thoſe
that were armed, for to diſturb their Meetings, as
well among the Publick Guard as the Promiſcuous
Multitude; but there are no deeds ſo much noted
and enlarged upon by them in all the Monuments
of their Writings, as thoſe done by the Scholars
and Students of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> againſt
them: If the Quakers did at any time enter into
the Churches, they fell upon and ſeverely treated
them for their boldneſs in coming to the ſight of
thoſe Youths, who were themſelves moſt bold and
ready for all wanton tricks. As often as the Quakers
held their Conventicles, and that it came to the
Ears of theſe Students, they flew thither, and hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d
and thruſt the Men out of Doors, and there toſſed
them backward and forward, and tormented them
all the ways they could; but if they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
get in, they broke the Doors and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
but when they could not, or would not do
that, they ſtood about the Houſe, and there recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them as they came out as before; and this alſo
was a ſmall matter with them; there were ſome of
them who were furniſhed with Pipes and Tobacco
(an Herb well known, and ſo called from him who
firſt ſhewed the uſe of it) and Ale, of which they
themſelves did not only ſip often, but alſo reached
the ſame to the Quakers, and upon their refuſing
thereof, yea, ſaying nothing at all to the matter,
and as it were ſilently ſipping up and digeſting all
that Affliction, they poured the Drink down the
Throats of the People, and upon their Cloaths,
ſtruck them, pulled them by the Noſe, and tore
their Beards, that they might force them to ſpeak
ſomething to them. But theſe vile doings were
yet but little in their Eyes; there were ſome of
them, who run upon, and trod them under their
Feet, who diſcharged Muskets at them, and threw
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50388:75"/>
Squibs and Serpents, as they call them, which flew
and burnt their Cloaths where ever they touched
them; others brought Maſtiff Dogs with them,
and ſet them on, not only to bark at the People,
but to fly at them, and bite them; ſome of them
when they went away, took the mens Goods along
with them, and when the Quakers made Complaint
of theſe Miſchiefs and Injuries done them to their
Tutors and Profeſſors, they were deaf to them,
and took them but as ſo many Tales told them.
And indeed they ſuffered ſuch great and ſo many
Evils, that unleſs theſe Men had written concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame openly to the World, and that none
did ever refel and confute what was written by
them hereupon, they could not be believed: Such
things alſo as theſe, they complained were done
unto them by the Students in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and this
they ſet forth in Print. While theſe things were
tranſacted, <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> died, being the Year
One Thouſand Six Hundred Fifty and Eight, on
the Third Day of <hi>September,</hi> at Three of the Clock
in the Afternoon, of a Tertian Ague, after he had
had a ſevere Fit of it. This Man had the boldneſs
to arrogate to himſelf ſo great a Power in all the
three Kingdoms, that of Old were eſteemed to be
another World, that all things were governed and
managed according to his Pleaſure alone, having
rejected the Name of King, and aſſuming that of
Protector, that he himſelf might be the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
from all Hatred and Envy. Under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of whoſe Son <hi>Richard,</hi> which was but
very ſhort, and not managed with that Induſtry
as his Father had done, nor adminiſtred with that
Moderation that he ſhewed, ſo as that neither his
Authority had leſſened the Peoples Love to him,
nor the Favour of the People his Gravity, the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
Affairs begun daily to grow worſe and worſe,
while both on the one ſide and the other the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
were hurried on with greater boldneſs; and
thoſe who oppoſed, with greater Cruelty. And
ſeeing there are very many Inſtances extant, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50388:75"/>
ſuch as are very memorable, yet becauſe we would
ſhun ſatiety, and that I find the ſame creeping on,
I ſhall diſpatch the matter in a few words. Seeing
there were now more Perſons among the Quakers
than before, who uttered their vain Ribaldry and
Bablings, even in the Churches, and while the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
were in the midſt of their Sermons, ſo there
were alſo other Men that were more animated and
forward to do nothing with Deliberation, ſo that
the Quakers for that reaſon were much more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
puniſhed, eſpecially in <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſome parts
of <hi>Pembrokeſhire.</hi> There was at <hi>London</hi> a certain
Man, whoſe Name was <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> a Man void,
not of Underſtanding, but of all Shame and Fear,
who began ſuch a deed, that it's very ſtrange that
the ſame Quaker himſelf ſhould be willing to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
it, and put the matter beyond all doubt, and
maintain it beſides in the very ſame Pamphlet, and
thereby ſhew that no Fact can be feigned, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo fooliſh and raſh, which ſome would not at
leaſt do, and not commend as a right and laudable
thing, to be committed againſt thoſe whom they
ſo much complained of, in reſpect to the wrongs
and injuries done unto them. I ſhall take the thing
from the beginning: This Man was a Muſician, and
could Sing and Play very well, having been Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in this Art and Science by his Father and
Grandfather, and did by it maintain both himſelf
and his Family very genteelly and plentifully: It
was believed he could Yearly by Teaching of others,
and by Playing, get no leſs than Two Hundred
Pounds <hi>Sterling.</hi> But he had a mind to change
this ſort of Life, and to get into the Fellowſhip of
the Quakers, and ſo experience another way of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
and ſo he firſt ſells his Books, and all his Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
Inſtruments at a great rate, as being now uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and noxious to him; but afterwards bethink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf, that they might be hurtful to others
as well as to him, and that he ought not, if he
could avoid it, ſuffer any to be injured at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of his Profit and Conveniency, he buys them
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50388:76"/>
back again of thoſe to whom he had Sold them,
for the ſame Money, and when he had ſo done, he
gathered them all together, and goes with them
directly to <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> and having there ſet up a
Pile of Wood, and fired it at Noon day, he does in
the ſight of many People commit to the Flames,
and burn all theſe Excellent and Precious Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Books altogether, as being a means to
draw Men to be idle, to promote a Laſcivious Life,
and as ſtings to their Luſts, and commands all Men
to take Pattern by him, and ſhun and curſe all ſuch
vain and profane Arts. So great was the Zeal of
this Man for his new Religion, and ſo great was his
Anger and the fervour of his Mind againſt the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Religion of the Kingdom, that he could not
forbear, but muſt go upon every new, bold, and
raſh Act, whereof above others this is a moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Inſtance.</p>
                     <p>When the People were met together in <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manbury</hi>
Church, for to Celebrate the Lord's Supper,
this Man came thither, having furniſhed himſelf
firſt with a Sack full of Shooe-maker's Ware, ſo
that now from a Muſician he was turned Shooe-maker,
and partly a Cobler, to that end that he
might go into the Church, and there in the croud,
before that the Miniſter had got into the Pulpit,
might Act ſomewhat of the part of a Shooe-maker:
And ſo that he might not be put out, he had taken
care to get very timely and ſecretly into the Church,
and hid himſelf there in ſome place. Afterward
when they were ſinging of Pſalms, he ruſhes up,
and draws nigh unto the Table, and ſtood with
his Hat on, looking about to ſee how he might get
up into the Pulpit; but when he could not find a
way to it, he determines with himſelf to get up to
the top of the Altar, and there to do his buſineſs;
but as the croud was alſo here in his way and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
him, and that he in the mean time was
diligently conſidering of every thing about him,
and ſtanding all the time with his Hat on, while
all the reſt were ſinging, ſome of them when the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50388:76"/>
Pſalm was ended take his Hat off his Head, and
deliver it into his Hand: He put it on again; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pulls him by the Hair, and takes it off a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time; then comes the Clerk, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his Refractorineſs and Contempt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
things, leads him away gently; but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
and being much aſſured that the Spirit of
God would have him do this, he had contrived and
projected, ſeeing he had failed of his purpoſe this
day, returns thither the next Lord's Day, fully
animated, as he thought, with Divine and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Zeal, and when he was now come nigh, and that
the Miniſter was going up into the Pulpit, he drives
forwards, and being as it were ſtung with Fury,
ruſhed headlong over the Peoples Seats, and briskly
gets up into the Pulpit, pulls out his Shooe-maker's
Tools, and begins to ſow: Upon which comes up
a ſtrong hardy Man, and thruſts the Beaſt down,
where being received by many below better than he
deſerved, does notwithſtanding ſtruggle and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to get up again into the ſame place, until
at length being driven out of the Church, after he
had been ſufficiently inſulted over by the Boys, and
received ſome blows, he was carryed before the
Lord Mayor, who orders him, as being an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch notorious Impieties, and come not
from the dregs of the People, but from an Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtye,
and fit for ſuch a place, into ſuch another,
and as being unworthy the uſe of the Light, there
to be kept in Chains and Darkneſs. I ſhall ſay more
of this Man in another place. And now ſeeing
that in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and every where elſe,
the Quakers Meetings were forbid, and conſtantly
hindered, as is wont to be done to ſuch Conventicles,
the Soldiers did many times, being accompanied
with the next Neighbours, between whom other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
there is no ſtrict Union and Conjunction
commonly in <hi>England,</hi> break into the Quakers
Houſes, even when they were gathered together in
a Religious manner, and without fraud, and took
and carryed away ſome of them, ſpoiled others of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50388:77"/>
their Cloaths, others they punched, beat, and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the hair of the Head, and handled ſome
of them in ſuch a manner, that they ſeemed to be
left for dead by them. A great many Men with a
multitude of Boys got together at a place called
<hi>Sabridford</hi> in <hi>Hereſordſhire,</hi> and twice ſet upon the
Quakers, while they were peaceably attending at
their Devotion, and beſides the opprobrious words
they uſed to them, added all the Obſcenity and
Wickedneſs almoſt that could be: For they broke
the Windows, Walls, and Poſts of the Door, laid
hold on the Men, threw Stones at them, ſtinking
rotten Eggs, Dirt, and even Humane Excrements,
which Men do not care to ſee, much leſs to handle,
riſted them, and rent and tore their Cloaths, and
tormented them other ways. And when the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
alledged theſe things, and made them plainly
to appear before the Magiſtrates, they complained
that there were none of thoſe Rioters either called,
much leſs made an Example of. Such things might
be daily ſeen, not only in ſome, but in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
but while theſe things were doing, theſe Men
ſuppoſing that their Complaints would be to no
purpoſe before theſe Inferiour Magiſtrates, they
Addreſs themſelves to the Supream Aſſembly of the
Nation, and ſet forth in their Petitions, That for
ſix Years laſt paſt, there were within the Kingdom
of <hi>England,</hi> above a Thouſand and Nine Hundred
Perſons of their Society ſhut up in Priſons, and
that there were yet this Year an Hundred and Forty
of them ſo confined, and that One and Twenty
had died there, adding the Names of each of them
withal, the places where they ſuffered, and the
cauſes for which every one ſuffered; in demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of which they could not yet leave off their
old way of Accuſation, as well by concealing the
greater Crimes, and more notorious Offences that
had brought many of them under ſuch Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as by aggravating and exaggerating too much
the many lighter Evils which they ſuffered, and
often-times taking and amplifying a light Scratch,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50388:77"/>
a Pinch, and blue Spot, for a grievous Torment,
and bloody Wound; which two things ſeem to me
may be well obſerved in moſt of the Monuments
which theſe Men have left of their Sufferings, for
indeed I cannot allow that theſe Authors have been
ſo often uſed by their Adverſaries (as they ſay) ſo
as that they were left for half dead, for no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
can be produced by them of any of their
Deaths the ſame moment, or in a ſhort time after,
and when all of them, even then when they are at
beſt, ſeem to be half dead, and without their Senſes;
nor this, that they ſhould ſo often ſpeak looſely
and ambiguouſly, and uſe thoſe Forms, to which
their Caſes and Law-Suits are accommodated, which
they themſelves alſo underſtand to be the Gins and
Snares of the Fact and Law, and which <hi>George Fox</hi>
in ſuch caſes as theſe calls huge Monſters, whoſe
Mouths are as wide as Hell: It is a much greater
ſign of Community and Communion, to make the
Misfortunes of our Enemies one with our own,
and to look upon their Calamities as if they befel
our ſelves; but ſeeing that in time ſome out of ſuch
a Number of the Quakers as were ſhut up in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
by reaſon of the languiſhing of their Bodies,
could not hold out as they would, and others grew
very ſick, and beſides very low in their Spirits, when
this came to be known among all the other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
every one began to look upon, and take care,
not ſo much of himſelf as of another and the whole
Society, and ſo every one offered himſelf, if it
might be allowed, to go and Ranſom thoſe ſick and
infirm Friends and Companions from that wretched
place, and to become Priſoners in their room; and
having at a certain time reſolved hereupon, an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and Sixty Four of theſe Men, of their own
accord, and without being ſtirred thereunto by
other Exhortations, go all together to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Preſent this Humble Petition unto them,
drawn by <hi>George Fox,</hi> (who was not yet himſelf
one of theſe Sureties) in this rude ſtyle, many of
them at the ſame time ſpeaking to him againſt it,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50388:78"/>
and deſiring that ſome Words and Sentences therein
might be amended (which was told me by a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Man among, and one that was of the number
of thoſe Sureties) and after it was written down as
he dictated, they ſubſcribed every one their Names
to it. <hi>Friends, You that are called the Parliament of
this Nation, we, out of the Love we bear to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that are in Priſons, Bridewels, and Iron Chains,
beaten ſeverely by mercileſs Officers, fined, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
to Death, and dying in their Impriſonments,
ſeeing that now many of them lie ſick, lying upon
Straw, we give up our ſelves and ours unto you, that
you may ſhut up us like Sheep in the Priſons, Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels,
Litter, and Sinks of thoſe our Brethren, and
we are ready as ſo many Sacrifices to go into their
places, out of the Love which we bear unto them, for
we cannot chooſe but be ready to lay down our Lives
for our Brethren, and take thoſe Torments upon our
ſelves, which you have prepared for them; neither
can we, when our Brethren ſuffer, chooſe but feel our
ſelves the ſame thing, even as Chriſt has ſaid, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
and was afflicted; and this indeed is our Love
towards God, and Chriſt, and our Brethren, which
we owe both to them, and to our Enemies, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the lovers of your Souls, and of your Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and if ye will take our Bodies, which we
offer for our Brethren, who are Impriſoned becauſe
they have preached the Truth in many places, refuſed
to pay Tythes, met together in the fear of God, have
not ſworn, ſtood with their Hats on, becauſe they have
been looked upon as Vagabonds, when they have gone to
viſit their Friends, and ſuch like; we whoſe Names
are under written, wait for your Anſwer in the great
Hall of</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>to the end we may be ſatisfied
in this our deſire, and manifeſt our Love to our Friends,
and remove the Judgment and Vengeance that hangs
over our Enemies.</hi> The Parliament did indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
this Petition, but ſeeing theſe Men were affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with ſo much Pity and Concern for the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of their Friends, and that they themſelves were
ſo nearly touched with a ſenſe of ſo many Evils
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50388:78"/>
and Miſeries, it had this further Effect, that other
Men ſeeing ſuch great Affection of Heart between
them, and ſo great Courage and Conſtancy in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Miſeries, they began to judge more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of them, and many daily joyned themſelves to
their Society and Community. Moreover, what
theſe Petitioners and Deprecators of theſe Miſeries
and Dangers complained of in this their Humble
Petition to the Parliament, as alſo in that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
a little before concerning their Brethren,
that there was ſo many of them ſhut up in Priſons,
and that ſome of them were ſo ſeverely and hardly
uſed, ſome periſhed under the weight and preſſure
of their Afflictions, was ſo true, that there was
ſcarce any Common Gaol, or ſuch like places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Felons and Criminals were kept, which could not
very manifeſtly bear Teſtimony to the Complaints
of theſe Men. Now, for the remainder of the Year
Sixty, until King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second his Coming
in, theſe Men had no better Fortune; for during
that time the Soldiers in many Countries, following
the heels of their Commanders, break into the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of theſe Men, whilſt they kept their Meetings,
and drive them out with Muskets and Swords, in
ſome places diſcharging their Muskets upon them,
and wounding them, or ſtruck them with their
Hands, and kicked them, or pulled them by the
hair of the Head, and ſometimes after they had ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them out of their Houſes, drove them into the
Water. Sometimes the Soldiers came alone, and
being asked, by whoſe Command they came, and
what Authority they had? And anſwering, That
their Warrant was in their Pockets, they fell upon
them, and did them violence, ranſacked all things,
or took them away, and turned them to their own
Uſe, though many times it was but little, that theſe
Burglars and Sharers carryed away, though they
did not only not ſpare the Houſhold Goods of the
richer ſort, but alſo ſeized upon whatever they had
in their Poſſeſſion of other things, ſeeing they had
moſtly nothing of their own, but what was neceſſary
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50388:79"/>
for daily uſe for the ſupport of their Bodies. The
Students in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> had not
yet ſufficiently inſulted over, and exerciſed their
Rage againſt the Quakers; they therefore at this
time reaſſumed their former Licentiouſneſs, Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs,
and Impudence, and did not alone, but
accompanied with the Populacy and meaner ſort
of People, that are ready for all audacious, facinorous
and vile doings ſeveral times, but more eſpecially
thrice break into the Quakers Meeting, and Aſſault
them, after they had broke the Locks and Doors
with great Hammers, and break all things with their
Hands and Feet to pieces, frighten ſome of the Men
away, uſe others baſely, and throw Dirt and ſuch
like filth in their Faces, beat others with ſticks tear
their Cloaths, prick and wound them with Knives,
till the Blood guſhed out, others they haled cruelly
by the hair of the Head, and having ſo done, let
them down and ſoaked them in Ditches, and the
Kennels of the Streets; neither did they ſpare any
of them, had no regard to any Age, nor Sex, nor
Degrees of Men, for when an Alderman came to
them the ſecond time they were engaged in this
Work, to hinder them to proceed, they thruſt him
into the Water-courſe of the City, and abuſed not
the Man only, but the Dignity alſo; and ſo the laſt
time, when ſome of the Juſtices of the Peace diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
them from ſuch Practices in the King's
Name (becauſe the King ſome days before had been
Proclaimed publickly) and that others alſo ſtood
by, and urged them to deſiſt, they for all that go
on. There were beſides at this time alſo many of
theſe Men by the Magiſtrates Command haled from
the Conventicles, and ſhut up in Priſons, whipped,
and ſent into Baniſhment, as wicked Men and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds,
from which People they thought their
preſent Danger might ariſe. In the mean time the
Soldiers, which were thus placed every where in
Garriſon, or wandered up and down the Country,
that the Quakers could reſide no where but as it
were within their Camps, did ſo Ravage theſe Men
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50388:79"/>
at their pleaſure, that no Perſon, nor Houſe, nor
Goods could be ſafe, nothing ſo well fortified and
defended, that was not expoſed to their Fury, and
became a Prey to their Rage. And the Quakers
made no leſs Complaint of the Officers than they
did of the Soldiers, becauſe they did not reſtrain
their Inſolence, and puniſh them for their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
but they did more eſpecially complain of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Lambert,</hi> whom, they ſaid, was a great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to their Sect. Which Perſon however ſome
Years after, when we went to viſit in the Company
of an Honourable Perſon, being then kept a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in a certain Caſtle in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> we
found he was not ſo averſe to the Sect of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
and ſuch ſort of Men. All ſorts of Men, both
learned and unlearned, had to this time written
and publiſhed Books and Pamphlets againſt the
Quakers; all theſe, which were an Hundred and
Fifteen in all, <hi>Fox</hi> in the Year Fifty Nine gathered
together, and digeſted in Order into one Book, and
did partly refute them, and ſcoffed at the reſt, as
being ſome of them not written in any ſerious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
At the ſame time the Quakers put out a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
wherein they recounted, what every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Publick Church throughout <hi>England</hi>
had done againſt every one of their Society, how
they had handled them, with the Name and Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
of every one of them, at what time <hi>George
Monk,</hi> General of all the Armies of <hi>Britain,</hi> put
an end to this Evil by a Proclamation, that none
ſhould injure the Quakers, provided they demeaned
themſelves dutifully towards the Common-wealth;
I have given an Account of the Afflictions and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
of theſe Men in <hi>England,</hi> and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
various Inſtances of every kind concerning
their Troubles; and now theſe Quakers ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> behaving themſelves here as in all
other places where they came, being often-times very
vexatious and troubleſom in the Publick Meetings
and Converſations of Men, in the Markets, in the
Churches, and that either before, or after, or while
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50388:80"/>
they were at their Solemn Prayers and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
neither did they only confound Speakers and
Hearers, and made them diſſatisfied with their
Meeting together, or exerciſe of their Religion, but
as often as they were taken, and did not beg Pardon
for the fault committed, they were handled in the
ſame manner as they had been in <hi>England,</hi> many
of them being Impriſoned, ſome whipped, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
baniſhed: This was a thing very ſingular and
ſtrange in this Country, and among this Nation;
there was a Law made at <hi>Glaſcow</hi> in the General
Aſſembly, that no Quaker ſhould be cheriſhed and
relieved by any Member of the Reformed Church,
and that no Perſon ſhould have any Commerce
with them, or make uſe of their Labour, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them, under the Penalty of being Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated;
and by this means theſe wretched People
were forced to ſeek for other, though uncertain,
Abodes, or elſe to periſh through extream want.
Notwithſtanding which Law, which the Quakers
cryed, was by no means made with a Chriſtian
Temper, but was a barbarous Rite, and the Effects
of Cruelty, when their Affairs ſeemed to have been
brought to the utmoſt danger, they did ſo ſtruggle
with theſe Difficulties, that they even increaſed in
Number day by day. Neither muſt we paſs over
in ſilence, that thoſe two Men, <hi>John Swinton</hi> and
<hi>David Barclay,</hi> did at this time go off to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
who, becauſe both of them were very Famous
and Renowned, firſt, among all the <hi>Scots,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
among the Quakers, I cannot paſs it over,
but muſt here inſiſt a little upon it. <hi>John Swinton</hi>
was of a good Family, and at firſt well deſerving
of the Common-wealth, having his Name from
the Place whereof he was Lord; when King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second fled from <hi>England,</hi> and was received and
crowned by the <hi>Scots,</hi> this <hi>Swinton</hi> was a Member
of the General Aſſembly then, as alſo of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and then it was that the ſaid King Solemnly
ſwore, he would preſerve the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>
as then eſtabliſhed inviolable; but when the King
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50388:80"/>
afterward changed his Faith, and endeavoured to
promote the Function and Rule of Biſhops, and
that now both Nations were at deadly and Inteſtine
Wars one with another, and that the Members in
Parliament took into Deliberation what they ſhould
do with the King, <hi>Swinton</hi> ſaid, it was his Opinion,
that they ſhould reject the King's Intereſt, and be
at Peace and Amity with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by which
Speech when <hi>Swinton</hi> found that he had much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated
the Minds of all of them, and being
afraid of the Danger, withdraws from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and with all Expedition flies to his Eſtate in
the Country, which was not far from the Frontiers
of <hi>England,</hi> and cunningly contrives it, that he had
fallen into the hands of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers; theſe
carry him to <hi>London:</hi> when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the <hi>Scots,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament appoint
this Man, that was ſo Faithful to their Church and
Country, together with others, to Govern the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But while <hi>Swinton</hi> tarryed at
<hi>London</hi> he contracted Acquaintance and Familiarity
with the Quakers, and afterward became of their
Society: When the King was reſtored and come
over, <hi>Swinton,</hi> who was then at <hi>London,</hi> though
he was not ignorant how angry the King was
with him, yet he ſtaid there, truſting to a good
Conſcience, that he had diſcharged his Duty to the
Publick without any private Enmity againſt the
King. There the King Commands him to be ſeized
and carryed into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the end that he
might be put to Death; when he was brought
before the Parliament, and being allowed the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to defend himſelf, he did ſo Plead his own
Caſe, and by his Eloquence allay the Anger and
Fury of all the Members, that they did acquit him
from his Capital Crime, and only confined him
Priſoner to the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for ſome Years. <hi>David Barclay</hi> was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and deſcended from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Illuſtrious Family of the <hi>Barclays,</hi> of
which theſe Men have not only reported of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50388:81"/>
but it has alſo been aſſerted by others, that they
have not only proceeded from ſo Noble, Great, and
Ancient a Stock, but alſo that they were a-kin to
the Royal Family; this ſame Gentleman uſing his
Nobleneſs not for a Veil to Sloath and Idleneſs,
but as fewel and an incitative to Induſtry and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
after he had from his Childhood given himſelf
up to the Exerciſe of the Liberal Arts and Sciences,
and finding that in the doubtful Affairs of his
Country he could not find room for his Studies, he
betook himſelf to the <hi>German</hi> Wars, and was firſt
a Captain in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army, and in ſome time
came to be a Colonel; but after that the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
had enforced their Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to his own Country, and he is together with
<hi>Swinton</hi> and other Nobles appointed for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernance
of it; and is ſent for to <hi>London,</hi> that he
might be preſent at the making and eſtabliſhing
of the League between both Kingdoms; but in
proceſs of time, when King <hi>Charles</hi> was reſtored,
he is committed Priſoner to the Caſtle of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
to his old Friend <hi>Swinton,</hi> and not long after
gave himſelf over in Company with <hi>Swinton</hi> to the
Sect of the Quakers; this <hi>David Barclay</hi> was the
Father of <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> who if not the only, yet
was the moſt memorable of the Latin Writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all the Quakers. In <hi>Ireland, Howgil</hi> and
<hi>Burroughs,</hi> the fore-runners of this Sect, were ſent
back from <hi>Cork</hi> into <hi>England</hi> by the Command of
<hi>Henry Cromwel,</hi> who then governed that Kingdom
by the Title of Lord-Deputy; and when after they
were gone, <hi>Ames</hi> took upon him to propagate Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm
in that City, he was alſo thrown into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
from whence being afterwards ſet at Liberty,
and ſeeing he could not forbear, but muſt ſpeak
openly in the Church againſt the Preacher, he was
again clap'd up in the ſame place; from which
place, when he wrote a Letter to Colonel <hi>Henry
Ingoldsby,</hi> who was Governour of that ſame City,
and under whom he was a Soldier, and endeavoured
to make his Defence, and procure his Liberty, he
was indeed brought before him; but he was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50388:81"/>
and without any delay, in the preſence of all
that were there, according to the Military Practice
of ſome Men, ſo beaten and kick'd by the Colonel
himſelf, becauſe he ought above any other to have
deſiſted from ſuch doings and practices, as he had
then taken upon him, that he made him bleed, and
then was ſent back to his old Priſon, and tyed Neck
and Heels there. But as there were many of <hi>Ames</hi>'s
fellow Soldiers, and alſo other Soldiers, who by
little and little became of the Quakers Sect; ſeveral
of them having taken Counſel together, and allotted
their Work, did either uſe their babling Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Publick Aſſemblies, while they were at
Prayer or Preaching, or fell a Trembling there, or
ſhewed ſome ſuch idle and fooliſh Prank; this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
was followed by many others, both of the
one and of the other Sex, wherefore they were ever
and anon, one after another, fined, driven to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and in ſome places miſerably harraſſed, ſome
of them were ſeverely laſhed, but the Soldiers more
than any; until the Year Fifty Six, when Colonel
<hi>Ingoldsby</hi> the Governour, commanded all, upon a
very ſevere Penalty, to give no manner of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to any Quaker whatſoever, and not ſuffer
them to come within their Doors, and that whoever
did to the contrary, ſhould be expelled out of the
City. But it was to no purpoſe; ſome indeed were
driven away, but their Number did even then and
by that means increaſe; and ſo by degrees came to
hold their Aſſemblies. Officers were ſent to break
open their Doors, and to interrupt and diſturb
them; ſome they fined, others were baniſhed, but
yet for all this they increaſed and multiplyed more
and more; this happened at <hi>Limerick, Cork, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford,
Kingſale,</hi> and other places: And thus did
this Sect of the Quakers about the time of their riſe
and firſt Progreſs, ſtruggle in the time of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
under the two <hi>Cromwels,</hi> Father and
Son, Protectors, under the many Afflictions they
were put to by their Enemies, and to the great haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
both of their Religion and People.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Have brought down the Hiſtory of the Quakers
to the Time of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. in whoſe Reign,
and even in the very beginning thereof, as great
changes happened, not only in the State, every
thing being abrogated and taken away, that had
been Obſtacles to the Kingly Power and Dignity,
or that might be ſo for the future, but alſo in the
Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, for that Equality and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50388:83"/>
Conjunction that ought to be between the Brethren,
Friends, and Diſciples of Chriſt, was taken away,
whilſt the Government thereof reverted to a few,
and for the moſt part to the King himſelf; ſo there
was among thoſe Perſons who were not diſſatisfied
with the Name, Splendor, and Authority of a King,
but with that turn in the Church, no ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of Mind, no light Care and Diligence, not
only that they might defend their own Churches,
with the Orders and Conſtitutions of them, leſt
they ſhould ſuffer any damage any other way, but
alſo that they might further vindicate all their
Practices from the Envy of their Adverſaries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
and trim up the ſame, and recommend them
unto others. Therefore this Study and Concern
alſo ſeemed to be among all Perſons, who had as
well departed from that ſame pitch of Religion, as
from that publick Religion; in the very ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
did <hi>George Fox</hi> and his Colleagues, and all of
that Herd, even every one according to his Place and
Station, diligently and induſtriouſly apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to this Affair; wherefore <hi>Fox,</hi> according to
his wonted manner, began his Peregrination in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to viſit his Friends, to Preach amongſt them,
but did not take upon him as formerly to talk in
the Publick Churches, Markets, and Streets, and
there to ſtir up the People; and ſeeing that he had
before this attempted many things, more earneſtly
than ſucceſsfully, he took diligent heed from this
time forward, as to what Places he went, ſo with
whom he converſed, and whom he ſhould ſhun,
and when he found there were ſome who laid in
wait for him to trepan him, and hale him to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
he immediately haſtened away. He did alſo
moreover adviſe his Party by his Letters and Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,
that all of them ſhould make it their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
and endeavour, to do nothing againſt the
King's Authority and the Common-weal, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of nothing in that kind which might be avoided
by them. Beſides this, <hi>Fox</hi> proceeded to write ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things even againſt their Adverſaries, but in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50388:83"/>
ſuch a manner, as not to ſet forth ſo much what
his own Sentiments were, as what he wrote, and
in what place he wrote it. Which ſort of Life
<hi>Fox</hi> from thence forward led, even to his Death,
that all his Actions, both in the middle and laſt
part of his Life, might be like unto thoſe he had
practiſed in the beginning, ſo that I judge it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to ſay many more words concerning <hi>Fox</hi> in this
Treatiſe, unleſs ſomething that is altogether new
and ſtrange ſhould occur. And thus did almoſt all
the Quakers behave themſelves now more cautiouſly
and circumſpectly among their Adverſaries, neither
did they ſo often and conſtantly make a noiſe in
the Churches and Publick places, neither did they
Act thoſe Fooleries where there was a Concourſe of
People, and utter ſuch ridiculous Bablings, neither
when they were brought before the Magiſtrate, did
they talk ſo uncivilly, abruptly, and foreign to the
purpoſe, as they had been wont to do; neither did
they Anſwer, when the Judges asked them, what
their Name was, what Country-men they were,
where they lived, that they were of the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and that they lived in God; ſo that as the
Time, even ſo their Manners changed; yea, from
henceforward theſe Men wrote and publiſhed in
<hi>England,</hi> not only Pamphlets, but Books, in which
they handled the Heads of things not at large only
and confuſedly, but curiouſly and diſtinctly, and
did Argue in them, firſt, againſt the Opinions and
Tenets of the Principal Epiſcoparians, and then
againſt thoſe of other Diſſenters, which they did
not approve of, and this in a neat and orderly way
of Argumentation, not by wrangling, but exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
every Propoſition, and coming up to the Merit
of the Cauſe, and by admirable Skill arriving at
their deſigned Concluſion; neither did they urge
thoſe things which they taught and believed, by a
rude and disjointed way of Reaſoning, but clearly
and openly, and explicated the ſame at large, and
ſtrenuouſly defended it: Which Method was vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
purſued by <hi>Samuel Fiſher,</hi> who was the chief
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50388:84"/>
Man, and the Ornament of the whole Sect. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
ſome of them were not afraid to Diſcourſe,
Argue, and Diſpute with the Adverſe Party, yea,
and when need required, with the very Miniſters of
the Publick Church, concerning their own and the
others Doctrine and Concerns. Which ſort of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
was held this very firſt Year at <hi>Hereford,</hi>
between two City Miniſters and three Preaching
Quakers, <hi>Howgil, Burroughs,</hi> and <hi>Croſs;</hi> wherefore
from henceforward theſe People the Quakers began
gradually, and by little and little to ſtand up, and
to increaſe in number and ſtrength, and to be
reckoned and uſed as one of the Sects of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion. Things were at the ſame paſs with
theſe Men in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſaving that their Affairs did
not thrive ſo faſt there until the arrival of two Men
of great Fame and Reputation amongſt all the
Quakers, <hi>Geroge Keith</hi> and <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> by Name,
by whoſe Labour, Toyl, and Induſtry, the whole
Doctrine of the Quakers, eſpecially their chief
Dogms, Principles, and Fundamentals were very
much illuſtrated and confirmed; and becauſe this
is the firſt place where we meet with the Names of
theſe Men, and that hereafter mention will be made
of them upon various Accounts, we ſhall in a few
words, acquaint thoſe who do not know it, what
ſort of Men theſe are; they were both of them
<hi>Scots,</hi> but there is only one of them, to wit, <hi>Keith,</hi>
that is yet alive; <hi>Barclay</hi> the other being dead.
<hi>George Keith</hi> was at firſt of the Reformed Religion,
and a Student of Philoſophy and Divinity; as ſoon
as he commenced Maſter of Arts, and was more
eſpecially had in eſteem for a good Mathematician,
he did afterward become a Chaplain or Miniſter of
God's Word in a certain Noble Family. But ſeeing
that he was always tranſported with a deſire of
ſearching after, and learning ſomewhat that was
new, and alighted upon theſe late Sectaries, he did
in a ſhort time embrace their Doctrine, and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be one of the chief Speakers and Holders
forth amongſt them: This Man after many Toyls,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50388:84"/>
Wanderings, and Perambulations, went at laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that part of <hi>America,</hi> which from the Owner
thereof is called <hi>Penſylvania,</hi> and there in their
Church and Latin School of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> exerciſed
the Office of a Teacher. <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> was a
Gentleman of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Son of that ſame <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
Barclay,</hi> whoſe Book we have made mention of
a little before; his Father had ſent him to the City
of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Capital of <hi>France,</hi> and there was
brought up in good Literature, and after a manner
that ſuited to his Quality, and thoſe Noble Youths
that were his Fellow-Students. But this Young
Man had an Uncle in that City, that was Principal
of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Popiſh College there; to whoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
when <hi>Barclay</hi> had for ſome time attended, he
leaves the Reformed Religion, and turns Papiſt;
which when his Father came to know, he ſends for
him home, and as he himſelf in the mean time
was turned Quaker, he alſo endeavours to induce
his Son to embrace the ſame way; but he, ſeeing
he had in all other things been Obſervant to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
refuſes, and ſays, he could not in ſo great and
weighty a thing as that was, hearken to him. But
when he had, not long after, come to one of the
Meetings of the Quakers, he ſuddenly turns about,
and becomes throughly one of them, being now
Eighteen Years of Age, and from thence forward
for a great part of his Life, was as it were, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
or Meſſenger of the Quakers in their weightieſt
Affairs; it's alſo ſaid, that he was deſcended from
<hi>John Barclay,</hi> that notable Writer of Heroick Verſe
and Satyr, and whoſe Name it's enough to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Keith</hi> wrote many things in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> wherein
he does clearly Teach, Explain, and Confirm thoſe
chief Points of their Doctrine, which <hi>Fox</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had neither ſo diſtinctly handled, nor ſo arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
and dexterouſly propounded, and vindicates
the ſame from the Objections and Exceptions of
their Adverſaries, which afterward all the reſt of
the Quakers greedily ſnatched at, and would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
and reckon among the Opinions of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50388:85"/>
Quakers, excepting two or three Articles which
they left alone, as peculiar to himſelf. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the firſt of them all who taught, poliſhed,
and perfected thoſe Principles concerning the Seed
and Light within, immediate Revelation, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
Divine, and Spiritual Filiation of Jeſus Chriſt
(for ſo do all Divines, and not the Quakers alone
ſpeak, as often as Latin words fail them) his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
and the Preſence or Exiſtence of him as
of the Seed and Light, and his Manifeſtation and
Operation in Men, hitherto either unknown, or but
very obſcurely delivered. <hi>Barclay</hi> betook himſelf
to Write a long time after <hi>Keith,</hi> and at laſt came
out a large Treatiſe of his, written in <hi>Latin,</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<hi>Apologia Theologiae vere Chriſtianae,</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. A Book highly praiſed
by thoſe Men, and very common among all that are
curious of the Writings of thoſe Men of which Book
I ſhall elſewhere more particularly ſpeak; ſo that as
the Doctrine and Religion of the Quakers owes its
Original and Increaſe to <hi>England,</hi> ſo it does its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and Completion to <hi>Scotland,</hi> And now even
in this Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> theſe Quakers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Keith,</hi> had many Conteſts with the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
there, concerning the cauſes of their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Seceſſion from thoſe Churches, with
which they had till this time firmly united, and
concerning their new Articles of Faith, which they
were ſaid to have obtruded upon thoſe Old Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
and that by Conferences, Diſputations, and
Writings, which gave occaſion to <hi>Keith</hi> to write
thoſe Books, wherein by examining ſeriouſly, all
that was objected againſt them, and often rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon, and digeſting all that he had before pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
or ſpoke, he brought forth his Meditations
in that Method and Form before ſpoken of. Theſe
Men did in the mean time grow here alſo by degrees
more moderate, and leave off their rude and auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ways that had gained them much Hatred, and
many Evils, and ſo by degrees being accuſtomed to
the ſight of their Adverſaries, they began to live
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50388:85"/>
more ſafely, and alſo to increaſe in number. Their
Affairs went on in <hi>Ireland</hi> but ſlowly, where they
who preſided as it were over the reſt, took their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in promoting their Doctrine and Religion
from the Inſtitutions and Manners of their Friends
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> And ſo from this time
forward was the Sect of the Quakers brought into
form, and their Doctrine and Faith conſummated;
to which this may be further added: Seeing that a
Publick Confeſſion of Faith made by all, is a great
Bond for the uniting of their Souls together, and
an apt Symbol of Communion and Fellowſhip,
<hi>Keith</hi> did at a certain time propoſe this unto them,
That it would be a moſt uſeful thing, if ſuch a
Book were compoſed in the Name of all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
called Quakers, by worthy and choice Men,
with clear Words and Sentences, which might be
an Abridgment and Publick Confeſſion of all their
Doctrine and Faith, and that the ſame were Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by all, even each one in his particular Church,
who for the future ſhould be received into the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of the Quakers, and joyn themſelves unto
them. But their Friends were not pleaſed with
this Advice, by reaſon that they thought it to be a
thing on the one ſide that carried in it too much
Authority between Equals, and on the other ſide
an Obligation of Servitude in a free Affair, and
that they ſhould be very cautious leſt they ſhould
be brought under any Inconveniency in that kind;
for the avoiding of which, they had all hitherto
gathered together, and lived in the greateſt Union,
as they had done in the greateſt Freedom imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
But to return to the beginning of the Reign
of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and Record the Facts
of theſe Men, and what befel unto them. Their
Study and Endeavours did indeed appear to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the Government of this King, as did thoſe
of other Sects and Diſſenters from the Publick
Worſhip, if not from their Judgment, yet better
by their yielding and giving way, and that becauſe
of the diſpoſition of the King to be Eaſie and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50388:86"/>
Beſides this King himſelf with all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
ſeemed to have ſufferd for ſo long a time
ſo many, and ſuch great Injuries and Calamities,
and ſo muſt be mindful of the Lot and uncertain
ſtate of Man, that he would at length grant Reſt
to theſe Men from the many Troubles which they
had been expoſed to. To this may be added, that
the King at that time, when they were debating in
Parliament concerning the Reſtauration of him, he
himſelf being then at <hi>Breda,</hi> in the Court of the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his Nephew by his Siſter, writes
very lovingly and tenderly of his own accord to
that Supream Council, as alſo to the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
That he would give to and preſerve the Liberty
of Tender Conſciences and Opinions in Religion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it were without endangering the Publick Peace.</hi>
Which thing was again repeated by the King after
he was Solemnly eſtabliſhed in his Throne. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Quakers upon the King's Reſtauration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
great hopes concerning their Affairs. At laſt
when in the beginning of the King's Reign, ſome
of the Quakers, full of good will towards the King,
and of a good Opinion of his kindneſs towards
them, went to the King, and implored his Favour,
Protection, and Help againſt the Injuries and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of their Enemies. The King grants them all
they deſired, and it's not to be doubted but that he
did it of his own accord, for he ſuffered them at
firſt to live and act according to their own Way
and Mode, as alſo to Meet to perform their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worſhip, and ſo alſo did he ſometime Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
that for the future, he would not only not
obſtruct, but alſo promote their Liberty; therefore
theſe Men from the very beginning of the change
of the Government, did moſt Induſtriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in their Affairs and Exerciſes for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Good; neither did they do it unknown to
their Adverſaries, but openly and in their ſight, as
it were not by the tacit but expreſs conſent, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
Command of the King: But it will not be long
ere all this matter ſhall fall out much otherwiſe than
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50388:86"/>
this, and the Event deceive all the Hope and Opinion
of theſe Men. Yea, indeed it ſo happened, as if this
Letter, the Name &amp; Power of the King, did not avail
for the Liberty and Eaſe but Ruine of theſe Men,
that even from the firſt Decree of the Parliament
concerning the King's Reſtauration, in all that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
till the King did apply himſelf to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the Government, they who were the
Quakers Adverſaries, amongſt other Pretences which
they made uſe of for to repreſs and enſnare theſe
Men, they turned the Edict, Name, and Dignity
of the King to their Moleſtation and Deſtruction.
Therefore as often as they met together to Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
their Worſhip, they were apprehended and
carryed away as diſturbers of the Peace, and though
they had not the leaſt Weapon that might give any
Offence, they were treated as if they had been
armed Men, and like Enemies and Cut-Throats,
and ſtirred up one another and other Peaceable
Subjects to Rebellion, and to offer Violence to the
Common-wealth. This I will ſay to thoſe who
do not ſo well know what the Oath of Fidelity
among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> means, which they themſelves
call the Oath of Allegiance. After the Diſcovery
of the Gun-powder Treaſon, formed by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
againſt King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, and all the Royal
Family, and all the Peers of the Realm, ſuch a
Law was made by the ſaid King <hi>James</hi> and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
to wit, That for the reſtraining of ſuch
Papiſts, who had much rather that the Pope ſhould
be Supream Lord of the Kingdom than the King,
and were eaſily induced to Offer ſuch mad and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Sacrifices as theſe that are not to be named,
and that they might be known from other Men;
that as God ſhould help him, every one ſhould
Acknowledge, Profeſs, Teſtifie, and Swear, that
the Pope had no Power to Depoſe the King,
or to ſtir up his Subjects to Rebel againſt him,
and that the ſame would perform all due Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Fidelity towards the King, and withſtand
all Plots and Contrivances againſt the Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50388:87"/>
There was moreover an Oath long ſince
in uſe to this King's Predeceſſors, called the Oath
of Supremacy, firſt begun by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.
whereby every one did Swear, That the King alone
was Supream Governour of this Kingdom, in all
things and cauſes whatſoever, as well in Spiritual
and Eccleſiaſtical as in Civil. Theſe Oaths from
the beginning of this New Revolution being put
to the Quakers by the Royalliſts, they propoſed to
them, when they were taken, to Swear to theſe
words poſitively, that they might try how they
ſtood affected towards the King. But ſeeing they
refuſed to Swear at all, as holding it an unlawful
Act, and not that only of the Abjuration of the
Pope, and their Affection towards the King, and
that in the mean time they were always ready, in
clear and diſtinct words, truly to Affirm in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God, that they were ſuch Perſons as did
abominate and loath the Pope, and that Church,
and the Power of thoſe Men, and their Tenets, as
alſo their Pride and Treachery againſt Kings, and
that the King could fear no Danger and Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
ſo little from any ſort of Men as from them,
nor deſire more Love, Obedience, and Good-will
from any, as towards their Lawful King; and that
they were ready, if they proved falſe herein, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
ſuch Puniſhments as they who have violated
their Oath, after they have ſworn in direct words;
yet this Oath was always objected againſt them, as
an inexplicable Snare, wherewith to enſnare whom
they were minded to catch; for whether they did
altogether refuſe this Oath, or with this ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
that they might give their Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, or the thing it ſelf, and ſpoke of their
willingneſs to Promiſe Solemnly to be Faithful, and
did not refuſe to Subſcribe the ſame with their hands,
they were preſently looked upon as Men either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
or wavering, or treacherous in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the King, and to be deprived of all the
Protection and Favour that the King could give
them. And as a Superaddition to the reſt, when
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50388:87"/>
they to whom Tythes of the Fruits of the Earth
and the like were allotted for their Labours, and
eſpecially the Farmers of theſe Tythes, were very
ſharp upon them for their Returns and Profits, and
the Quakers denyed that they ought to pay them,
they were very ſeverely and hardly uſed every
where. Moreover, when they were ſhut up in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
had little or no Relief from without, thoſe
that ſerved them, uſed them for the moſt part as
they pleaſed, neither was there any thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might defend themſelves. Of which things
as there are very memorable Inſtances, and almoſt
without Number, I ſhall give one only Specimen
of every ſort, and that briefly. At <hi>Sherborn</hi> in
<hi>Dorſetſhire</hi> there were Thirty Quakers got together
into an Houſe, for to Worſhip God in an innocent
harmleſs manner, who, as if they had been a knot
of Men come together for to Drink, Revel, Rebel,
and Conſpire againſt the Government, were haled
out by the Townſmen, Officers, and School-Maſter
of the place, followed with many Swords and Clubs,
and entertained with Curſes and Blows, were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
before the Magiſtrate, who blamed, ſentenced,
and condemned them, as vile Perſons, bent upon
Rioting, and while they were met together, did only
contrive and raſhly machinate Innovations; and this
they did without any Proof, Judgment, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
the Quakers at the ſame time however crying
out, that there was not one Perſon that could make
any ſuch thing good againſt them, or that they
met upon ſuch an Account, and urging the King's
Promiſe in vain, that while they were only met
together to Celebrate their Worſhip to God, that
none ſhould ſuffer any Injury becauſe of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Some of the Quakers were ſhut up in <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>
Gaol from the ſight of all Men, and even
from the common Light; others of them meeting
the Danger, make their Appearance at the next
Quarter Aſſizes; where, when nothing that had been
urged againſt them could by any means be proved,
but that theſe Men did now appear before the Court
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50388:88"/>
with their Hats on, this was now objected as a
Crime unto them, and looked upon as a certain dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of the King's Majeſty, and ſo they were fined
for their Puniſhment to pay great Sums of Money,
which when they did not forthwith pay, they were
all adjudged by the Court to be ſhut up in the ſame
Priſon of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> upon Condition they ſhould
not be releaſed from thence till ſuch time as they
had paid the ſaid Sum. In the Town of <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
which is the head Town, and fineſt in that
County, when the Quakers were at their Meeting,
ſeveral Soldiers break open the Doors, and ruſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Houſe, and take away, and hurry into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
One and Twenty of them: The Judges, when
they did not, and could not Accuſe them of having
done any Villany or Wrong, require them to take
the Oath of Allegiance; which when they refuſed
to do the ſame, as it were condemning themſelves
by this their ſilence, as if they had been guilty of
Treaſon, they are forced to remain ſhut up in the
ſame Priſon. <hi>Edward Noell,</hi> a Country-man of <hi>Kent,</hi>
had taken from him of his Flock to the value of an
Hundred Pounds, for the Tythes of Twenty Pounds,
for which he had not paid the Money; and when
he, according to his Country Rhetorick and Truth,
had made a noiſe about it, and ſufficiently ſtung
the Ears and Hearts of the Tythes-men and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
he was commanded away to Priſon, and
there kept a Year and an half. One <hi>Thomas Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,</hi>
at a place in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> called <hi>Chadlington,</hi>
and a Man of a good Nature and Diſpoſition, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
travelled through many Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
turns in to ſee his Friend <hi>Benjamin Staples:</hi>
This Man, the very next Night after he came, was,
together with his Landlord, carryed away, and led
before the Juſtices; they tender to them the Oath
of Allegiance, which when they refuſed to take,
ſo as that there was no way left for them to make
any Defence, they are led away, and committed
to the Common Gaol of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and were ſhut up
there among ſome of their own Friends of their
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50388:88"/>
Religion, ſome whereof had been there for Two
Years and longer, becauſe that they alſo refuſed to
pay Tythes, and to Swear; the Jaylor put ſuch
thick and heavy Fetters of Iron upon theſe two
Men, that their Feet were wounded with them;
which when they deſired might be taken off, the
Keeper of the Priſon demanded Money of them
for ſo doing; they did not ſhew themſelves very
forward to do that; whereupon he thruſts them
into a filthy and noiſom place, where they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
either to ſit or lie upon beſides dirt; and ſo
they deſire they might have a little Straw allowed
them; and here the ſame Mercenary Wretch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
he would give them ſome, if they gave him
Four Pounds in Money; which when they deſpiſed
and rejected, the Keeper's Wife, who was even
more wretchedly Covetous than her Husband, and
far more greedy of Prey, as often as ſhe came to
them, would rail and revile them bitterly, pulling
and haling of them violently at her pleaſure. In
ſome time they were both ordered to appear at the
Aſſizes of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where when they were accuſed
of various things, and that nothing could be found
againſt them that was worthy of Puniſhment, they
were again asked as before, to take the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
which when they now alſo ſaid, they
could not do it, they are remanded back into the
ſame Priſon, among the ſame Thieves and Cut-Throats
that were kept there; which before it was
done, <hi>Goodrey</hi> asked, whether the Judges did Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them to be laid in Irons? The Chief Judge
made Anſwer, That the Keeper of the Priſon might
do as he pleaſed, becauſe they were Perſons out of
the King's Protection. There does the Keeper put
them again amongſt thoſe Villains and profligate
Wretches, and gives thoſe wicked Men leave, if
they wanted any Cloaths, to take off theirs, I mean,
theſe two Innocent mens Apparel, at which one of
the vileſt amongſt the whole Crew made Anſwer,
That he had rather go altogether naked, than take
any thing away from theſe Men: And ſo it was,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50388:89"/>
that while the Law was ſilent at the Bar of Juſtice,
and no Fence againſt Injuries in Priſon and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
theſe wretched Men ſuffered all Violence and
Cruelty. Theſe few Inſtances, from among many,
may ſerve; but becauſe the firſt Parliament under
this King was yet ſitting, the Quakers ſuppoſing
the Tribunals to be every where ſet againſt them,
ſo as that there was no hopes of Juſtice for them;
they prefer their Supplications to the King and
Parliament, as being Supream Magiſtrates, and the
Authors and Defenders of Liberty, Right, and
Judgment, highly complain of the great and many
Injuries, Violences, and Troubles that they ſuffered
from their own Country-men and Neighbours, and
implore their Help and Aſſiſtance; and that they
might affect them the more, they produce a great
Commentary, or rather Catalogue in Writing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
how that during the time of the two <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels,</hi>
there were no leſs than Three Thouſand, One
Hundred and Seventy Nine of their Society that
had been Impriſoned in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and other Countries beyond the Seas, Subject
to the King's Dominion, and that of them, Thirty
Two were dead. And in the cloſe thereof they
add, That from the King's Coming in, to the
preſent time, there had been, and were ſtill kept
in Priſon, Three Hundred and Seventeen of them.
They name every place of their Impriſonment, and
give the Names of moſt of the People, and did
alſo ſet forth the Afflictions that moſt of them had
ſuffered before, for what Cauſes, and what thoſe
are alſo for which they were ſtill Impriſoned; they
did moreover the next Year Preſent a Writing to
the King and Parliament, wherein they ſet forth,
that their Number was now ſo increaſed, who ſince
the King's Return had been thrown into Priſon, that
they were no leſs than Five Hundred Fifty and
Two, many of whom had alſo even before their
Impriſonment ſuſtained many Afflictions in their
own Congregations, and did even now undergo
many Miſeries in the places where they were
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50388:89"/>
detained; they did in that Writing confirm the
Matter with Examples and Teſtimonies, that the
Magiſtrates themſelves in ſome places, came to
them, and carryed them away; that in other places
they left them to the management of Soldiers;
and elſewhere, that the Commonalty and Rabble,
who had neither Fortune nor Good Name, ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them with Swords and Staves, haled them away,
and after many blows, threw them into Priſon.
Moreover, that many Miniſters of Churches in ſeveral
Countries, ſeeing there were ſome of the Quakers
who had not paid Tythes, and refuſed to pay any,
that came and took out of their Houſes and Fields
for theſe Tythes much more than they ought to
have done, neither did they afterward reſtore the
Over-plus; yea, that ſome of them were ſo chou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of their Money, that they had rendred them
uncapable of paying any more, and needed take
no further care of exacting the ſame from them.
This Writing, which was full of Truth, was partly
neglected, and partly deſpiſed both by the King
and whole Aſſembly: For which there ſeems to
be more than one cauſe; for when the King, who
was not yet well confirmed in his Kingdom, minded
his own and other Publick Affairs, he did indeed
think that theſe mens Affairs were not yet ſeaſonable
and worthy of his Cognizance and Judgment, and
had entirely forgot all that he had promiſed to
theſe Men, which they thought they had fixt in
his Memory with a Ship-nail. But as to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
of the Kingdom, they did indeed ſeem not
yet to have laid aſide their Hatred and Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
theſe Men, at leaſtwiſe the greateſt part of
them. They acknowledged indeed the freedom of
Religion given to them, but they thought, that
under that Pretence and Cloak, all wicked and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
Sects and Opinions would creep in, and
that this Sect of the Quakers was of that ſort;
moreover, although the former Endeavours of the
Quakers, and their Inſolent Attempts, and ſuch as
ſeemingly were Turbulent, were now over, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50388:90"/>
that no Crime could be laid to their charge, that
tended to the diſturbance of the Publick Peace, yet
as the good as well as the bad of ſuch as are once
envied, are always hated, and that to thoſe who
are afraid even falſe things are true, ſuch an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of them did continue, and could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
that the Quakers were ſtill Men of the
ſame Spirit and Temper, and that all their doings
tended to Diſcords and Diſturbances. Laſtly, this
Affair of the Quakers ſeemed to have been ſo often
adjudged and decided by ſo many Judgments, that
it were unworthy to be brought upon the Stage
again. So that theſe calamitous Men were hereby
deprived of the benefit of all Judgment, of every
Suit, and Complaint, there being no room left for
the ſame. And ſo thoſe who were impriſoned, were
like to be ſo always, and kept in greateſt want and
miſery, neither had any of them the leaſt hopes of
their Freedom, unleſs they would comply with the
wills and terms of ſuch as were in Authority over
them, and would agree to pay Money for to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to depart. Of which Number there was not
one to be found that would do ſo; though the King
being not long after asked and urged by ſome, That
he ſhould not ſuffer any ſuch thing, which did ſo
much wrong to his Subjects, when there did appear
no ſuch Fact, no, not ſo much as an Attempt or
Endeavour in them to do that for which theſe Men
were ſo much accuſed, and whereby ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
was caſt upon them, but that he ſhould by
reaſon of his Royal Word given them, uſe them
kindly, he did at length Anſwer, That he would
be Gracious and Merciful to the Quakers, provided
they did nothing that was againſt the King's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Safety, and did again give his Royal Word
for it. It's indeed manifeſt, that <hi>Richard Hubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn,</hi>
one of the chief Quakers, was at this time
admitted to talk with the King, in the preſence of
ſome Noblemen; in which Conference, when the
King with ſome of his Courtiers asked <hi>Hubberthorn</hi>
ſeveral cloſe Queſtions concerning the Doctrine and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50388:90"/>
Religion of the Quakers, and that he made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to every thing that was asked; the King and
thoſe ſame Perſons that had Interrogated him, ſaid
ever and anon, <hi>It is ſo indeed as thou ſayeſt;</hi> and
turning themſelves about, or to one another, they
ſaid, <hi>He offers nothing but the Truth:</hi> And when
the King proceeded to ſpeak, among other things
he uſed theſe words to <hi>Hubberthorn; I do aſſure
thee, that none of you ſhall ſuffer any thing for your
Opinions and Religion, provided ye live Peaceably;
you have the Word and Promiſe of a King for it, and
I will take care by a Proclamation to prevent any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Proſecution of you.</hi> But ſeeing there were ſome
Men, who put an ill Conſtruction upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<hi>Hubberthorn</hi> himſelf did in a little while
after publiſh it in Print, and did therein explain
the whole Matter to all. But how the King did
afterward perform theſe many Promiſes in many
of his Actions, the Event will ſoon ſhew. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
muſt we paſs over in this place that upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Letter that was written and ſent to the King
by a Quaker, then lying in Priſon: <hi>George Fox</hi>
was this Quaker, not he that was the firſt beginner
and Founder of the Society of the Quakers, who
was indeed no ways related or a-kin to that ſame,
though moſt like and near unto him in Nature and
Manners; but one that had lately been a Trooper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>O. Cromwel,</hi> or in the Common-wealth's Army,
wherefore that he might diſtinguiſh himſelf from
the other and older <hi>George Fox,</hi> he called himſelf
who was not ſo old, <hi>Fox</hi> the <hi>Younger.</hi> His Letter was
to this effect. <hi>O King, he who is King of Kings, ſees
and obſerves all thy Actions in the midſt of Darkneſs,
and ſeeing that they proceed from thence, even thy
moſt hidden Counſels can by no means eſcape the ſight
of God, ſo that there remain no lurking places for thy
ſpecious and pretended words, and therefore hath he
freely obſerved all thy Wiles and Treacheries, laid for
thoſe, who did no hurt, and hath alſo manifeſted them
unto all Men, and that at the very time when thou didſt
make thoſe great and fictitious Promiſes, and only didſt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50388:91"/>
play the Hypocrite; wherefore thou haſt angred God,
when at the time thou didſt promiſe Liberty unto us,
thou didſt then ſuffer that outrage to be done us, and
the Impriſonment of ſo many Men for the Teſtimony
of a good Conſcience: Alas, how has the Pride and
Impiety as well of thy Houſe, as of thy Government
ſadded thee; for as often as I revolve within my ſelf
upon the Vnjuſtice, Cruelty, and publick Perſecutions
of this Country, and as often as I think upon their
Wickedneſſes, that are committed in Secret, ſo often is
my Spirit grieved and in anguiſh, and my Heart di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
by reaſon of the fierce wrath of the great God
againſt all Men. And I have had it often in my
thoughts, both before and after thy Reſtauration to the
Kingdom, when I have conſidered the fixt and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Idolatry of this Land, that it had been better
for thee that thou hadſt never come hither, becauſe I
find it has been to thy Ruin; and I have often prayed
to God, that thou wouldſt become of that Mind, as to
depart again out of the Kingdom, that while thou haſt
Life left thee, and ſpace to Repent, thou mayeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of thine Iniquities; do not, O King, ſuffer any
one to flatter thee; God will not be mocked, what any
Man ſhall ſow, that ſhall he alſo reap; conſider with thy
ſelf, how thy Brother the Duke of</hi> Glouceſter, <hi>was ſo
ſuddenly, and unexpectedly cut off, who might have
ſurvived after thy Death; and do not imagine, that
thou canſt be preſerved by Men, when God ſets upon
thee; and God's Will ſhall ſtand, that his Kingdom
may extend over all. Ah! what ſhall I ſay as to what
appertains to thy Salvation? God is burning with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and will ſhorten the days of his Enemies for his
Elect ſake; and Oh that thou mayeſt be ſaved in the
day of the Lord! for my Soul is even under Horror
and Amazement at the ſight of the inevitable Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that attends thee. Theſe things that I write are
true, and I would have thee to know, that I write theſe
things both godlily and lovingly; as for my own part,
though I ſuffer many Miſeries from without, yet I
have that inward Peace with God, that exceeds all
Earthly Crowns.</hi> It was ſaid, that while the King
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50388:91"/>
was reading this Letter, his Brother the Duke of
<hi>York</hi> ſtood by him, and that he, after he had read
it alſo, adviſed the King to order the Quaker to be
hanged; but that the King had anſwered, That it
were better that they themſelves ſhould have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to their own good, and amend their Lives and
Manners; that there is no Underſtanding ſo great,
but that many times is overtaken with Error, and
ſometimes Folly. About this time came forth a
Book, written in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> marked in every Page
with the form or note of a Child's Tablet, ſuch as
Children uſe in <hi>England,</hi> as alſo in our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
out of which they learn to pronounce their
Letters in Alphabetical Order: This Book did in
every Page ſhew, that it was in uſe throughout the
World in all and every Language (whereof there
were no leſs than Thirty Languages recounted and
ſet forth, and each of them diſtinguiſhed into its
proper Table) that when any one ſpoke to a ſingle
Perſon, to call him <hi>Thou,</hi> and not <hi>You,</hi> which the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> uſed, if they talked with a Man that they
reſpected. The Work was neatly and ingeniouſly
done, with much Coſt by <hi>John Subbs</hi> and <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
Furley;</hi> but <hi>Fox,</hi> who beſides the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue,
underſtood none of theſe Thirty, was ſo deſirous to
ſeem to be the Author of this Work, and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it contained of Induſtry and Praiſe-worthineſs
had its Original from him, that he even here and
there ſubſcribed his Name to every Page, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by his Teſtimony, that it contained and
taught every Language; by which Work and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<hi>Fox</hi> now ſhewed plainly the thing, not to
Boys, but to all Men that were like Boys in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
herein, and untaught them that wicked way
of ſpeaking: But when ſome objected againſt <hi>Fox</hi>
his Ignorance in theſe Languages, and that he was
upbraided herewith, as if he were mad, he wiped
it off thus with this new Joke, That he knew only
as much of Languages as was ſufficient for him.
The Year Sixty Two was Remarkable for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
and Change of many things, to the great
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50388:92"/>
Inconveniency, Trouble, and Incommoding of the
Quakers, and went ſo far in the Times that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
that the Ruine of the whole Party and
Race of them ſeemed to be at hand; for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant between the King and
People of <hi>Britain,</hi> and between the Kingdoms of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> than which League there
was nothing before looked upon to be more Holy,
Juſt, and Deſirable, no greater Foundation both of
the Regal Dignity, and the Peoples Liberty, nor a
greater Bond to gather and unite together the whole
Body of the Church, and to eſtabliſh the Religion
of both Kingdoms, was now looked upon as it
were an Antichriſtian piece of Work, and the Spring
of all Evil; and there was the preceding Year,
even by the Parliament's Command, raſed out of
all the Publick Records, both in Church and State,
and at <hi>London</hi> in ſeveral places burnt by the hands
of the Common Hangman. This Year was the
Epiſcopal Order and Authority, which had always
been the Spring and Original of many Brawls and
Calamities, was every where ſet up and eſtabliſh'd,
there being ſome, even of the Presbyterians,
who now were deſirous of this Power and Glory,
which they had before withſtood, or when offered
them, did not reject them, upon this Conſideration,
that ſeeing they would endeavour to be good Men
in the diſcharge of this Office, they were afraid if
they did refuſe the ſame, leſt ſuch ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
who would not carry themſelves in that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with that Moderation required of them. The
King now, which had been the fear of good Men
a long time, and what was now looked upon as a
new Prognoſtick, and ſad Omen upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
contracted a Marriage with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> a Lady ſo given up and devoted to the
Religion and Ceremonies of the Popiſh Church,
that ſhe was inferiour to none of the Queens or
Princeſſes of the Age for that Superſtition. At
laſt, the King, after he thought he had eſtabliſhed
his Houſe and Kingdom, and made all things ſure,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50388:92"/>
did more and more, inſtead of the Care, Labour,
and Continency he ought to have exerciſed, give
himſelf up to Eaſe and Luxury, and left the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of moſt things to his Counſellors and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of State, eſpecially to thoſe who were moſtly
his Familiars and Companions; all which change
wrought no ſmall Perturbation, Trouble, Fear,
and Trembling in the Minds of all thoſe, whoſe
Religion differed from the Religion and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that were now thus revived again; he who
had perſecuted another, did even now perſecute
himſelf, and whom many were before afraid of,
was not now without his own fears, and had need
to take care of himſelf; and therefore from ſuch
a Commotion as this, others became alſo afraid,
who were otherwiſe more to be feared, and from
this their Fear aroſe a Suſpicion, and hence Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
and at laſt a Rumor, that there was a
multitude of Enemies and Conſpirators in the City
and elſewhere, who laid in wait for the King, and
were ready utterly to overturn the whole frame of
this new Government. Though many did believe
this to be an Evil Report, cunningly contrived by
thoſe, who looked upon ſuch a Report to be the
beſt way for them to arrive at that which they
could not hope to obtain in Peaceable Times: Now,
as there was nothing tranſacted by wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate
Men, of which the Quakers were not eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either the Authors, Promoters, Parties, or knew
of it, or conſented to it; ſo here alſo theſe Men
came to be ſuſpected of this Crime, when at the
ſame time there was no certain ſign of any Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
or Sedition contrived by any ſort of Men, and
not the leaſt Foot-ſteps of it by the Quakers; and
ſo there was a Report quickly ſpread abroad, that
theſe were ſuch Men, as had embrued themſelves in
ſuch great Wickedneſſes, and that they had aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
themſelves, and daily met together to that
purpoſe. Of which things, when they did not of
their own accord clear and vindicate themſelves,
which they thought they ought not to do without
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50388:93"/>
certain Accuſers, nor could do without ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
thence the ſame Suſpicion and Report in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
and by this means the People, who were
not indeed called to anſwer at the Bar, becauſe that
would be done upon too ſlight a Conjecture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
the real hatred of all, and became in great
danger, and were impunedly troubled all manner
of ways by them, who, becauſe they were not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
thought they were allowed ſo to do. Now
the King had commanded, that the Quakers of
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex</hi> ſhould take the Oath, which
ſeemed to be the ſtricteſt tye for the Teſtifying of
their Affection, and engaging their Faithfulneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the King and Kingdom; and that the Judges
ſhould ſhew favour to none: But if the Quakers
would not Swear, in purſuance to his Proclamation,
they ſhould hold their Meetings no where; then
follows another Law for the prevention of Seditious
Aſſemblies, <hi>That no Meeting ſhould be held, under a
ſhew and pretence of Divine Worſhip, that was not
approved and ratified by the Liturgy of the Church of</hi>
England, <hi>nor more Perſons meet together at one place
than five. But and if any above the Age of Sixteen
Years and upwards, did tranſgreſs herein, and being
a Subject of the Kingdom, ſuch an one ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
for the ſame.</hi> This Law ſeemed to have been
enacted for the reſtraint of all Sects, but did more
eſpecially appertain to the Quakers, and none could
but underſtand that it was a Snare for them, and
rended to Shipwrack their Affairs. So that it came
hereby to paſs, that ſuch of theſe Men as were now
impriſoned, were for this reaſon more cloſely kept,
and uſed more ſeverely by the Gaolers, even by
thoſe who before ſeemed kind unto them. As for
the reſt of them, they had one Tryal and Affliction
upon another, and the ſame were every where open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not only when they were met together in the
ſtreets, entertained with all manner of Ignominy
and Reproach, but were alſo enforced to abſtain
from their Religious Aſſemblies, and when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all they proceeded, they were harraſſed
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50388:93"/>
by Soldiers, and fined, ſometimes entertained with
more than an Hoſtile Fury, and thrown into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and being required to Swear, were, upon their
refuſal, detained in Priſon, or thruſt into Working-Houſes,
among wicked and profligate wretches,
who had waſted their Subſtance in Drinking, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and Brothel-Houſes, and among Thieves
and Cut-Throats, as if they were their Aſſociates,
or alike infected with them, and ſo being in thoſe
places enforced to Labour very hard, and thereby
ſuſtain their Lives, which when they endeavoured
to do, ſome of them at length being in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
oppreſt with many Miſeries and Calamities,
were freed therefrom by Death. This was done in
<hi>London, Worceſter,</hi> and in other places: Some of
them in other places, whom either the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Life, or the Clamour of many Perſons,
did more eſpecially expoſe to Envy, were ſeized
and taken out of their Beds at Midnight, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
into Priſon; by reaſon of which Practices,
and ſeeing there was no likelihood of any end of
theſe things, the Quakers did again Preſent an
Humble Petition to the King, and did therein ſet
forth, in what Trouble, and under what great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
they all lived; and proved, that from the
King's Reſtauration to this time, there were Four
Thouſand and Five Hundred of them impriſoned,
and that Fifty Six were dead, through the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
and Difficulties they underwent. But as to
what effect this Petition had, it will appear from
hence, that he who wrote it, obtained from the
King for his Reward, a place where thoſe Perſons
were impriſoned, concerning whom he made his
Complaint in that ſame Petition; ſo that that very
thing was looked upon as a Crime, in that they
deplored and deprecated their own Miſeries. But
at length, after that the King had found nothing
by Deeds or Witneſſes, whereby it did appear that
the Quakers were deſicient in their Loyalty towards
him, or that they had done any thing whereby he
might gather that the Crime of Rebellion was not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50388:94"/>
far from their Diſpoſition and Manners; and that
alſo the Accuſation and Clamour of the People, as
being the moſt eaſie and lighteſt things, vaniſhed
of their own accord, and that Time had allayed
the Envy of the People towards them, in reſpect
to their ways, the King ſuffered this ſting of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
to be removed from his Heart; and ſeeing
that hitherto he had been forgetful of his Promiſe
made to this People, he now calls it to mind, and
ſo orders his Officers, and other Magiſtrates, that
they ſhould no further vex theſe People, and ſet
thoſe that were impriſoned at Liberty; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which Command, ſuch was the Severity
and Hardneſs of ſome of theſe Magiſtrates, that
though they did not reject the King's Authority
openly, yet they did indeed fulfil it either not in
earneſt, or but ſlowly: Which thing even the
Gaolers in ſome places did not ſtick to maintain,
when they offered that they were willing to looſe
and free the Priſoners at laſt, if ſo be they would
lay down Money, either of themſelves, or others
for them, to be delivered from their Impriſonment;
the which when they affirmed they would never do,
and that they would chooſe rather to rot there and
periſh, and held ſtoutly to it; and ſeeing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſome of them were ſo harraſſed with dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Diſeaſes, contracted from the ſtench of the
place, that they died thereof, and that the Cries
and Lamentations of theſe Men did reach the Court,
and even the King's Ears, while they were treated
in this manner, the King at length Commands all
of them to be ſet at Liberty without any Money
and Terms whatſoever. In this Perſecution of the
Year Sixty Two, the Quakers recount ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of their ſevere Uſage, and great Conſtancy
of theſe Men. I ſhall only mention two: <hi>Richard
Payton,</hi> at <hi>Duley</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> was thrown into
Priſon, becauſe he would not take the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance;
all his Goods were confiſcated, and he
himſelf ſo long to remain in that place as the King
pleaſed. <hi>Thomas Stourdey,</hi> of <hi>Moorhouſe,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50388:94"/>
of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> was brought before a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
and the Oath of Allegiance put to him,
which he refuſing to take, but at the ſame time
affirming, that he was otherwiſe one of them, who
without Swearing, would obey the King more than
many that had ſwore to him, was condemned by
<hi>John Lowther,</hi> a Man in Authority in that County,
to have all his Goods confiſcated, and himſelf to
perpetual Impriſonment; who being thus ſhut up,
not as the reſt, that were afterwards ſet at Liberty
by the King's Favour, but detained till the Year
Eighty Four, about the end of the ſame ended his
Miſeries by Death in the ſame place. Moreover,
theſe Men do more eſpecially in this Year commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate
the Death of two of their chiefeſt Leaders
(who departed this Life at <hi>London</hi>) as upon the
ſcore of Religion, ſo as being a very glorious and
happy Departure, and Guides to Heaven, and to
God. One of them was <hi>Hubberthorn,</hi> who, we
have ſaid a little before, was in eſteem with the
King, and ſo received into his Favour, that even
in him the welfare of all his Friends might ſeem to
be ſafe, and ſecured from all Moleſtation and Trouble;
this Man reſided in <hi>London,</hi> and on a certain day
having got the People together, he began to Preach;
which when the Lord Mayor came to know, whoſe
Name there is no need to mention, the Quakers
know it well enough, he ſent with as much immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of Power as he had extenſiveneſs of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
to fetch <hi>Hubberthorn</hi> away from that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
and ſo was brought before him, who, when
the Man would not put off his Hat before him,
according to the uſage of the Quakers in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
he uſed him as if he had been the greateſt
Villain, and ſeditious Fellow, and taken openly in
the greateſt Wickedneſs, beat him with his own
hands, haled him by the hair of the Head, and
threw him upon the Ground, and after that, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
him to be put into Priſon among Rogues
and Malefactors, in which place <hi>Hubberthorn</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that Favour (that a Criminal deſires moſt) of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50388:95"/>
the Attorney, that his Cauſe might be transferred
to another Court; and ſeeing there was no Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
taken of the Man's Religion, they now bent
all their Accuſations againſt his Moroſity, Irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and Contempt of the Magiſtrate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
he might be ſeverly puniſhed for the
ſame. <hi>Hubberthorn,</hi> after he had lain in this ſad
and doleful place two Months, falls very ſick and
weak, and in a ſhort time after died; leaving this
Memorial of himſelf with his Friends, That he
had born whatever befel him with an even Mind,
and always ready to maintain his Religion, and
choſe rather to die for the ſame than to live. The
other was <hi>Burroughs,</hi> who alſo in the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
ſtood firm to his Religion, and died for it in
Priſon, and whom the Quakers were wont to eſteem
as the Apoſtle of the <hi>Londoners.</hi> Of him, they
ſay, when a little before he had reſided at <hi>Briſtol,</hi>
that upon his departure from thence towards <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
he took his leave of his Friends with theſe
words, as a Preſage of his approaching Deſtiny:
<hi>That now he was directing his Courſe for</hi> London,
<hi>that he might there together with his Brethren ſuffer
for the ſake of the Goſpel, and to lay down his Life.</hi>
When he came to <hi>London,</hi> he preſently goes to their
Meeting, and there Preaches, eſteeming he could
not otherwiſe ſatisfie his Conſcience, diſcharge his
Duty, and uſe the Gift which he had received;
which as ſoon as it was told the Mayor, who was
the ſame before mentioned, away goes he with
ſome of his Officers and Followers, and leſt he
ſhould do the ſame again, which is not very much
commendable in a Magiſtrate, he Commands them
to hale away the Man, and forthwith thruſt him
into Priſon, which they do, and put him into an
horrid place, full of filth and ſtench, and ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
that he could not well ſtand there; with which
Miſeries after Eight Months he falls ſick, and his
Diſeaſe increaſing upon him daily, he at length
dies as he had lived, ſupporting and comforting
himſelf and his Friends, who were not hindred
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50388:95"/>
acceſs to him, and ſo were preſent at all times,
with many words, the ſum and ſubſtance whereof
was this: <hi>I have hitherto preached the Goſpel in this
City freely, and not to the burden of any, and have
often ſpent my Life therein, and now in the midſt of
my Labours part with my Life for it; and how true
it is, that I have truly and ſincerely both acted and
dealt in this matter, is known to him who knoweth all
things. And thou, O God, haſt then loved me, when
I was yet ſhut up in my Mother's Womb, and I have
loved them from my Cradle, and have ſerved thee
from my Childhood and Youth to this very time, to
ſome good purpoſe, and that with the greateſt Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and though this Body of mine returns unto the
Duſt, yet I am conſcious to my ſelf, and aſſuredly know,
that my Soul ſhall return from whence it came, and
that that Spirit which hath lived in me, wrought in
me, ruled me, and hath ruled in all, will be diffuſed
into Thouſands. I pray unto God, that he would Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
if it be his will, the Sins and evil Practices of
my Enemies.</hi> And when he died, winking as it
were with both his Eyes, he ſaid, <hi>Now my Soul
reſteth in her own Centre. Fiſher</hi> doth deſcribe this
Man's untimely Death in a lofty ſtyle, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his way, in a Rhetorical and Tragical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
The Perſecution of theſe Men was very hot
the Year following in the City of <hi>Worceſter:</hi> Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Quakers were met together in the Houſe of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Smyth,</hi> not for to Preach, but to the intent
they might Adviſe together, concerning four Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
the Death of whoſe Father had left them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of Suſtenance and Education; they chiefly
conſidered what might be done, leſt the Children
ſhould come upon the Pariſh, and that then as the
Pariſh ſhould have the charge of bringing them
up, ſo it would alſo take care to have them inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the Religion and Diſcipline of the ſame.
Preſently upon this, ſome Soldiers get together,
and having given no ſign of their being ſent, ruſh
upon them, as upon a Rabble withſtanding or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
the Government, and with much Clamour
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50388:96"/>
and great Violence take Twenty Four of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and carry them to the places where they were
wont to be put, amongſt Bawdy-houſe haunters,
for this now was come in faſhion, Ruffians, Thieves,
and ſuch ſort of vitious notorious Offenders; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome Weeks <hi>Smyth</hi> and a few other are brought
before the Magiſtrates, and examined; they ask
them, whether they had taken the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance?
And when they ſaid, they had not; they
ask them again, whether they would now Swear,
according to their uſual way of Interrogating of
them in theſe Times? They Anſwer, <hi>That they
could not ſwear for Conſcience-ſake, and affirm a
thing according to their forms, and in ſuch a manner,
but that otherwiſe they could ſincerely affirm, that
they would diſcharge all their Duty towards the King
and Government, neither would they attempt any thing
which tended to their diſhonour and Incommodity, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would they do any thing for which they might
juſtly be blamed.</hi> But whilſt that in this hearing
there was no diſpute about the Thing, but the
Mode and Circumſtance thereof was only contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and that the Quakers in the mean time
held to their own way, and ſtood covered; the
Magiſtrates laying aſide the Diſpute about Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they take up the matter of theſe mens wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Hats before them, and urge, that to ſtand
covered before the Magiſtrate, as it did here mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
appear, was a great derogation from the
King's Honour, and ſuch and ſo great an Offence,
that it ought to be puniſhed, and that ſeverely by
the Court. To which <hi>Smyth</hi> wittily replyed, <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there was not only any appearance of no Crime,
no, nor the leaſt ſuſpicion againſt them, that they had
leſſened the Reputation of this King, his Name, Rule,
and Government, in words or deeds, it was a very
trivial thing for them to urge that as a mark of it,
and ſeeing that the Hat is a Covering to the Head;
and that each part of the Body has his Covering, and
that none in his approach to others, though they be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
uncovers any other part of his Body, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50388:96"/>
that his not doing ſo, is not for all that taken as a mark
of Contumacy and Diſobedience; it's moſt ſtrange
Men ſhould be bound by this Law and Religion about
the Bonnet.</hi> After this Reply, there was Sentence
pronounced againſt all of them, that they ſhould
be detained in Priſon, becauſe they refuſed to obey,
and be obſervant towards the King, and irreverent
towards the Judges. As for <hi>Smyth,</hi> they adjudged
him to be out of the King's Protection, to have
his Goods Confiſcate, and brought to the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer;
after this, the reſt of them were accuſed,
and partly becauſe of their Meeting together, and
partly becauſe they refuſed to Swear, adjudged alſo
to Priſon; the thing from a Hearing came to a
Tryal, the Evidence Swear to the Matter, in the
abſence of the Criminals; but the Witneſſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed
very much one with another; the whole
Action, of which the Accuſation and Caſe was made
up, is found to be far otherwiſe, than was thought
to be; the Judges hereupon were ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
what clear Anſwer they ſhould give, and
what to determine concerning the Men; at laſt,
they adjudge them to be carryed back to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
At this time <hi>Francis Howgil,</hi> a diligent Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
among theſe People, was taken from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place,
where he attended his buſineſs, by a
Traveller, and carryed before the Juſtices of the
Peace, that were met together in the next Inn:
Theſe look askew upon the Man, heſitate, queſtion
him, and at laſt come to that which they deſigned,
and require him to take the Oath of Allegiance;
he did at firſt in like manner delay, as knowing
their Tricks, made no Excuſe, leſt his going about
to purge him of a fault might be eſteemed as a
fault, but he afterward goes on whither they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him, and denyed, that he could with a ſafe
Conſcience take the Oath. And ſo was committed
to Priſon; whence being brought before the Judges
to <hi>Appleby,</hi> and when they alſo required him to
Swear, and that he could not be brought to do ſo,
he is led back to his former Priſon. He was again
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50388:97"/>
the Year following brought before the ſame Court,
and the ſame Queſtion put to him, where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
with great Conſtancy, but in much Modeſty,
<hi>That he, as to what belongs to the ſubſtance and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Oath, did not refuſe to Declare and Promiſe
the performance of it, yea, and to ſubſcribe it, but
that he could not affirm the ſame by an Oath, neither
was that Lawful for a Chriſtian, nor Advantageous
to Men; ſeeing that ſuch an Aſſeveration would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impoſe a greater Obligation upon good Men in
the preſerving of their Faith, nor take away fear
from the wicked, and that the ſame was only an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to Raſhneſs, and Temerity in all falſe
hearted Men, and a Cloak for Evil, and ſometimes
for the moſt notorious Villanies.</hi> By which ſpeech
and moderation in ſpeaking, <hi>Howgil</hi> was ſo far
from being freed from the Proſecution and
Envy of his Judges, that for all that, he was
adjudged Guilty, and adjudged, as being guilty of
Diſloyalty, to have all his Lands forfeited as long
as he lived, and Moveables for ever returned to the
Exchequer, and that he himſelf was out of the
King's Protection, and ordered to be ſhut up and
detained in perpetual Impriſonment; and ſo it
came to paſs, that the Man continued in that Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for five Years, when at length he fell very ſick,
and ſhortly after ended his Miſeries by Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Arms and Lamentations of his Wife,
and many Friends, who were the Witneſſes of his
<hi>Exit,</hi> and of their own ſorrow, for the loſs of a
Man, who was not only dear and delightful to them,
but to all of their Society; at his Death he called
God and Men to Witneſs, <hi>That he died of thut Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
for which he had ſuffered ſo many Afflictions.</hi>
While the Quakers were thus diſturbed, harraſſed,
and moleſted, the Parliament made yet a more
rigid Law, That the Quakers ſhould, in direct
words before the Magiſtrates, take the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to the King, and own him for the Supream
Head of the Church. But, and if upon any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
they could not be brought to do this, it was
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50388:97"/>
Enacted, That within a Year's ſpace they ſhould
leave the Kingdom, as refractary and rebellious
Perſons, that acknowledged no Authority of Rule,
and rejected, and laid aſide all Bands of Humane
Societies. By which Law they ſeemed now as if
they did not only raiſe up Arms, and Proclaim
War againſt them openly and ſimply, but deſign
their utter Ruine and Deſtruction. Now, by this
Law there was an increaſe of theſe Peoples Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
the following Year, in that it made them to
be much more ſuſpected and hated by the People,
but it's uncertain whether this proceeded from the
Opinion, and from thence the Rumour of ſuch
ſort of Men, who think what they do not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
and ſay what they think, or from them who
believed cunningly enough that this was the beſt
way and manner for them to be quickly and readily
rid of theſe Men. Or laſtly, from them who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
that they might in theſe troubleſome Times
gain ſome Profit and Advantage to themſelves; the
Miſchief was this: Theſe Men were more and more
blamed, that they cheriſhed Papiſts, and even
Jeſuits, that certainly lurked amongſt them, which
ſame Perſons were ſo hateful to the People, and
which took upon them their Names and Perſons,
and preached amongſt them, that ſometimes one
and the ſame Teacher, on one and the ſame day,
did firſt Celebrate Maſs among the Papiſts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
Preached in the Congregation of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
either without Hair, or with a Peruke on;
neither was there any Notable Preachment at any
time had among the Quakers, the Author whereof
was not eſteemed to be a Jeſuit; and this was ſo
rooted in the Thoughts and Imaginations of moſt
Men, that if any one knew it not, he was looked
upon as ignorant of the Publick Affairs; if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
it, as Impudent, or a Papiſt or Jeſuit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
born to Lye, and to Cheat: And they offer
this as an Argument of ſuch Practices, which made
the ſame find a more eaſie belief; to wit, that the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50388:98"/>
Papiſts did ſo, as well, becauſe that hereby, they
might avoid Swearing, as the Quakers were moſt
averſe to ſuch Oaths, and ſo ſhould ſwear nothing
againſt the Honour and Intereſt of their Religion,
as that ſo they might catch and allure the unwary
by their Artificial and cunning Speeches. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I have heard, a long time after being in
Company with ſome <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and amongſt
ſome Quakers, theſe Men complaining, that even
then ſuch Diſcourſes were bandied about concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Jeſuits mixing with the Quakers, and that
they durſt not contradict them. I'll go a little
further; ſome time after, ſome, I know not who,
according to their Jeſuitical way and diſpoſition,
that wrote Foxes and Fire-brands, urging that
there was a certain Jeſuit that had lurked and
taught among the Quakers for Twenty Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
but as often as I have put this thing to the
Quakers, they have anſwered, That there could be
nothing upon this Head found more falſly, or
more fooliſhly, and that they could never find any
thing that was like it, or ſmelled of it; but yet it
is ſtrange, how much Envy and Hatred this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
contracted to theſe Men, who followed this
Sect and Conſtitution; and certainly there is no
Year ſo Memorable and Note-worthy for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of theſe Men, than this of Sixty Four;
for ſeeing that neither thoſe who were in Priſon,
that they might be ſet free, nor thoſe at Liberty,
that they might prevent their Impriſonment, could
be brought of that Mind, as to be willing to Swear;
and that thoſe who were free, would by no means
ceaſe to hold their Aſſemblies, and that in greater
Numbers than the Law allowed, and that many
times they went ſo far, that they left their homes,
and went out of the Bounds of the Kingdom.
They were indeed in ſome places very ſeverely
handled, and in other places, over and above their
hard Treatment, ſeeing that all places were filled
with Priſoners, they ordered them into Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50388:98"/>
and drove them, as the noiſom and horrible
Peſt of the Kingdom, into the uttermoſt Parts of
the Earth. The City of <hi>London</hi> had none of the
leaſt ſhare in this Perſecution, where beſides the
Oppreſſions and daily Violences offered by the
meaner ſort and ſcum of the People, as well as by
the Soldiery, who ſtrenuouſly rejoyced in ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and as having no regard of their own, ſo did
more lightly ſet by other Mens Lives, and who
every where waited for them in their Meetings, and
did ever and anon by the Magiſtrate's Command,
hale away many of them, yea, ſometimes an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
together, and drive them before them like a
Flock of Sheep, and throw them into Priſons, but
not into thoſe that were next at hand, and more at
large, wherein however they might have been ſafe
enough kept, and that in a gentle and kind manner,
but into one common Priſon, called <hi>Newgate,</hi> the
Receptacle of Thieves, Rogues, Highway-men,
and Cut-throats, as if they had been their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
and Aſſociates in their Villainies and Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the Scum and Off-ſcouring of the People,
where they were crouded up like Beaſts, ready to
be ſtifled, and languiſhing with the Infection of
ſuch a place: Whence ſome of them, being ſo
ſtreightned and terrified with the place, and their
pernicious and profligate Company, that they
might enjoy a freer Air, and the ſight of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
ſtood Night and Day either guarded in the
Yard, or elſe got up to the top of the place, where,
being not ſufficiently clad, were very much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded
by the Cold and ſharpneſs of the Air; and ſo
many of them, them, through the Inconveniencies, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Fatigues, and Stench they were expoſed to,
were much weakened, and fell ſick, ſome were
waſted throughout in ſuch a manner, as that they
ſeemed to be meer Sceletons, and lead a Life more
intolerable than Death it ſelf; and others that
could not endure the Miſery, died, whoſe Corps,
when their Friends and Kindred deſired they might
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50388:99"/>
have to bury (though in vain) were privily Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Keepers. Some of them being ſick,
and diſcharged therefore out of Priſon, ſoon after,
their Diſtempers increaſing more and more upon
them, died. Of whom there were two, whoſe
Corps in the dead of the Night, ſoon after their
Deceaſe, and when their Friends had ſcarce lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their Death, comforted one another, and gone
to thier Reſt, were taken away by Guards and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
(having broke open the Doors for that end)
ſent by ſome of the Magiſtrates, and againſt their
Friends conſent, gave them a Chriſtian Burial;
and this induces me, deſigning otherwiſe to uſe not
many Examples, to add this one notwithſtanding,
eſpecially becauſe of the oddneſs of the thing, and
not unworthy to be known. Some Quakers at
<hi>Scarborough</hi> in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> met together in
the Houſe of <hi>John Biſhop,</hi> one of their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
and Society; ſome of the Townſmen ſet
upon them, and take ſeveral of the Quakers, and
upon this Condition would grant them to depart
freely, that every one of them ſhould pay Half a
Crown for his Offence; which Money when all of
them refuſed to pay, not for the Money, which
was not much, but becauſe that in ſo doing they
might ſeem to incur ſuch a Penalty, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
themſelves to have been juſtly amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
they were all put into Cuſtody; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Man's Name was <hi>Biſhop,</hi> in whoſe Houſe
they met together, there was from thence a Story
raiſed in <hi>England,</hi> and from thence diſperſed into
other Foreign Countries, that the Quakers in that
Iſland had pulled down the Biſhop's Houſe, to
whom belong'd the Adminiſtration of all Matters
in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs there. There was one <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla
Moe</hi> by Name, preſent in this Company afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
a Widow Woman; of whom Money being
demanded, as of the reſt, and ſhe at the ſame,
and in like manner looking not ſo much upon the
Sum it ſelf, as that ſhe ſhould ſeem to make her
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50388:99"/>
ſelf Criminal, if ſhe parted with it upon ſuch an
Account; and ſo did ſtedfaſtly, as all her Friends
had done, reject their Demand, ſhe was with them
thrown into Priſon, though ſhe was very weak and
infirm, where not long after ſhe died. Next day
her Friends the Quakers prepare to carry away the
Corps, and to bury it in their own Burying-place,
they had purchaſed for that purpoſe; but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Town would not ſuffer it, and ſo
Commanding them to leave that to him, he takes
care to have her buryed in a Chriſtian manner, to
the great regret, and ſore againſt the will of thoſe
Men; for the Quakers did not reprehend this, that
they buryed their own Dead ſo, but this they took
very hainouſly, and troubled them much, that they
were not entruſted with the Affairs of their Dead,
whoſe Lives, and all their Concerns were within
their Care, and that they durſt not diſcharge that
laſt Office of Piety towards them, according to
their own Will and Mode, and that their Enemies
carryed their Friends Corps with ſo many Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and Circumſtances of their own, Prayers, and
other Acts of ſuch like Devotion, into hallowed
and conſecrated Ground, which they then call a
Chriſtin Burial, and the juſt Funeral Solemnities
of a Chriſtian; which concernedneſs and anxiety
of theirs is indeed very ſtrange, as if the Quakers
themſelves did believe that their Chaſt and Holy
Bodies were defiled with theſe Rites, and in theſe
Places, and they ſo abhorred the Superſtition
of others, as to favour another Superſtition; for
according to their own Confeſſion the Dead have no
ſenſe or feeling, neither is it any matter where they
rot. Theſe Men moreover did more eſpecially take
ill, and grievouſly complain of this; that ſeeing
their Adverſaries did ſo ſhun their Friends that died
before for their Religion, Faith, Manners, and
Actions, and deteſted ſome of them, and that now
they were dead, they perſiſted in the ſame Temper
to the laſt gaſp of their breath, and died ſo, yet
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50388:100"/>
that there were ſome of them, who when they
gave them Chriſtian Burial, as they called it, did
not only judge them worthy of the Name, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of the Honour and Memory of Chriſtians, yea,
and in the reciting of their Funeral Rites and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities,
praiſed them as Members of their own
and the Chriſtian Church. And this has ſuggeſted
another matter, of which I ſhall mention; this
from the very firſt riſe of theſe Men, has ſeemed to
them to be altogether unfit and unbecoming honeſt
and ſincere Perſons, and eſpecially Chriſtians, to
make ſuch ſplendid Preparations in the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Funeral Obſequies, that they ſeemed
to be more like unto the Pomps of fine Shews and
Triumphs, than Funerals, wherein together with
Life all Worldly Glory paſſeth away; and namely,
that they are often ſet off with ſo much Ornament
and Company, with ſuch Oſtentation and Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of Face and Habit, implying Sorrow, whenas
they in the mean time rejoice in their Boſoms, and
ſometimes when they return, Rejoice and Revel;
and that others who take Pleaſure to ſee ſuch days
as theſe, follow the reſt; yea, ſome Sots and Gluttons,
and ſuch as have had no Invitation, come and glut
themſelves, and very often poor needy People, who
are in extream want of Money, indulge themſelves
upon ſuch occaſions, and ſpend the remainder of
their Subſtance: Whereas on the contrary, theſe
Men have uſed, and do ſtill uſe to demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
modeſtly in providing for the Funerals of
their Friends, to wit, in conveying the Corps into
ſuch places as are convenient and adapted for that
purpoſe, not into conſecrated Ground, left they
ſhould be thought to partake of the Superſtition
of their Aſhes in the leaſt; neither have they any
Ornaments, nor any Enſigns of Lamentation or
Mourning, nor do they wear any balck Claths,
beſides what they are daily wont to do; neither do
they uſe any Junkettings, but only both before and
after think upon the Mortal ſtate of all Men, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50388:100"/>
every one of his own in particular, and how in a ſhort
time every one muſt enter upon that Journey unto
Eternity, from which there is no returning, and
commit this to their Heart and Memory, and excite
one another to the ſtudy of an Honeſt and Pious
Life, that his Death may be anſwerable thereunto.
And that I may add this further, which is not to
be omitted, but not therefore to be extended to
many: It's a wonder, how much hatred alſo the
odd and different way of managing and carrying
their Funerals, and what ſtorms of Reproaches
and Trouble it brought upon the Quakers; they
themſelves Report, that the dead Carkaſſes of their
Friends were dug up again, and buryed in other
places; and all this laſted till the next Year after
this, wherein that Memorable Plague raged, and
when the Quakers had free Liberty to Bury in their
own Places, and perform their Funeral Rites as
they themſelves pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>And ſeeing I have ſaid thus much concerning the
Burials of theſe Men, I ſhall take the Liberty to
add this one paſſage more concerning them: There
was a certain Man, whoſe Name was <hi>Oliver Athar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
of the Pariſh of <hi>Ormskirk,</hi> who, becauſe he
would not pay Tythes, was put into the Common
Goal of <hi>Derby</hi> by the Counteſs of <hi>Derby,</hi> where,
after a long Impriſonment, the Man died; the
Quakers having Liberty granted them, carry the
Corps away, and paſſing through ſome Streets into
the place where he had dwelt, there bury him, and
in the mean time ſet up pieces of Paper on Poles
in all thoſe places, with this written thereon,
whereby they extolled. <hi>Oliver</hi> as a Martyr, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed
the Counteſs, as being guilty of Murder:
<hi>This is</hi> Olliver Atharton, <hi>of</hi> Ormskirk, <hi>perſecuted
to Death by the Counteſs of</hi> Derby, <hi>becauſe he would
not pay her Tythes:</hi> After which, when that the
Counteſs in a few days after died in like manner,
and was carryed the ſame way to be buried, the
Quakers made alſo a Miracle of this her Death,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50388:101"/>
as if it had been the Effect of Divine Vengeance
and Diſpleaſure, as all are prone to Judge of the
ſudden, unexpected, and heavy Misfortunes of
their Enemies. This Year a new and odd Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
attended theſe Men, which here we ſhall a
little largely inſiſt upon. It happened in the City of
<hi>Colcheſter;</hi> I have given an Account in the Firſt Book
how the Quakers firſt came into this City, but by
this time having much increaſed in Number, they
met together daily, and could by no means be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from that their Practice and Cuſtom; at
which things the Mayor of the City did at firſt
wink, but afterward, finding them proceed in their
ways, he began to look upon this Connivance as a
diſgrace unto him, and therefore bethought himſelf
what he ought, and what he could do in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and at laſt, ſeeing that they ſtill perſiſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
he was much grieved and inflamed with Anger,
and fully determined with himſelf to Proſecute
them ſeverely. It's a fearful thing to have an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
and an armed Enemy. It happened on the
<hi>25th.</hi> day of <hi>October,</hi> being the Lord's Day, that
many of the Quakers were met together in a Houſe,
to Worſhip God according to their way, which
when the Mayor came to hear, being eager with a
deſire to Puniſh them, he haſted thither with his
Officers, breaks open the Houſe, ruſhes in, and in
harſh Words, but with a grave Authority, ſaid, he
came, according to the King's Laws, for to diſturb
this their Cabal and Conventicle, and immediately
without delay, charges his Followers to Apprehend
ſome of them, and lead them to Priſon, and at the
ſame time Commands the other Quakers to follow
their Companions into the ſame place, which they
quickly and readily did, not in conformity to his
Command, but of their own will and inclination:
After this, the ſame Officers on the Nine and
Twentieth Day of the ſame Month, in purſuance
to their Maſter's Command, return and repeat the
ſame thing with great Care and Diligence. But
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50388:101"/>
when the Quakers on the Firſt day of the next
Month and Week met together again, the ſame
Officer adviſes what to do, and does himſelf with
his Guard undertake the ſame thing as before, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades
and ſets upon the Houſe, where many Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
again, not expecting his Command, knowing
already what his Will was, go away into the ſame
Priſons; and becauſe that the reſt of them did for
all this meet again together on the Tenth Day of
the ſaid Month, there came either by the Command,
or certainly by the Permiſſion of the Governour,
part of the County Troop, and theſe violently ruſh
upon the Aſſembly, take ſome of them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
them to Priſon, beat and thump others, and
beſides ranſacked the Place, rent and pull down
the Seats, Windows, and every thing elſe beſides
the Walls and Rafters; when this was done, the
Governour ſet one of the Gang, that lived not far
from the Houſe where the Quakers met together,
at the Door, for to hinder them with Words and
Threats for to Meet there, if they were not minded
to fall from one Calamity unto another; whom,
when they would not reſiſt, they all ſtood in the
Yard in the open Air, and purſue their Worſhip
quietly, according to their uſual manner; the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Keeper does the ſame thing on the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
days, and theſe ſame Men did the ſame as they
had done before, not caring to what Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Air they were expoſed, nor to what Injuries
and Reproaches of their Enemies, nor with what
Danger they were beſet by lyers in wait for them,
and not knowing what great Evil and Miſery was
a brewing for them at this very time for their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy
and Perſeverance: For ſeeing they would
not deſiſt from their Method and Purpoſe, it came
to paſs, as if the Law and Civil Power were too
weak and feeble, that they had recourſe to the Law
of the Sword, and the Force of Arms; there were
Forty Horſemen well mounted with choice Horſe
made ready, and theſe being furniſhed with Swords,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50388:102"/>
Carabines, and Piſtols, as they are wont to be, they
drew nigh, that if ſo be they ſhould again attempt
any ſuch thing, they were forthwith to fall upon
them, and put them under Military Execution, ſo
as that they did not kill them outright. The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
come again together on the Fifth of <hi>December,</hi>
upon which this Troop approach, and ſeeing the
Quakers, did immediately with drawn Swords, like
ſtout Soldiers, as if they aſſaulted armed Men, but
ſuch as few of them had ever done, gallop up with
full ſpeed unto them, and then crying aloud, as if
that were the Signal, <hi>What a Devil do you do here?</hi>
They ſet upon them, beat, knock, and wound
ſome of them with their Swords and Muſkets, ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
neither the tender Age, nor Female Sex, nor the
grey and wrinkled, and drove them from one place
into another; and ſome that met them, even far
from the place, and whom they took to be Quakers,
were ſeized by them, and ſeverely handled; ſome
who had eſcaped ſafe to their Homes from this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Uſage, had their Doors broke open, and were
hardly uſed there; but neither did this alſo deter
them from Meeting together again, but they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
next day to the ſame place, whither came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the ſame number of Horſemen armed ſome of
them, beſides the Inſtruments already mentioned,
with heavy-headed Clubs, and ſo ſet upon them,
throw them upon the Ground, beat them, and
handle them with ſuch a Violence, that they drew
Blood from many of them, ſome they left as if
they had been dead upon the Ground, and had
died, had it not been for the Citizens, who being
moved with Compaſſion, received ſome of them
into their Houſes, and took care of them; ſome
were ſo uſed, that they could not lift an Hand to
their Mouths, yea, and could not uſe any Member
of their Body for a long time after. There was
one of the Horſemen who ſtruck at one of them
with ſo much violence, that he ſhook his Blade out
of the Hilt, which when the Quaker perceived, he
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50388:102"/>
gives it up to his ſmiter, ſaying, <hi>Take thine own,
but as for me, that which is ours and a Chriſtian's
part, I beſeech and pray to God, that the work of this
day may not be laid to thy Charge.</hi> And ſo on the
one ſide, Fury and Cruelty, and on the other, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
and Gentleneſs ſeemed to outvie one another.
But all this Violence could not yet repreſs the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
and Purpoſes of theſe Men: And ſo they
met again another day, whereupon the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are ſent to them alſo, being now looked upon
as the beſt and ſureſt Chaſtiſers and Puniſhers of
theſe Men, who ſet upon them, and handle them
according to their wonted manner; and while the
Quakers endeavour, as every one beſt could, to
eſcape, they purſue them even to their very Houſes.
And when theſe Men could not ſtill be diverted
from their way and purpoſe, but that they met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
on the Twenty Seventh day again, the ſame
Troop came up with, and before they ſet upon
them, they placed Sentinels at the Paſſes to ſtop
their going out, whereupon the Horſemen, to the
number of Thirty Six, break in upon them, and
with their Clubs and Muskets ſo beat and bruiſe
the Limbs and Heads of theſe People, with ſuch
hard blows, and ſome of them receiving even an
Hundred, that there was ſcarce any part of their
Body free from Wounds and Bruiſes; and ſeeing there
were ſome of them who ſought to eſcape their hands
by flight, they fell in the Avenues into the power of
the Sentinels, and were as ſeverely handled as the
reſt; and thoſe Puniſhers and Chaſtiſers intermixt
ſo many Maledictions and Curſes with theſe things,
that the Quakers, who are a People of few words,
and ſuch as are awful and modeſt, affirmed, that
they were not ſo much hurt with their Swords and
Clubs in their Bodies, as they were troubled
at their wicked Words in their Hearts. Theſe Men
were now ſo hardned with all theſe Tryals and Evils,
that they were not only not moved in the leaſt
thereat, but alſo looked upon whatever they ſuffered
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50388:103"/>
as pleaſant and glorious, being as it were a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
for their Religion. They again Meet on
another day, to the Number of Sixty Perſons, with
a ſtedfaſt and firm Reſolution of Mind, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be put under the bittereſt Tryals and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
at what time a Company of People, partly
on Horſeback, and the reſt on Foot, all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſet upon them in a Tumultuous, Boiſterous,
and Clamorous manner, and whomſoever they
catched, they knock'd down to the Ground with
their Arms, and did ſo beat and aſſail ſome of them,
and made them ſo weak and infirm, that they could
not for a long time ſtir their Limbs for the uſe of
their Bodies. Yet this Outrage could not bring
theſe Men to take better Advice, and change their
Purpoſe; wherefore the Forty Troopers were ſent
again againſt them, who thinking they could not
be forced by the former Arms they had uſed, do
now drive very ſharp Nails into the ends of their
Clubs, wherewith they might repel them, and ſo
when the Quakers returned boldly to their Place of
Worſhip on the Sixth of <hi>November,</hi> they ſet upon
them, and with horrid Curſes and Railleries beat
them all from all ſides, and ſeparate ſome of them
from the reſt: Here a certain Widow, and an Old
Woman, received Twelve Wounds, and another
Woman was wounded to her very Reins. This
Perſecution laſted ſix Weeks. From thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Governour took another Courſe; and firſt
of all indeed according to his former manner, but
now accompanyed with the Recorder of the City,
and ſome Officers, goes to the places where the
Quakers were to Meet together, breaks the Doors
open, and goes in, and as ſoon as any of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
entred, diſperſed them; at another time, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
uſe of gentler Remedies, he Commands them,
and leſt they ſhould not do it, in the King's Name,
to be gone; to which they made Anſwer, <hi>That they
were full of Duty towards the King, but that they
loved God, the King of Kings, more, who commanded
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50388:103"/>
that no one ſhould forbear to Worſhip him when they
had time and place.</hi> This the Governour interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
either as the greateſt Ignominy, or the utmoſt
Contumacy, and thinking neither of them was to
be endured, renews his former ſevere Methods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, which he had for ſome time intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and ſends Soldiers, who ſhould drive them
from the places where they were, by thruſting, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and ſmiting of them. But when he ſtill
found that he neither could by all his Devices, and
ſo many Tryals, do any good, nor was able to bridle
them, but that they were of that Mind and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
either to live with this Freedom of Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, or to ſuffer Death for it, he choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at laſt to ceaſe, and give over taking any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of them. Theſe things which are worthy of
Admiration, and which might ſeem to be ſet forth
at large by the Quakers by way of Accuſation, I
take notice of not only from their own Relations
of themſelves, but alſo from the Teſtimonies of
others, and of the moſt ſober Chriſtians of that
City; moreover, there was no Citizen, who had any
ſenſe of Pity and Humanity about him, that did not
expreſs his Indignation, Diſ-approbation, and alſo
Deteſtation of the great Severity uſed againſt them.</p>

                     <p>SO Eager and Reſolute they were for the
maintenance of their Religion, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and publick meetings, that mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
all the ſevere Laws enacted againſt
them, all the miſeries they had already
undergone, and the future evils impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on their heads, yet they never intermitted
ſo much as <hi>one day</hi> from aſſembling together,
and managing religious concerns. Nay, ſo far
were they from being diſpirited by the great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
and miſeries they lay under, that from the
loweſt to the greateſt they ſeem'd to be harden'd
and confirm'd againſt the greateſt puniſhments
whatſoever: as if all their misfortunes and diſaſters
had been means rather to excite and encourage
their boldneſs, than to enfeeble or repreſs the ſame.
So that now there was no remedy left to reſtrain
them, ſave <hi>cloſe impriſonment.</hi> But becauſe it was
difficult and hard to detain them all in perpetual
priſon; It was at laſt reſolv'd that they ſhould
not only be baniſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but from the whole kingdom; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50388:106"/>
                        <hi>Engliſh;</hi> where they ſhould be condemn'd to the
ſame ſervice and ſlavery that the <hi>barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
of that Country are; who are a people ſo
ſtiffneck'd and ſtubborn that neither levity of
treatment can break them, nor ſeverity of
puniſhment ſcare from their barbarous cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms;
ſo that by an <hi>inveterate and immoveable</hi>
deſpair they break all the bounds of Temperance
and Reverence among the Chriſtians. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there were ſeveral <hi>decrees made in ſeveral
Courts</hi> and Judicatories at one and the ſame time
about the <hi>Captive Quakers:</hi> (that is, thoſe of
them that were refractory and obſtinate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
puniſhment could move to deſiſt from their
diſallowable practices; for there were ſome of
'em that after having been three, four, or five
ſeveral times diſmiſs'd and ſet at liberty, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to their former vomit) that they ſhould
be ſever'd from the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> World by
being tranſported to <hi>Barbado</hi>'s and <hi>Jamaica,</hi> where
the Garriſons and Forts were ſtrong enough to
oppoſe them and ſtiffle their deſigns; and where
there was no great fear of any danger that could
ariſe from their commotions. And that they
might be depriv'd of any ſupport or comfort
from <hi>conjugal love or fellowſhip,</hi> they order'd the
women and men to be ſeparated and tranſported
to ſeparate Colonies. But the term of their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
did not exceed <hi>ſeven years.</hi> And this
favour was likewiſe indulg'd them, that whoever
would pay one hundred pounds <hi>Engliſh</hi> for his
offence ſhould redeem himſelf from being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.
But it was never heard that any of
them attempted this manner of redemption.—I
ſhall here mention only two examples, the one
remarkable for <hi>inſolence,</hi> the other for the place
and manner of <hi>Judgment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt Was in <hi>Hereford</hi> Town, where one
and twenty of 'em were kept in Priſon, (of
which ſixteen were <hi>Married Perſons,</hi> and very
comfortably match'd to loving conſorts,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50388:106"/>
of their frequent meetings and Religious

                        </gap>onventicles; who had been before try'd and
condemn'd in a Convention of the County, and
were afterwards ſentenc'd to ſuffer the aforeſaid
Exportation, by a Court held in every reſpective
County. The <hi>Quakers</hi> relate that all things
were done very ſuperficially in the latter, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of tryal being made ſure only for faſhon
ſake, as if they would not repine or reverſe the
Sentences formerly caſt againſt them in other
Courts; or as if the matter had been ſo plain
that there was no further place left for the guilty
to put up defences; ſo that all things were ready
for paſſing Sentence. The <hi>Witneſſes</hi> that had been
Examin'd before, depon'd that they ſaw the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
aſſembled together at that place, from
whence they were brought to Priſon; and
that in this their aſſembly, they were ſitting
quiet and mute without any ſpeaker. The <hi>Quakers</hi>
made no diſpute upon the matter, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
That as they us'd to do at all other times,
they had then met together, not tumultuouſly,
nor after any unhandſom manner. However, this
was accounted a Crime ſufficient to demerit ſuch
a puniſhment. The <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay, That when the
Preſident of the Court, <hi>Henry Chany,</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
Sentence of Tranſportation againſt them,
his Countenance bewray'd great trouble of mind,
and the words he ſpoke were very faint and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid,
as if the Injuſtice of the Sentence had ſtruck
him with fear and confuſion. This they obſerv'd;
and indeed they are men very apt and ready to
make their Obſervations, and commemorate the
ſame for infallible Truths. However, this Judg
having pronounced Sentence, interrogates them all,
if they were willing to redeem themſelves at the
price ſet, allowing them the next night to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
upon it; Which night (as they write them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
they ſpent not in conſulting one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what Anſwer to give; but in <hi>ſecure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
ſleep,</hi> as being conſcious to themſelves of
no evil thing they had done, which ſelf conſcious
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50388:107"/>
innocence devoided them of fear, and encourag'd
them readily and chearfully to undergo all the
Afflictions that might befal them. In the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
being call'd before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Judicatory to give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the queſtion put to them the preceeding
day, they reply'd to the Judge, interrogating them
a freſh, that they would pay nothing, and tho
they had a hundred lives they would not redeem
them for a hundred pence; ſo far were they from
offering or promiſing ſo many pounds.</p>
                     <p>Some few days after that two Courts were held
at <hi>London</hi> about the ſame buſineſs, which may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the <hi>Metropolitans</hi> of all the others held
on this account, as <hi>London</hi> is of that Kingdom.
The Deciſions and Judgments of theſe Councils
were very various, as the exit teſtify'd. The
<hi>Quakers</hi> being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> up in Priſon for having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated
themſelves in publick Crowds, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
perſiſting in the ſame irregularity; were
arraign'd before the Court, and accus'd of having
tranſgreſs'd the Laws, in meeting and preaching
to more than five at a time, in contempt of the
King and the Laws of the Realm; that tho they
met together for worſhipping God, yet their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of worſhip was diſſonant from the Liturgy
and Canons of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and that
tho they deſign'd to advance mutual concord
among themſelves by their frequent Conventicles,
yet they tended to raiſe diſcord &amp; ſedition amongſt
the People. The informers and delaters againſt
them were moſtly the Magiſtrates Servants and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
or the Keepers of Priſons and ſuchlike, who
yet teſtified nothing againſt them, ſave that they
found them aſſembled together, tho they did not
hear any ſpeaking amongſt them; or that they
were deliver'd to them by the Meſſengers who
apprehended 'em; or that they ſaw them brought
into Priſon. Unto which the <hi>Quakers</hi> reply'd, that
they did not deny their being together; but that
they deſir'd it might be proved that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregating
together was upon any ſuch wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50388:107"/>
as to ſhew contempt of the King and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
which was the crime laid to their
Charge, and upon which they were then call'd
in queſtion. They added likewiſe, that they did
not deny their meeting together in greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
than five; which if it was contrary to the
King's commands, was excuſable in them, ſince
they were bound to obey the Commands of God,
and give ear to his voice alone, tho Kings and all
Men on Earth ſhould Countermand the ſame;
And as to the Liturgy of <hi>England,</hi> they reply'd,
that if it contain'd any thing contrary to the
<hi>Divine Will,</hi> it was to be put in the ſame ballance
with the Kings Laws, when of the ſame ſtrain;
and ſo could not be urg'd upon them as a rule to
walk by; Beſides, that the Liturgy did not forbid,
nay, commanded to Worſhip God after the ſame
manner that they did, <hi>viz. In Spirit and in Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Jurymen after having underſtood the whole
matter how it ſtood, did not all ſo freely tell their
minds as they might have done; nor were they all
equally forward and ready to decide the matter;
ſome pleading, that it being an intricate caſe they
were doubtful and uncertain how to determine it;
others refuſing poſitively to Judge of it, as being
a moſt important and momentous affair. But
all the Judges unanimouſly concentred in this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that ſuch Religious Meetings as were not
conform to the Modes of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
or exceeded the number of five, were unlawful;
and that theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> (whatſoever was their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in Meeting, be it good o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ill) had celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſuch unlawful Meetings and perſiſted to do
the ſame ſtill; which they openly and Judicially
acknowledged, ſo that no place was left for atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
the crime, or alleviating the puniſhment;
wherefore they were all guilty of a Capital crime.
And whereas ſome of theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> were marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
others were ſingle perſons, in ſome Courts the
ſentence was that the former ſhould pay a fine of
ſo many pounds, or ſuffer a years Impriſonment;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50388:108"/>
and the latter be Tranſported to the <hi>American
Iſlands,</hi> to do ſlavery in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies there:
In other Courts they were all promiſcuouſly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to be Tranſported; Yet ſo as in ſome
Courts Liberty was given to thoſe that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
ſentence of Baniſhment, (in ſome places to
them all, but elſewhere only to the Boys and
Girls) to chooſe whether they would rather be
Tranſported, or ſtay in <hi>England,</hi> and frequent the
publick Churches to hear Sermon; which they all
unanimouſly rejected; ſome of 'em returning this
anſwer, that they wondred how the Judges ſhould
propoſe ſuch an offer, ſince they all knew very
well that if any of the <hi>Quakers</hi> came that length
as to embrace their Propoſal, it would not be
from a ſincere love to the Church, or their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
but through Hypocriſy and Diſſimulation,
which in Religious matters is the moſt heinous
and ſuperlative crime that can be Committed.
In fine, ſince the <hi>Quakers</hi> continued ſo obſtinate
in rejecting all offers made by the Judges, they
likewiſe continued ſtedfaſt in ordering their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to be put in Execution againſt them. The
firſt Court that took this affair into Cogniſance,
was held about the middle of <hi>October, William
Proctor</hi> being choſen preſident: The Jurymen
were unwilling and refractory to meddle with it,
which Created a great deal of trouble to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
At this time there were twelve receiv'd ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Tranſportation, partly Men, of which
ſome very ancient, ſome very young, partly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
among whom was one Girl under ſixteen
years of Age. Another Court was held the ſame
very month, to which <hi>Robert Hide</hi> preſided. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
aroſe betwixt the Judges and Jurymen,
for that the latter were ſlow and backward to
decide the matter. At length after they had
reaſon'd and debated among themſelves about the
nature of the Crime, the matter of fact, and the
tenor of the Law, they with one voice gave in
this Reſolution, that theſe men were guilty of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50388:108"/>
having kept Conventicles; but that they could
not determine whether they kept ſuch Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
as here repugnant to the rites and cuſtoms of
the Church, or what was their intention in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
By which ſentence they thought they freed
themſelves from any further trouble in the affair:
But the Judges began to debate with ſome of
them about the Religion of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and at
laſt to threaten them openly; and <hi>cited ſix of
the twelve</hi> to appear before the King to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what they had done; the ſix were not
at all affraid, perſiſting in their opinion, in favour
of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> which they thought it their duty
not to revoke from. Upon which the Court was
diſmiſs'd for that occaſion; and the matter left
undecided, yet it ſate again that ſame very day;
but Judge <hi>Hide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> did not ſit, the Lord Mayor ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
his place; and then it was determin'd
(<hi>nemine contra dicente</hi>) that they were guilty of
moſt heinous Crimes, unworthy to live in their
Country, and therefore to be baniſh'd to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
bounds of the Remorter Earth. Among
them was a <hi>Boy in Coats</hi> (being ſo very young)
who being ask'd if he would not ſwear that he
was not ſixteen years old, had not the Ripeneſs
enough of Judgment to give a grave and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Anſwer, but reply'd, that no Man could
<hi>Remember the Day of his Birth, and that he was
not born for, nor train'd up in Swearing.</hi> On this
occaſion Eighteen were condemn'd to the ſame
puniſhment of being Tranſported.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The next Court</hi> was held in <hi>December, Hide</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding;
in which, without any diſſention, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Opinions, they condemn'd <hi>Two and Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
to be turn'd out of all their Poſſeſſions and
Enjoyments, and baniſh'd their Countrey. One
of theſe Two and Thirty boldly deſir'd leave of
the Judges to <hi>ask One Queſtion;</hi> which being
granted, he tells them, <hi>That they were conſtituted
Judges to reſolve him and others about dubious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>
which they acknowledg'd to be true. Then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50388:109"/>
he asks of them, ſince the cauſe of his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was his frequenting the Meetings of the
Quakers, and abſenting from the Publick Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
and ſince the Commands of God enjoyn'd
the former, and the Laws of Men conſtrain'd the
latter, which would they have him obey, or what
would they adviſe him to do? The Judges gave
no anſwer, either becauſe they durſt not anſwer
contrary to their own Conſciences, or becauſe
they would not ſeem by their Judgment to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
a Law eſtabliſh'd and confirm'd by ſo many
Judgments paſs'd upon the ſame Affair. Some
of theſe condemn'd both in this and other Courts,
demanded (by their Solicitors, as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
to have a Copy of the Judges Sentenco,
that they might conſider it, and anſwer diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to each Article of the ſame: but it was deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, leſt by protracting and pretending this
for an Excuſe of further Delay, they ſhould ſeem
to elude the Law. Wherefore ſome of them, as
ſoon as they open'd their mouths in their own
defence, were inſtantly carried away.</p>
                     <p>Another Court was held upon this account that
ſame month, Judge <hi>Hide</hi> preſiding; in which the
Judgment was ſummary and compendious: For
ſince the Accuſed did not deny their congrega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, the confeſſion of this was accounted
an acknowledgment of the Crime, and without
any further Enquiry, or Proof, they were forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
adjudg'd to undergo the ſame puniſhment.
There was a <hi>Widow</hi> among the reſt, a Mother of
Three Children, who (while the reſt were alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That they were not found guilty of any Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
in the manner and deſign of their aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
for the Act it ſelf they did not deny) cry'd
out, That ſhe was moſt unjuſtly accus'd not only
of the Crime, but of the Fact it ſelf; and that
it would be a wicked and ſcandalous Action to
inflict upon her ſuch a Puniſhment which ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
deſerv'd; fot that ſhe was only ſtanding at
the Doors of the Houſe where the Quakers (her
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50388:109"/>
Friends and Neighbours) were aſſembled, and
had not yet entred in, when the Sergeants and
Officers laying violent Hands upon her, drew her
into the Houſe. Upon which, one of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
turning himſelf to the Jurymen (for they are
upon Oath when they give Judgment, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
caution is to be us'd after the taking of an
Oath) accoſts them thus, <hi>That they would think
upon God the ſupreme Judge Omnipreſent, and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient,
and on Conſcience the Judge within them;</hi>
And not imagine to themſelves that the times, or
the neceſſity of doing ſo, or ſo, would be a ſolid
excuſe for 'em, or to take Encouragement from
any other reſpect whatſoever. Which injected
ſome terror and ſcruple into their minds, ſome of
them anſwering, that things were now come to
that length that they could not help what they
did. At this time they condemn'd <hi>twenty to the
ſame</hi> puniſhment. <hi>Another Court</hi> was held in
<hi>January,</hi> in which alſo Judge <hi>Hide</hi> preſided, for
all this affair was totally devolv'd upon him, as
being the ableſt and experteſt of his function in
<hi>England.</hi> They condemn'd <hi>thirty two</hi> after the
ſame manner as the former, to be ſever'd from
their Friends, poſſeſſions and all Commerce with
their native Country, by being baniſh'd into theſe
remoter Plantations. In <hi>February</hi> there enſued
two more, (onely Counſellor <hi>Wachlon</hi> preſiding
in the firſt, and <hi>Windham</hi> in the latter. The
former condem'd twenty four; the latter ten
Men and Women; both to undergo the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
proſcription. There was ſome among
them who alledg'd that at that time, when the
Conventicle was kept, at which they were accus'd,
and ſaid to have been preſent, they were in places
far diſtant from it, but all Defences and Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were in vain. So that in this one City the
Principal of the whole Kingdom, ſo many of this
Society as were Charg'd to be ſeditious, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and tumultuating, were not allowed to breath
in their native Air; of which they were ſaid to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50388:110"/>
be unworthy, and confin'd to theſe Solitary diſtant
Colonies of the <hi>New World,</hi> to be there hardly us'd,
and oblig'd to truckle, with the native <hi>Barbarians</hi>
to all manner of ſervile work; this being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the moſt effectual way for allaying their fury
and quelling the reſtleſs Commotions of their
Spirits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>relate, that in ſome of theſe Courts,
there happen'd a Remarkable inſtance, as at</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford;
<hi>that while they read over the ſentence
given againſt the</hi> Quakers, <hi>they did it with ſo
much Conſternation, Heſitation and Slowneſs of
Speech, that of all the multitude ſtanding by,
there was none could tell what was read. They
tell likewiſe of the</hi> firſt witneſs, <hi>or informer
againſt them at theſe Courts, that from that
time that he appear'd againſt them, he never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
either peace of mind, or health of body,
but loſing all appetite to meat, ſhortly afterwards
pin'd away and Died. All theſe</hi> obſervables <hi>are
accounted by the</hi> Quakers <hi>to be a ſignification of
the Divine wrath againſt them, It being uſual for
Men when in Adverſity, to make curious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
and Reflections upon thoſe things, that
in Proſperity might have paſt without being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of; which they then interpret favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
for themſelves, as tending to their comfort
and ſupport, and ſignifying the wrath and anger
of the Almighty, againſt the Actions of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.
I have not inſerted the Names of theſe
perſecuted</hi> Quakers, <hi>becauſe it would have been
tedious to mention all their Names; and alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious
to name ſome of 'em, whether they
place their Glory or their ſhame in this their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
This ſevere and intollerable Affliction
had that effect upon them (As all afflictions
have, even upon Children, the moſt rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
of Eloquence) that thoſe who formerly
were mute and uncapable to ſay any thing to the
purpoſe in their Defence, now became talka<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ive
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50388:110"/>
and ready in their diſcourſes; Inſomuch that
both the Afflicted themſelves, and alſo their
Friends and Relations who were touch'd with
pity and brotherly Compaſſion, for their hard lot,
were heard frequently to expreſs themſelves after
this Manner;</hi> That it was juſt for Evil doers to be
ill treated; But they who offended no Man were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
by all; that what all other People praiſe and
applaud themſelves in, was imputed to them as a
ſuperlative Crime; what they accounted vertuous
and worthy of a Reward in themſelves, they had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
puniſh'd and perſecuted in them, <hi>viz.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
in Religion and Faith. This ſeems (ſay they)
to be ſuch a Metamorphoſis and Renverſement of
things, as cannot but prove matter of Wonder and
Aſtoniſhment to all good and wiſe Men; that what
of old was deem'd for a hainous Crime, ſhould now
be Crown'd with the Testimony of vertue; what of
old was branded as Contrary to all Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws, ſhould now be eſtabliſh'd and enacted in
a Law. By this Law it is that ſuch Numbers of
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n are accus'd, examin'd, try'd, and condemn'd
by Witneſſes, Jurymen, and Judges, all fill'd with
Paſſion and Revenge; excepting only a few who
while they plainly inſinuate, that ſuch unaccountable
procedure is contrary to their mind, yet would not
openly diſcloſe their thoughts, or oppoſe the reſt of
their angry and paſſionate Companions. Moderate
puniſhments are moderately endur'd; but this of
theirs was ſo intollerable and grievous that is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d
the tortures of Hangmen, inſomuch that Death
it ſelf (even the cruelleſt) would be welcome to them
and accounted a favour. That what God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had moſt ſweetly and ſtrictly Conjoyn'd and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
together, could be ſever'd and torn aſunder
without the moſt ineffable pain of Torment. That
of this nature were the Enjoyments they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reav'd
of, and deſpair'd ever to Recover. That
the deareſt and moſt loving Friends were ſeparated
from one another, caſt out, and baniſh'd their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
their Houſes, Families, and the Society of their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50388:111"/>
Friends, Relations, and Acquaintances; Nay, the
Wives were Raviſh'd from their Husbands, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
from their Children; the Infants were ſnatch'd
from the Boſom and Embraces of their Parents;
and Sucklings pull'd from the Breaſts of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
That free Chriſtian Men were reduced to
Slavery and Bondage, and thruſt out among the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and cruel <hi>Indians,</hi> who were estrang'd from
all Religion towards God, or Humanity towards
Man. So that the Common liberty purchas'd with
ſo much labour and pains, with the Blood and Lives
of our <hi>Anceſters,</hi> and deliver'd to us their posterity,
as a moſt precious and invaluable depoſitum, not to
be parted with but with the loſs of our Lives, is now
violated and trampl'd under, in theſe very Lands
which boaſt of their happineſs in enjoying more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and liberty than other Nations. And thus it
decays a pace, leſſening by degrees, and changing its
face every day, ſo that there is juſt ground to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that what now is their lot, may afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
the whole Nation, and that thoſe who now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
and exult ſecure of their own Liberty, may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
come to bemoan the loſs of the ſame when
it is too late.</p>
                     <p>But ſince, I have already given you a taſte of
their Condemnation, it will not be amiſs to
trace their ſentence to its Execution, and take a
view of the events that enſu'd thereupon. <hi>The
firſt of all the Quakers adjudged to be baniſh'd
their livings, fortunes, and Country,</hi> and order'd
forthwith to receive the Execution of this their
ſentence, were the ſeven Condemn'd at <hi>Hereford;</hi>
from whence they were carried Priſoners to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
to embark in a Ship lying in the <hi>Thames</hi>
bound for <hi>Barbadoes.</hi> But when they came to
bargain with the Maſter of the Ship about their
Tranſportation, he believing the Men to be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
thought it not ſafe for him to carry away
his own Countrymen againſt their wills; and
therefore deny'd to do it. This his rufuſal was
ſo heavily reſented, that he was forthwith caſt into
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50388:111"/>
Priſon. But afterwards, being releas'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
more the miſery and Affliction of the
poor innocent Men, than his own diſadvantage
or Detriment, he again refus'd to do ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
thing, eſpecially that reflected ſo much
upon the fame and honour of his native Country.
But the owners of the Ship having engag'd to
carry them off, and thinking themſelves oblig'd
to fulfil their promiſe, depos'd the Maſter from
his Office. Upon which ſome other Merchants,
when they ſaw theſe Men ſo inſens'd againſt the
Maſter, that they had remov'd him from his place,
and thinking he had done as became a good and
faithful Man, in refuſing to Tranſport his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Countrymen, made him Maſter of another
Ship, better than what he had before. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
a new Maſter being put in his place, the
<hi>Quakers</hi> are deliver'd to him to be carried to
<hi>Barbadoes.</hi> But this New Maſter bethinking
himſelf afterwards what manner of men they
were, began to repent of what he had done, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
conſidering that he could gain nothing
by their Tranſportation, but a Reproach and
Scandal, eaſt upon his Name; and in fine ſets
them at liberty, giving them a Teſtimonial under
his hand, that they had not privily fled away,
but were freely diſmiſs'd by him. The <hi>Quakers</hi>
preſently ſets ſtraight homewards, and when they
arriv'd, their Friends were ſo overjoy'd that they
not only beat their Breaſts with their hands, but
likewiſe toll'd the Bell; which Alarm'd the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of the place, who having met together
and underſtanding what the matter was, ſent for
one of the ſeven to appear before them, who
told them the whole ſeries of the ſtory; upon
which they ſent for all the ſeven, ordering them
to be carried to <hi>London,</hi> and deliver'd to another
Maſter who was bound the ſame courſe; who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having ſet to Sea began to conſider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that the Men he had on board, were Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
againſt their wills, being Captives and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50388:112"/>
The ſame conſideration began to move
the Seamen; who are a ſort of Men more merciful
and compaſſionate than others; and more exora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ready to aſſiſt and relieve the miſerable
and oppreſſed; which does not flow from their
natural Inclination or Education, but from the
frequent uſe of encountring many dangers, and
being accuſtom'd to hardſhips. They began all
to call to Remembrance what they had often
heard in <hi>England,</hi> that there is a Law againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
any Man from his native Country without
his conſent, impoſing a conſiderable fine upon any
who ſhould Adventure to do the ſame; as alſo
that in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> there is a Law, enacting, that if
any Man imported an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> into that <hi>Iſland</hi>
againſt his conſent, he ſhould be liable to what
puniſhment the Governour pleas'd to inflict.
Wherefore they all refus'd to be Acceſſory to any
ſuch Crime, which was Repugnant to the dictates
of their Conſciences, and liable to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orce of
both Laws, in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Barbadoes.</hi> It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
likewiſe that the wind prov'd contrary,
and every thing croſs, as they were upon the Sea,
for a long time. Which Alarm'd the Seamen mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
inclining them to believe that it was a certain
ſign of Divine wrath againſt them, for exporting
their Countrymen (as the ignorant Vulgar are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ready to preſage ſome fatal men from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of any thing that is ſtrange or unuſual) in
ſo much, that they aſſur'd the Maſter of the Ship,
that unleſs he would let theſe Men go, they would
not manage the Ship, nor perform the Voyage.
And accordingly, as ſoon as they came to the
<hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> they took Counſel together to ſet
them at Liberty there. And that their deſign in
diſmiſſing them, and the manner of the ſame
might the better appear, they wrote a Letter
ſignifying the Reaſons that mov'd 'em to let 'em
go, and withal Teſtifying that they were men of
unblamable Converſation in every thing; as alſo
that they did not flee away from them by ſtealth,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50388:112"/>
but were freely diſmiſs'd; which Letter was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
by ſome, and delivered to the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
who came ſtraight away for <hi>London,</hi> (not going
near their own Houſes) where they were brought
before the Council, as Fugitives) to be puniſhed by
the Pains of Death; for ſuch is the penalty of
that crime; but they ſhowing their Letters,
which teſtified the contrary, were order'd to be
kept Priſoners till another opportunity offer'd of
ſending them to <hi>America.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next to theſe <hi>ſeven,</hi> other three at <hi>Briſtol</hi> were
put on Board a Ship for the ſame end; but the
Seamen conſidering their caſe and doleful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and being mov'd with that affection, call'd
mercy, (which is Grief of Heart for the miſery
of others) and alſo ſcar'd by the Laws againſt
any ſuch Exportations, ſet them at Liberty again,
giving them a Letter or Certificate to remove all
ſuſpicion of their being Fugitives. Theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
were wonderful, and accounted by the
<hi>Quakers</hi> to be Miracles. Altho all theſe, and
many others, who had receiv'd the ſame Sentence
of Tranſportation, were put all together into
one Ship, that was ſtrongly enough guarded, and
ſecur'd from the laſh of the Law. This Ship,
when ſet to Sea, was taken by a <hi>Dutch Privateer</hi>
in the time of War between <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and the Captive <hi>Quakers</hi> were ſet a ſhoar
in <hi>Holland;</hi> which accident (whatever conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Quakers</hi> may put upon it) is a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inſtance of the viciſſitudes of Human Affairs.
Some of theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> return'd again to their
own Habitations, as being afraid of nothing, and
deſiring reſolutely to undergo all manner of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
for the defence of their Religion. Others
fix'd their Reſidence in <hi>Holland,</hi> making that place
a Refuge and Receptacle of the Miſerable; and
thinking it ſafer to hear of the miſeries of their
Countrymen, than to ſee them with their Eyes,
and be the feeling Subjects of the ſame themſelves.
Some of theſe men, <hi>Now Pilgrims in a ſtrange
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50388:113"/>
Land,</hi> had but very little to maintain themſelves
withal, but they acquieſc'd in their Poverty very
patiently, chooſing rather to live a ſecure (tho
mean) life in a ſtrange Country, than to try the
uncertain Events of dubious Fortune in their
own. Some, in the progreſs of time, encreas'd
their ſmall Fortunes to a conſiderable bulk, ſo that
their <hi>former Perſecution,</hi> and the Exchange of their
Habitations, prov'd advantagious to them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
there were not wanting ſome among them,
who, beſides their domeſtick Affairs, took care al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of the General intereſt of the Sect even in that
Country; and by introducing New Meetings and
conſtituting a <hi>New Society,</hi> there became the chief
Pillars and Ornaments of their whole Church;
tho formerly they had been in no repute amongſt
their own People, either for Riches or other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments;
ſo that their Friends and Aſſociates
did not ſtand to ſay publickly of them, that they
were toſs'd and harraſs'd by many tribulations,
and at length brought to that Country by the
Divine Counſel, that they might be oblig'd to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that Divine Aſſiſtance which enabled
them to compaſs ſuch great undertakings; the

Root they take, and when prun'd, bring forth

complain'd hugely of the cruel and inveterate
malice of the Eccleſiaſticks and Miniſters againſt
them, who ſhould have been meek even to their
Enemies, following in this the Example of their
Lord and Maſter, while on Earth, who was meek
and tender to his greateſt Enemies. Their mouths
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50388:113"/>
were alſo fill'd with the cruelty of the Biſhops,
who are the chiefeſt managers of all publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
and the principal Members of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the ſupreme Judicatory of the Nation, whoſe
Authority is of ſo great weight and influence in
the Nation, that they were the Authors of all
the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>vere Laws and Rigid conſtitutions made
againſt them; that they propos'd nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the reſtraining and ſuppreſſing of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
(and conſequently <hi>Quakers</hi>) that was not
forthwith liſten'd to by the Noble Men and Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Kingdom. Their complaint there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was, that Juſtice was done them no where,
that they could not obtain liberty ſo much as
to diſplay the injuries that were done them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that this perſecution was Univerſal and every
where, inſomuch that every Town, or whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
place was frequented by People, ring'd with
the perſecution and affliction of the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
And becauſe they are of this principle, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
is to be offer'd to none, nay, not ſo
much as to ward off force by force; that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
fortune befell them, they ſhould not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquieſce in it, but receive it with all chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and willingneſs of mind, while it was for
Conſcience ſake; that whatever evils they were
oppreſs'd with, they ſhould undergo them with
the greateſt Conſtancy, Patience and Fortitude of
mind and body; they complain'd that upon
this account the world was the more jealous
and ſuſpicious of them, that their wrath and
malice was incited the more againſt them; that
they lay open to the ſnares and devices of all
Men, ſuch as could not be avoided by ſimple and
open hearted Men, and to the greateſt Perils and
Dangers that any Mortals could undergo; not
otherwiſe than if every thing alledg'd againſt
them had been prov'd, or if their patient endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Puniſhments inflicted had been their
crime, and this their conſtancy in ſuffering, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
by ſome ſtubbernneſs and contumacy,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50388:114"/>
had call'd for a greater weight of puniſhment to
be inflicted. In oppoſition to which, when ſuch
like complaints came to the ears of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
they endeavour'd to purge themſelves thus;
that ſeeing the <hi>Quakers</hi> did ſo obſtinately forſake
and ſeparate from the publick Religion, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and Sermons; and neglected, deſpis'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
by all means to render ineffectual the
Laws and Conſtitutions of the Church; and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
oppos'd and diminiſh'd, as much as in them
lay, their revenues, incomes and advantages; ſo
that they deſign'd and contriv'd to ruine them,
and theirs, if they could; there was therefore no
remedy left for curbing and checking their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
minds, irregular Actions, and unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
boldneſs, but the method they had choſen
for that effect; and the puniſhments they met
with were no leſs than they deſerv'd; that as for
them, they had done nothing but what was their
duty, and became them in the conſcientious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of their function, which was not to be
their Enemys, (as they ſaid) but to correct, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
and reform ſinners. But the <hi>Quakers</hi> chiefly
found fault with this, that they always cited
them before the Eccleſiaſtick and Spiritual Courts,
which after this year became very frequent; this
touch'd them ſo ſenſibly that they could not
conceal the grief and anguiſh of their mind, nor
moderate their tongues from expreſſing the ſame.
This Eccleſiaſtical Court was after this manner:
<q>The <hi>Quakers</hi> being moſt obſtinate and tenati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to all the Articles of their Religion, and
very nice and inſulting in the minuteſt Tenets
of another, did by their obſtinacy and trouble
mightily incourage the Miniſters of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and (which of all things here on Earth is
moſt ſenſible) occaſion'd the diminution of
their revenues; They were then cited to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and if they either made any great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
or refus'd to give ſurety, or to appear
before the Court, they were excluded from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50388:114"/>
Communion with the Church, as being the
Excrements and Off-ſcourings of the world.
This we commonly call <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
Which Excommunication was approv'd and
confirm'd by every Biſhop in his Biſhoprick,
and alſo by the Biſhop of the Dioceſs where
it was done; after which any Accuſers or
Actors had full power and liberty to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
them, as lewd and wicked people ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the Mother the Holy Church.</q> Then
being delated to the Magiſtrates, and by their
command apprehended and caſt into Priſon,
were to lye there till they had ſuffer'd all the
penalty and pay'd the laſt farthing, tho in the
mean time none of them had began to pay the
firſt penny. This Action is call'd by Lawyers
<hi>de Excommunicato capiendo.</hi> The crimes they
were accus'd of, that made them liable to this
Thunderbolt of Excommunication were theſe,
<hi>That they did not frequent the publick Churches,</hi> nor
obſerv'd the ſet holydays, in attending Sermons
and publick Prayers; that in holy days they and
their families did not abſtain from profane
wocking; that they withheld their Children
from baptiſm, and would not give ſurety for
them, when they excluded 'em from the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Chriſtians. That they did not receive
the other Sacrament; that they were not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by their Pariſh Miniſters, nor any others
of the Church; that they were not joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the bond of Matrimony according to
Law, but liv'd together like lewd and debauch'd
perſons, making their <hi>Wives whores,</hi> and their
Children baſtards and illegitimate. (This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
the Miniſters of the Advantages they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
had by the fees and allowances paid them
on ſuch occaſions; which the <hi>Quakers</hi> were very
refractory to do.) That they ſent not their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to School to be taught by the Pariſh School-maſters,
who otherwiſe were ſtraiten'd for a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood
(for the <hi>Quakers</hi> had School-maſters of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50388:115"/>
their own profeſſion, to whom they committed
the Education of their Children); that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to pay their quota for repairing the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and keeping them in order; that they omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to give the <hi>Easter</hi>-Offerings, or ſuch other
gifts as ought and us'd to be given to the Curates,
or Minſters of their Pariſh; and laſtly, that they
refus'd to pay the Tithes of their Cattel, Lands,
Trees, Honey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Miniſter; this (ſay the
<hi>Quakers</hi>) the Clergy look'd upon as their greateſt
Calamity, accounting it their <hi>cloros</hi> (as they us'd
to taunt them) or the loſs and rottenneſs of their
honeycombs, and the product of their Bees. Thus
the <hi>Quakers</hi> both in their geſtures, Speeches, and
Writings ſometimes, cunningly inſinuated ſuch
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>art bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ter Reflections. Liberty was given the
<hi>Quakers,</hi> before the ſentence of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was pronounc'd againſt 'em, to propoſe their
Defences and Apologies for themſelves, before
the Biſhops and Magiſtrates. But becauſe they
were not allow'd to do it themſelves, but only
by Procurators and Sollicitors, which could not
be done without giving Money, they declin'd
appearing before them; for they thus reaſon'd
with themſelves, that if their buſineſs ſucceeded
favourably, it was well; if not it would be the
multiplying expences upon expences in vain;
and beſides, they bethought themſelves, that no
faith would be had to their Allegations without
interpoſing their Oaths, which they were very
a verſe to, nay, ſo reſolute that they would rather
run the hazard, of the greateſt perſecutions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
So that none of them obtain'd any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
Nor were they excus'd who pretended to
be ſick, and ſo unable to attend the Court; for
this their pretended ſickneſs was interpreted to
be feign'd and not real. So that one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
great numbers of them were Condemn'd,
apprehended, and put in Priſon; ſome Rich,
ſome Poor, ſome Citizens, ſome Country-Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants;
ſeveral of the latter being Impriſon'd for a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50388:115"/>
very ſmall ſumm, not exceeding ten or ſix pence.
Which ſmall ſumms they all refus'd to advance,
not that they were ſo poor as that they could
not, or ſo pinching and niggardly, that they
would not part with ſo much; but that they
thought the purſuers had no right to them. And
the purſuers were ſo eager and ſtrict, that they
would not forgive ſuch little ſumms, nor abate
the leaſt farthing of their due, leſt others ſhould
have taken Encouragement from ſuch a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
to expect the like immunity. So they
were all promiſcuouſly Impriſon'd. In the mean
while the fomenters of the Action, while they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to recover what was owing them, took
by force from their houſes what (as they ſaid)
would amount to the ſumm; pillaging their
houſes, Embezzeling and Spoiling their Barns,
Stacks, Harveſt, Vintage; taking their Horſes,
Cows, and all other poſſeſſions they could be
Maſters of, ſo that they recover'd their Money
with Intereſt, deſtroying all that the diligent
Men had ſcrap'd together by the ſweat of their
brows, and living ſparingly, and leaving nothing
almoſt for the ſuſtenance of their families. Yet
the <hi>Quakers</hi> continued ſtill ſtedfaſt, and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
reſolving to ſuffer to the laſt extremity, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than recede from the courſe they had begun;
ſo that ſome of them were caſt into common
Goals, ſome into Caſtles and Places of ſtrength,
ſome into ſtinking noyſom Dungeons, where
dogs could not live, being forc'd to live at the
Diſcretion and Arbitrement of their Keepers, and
expos'd for a ridicule to the baſeſt and meaneſt
of the Vulgar Servants; ſome were put in among
the profligate and debauch'd, who had liv'd in
all manner of wickedneſs and villany, and were
juſtly puniſh'd for their evil deeds; who yet
even then could not abſtain from their perverſe
and wicked courſes, nor refrain from calumniat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and vexing their fellow Priſoners; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſome of them were baniſh'd into ſo diſtant
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50388:116"/>
Countrys from their Wives and Children, and all
other Enjoyments that were dear or comfortable
to them; which one Affliction cruſh'd ſome of
them to Death, being overwhelm'd with anguiſh
and ſorrow, for the loſs of their endeared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts.
Many of them died by the noyſome ſmell
and other inconveniences of the Priſon, or through
grief, or being wearied out and oppreſs'd with
long and tedious diſeaſes ariſing from ſuch cauſes.
Some came ſooner to this unhappy end, ſome
later; but others endow'd with more ſtrength
and firmneſs of Body, wreſtled out for a long
time. There were ſome of them ſet at liberty,
and freed from this inſupportable weight of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
through the interceſſion and entreaties of
their Friends with the Magiſtrates, who likewiſe
were mov'd with pity and compaſſion towards
them; but were afterwards remitted to their old
miſerable habitation, not for any new debt or
crime, but for that ſame they were Impriſon'd
for before; where they continued till Death alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated
their ſorrows.</p>
                     <p>Some few years after this, the <hi>Quakers</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulg'd
all this ſevere uſage to the World by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which they preſented to the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
In which they run thorough all the
<hi>ſeveral Countries of the Kingdoms, amaſſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
all the inſtances of the cruelty and barbarity
us'd towards them. But I ſhall here content
my ſelf with two of their moſt Remarkable
Examples; adding unto them a third, which
tho omitted by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon what account I know
not) is as memorable and worthy to be remarked
as any. The year that firſt affords us theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
is the year <hi>ſixty four.</hi> The firſt is this.
There liv'd a Blackſmith in a little Village in
<hi>Hampſhire,</hi> by name <hi>Thomas Penford,</hi> who was
Impriſon'd at <hi>Worceſter</hi> in the common Goal, by
an edict of Excommunication, becauſe he would
not pay three pence for Reparation of the
Church; which he obſtinately refus'd to do; ſo
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50388:116"/>
that after three years and a half Impriſonment
he died in Goal. The next is, <hi>Thomas Rennes</hi> a
Country Farmer, in ſome little Village in <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
was Impriſon'd at <hi>Oxford</hi> by an Edict of
Excommunication, for not paying the Tithes,
which he was averſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to do. While he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
Captive, the Miniſter goes and ſeizes on his
Horſes; which were much more valuable than the
ſumm he wanted; yet the poor Man continu'd
in Priſon a long time, and ends his days upon the
place. The third Example, which is a Complex
and Image (as it were) of all the reſt, was after
this manner. One <hi>Thomas Dobſon</hi> liv'd at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Village call'd <hi>Brichtnel</hi> in <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> where he
maintain'd himſelf and his Family very honeſtly
by a Farm he kept, and ſome ſmall ſubſtance he
had ſcrap'd together by his labour and diligence.
He refus'd to pay the Tithes, not that he was ſo
ſtraitned for Money that he could not make up
the ſumm, but that he could not do it becauſe of
the dictates of his Conſcience diſallowing the
ſame. There was one <hi>Radulph Wiſtler</hi> who
bought the Tithes, and had an Eye for a long
time upon this Man's ſubſtance, and was fond of
an occaſion to terrify the reſt from doing the
like; he caus'd this Man to be hal'd to Priſon,
where he ſmarted for his contumacy by fifteen
weeks Captivity; during which time, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
after that <hi>Dobſon</hi> was releas'd, and return'd
to his own houſe, he pillag'd and haraſs'd his houſe
and poſſeſſions, taking off his Horſes, Kine and
other poſſeſſions, (which were priz'd and ſold for
his benefit) till he made about <hi>forty pounds Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>
And afterwards in the year ſixty ſix, and
ſixty ſeven, when the poor Man was ſecure, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing, he attacks him again, takes from
him his Horſe, four Kine, and all the Cattle
he had of whatever ſort, all the furniſhing of
his houſe, and the very beds they lay upon, ſo
diſtreſſing and empoveriſhing the poor Man, that
he and his Family ſcarce had wherewithal to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50388:117"/>
cloath themſelves. But ſome time after, when
he had almoſt overcome this diſafter, having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
<hi>two kine</hi> which gave Milk, out of which,
and the cheeſe made of it, he ſuſtain'd his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
without any other food; the Miniſter of
the Pariſh Church (whoſe name I chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to conceal) purſues him with an Edict
of Excommunication, inſomuch that not only
this ſmall remnant he had for maintenance of
his family was taken from him, but himſelf,
thus poor and empty, was caſt into Priſon;
which was done in the ſame year, from which
time he remain'd captive till the year Seventy two;
when he was ſet at liberty by the <hi>King's ſpecial
Command;</hi> at length having return'd to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
dwelling place, and beginning to improve his
ſmall fortune a little by labouring the ground,
and diligent working, this ſame <hi>Tithe-maſter</hi> I
have already nam'd, ſo well vers'd in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actory
Diſcipline, that no office of humanity
withheld him from the ſame, falls upon him
again, and takes all the poſſeſſions he now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd,
leaving him nothing; ſo that the value
and price of what he took from him, was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
to be eightly pounds <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which is eight
hundred and fifty eight <hi>Dutch Gilders.</hi> And
moreover, to give a farther inſtance of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd
Barbarity, he cauſed him to be caſt
into Priſon in the year ſeventy five, where he
was ſhut up among Thieves and Robbers,
and thoſe who were not only guilty of ſuch
Enormous Crimes, but even of Whoring and
Revelling; the Botches and Exulcerations ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from their intemperate Venery, being yet
running upon their bodies, creating a moſt noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and grievous ſmell, and all the whole
Members of their body being infected and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with the ſame. But <hi>Dobſon</hi>'s greateſt
comfort was that he found in Priſon Men of
his own Society, who were kept Captive upon
the ſame account that he was. Sometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50388:117"/>
when one of theſe miſerable pocky wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
had rotted unto Death through the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of that <hi>blackest and fouleſt diſeaſe,</hi> the
Keeper of the Priſon (a Man inferior to none
for wickedneſs and exceſs of Rudeneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity,
who dealt ſo with theſe <hi>Quakers,</hi>
his Priſoners, that he ſhew'd to the World, that
his humor and conſtitution was fitted for tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
mankind) gather'd up the ſtraw upon
which this Corrupted and Loathſome carkaſs
was laid, bringing it into that place where
<hi>Dobſon,</hi> with his fellow <hi>Quakers,</hi> and alſo the
reſt of theſe flagitive miſcreants were throng'd
up, where he burnt it in a fire, to teſtify that
burning hatred, and malice againſt the <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
which rag'd and flam'd within his Breaſt.
And from the flames of this burning ſtraw,
there proceeded ſuch Exhalations and Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fumes, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> were all taken ill
of a moſt grievous and dangerous diſeaſe, which
in a ſhort time put a period to the lives of
ſome of them. <hi>Dobſon</hi> recover'd of this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
but continu'd under the ſame miſerable
Captivity, till the wellcome day of his Death,
which happen'd in the laſt day of <hi>May,</hi> in the
year of our Lord, one thouſand ſix hundred
ſeventy and ſeven.</p>
                     <p>The Quakers therefore being griev'd in ſoul
for this inſupportable affliction of their Brethren,
and apprehenſive of the like Events about to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
themſelves, could not contain themſelves from
expreſſing the Eſtuations and Boylings of their

and bloody Plague which Rag'd ſo ſeverely both
in <hi>London</hi> and many parts of that Realm, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
beſought the King, and boldly counſell'd
him, <hi>That in Order to avert and appeaſe the Weath

the moderation of the King was too great to
give Ear to ſuch Counſels; for though he would
not countenance or aſſiſt theſe men, yet he was
not willing to uſe ſuch inhumane Cruelty againſt
them; and accordingly choſe rather that <hi>the Old
Puniſhment</hi> ſhould be continued againſt them,
than a New One of that Nature take place. This
Year, which was ſo fatal unto many places, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
both the <hi>Quakers</hi> and their Enemies

ſtroke to <hi>Samuel Fiſher,</hi> whoſe Fame among the

He died in Priſon. The <hi>Quakers</hi> migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
lamented his Death, being ſenſible what a
great Doctor, and what a Skillful and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Defender of them and their Religion they

<hi>Engliſh</hi> Parentage, went over into <hi>England,</hi>
where he finiſh'd his Philoſophical and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
courſe in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
that Nurſery of Learning which boaſts ſo much
of her integrity, that ſhe never emitted any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
that prov'd corrupt or unſound in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
matters: He afterwards became Miniſter
to a Church in that Country, being ordain'd
by <hi>Reynolds</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich;</hi> but he had
not long exercis'd this function when he made
defection to <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> at the ſame very time
that he was moſt buſy in confirming and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
himſelf and his hearers, againſt the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of that ſect. There was a young Virgin
among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> fam'd for her dexterity
and skill in Preaching, whom many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
us'd to follow. <hi>Coughen</hi> having underſtood
that ſhe was to preach in a certain place, goes
thither himſelf in his Canonical Robes, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to preſerve his hearers from being ſeduc'd
by her diſcourſes. But ſo ſoon as he came to
hear her, he was ſo mov'd and affected, that
he not only not oppos'd her; or her Doctrine,
but appear'd for its defence, and ſpoke pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
for it at that ſame occaſion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home abandon'd his Eccleſiaſtick habit,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50388:119"/>
joyning himſelf to be a member of their Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety;
in which he afterwards became a Doctor
and Preacher, and was much careſs'd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
by them. But not long after this he
return'd to <hi>Holland</hi> again, and meeting at <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
with <hi>Edward Richardſon,</hi> Miniſter to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Church in that place, and diſcourſing
with him about Religion, he was ſo influenc'd
by his company that he forſook the <hi>Quakers</hi>
and their Society, betaking himſelf to <hi>Leyden,</hi>
when he purſued the ſtudy of Medicine. Which
where he had finiſh'd he returns to <hi>England,</hi>
and profeſſes that Art of adminiſtring medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
to the ſick, ſequeſtrating himſelf all along
from that Society, till at length ſome three
years thereafter, he attempts to introduce a new
Model of Doctrine and Diſcipline, (which had
been ſo often endeavour'd by ſo many and ſo
great Men) of obliging all Chriſtians to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrate
in one common faith, and interpoſe
their intereſt and power, for reconciling the
differences of Religion amongſt all who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
the Name of Chriſt. All this while <hi>Fox</hi>
was not Remembred or talk'd of, except
amongſt thoſe of his own Profeſſion and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;
for he had been detain'd Captive for
three ſucceſſive years together, one half of that
time in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and the other half in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi>
he was firſt Impriſon'd for his frequent
Conventicles, and alſo for refuſing his Oath of
fidelity ſo oft as it was requir'd of him. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole courſe of his Captivity, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
order'd and decreed many injurious and
rough ſentences againſt him. The chiefeſt of
his fellow Priſoners was <hi>Margaret Fell,</hi> whom
he afterwards made conſort of his marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
both of them were mutually aſſiſtant to
each other in all duties of Religion, affording
one another ſuch help and comfort, as people
ſo intimately conjoyn'd both in Friendſhip and
Religion, generally expect from one another.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50388:119"/>
But after this, he was ſhut up in a Dungeon
full of filth and naſtineſs, and ſtanding ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
water, where he underwent much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
being forc'd ſometimes to paſs the night
without having whereupon to ſup; upon which
he was taken very ill, and was now but ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recovering his former ſtrength.—I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told what havock that mercileſs plague
had made, both in <hi>London</hi> and the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

there ſucceeded another in the enſuing year,
ſixty ſix, <hi>viz.</hi> That terrible fire which did not
indeed reach the whole Country, but burn'd
and waſted almoſt all that noble and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

                     <p>Having given you an account of the many
hard and miſerable conditions of theſe Men, I
ſhall now adorn this treatiſe with ſome pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
variety, to divert and refreſh the mind of
my Reader, perhaps now wearied with read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
It will not be amiſs therefore to take
a view of what the <hi>Quakers</hi> wrote for theſe
four years, by way of Prophecy and Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
concerning the future State of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and both theſe memorable afflictions of
the City of <hi>London;</hi> for ſuch kind of Hiſtories do
much delight and charm the ears of Men; I
ſhall only ſelect thoſe that are moſt memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and worth obſervation. The predictions
of Men do generally run upon ſome great and
wonderful revolutions and changes; tho they
ſeldom come to light till the event be paſt.
Theſe people were ſo certainly perſuaded that
ſome of their faction, had ſo diſtinctly and
clearly foretold the future ſcenes of affairs, and
both theſe Calamities of <hi>London,</hi> that whoever
misbeliev'd 'em was concluded by them to have
ſhaken off all manner of faith and belief.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50388:120"/>
A certain <hi>Quaker</hi> call'd <hi>Serles,</hi> a Weaver, in
the year one thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty
two, ſaw theſe words wrote in legible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
upon the Circumference of a Kettle,
hanging over the fire; <hi>Wo to England for poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
of</hi> Charles <hi>the 2d, Cardinal. I underſtand</hi>
Moloch. <hi>Twenty Nations with him.</hi> Englands <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
cometh.</hi> The Man being affraid at the
ſight, calls the Neighbours to come and ſee it;
who coming, were raviſh'd with admiration to
behold that wonder, which they could not gueſs
from whence it came. The writing appear'd
legible for a whole hour together, and then
evaniſh'd on its own accord. Many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and thoſe of conſiderable note, who were
not <hi>Quakers,</hi> atteſted the verity of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
I my ſelf have ſeen and read both the
ſtory and the ſame very words, mark'd by
<hi>John Coughen,</hi> whom I formerly mention'd, in
his Note-book, that ſame year; which book
was kept in the Cloſet of a certain great Man
in this Country, from that year till two years
after King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Death; all which time it
was kept ſecret from any other body, ſo that
no doubt is to be made of the Authentick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of that Annotation. But what the <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
would have meant by theſe words, or that
ſight, and how they Accommodated it to the
manner of K. <hi>Charles</hi>'s Death, and to the
changes of Religion, and Miſeries to come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
many years; and how the future event of
things happening about the King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Death,
that were told, reported, known and ſeen through
all <hi>England,</hi> did agree with theſe words, is not
needful to be determin'd in this place. The
<hi>Quakers</hi> affirm'd, that one of their Captives at
<hi>London,</hi> did clearly foretell the peſtilence that
was to overtake that City, ſaying, that in a
ſhort time the ſtreets, which then were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh'd
with Men, and reſorted to by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
ſhould be ſeen cover'd with graſs, and

                        </gap> them. But I ſhall
not extend this preſage any further, leſt I ſeem
to recede from the deſign'd order and brevity
of this treatiſe.—This they relate of the fire
of <hi>London;</hi> that there was a <hi>Quaker</hi> at <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
who before the burning of the Town, ſaw
it clearly repreſented to him in flames; not
when dreaming, but when awake; and a voice
from Heaven warn'd him to go to <hi>London,</hi> and
make publick what he ſaw. He preſently takes
his Horſe, and rides thither; and when he came
at the Town he diſcovers his head, throws
away his hat, and having girded up his Breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he looſes all his other Cloaths, and pulls
down his stockings. Having put up his Horſe,
he runs to a Meeting, or Convention of his
own Sect, in the ſame habit, two days before
theſe things had happen'd which he was about
to foretell; He enters among them, with a
great commotion of Spirit, and an auſtere ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Countenance, and tells publickly in the
Meeting, that it was predicted, and made known
to him by the Spirit, that in two days time
<hi>London</hi> ſhould be all in flames, and that all
the Citizens, lull'd up in their ſecure beds in
profound ſleep, being awak'd at this terrible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
and fill'd with Conſternation and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
ſhould run naked from their beds and
houſes, to ſave their lives, and not know what to
attempt for quenching of the fire. All the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
wondred to hear him, taking him for ſome
prating fool, and ridiculing him and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
<hi>Omen.</hi> But he perſiſted in his aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
till at length, when they were expecting
no ſuch accident, and accounting him a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who went about to frighten people with
his Dreams, the lamentable event gave ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
teſtimony to the truth of the Oracle. And
when the whole Town was now all in a fire, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either too much puffed up with the inſpiration
of this accident, which was but too too certain,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50388:121"/>
or being mov'd in his Spirit a-freſh, was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
and preſumptuous of his own Power and
Intereſt, that he would pretend to ſtop, and let
bounds to that fire he had predicted, running up
up and down among the people, crying, That he
would repreſs the flames, and ſet Limits to them,
beyond which they could not reach: Then he goes
to the Houſes all beſet with fire, and fixes himſelf
among them, and would have ſtood till the fire
had conſumed him too. The people, when all
their Exhortations and Counſels were in vain, to
move him to retire from the Danger, took him by
the middle out of that place, removing him to
ſome ſafer ſtation. Afterwards he was ſenſible of
his Fool-hardineſs and Errour, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſame. The <hi>Quakers</hi> add, That this ſame
man foretold ſome ſuch thing of the Town of
<hi>Hereford,</hi> which he had ſeen in his ſleep; but in
vain, for the Event did not fall out as he had
predicted. But this did not at all leſſen the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
Reſpect to the Veracity of this Oracle; for
they ſaid, ſuch kind of Variation of Prophecies
is oft times to be found among the Holy Prophets
made mention of in the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>This Double Calamity of the City of <hi>London,</hi>
which not only afflicted that City, but injected
a Fear and Terror into the minds of all men eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where in that Kingdom, ſo that they were
more ſolicitous about their own Condition, and
the danger they were in, than buſie to afflict and
oppreſs others, did not a little allay the Ardour
and Fury of their Minds againſt the Quakers, at
leaſt for ſome time.</p>
                     <p>While theſe things happen'd in <hi>England,</hi> the
<hi>Quakers</hi> were not altogether free from perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> though it was not
ſo hot in the former as in the latter; for in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
there was but a ſmall number of Quakers in
the Kingdom, ſo that they could not meet and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
ſo frequently; and beſides, the Laws E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted
againſt them were not ſo many to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50388:121"/>
and they themſelves did not give their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
ſo great occaſion of reſiſting and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them: Wherefore if any of them were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
who perſiſted boldly and obſtinately in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregating
together, or enterpriz'd any forbidden
Thing, they were kept in Priſon for a long time
to terrifie and frighten the reſt from doing the
like. They were more numerous in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
that not in One County or Two, but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Kingdom; where they imitated
the <hi>Engliſh Quakers,</hi> in withdrawing from, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
and diſpiſing the Publick Ordinances of
the Church, celebrating Conventions and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
among themſelves, for managing their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Intereſt; putting themſelves out of the
way when call'd to pay Tithes, or contribute to
the Reparation of Churches, or to give Oath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any occaſion: Some of them would publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do prophane Work on the Feſtival Holy-Days;
ſome run into the Churches, and Diſturb the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and Prayers with their idle and bold Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues:
others ſtand in the Streets and Market-Places,
exhorting People to Repentance, diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
all their Actions, and extolling their own;
filling the Air with foolish and impertinent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.
For which Reaſons they were no leſs
perſecuted in this Kingdom than in <hi>England,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Penalties and Fines being indicted againſt
them all, which if they refuſed to pay (as they
all did) they were caſt into Priſon, and ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Treated, that ſome of 'em dy'd of Sickneſs
and Diſeaſes contracted in Priſon.</p>
                     <p>In ſome places the people oppos'd their keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conventicles together, Dragging them out of
their Houſes, Purſuing them in the Fields, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
and impriſoning them and if they
were aſſembled, they broke into the Houſes by
Force, ſmiting and beating them; and ſtripping
their very Cloaths from off their cacks. All this
was done unto them in ſome plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s by the Mob,
and Refuſe of the People, and Vagabond Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50388:122"/>
(next a-kin to Robbers) who were cloath'd
with no other Authority but that of their Hands
and Swords. Which was alſo conniv'd at by
their Commanders and Maſters, who not only
ſuffer'd theſe Outrages to be committed, but
ſometimes they themſelves did things inconſiſtent
with the Dignity and Gravity of their Station;
For if at any time the Quakers ſpoke more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to them in Publick Places, or when irritated,
gave them Tart Anſwers, they would preſently
ſet upon them, all in a Body, (for Revenge ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of no Delay) branding them with the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
Titles of a <hi>curſed impious Crew;</hi> Nay,
Kaining and beating them ſoundly. And even
among the Miniſters of the Churches, there were
ſome, who not contenting themſelves to have
Excommunicated them from their Society, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
them up to the Judges to be further proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
and puniſhed. The only Moderation and
Meekneſs us'd towards them was by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>I have already told, in the beginning of this
book, what advantage and improvement redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Doctrine and Religion of the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
by the Diligence and activity of <hi>George Keith</hi> and
<hi>Robert Barcley,</hi> who were more than ordinarily
Inſtrumental in advancing the Intereſt of that
Society. And now becauſe the ſcope and deſign of
this Treatiſe is to give a view of what are the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
theſe men maintain, and ſo Religiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;
and by what Authors, and after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they were firſt invented and Publiſhed, for
the Defence of which they have undergone ſo
many Miſeries and Dangers; I ſhall here ſhew
how that the Chief Cardinal Doctrines of theſe
Men, which are Fundamental to all the reſt, were
after this time taken into task by <hi>George Keith;</hi>
and in various Writings, partly handled and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
more diſtinctly and politely, partly chang'd
and repreſented after the Image of the Idea's
of the Ancient Philoſophers, not in that new
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50388:122"/>
Dreſs which the <hi>Quakers</hi> at firſt affected; deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afterwards to give account of <hi>George Barcley</hi>
in his own time and place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Keith</hi> firſt apply'd his Mind to Write in the
year Sixty Five, and continued in that exerciſe
for many years; all his writings were original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> except ſome few ſheets. He hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obſerv'd that the <hi>Quakers</hi> wrote but very
obſcurely and perplexedly, of that Divine light
which is in every Man, and of Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in him, which they place for the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and foundation of all their Religion and
Doctrine; and being a Man of a ſubtile and
acute Wit, has accurately repreſented, what
they had but rudely and lamely begun, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that Doctrine; diſplaying it in this
manner: God has given a light unto every
Man, which he plac'd within him; Which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the mind, or humane reaſon; for that
is innate, whereas the light is adventitious and
given to him from without, to command and
govern his Reaſon. This ſame light is the Seed
of God, or Inſtrument whereby Men fallen and
corrupted through ſin, are born again of God.
And this is a ſubſtance, a part of that inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ſpiritual ſubſtance of Jeſus Chriſt the
Son of God, that divine, inviſible, ſpiritual and
heavenly Man. For Chriſt is ſo the Son of God,
that he is made to be ſuch a Man by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
vertue proceeding from God. So Chriſt,
and by him God dwells, and is implanted in
every Man, nay, in every Creature. But ſince
Men have made defection from God, corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and depraving themſelves altogether, Chriſt
and God is dead, and extinguiſh'd in them;
but not totally; So that Chriſt being mov'd
with pity and compaſſion towards Men, and
remaining in ſome meaſure within them, do's
ſo help and aſſiſt their miſerable impotency,
that he moves from within, incites, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes
every Man, that they would give ear
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50388:123"/>
to and follow Chriſt, their light; and that
laying aſide their wicked manners and evil
opinions, they would ſubmit themſelves to
Chriſt, embracing and adhering to him, thus
expecting his divine vertue within them; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
him for their guide and conducter in
going about duties, and maintaining the ſame,
imitating him in every thing as their Maſter.
Which if they do, Chriſt revives and lives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them, eſtabliſhing and renewing an Union
and Communion with them, and becoming
righteouſneſs and ſalvation unto them. So Chriſt
becomes meat, heavenly and ſpiritual food un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Men. And thus in all Ages, the Godly
did eat the fleſh and drink the Blood of Chriſt.
And ſo indeed Chriſt is in the ungodly, tho
hiddenly, and as if he were quite away; from
whence it is that the Scriptures ſometimes ſay,
that Chriſt is not in them. But he is ſo far
within them, that when they are ſelling and
enſlavening themſelves to ſin, he ſuffers and is
afflicted by the ſame; and through the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and piercing of his own Body, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues
from this their wickedneſs, he is oppreſs'd
with grief and anguiſh, as if he were again
faſtened to the Croſs. This Chriſt is to be
ador'd and worſhiped, as being that Divine,
heavenly and ſpiritual Man, not as being an
External Man born of <hi>Mary.</hi> This opinion of
<hi>Keith</hi> concerning theſe Articles, was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
and publiſh'd to the World by Men
of no good Name, (which <hi>Keith</hi> was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of) Hereticks, and ſuch as were addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Schools, and Diſcipline of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi>
Philoſophers, eſpecially the <hi>Platonicks;</hi> but
it was only ſcatter'd here and there, by parcels
in their writings, not Collected into one entire
ſyſtem till in the laſt Century, <hi>William Poſtell,</hi> a
<hi>Frenchman,</hi> publiſh'd it openly in the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
form that <hi>Keith</hi> has done, (tho I have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
inform'd my ſelf that <hi>Keith</hi> knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50388:123"/>
of it) in a particular book ſet out on
that occaſion; but it was accounted ſo fooliſh
and ſilly by the Learned World, that none of
them thought it worth their while to write
againſt, or confute him and his writings. And
theſe were the poſitions ſo long invented and
retain'd before <hi>Keith,</hi> that this ſame <hi>Keith</hi> was
advancing and propoſing in ſeveral books wrote
by him, vindicating them from what objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were either obvious to himſelf, or mov'd
to him by others. But he took care that theſe
his books, ſhould be Printed without the
knowledge, or advice of thoſe of his own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;
and therefore ſent them to <hi>Holland</hi> to
be Printed, leſt any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould come
to know it. Now there being two principal
parts of this <hi>Keithian</hi> Doctrine; the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the preſence of God and Chriſt, not
only in Men, but in all his Creatures; the
ſecond concerning the indwelling and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſt within Men; there was none found
among all the initiatory Apoſtles of this Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
who either maintain'd, taught, or publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mention'd that former branch of his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
Yet none of the <hi>Quakers</hi> wrote againſt
him, neither did thoſe who aſſembled among
themſelves, upon ſuch like occaſions, condemn
that principle, being tender of his name and
fame, and judging it reaſonable, that this one
errour ſhould be paſt over in ſilence, becauſe
of his other good Endowments and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments.
But as to the latter part of his
ſentiments, there was none among all thoſe who
profeſs'd themſelves <hi>Quakers,</hi> that did not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it for his own opinion, ſubſcribing to it
as the ſingular and peculiar Doctrine of their
Church; except ſome few inſignificant thick
ſcull'd fellows, that liv'd in ſome remote and
hidden Corner of the other <hi>Weſtern</hi> World.
There was yet another Tenet which <hi>Keith</hi> was
not averſe to, but he was unwilling to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50388:124"/>
it upon any, for that thoſe of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
did not deſire it ſhould be receiv'd or
entertain'd, for their common Principle; it
was that of the perpetuity of Souls, and of
their Tranſmigration and Variation through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
bodies; which proceeded at firſt from
<hi>Empedocles, Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato;</hi> and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
variouſly trimm'd and furbiſh'd about
ſome hundred years ago, by thoſe pratling
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Maſters, call'd <hi>Rabbius,</hi> who not only
tell but write when awake, whatever they have
dream'd upon that ſubject while aſleep; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
by <hi>R. Jitzhakus Lorienſis,</hi> in a tractate
wrote in <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and in theſe our days is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd
by <hi>Baron van Helmont,</hi> who hath deck'd
it with all the neceſſary Ornaments fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it Reception; an Author famous for the
ſplendour of his Nobility, and his inſatiable
deſires after Knowledge and Learning, which he
accounted the moſt comely and laudable Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he could be Maſter of; who becauſe he
lives well and has not whereupon, is deem'd by
his friends to have found out the Philoſophers
Stone. This Man living in <hi>England</hi> at that time,
converſing among the <hi>Quakers</hi> as one of their
Society, had occaſion frequently to converſe
with a Noble Counteſs, that was a great admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Knowledge and Learning, and to reaſon
with her out of the Book of <hi>Plato,</hi> concerning
this Platonical Doctrine, and came that length with
her, that both he and ſhe embrac'd the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for a truth; and becauſe <hi>Keith</hi> was oftimes
preſent at their Conferences, they bring him in alſo
to take ſhare in the ſame opinion.</p>
                     <p>Which being made known to the Quakers, <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
who was a ſtiff Defender of his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
which they look'd upon, ſome of them,
as Dangerous Innovations; others, as fooliſh
Errors, and Diſtracted Notions, became ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and hated by them; upon which he bids fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
to them, and all their Society, proceeding
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50388:124"/>
not only to Vindicate his Opinion, but becauſe
he thought it yet rude and unpoliſh'd, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
and adorn the ſame, inſtructing himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and again out of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writings, of
what might be ſerviceable to his Deſign, digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Thoughts into this Form, which I give
you a Draught of in as few words as poſſibly I
may:</p>
                     <p>Before the Souls are united to their Bodies, they
exiſt in another World; after they are united to
the Bodies, each of them has its day of the Divine
Viſitation, after One Thouſand Years, given to it
for this End, that by abſolute Holineſs and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
it may prepare for Eternal Felicity; But
if it abuſe the Goodneſs of God, that it may expect
to be condemn'd to that long and terrible Puniſhment
which God hath prepared for them at the expiring of
this their ſet Time. But this Space of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Years is not continued and undivided, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd
and circumſcribed by Twelve Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Circnits of the Soul into the ſame Body, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
unto ſome of the Saints who are purg'd and
ſanctified enough in the firſt or ſecond Cireuit. And
theſe Returns happen after Three Hundred Thirty
Three Years and Four Months. But while they are
out of the Body, they do not advance or proceed in
Piety; therefore if they be good, it goes well with
them; if ill, they fare the worſe. Thoſe Souls
which before the Death of Chriſt were tranſlated
from this Life, and were not ſaved, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their Bodies, may obtain Salvation through
the Goſpel of Chriſt. But thoſe ſince the Death of
Christ, to the End of the World, that have not
heard of the Goſpel, ſhall return again to their
Bodies, all at one time, and in one place, and then
ſhall hear with their Ears the Tidings of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and obtain Salvation, if they believe. After
that the Saints return to the Earth, the Firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
ſhall be, and all the Saints ſhall live
upon Earth a Thouſand Years without any Sin, even
as <hi>Adam</hi> in the State of Innocence; and after the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50388:125"/>
Example of <hi>Adam,</hi> they ſhall be born of Virgins,
being begot of God their Father. Then the Second
Reſurrection ſhall follow, when the Saints ſhall,
after the Example of Chriſt the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> be
made perfect, and conſummated in their Heavenly
Bodies. And laſtly, The Felicity and Bliſs of the
Godly ſhall be Eternal, but the Puniſhment of the
Wicked ſhall be Finite, and at length terminate in an
End.</p>
                     <p>But I return to <hi>Keith.</hi> I am firmly perſwaded
that <hi>Keith</hi> receives, and entertains theſe Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if not all, yet at leaſt the chiefeſt and moſt
material of them; though he would not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his Mind, in theſe Points, unto any, ſave thoſe
that are his Secretaries and Truſtees, or that ſeem
a little wiſer than the reſt. But he is not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Favourite of theſe Doctrines; there be others
among them that are as fond of them as he, tho
very few; ſo that they are far from being univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
receiv'd by all the Society. Nay, the <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
ſhall not long tolerate any Abertors of ſuch
Principles to continue of their Society, if it be
true, what I have oftimes heard from ſome of
their principal Members. I have taken occaſion
to expreſs my ſelf more largely upon this point,
not only for ſake of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but alſo of
thoſe who when they hear, or read of theſe
propoſitions, and the books that treat of the
ſame (as not a few are curious to do) are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
what is the original and beginning of theſe
opinions, and thus are ready to Judge of the
whole matter amiſs.</p>
                     <p>After this time, <hi>William Penn</hi> joyn'd himſelf
to the Society of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who after his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Death becaine Governour of <hi>Penſilvania;</hi>
a Man famous all over <hi>England,</hi> and renown'd
even among forreigners, that are not quite ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> affairs; by whoſe acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that party, counſel, aſſiſtance, diligence and
activity, the intereſt of the <hi>Quakers</hi> was much
enlarg'd and amplified; not indeed all of a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50388:125"/>
ſudden, but by degrees; It ſhall not therefore
be improper, according to my method of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
theſe great Men, which we have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
from the beginning, to ſubjoyn an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the occaſion and manner of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
to this Religion, his Love and Zeal for
it; and of his Wit and Converſation. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Penn,</hi> his father was Vice-Admiral to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Navy, a prudent and grave Man, who
behav'd himſelf ſo, in the midſt of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
and Diſſenſions in the Government,
that according to the Divine Religion he was
faithful and honeſt to his Neighbour. This fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
having deſign'd his Son (who was not born
to him but to his Country, and to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth)
for ſome publick Remarkable Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in managing publick concerns, not for
being merely intent upon raiſing and encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his private fortune, took care to have him
well inſtructed in all Divine and humane Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and ſent him afterwards to the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> that among the reſt of the young
Gentlemen of that place, he might exerciſe his
mind with the ſtudy of Learning and liberal
Arts. Then afterwards he went to <hi>France,</hi> and
ſtaying ſometime at <hi>Paris,</hi> appear'd frequently
at the <hi>French</hi> Court. At this time being yet
very young, he gave great teſtimony both of
his ſtoutneſs and continency, defending his
Life boldly from the aſſault of an Enemy and
a Fencer, who ſought to ſlay him, but withal
ſparing the Life of this his Adverſary, when
it was in his power to have kill'd him. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
return'd to his own Country he went into
<hi>Ireland,</hi> where he heard many things of the
<hi>Quakers;</hi> and not being altogether an Enemy
to their Doctrines and Converſations, he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
their Meetings. This was the year
ſixty ſix, and of his Age twenty two, It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
that when he was preſent at their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Magiſtrate of the place came and took
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50388:126"/>
both him, and the reſt of the company Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
But he was ſo far from being frighten'd by
this ſudden and unexpected accident, or from
being tempted to withdraw from their party and
profeſſion, that even in Priſon he applied his
mind more eagerly to their opinions, after
having underſtood of them more fully what
were the peculiar properties of theſe Men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Doctrine of Converſation. The father
was raviſh'd with Admiration, and not a little
angry at his Son (who was the only hope and
comfort of his parents, and who on the other
hand pay'd the greateſt reſpect and reverence
to them, imaginable) who was thus become the
diſgrace of his family for ever, and the reproach
of all his kindred; and expreſs'd his violent
and ſevere reſentment both in words and deeds;
and when after all he ſaw it impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
him, he diſcharg'd him his houſe, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to diſinherit him. Unto this his fathers
anger were added the reproaches, revilings, and
enmity of his fathers Domeſticks, and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Companions both at Court and elſe where,
with whom he was Educated, and had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd
much before, and alſo of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks,
who formerly render'd him all manner
of Love and Friendſhip. Unto all which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages
<hi>Penn</hi> oppos'd this one remedy; the
integrity of his Life, as oppoſite to the ill reports
that were ſcattered abroad of him; and the
conſtancy of his mind and body, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
that weight of afflictions that ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him. And by theſe two properties he brought
his affairs to that paſs, that his father not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receiv'd him into favour again, and became
as fond of, and kind to him, as ever he had
been diſguſted at him, comforting and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his afflicted and humbled Son; but alſo in
his Will left him heir of all his Riches
and Enjoyments, encouraging and commending
his ſingular piety and fortitude of mind, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50388:126"/>
him to perſiſt in the ſame. Moreover,
when the father obſerv'd what heaps of envy and
hatred his Son had drawn upon himſelf, what
evils were yet impending upon him, and what
difficulties he might come to grapple with; he,
when lying upon a bed of ſickneſs, and looking for
certain death, ſent to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York.</hi> High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
who (as <hi>Penn</hi> was by place next to him)
was in dignity next to the King himſelf; and if he
ſurviv'd his brother, would undoubtedly, ſucceed
him ſince deſtitute of a lawful off-ſpring; he
ſends, I ſay, ſome of his Friends to this Duke, to
deſire of him in his Name, that he would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
his Son to his brother the King, and that
he himſelf would preſerve and defend him (who
had already ſuffer'd ſo much) from what perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
and oppreſſions might attend him; and
unto which both he and all the train of his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates
were ſo ſubject to. Which both the <hi>Duke</hi>
and his Royal Brother the King granted him,
becauſe of his great merits towards his Country;
tho they could not ſo defend his Son always, as
to prevent his Impriſonment at ſometimes. But
it is not here to be omitted, that <hi>Penn,</hi> the father,
lying upon his Death-bed, and when drawing near
to his laſt exit, which he certainly knew to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
took leave of his Son in theſe his laſt
words; <hi>My Son, remember to ſerve God the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
King, ſo constantly, and to prefer the ſame
to the ſervice of Earthly Kings, and all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.
Which if ye do, and if you and your Friends
perſevere in your ſimple and innocent way of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and living, verily ye ſhall make an end of all
the preachers to the end of the World.</hi> Which
words of the dying old Man do not obſcurely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate
what his opinion was of theſe Men, and
how great affection he had for their ſect. Now
as to what was the Wit and Spirit of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Penn</hi> (the ſon) from his youth, what prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and dexterity of diſcourſing attended the
acuteneſs of his wit, what knowledge of Tongues
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50388:127"/>
(ſuch as are uſual among the Learned) and of
things, what Temper and Converſation of life he
was of; I had rather the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or any body
elſe, ſhould give you an account than I. For I
know well how difficult and troubleſome it is,
for any Man to interpoſe his Judgment of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in which the Judgments of other Men are ſo
various. But certainly, tho my pen were ſilent
of him, his own Writings will ſpeak him forth
to be the moſt eminent member of all that Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety;
for while in his Writings he ſtudies to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
all to the capacity and underſtanding
of the Vulgar, yet the variety and abundance of
things therein contain'd, his language and ſtyle,
eſpecially the gravity of words and ſentences,
which when he writes of Theological ſubjects, are
connected and intermix'd with whole chains of
quotations, from the Holy Scriptures, do ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
teſtify of him; that unleſs one be maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
envious of the vertue and praiſe of another,
he muſt acknowledge that he is an eloquent and
well ſpoken Author. The <hi>Quakers</hi> fed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with ſo great hopes of him, that preſently
they allow'd him to do the part of a teacher
among them; and their eſteem of him was ſo
great that they did not doubt to call him the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt
of them all. Nor is there any among
them, who do's not acknowledge that there was
always an exact conſenſion, and agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and all the reſt of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> about
all the Articles of their Religion. This was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
in him, that he always eſteem'd more ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of theſe things, which pertain to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and ſpeculation of ſacred and divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and chiefly oppos'd himſelf to the forcing
and conſtraining Mens Conſciences to any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or perſecuting them upon a religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
(than which indeed there can be no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
cruelty and oppreſſion us'd) pleading for a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
and liberty to all Religions; ſo that he
would not only have the <hi>Quakers</hi> tolerated the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50388:127"/>
exerciſe of their Religion, but likewiſe all Men
at leaſt that are accounted Chriſtians) to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to places of Authority and truſt in the
Government; not excepting the <hi>Socinians</hi> with
their wanton little tricks; nay, nor the Papiſts,
a people ſo inveterate againſt that his Religion,
and all other Religions different from their own;
ſo bloody, cruel, and thirſty of Chriſtian blood,
that when they have exerted their utmoſt and
cruelleſt efforts, are yet never ſatiated. And <hi>Penn</hi>
was ſo ſenſible of the ill demerits of theſe Men,
and ſo well acquainted with their temper, that
he us'd to ſay, <hi>That the Quakers had reaſon to fear
none ſo much as the Socinians and Papiſts, who would
be laſt of all in the field againſt them, tho they had
vanquiſh'd all other Religions.</hi> It ſeems <hi>Penn</hi> had
a deſign to ſhew himſelf an Abettor of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
whatſoever, or to encourage that opinion of
him, which then poſſeſs'd every Mans mind, that
he was deceitful, and in his heart a Socinian, or
(as others believ'd) that he was a Papiſt, and not
only ſo but a Jeſuit: The <hi>Quakers</hi> did not agree
with <hi>Penn,</hi> about theſe Libertine Principles. His
notions of the Chriſtian faith was, that in order
to the maintaining of that, there was no more
neceſſary than in general to believe the Scriptures,
and love them as the word of God; and believe
all the <hi>fundamental Articles</hi> contain'd in the ſame.
By theſe <hi>fundamental Articles</hi> (a term much in
uſe among Divines) he underſtood ſuch propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as are expreſly and in explicite terms deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
in the Scriptures; or ſo evidently atteſted
by them, that all Men who are honeſt and ſincere-minded,
cannot but diſcern and comprehend the
meaning of them. Which being laid down for
a Principle, he thought that whoever gave due
reſpect and reverence to the Scriptures, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
Jeſus Chriſt for the Saviour of the
World, might be truly accounted a Chriſtian;
and that all ſuch Chriſtians both may, and ſhould
agree and write among themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:50388:128"/>
For which end he Recommended to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
to write a general Confeſſion of their
common faith, conſiſting only of ſome few ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
neceſſary and plain truths deliver'd in
Scripture terms; but it is eaſy for any Man to
Conjecture what effect ſuch a propoſal would
have had. Moreover, he reaſon'd further after
this manner; that the moſt part of Chriſtians
that imagin'd to themſelves, that they knew
any thing, bended all their faculties only upon
the Speculation and Contemplation of what
they knew; whereas a ſpeculative life is not ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
and neceſſary for a Chriſtian, as an
active and practical life is, and that all manner
of knowledge is but a meer ſhadow that do's
not tend to action, a ſolitary and wandring
Planet, that produces no fruit for the good of
the publick. Where he chiefly applied himſelf
to the ſtudy of ſuch Sciences as treat of the
manners of Men, what vices are to be eſchew'd,
and what duties towards God and Man are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
upon us; and approv'd mightily the
practice of the ancient Chriſtian in the firſt
Ages after Chriſt, who made moral Philoſophers
teachers and Maſters to their Chriſtians youths;
and who accounted none fit to be a Doctor
among them, who was not inſtructed in the
Philoſophy of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as being the beſt
rule and method of living. He was very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the <hi>Quakers</hi> by his Writings; being
fitted and well accompliſh'd for that work by his
acute Wit, and eloquent Pen; and alſo able
to ſerve their intereſt, becauſe of his riches and
affluence of fortune, together with his favour
and weight with the King; and as he was able,
ſo he was very willing, frequenting the company
of the <hi>Quakers</hi> continually, labouring by all
means to advance their cauſe, defending it from
all oppoſition and injury, demeaning himſelf ſo
forwardly, that he ſeem'd more Sollicitous for
them, than for himſelf; but withal not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50388:128"/>
to plead for the liberty and admiſſion to
publick offices, of other Sectaries, eſpecially the
Papiſts, inſomuch that he was ſuſpected to be
one of their Gang, and at laſt came to be envy'd
and hated by the <hi>Quakers</hi> on that account. But
he was ſo bent and eager for this liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
that he would have none profeſſing the
Name of Chriſt excluded from the ſame; But
of this I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely
afterwards.</p>
                     <p>When at this time the Adverſaries of the <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
relented and ſlacken'd their perſecution
againſt them, the <hi>Quakers</hi> took occaſion not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to aſſemble and congregate more frequently
and publickly, but to prepare and amaſs all
things neceſſary or conducive to their mutual
help and eſtabliſhment, or to the Ornament and
Splendor of their Churches. From that time they
introduc'd a new and more acurate Oeconomy,
Partition and Adminiſtration of all their affairs;
keeping ſome order among their Miniſters, who
likewiſe had their Meetings and mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes;
and began now to be orderly call'd and
prepar'd for that work; they introduc'd alſo a
form of diſcipline for cenſure of Actions, and
a certain Solemnity for confirmation of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
The manner and form of all which, is
not ſo eaſily to be Learn'd from their Writings,
which do not touch upon theſe things, as from
their own diſcourſes and converſe, for they do
not uſe to conceal any of theſe matters, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if they be ſeriouſly and gravely ask'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ſuſpicion of a deſign. Theſe Men did
always object to the Proteſtants in <hi>England,</hi> and
elſewhere, the Hierarchy of their Church (account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it a moſt vitious and ſiniſtrous order) or the
ordinary diſtinction of perſons, and diſtribution
of Offices in the Church; particularly the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and juriſdiction of ſome Perſons, and
the variety of Government and Adminiſtration
thorough ſo many degrees of places and dignity;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50388:129"/>
for they imagin'd the Church to be all one body,
of which each particular Member has its Office
allotted to it, in defending and edifying the
Church, according as they are capable to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
either to the publick, or their Neighbour;
pretending, that ſince no gifts are given by God
in vain, or which do not produce their proper
Fruit, there be as many Offices in the Church as
he has given gifts; even as in the humane body
all the Members bear ſome proportion in advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the good of the whole, ſo it is in the
Church; in which nothing of Government or
Authority is to be us'd, but only Miniſtry and
Mutual ſervice for the good of the whole. So
from that time the <hi>Quakers</hi> were of theſe
thoughts; which they maintain to this day;
acknowledging an Aſſociation and Community,
and alſo direction and adminiſtration in the
Church; deſiring that thoſe who excel others
in Wiſdom and Vertue, ſhould be had in greater
reſpect and eſteem, and be accounted preferable
to others in order and function; So that among
them whoever of either Sex, is eminent for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
and Goodneſs, excels in Dignity and
Office. They have alſo ſome who conſtantly
addict themſelves to the Miniſtry of Preaching
the Goſpel. Thoſe they call Miniſters, or by a
joynt kind of Speech, they ſay they are in the
Miniſtry. Some of theſe Miniſters do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
themſelves to one place, but range up and
down, trying what new Proſelytes they can gain,
or deſigning to overſee and confirm thoſe that
are already incorporated into that Society. Theſe
are as Apoſtles to the Sect, others fix their abode
at one place, and watch over their particular
flock as paſtors. There be women alſo that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Example of the Men. It ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuffice to have given caution in this place,
that whatever we have ſaid, or are about to ſay
further concerning the Males of that Sect, is to
be underſtood according to that <hi>Regula juris,</hi>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:50388:129"/>
which comprehends the feminine Sex under the
maſculine. Next unto the Miniſters are the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
or Elders, who exceed the reſt, as in Age
and Experience, ſo in Wiſdom. Theſe take
counſel together with the Miniſters for managing
all their Religious concerns; who together with
them, or with others eminent for prudence
and wiſdom, are carefully to obſerve all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
that may fall out in the Church, and to
ſee that all things therein proceed right; as, if
any make defection from their faith, or commit
an open manifeſt ſin, or be ſuſpected of any crime,
or have done any thing culpable againſt his
Neighbour; if any thing be wanting for the
promotion of unity, concord, and peace among
themſelves; they preſently come to rectify it, or
elſe ſend thoſe they repoſe truſt and Confidence
in, to do all that is neceſſary for advancing the
good deſired, or removing the evil that incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
them. Their office is likewiſe to viſit the
poor and needy, and relieve their neceſſities; alſo
to take care of thoſe who conceal and are aſham'd
to own their poverty; of the <hi>Orphans,</hi> widdows,
old people, the afflicted and miſerable, and the
ſick; unto whom they are to afford what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for their ſuſtenance and relief; for which
end the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay, they make Contributions of
Money, putting it into cheſts, and diſtributing it as
they have occaſion; Theſe Men are alſo to allot
every one their particular offices and functions,
which they are ſeverally and diſtinctly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
<hi>Stephen Criſp</hi> wrote a monitory Epiſtle,
to all Churches concerning theſe offices, which is
very well worth any Man's reading. All the
<hi>Quakers</hi> when ask'd about theſe matters, do migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
extoll and magnify the diligence, liberality,
and bounty of their Aſſociates one to another.
However, theſe Elders and the Miniſters, do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

                        </gap>n among themſelves, for delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
about the affairs of their Sect, and the
neceſſities of their Church; which Conventions
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50388:130"/>
are ſomewhat like, to what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
call Presbyteries and Synods, and the <hi>French,</hi>
Conſiſtories. There were of them in <hi>Holland,</hi>
who, becauſe no Society could be laudable and
permanent without Government and Laws, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to have an Eccleſiaſtical ſenate conſtituted
in every Church, conſiſting of the ancient Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Men and ſuch as were married (excluding
Batchellours) who ſhould have the Government
lodg'd in their hands, and order every thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to certain Rules and Laws, laid down
by them. But others oppos'd it, pretending that
it would introduce a new Hierarchy, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
their Community, and reſtrain and ſuppreſs
the gifts of the Spirit. They have likewiſe Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
like to thoſe we call Claſſes, and provincial
and national Synods, or Councils. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
are Celebrated oftner or Seldomer, as
the number and variety of their Churches is; but
ſo as to Allot each Sex (Men and Women) their
diſtinct and particular Meetings. Wherefore if
the Churches be more numerous or large, the
Seniors or Elders with the Miniſters meet fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
chiefly on the firſt days of the weeks,
and alſo on other days, at which time, after
having Communicated their thoughts one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they confer and conſult together what is to
be every Man's task, what part of the charge he
is to undertake, and what is incumbent upon him
to do. Other Meetings are appointed every fourth
week, in which they deliberate of the affairs
common to the Church. Others every three
months in which they conſider of their provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
affairs, and ſuch as are remitted to them by
appeal. In theſe they inſpect into, and Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
all Books that are Printed, after they
have been perus'd and approv'd by the Cenſors
appointed for that purpoſe. The Acts of theſe
aſſemblies are put into Regiſters, of which ſome
are very curiouſly and Elegantly done. They
have Anniverſary Synods in every conſiderable
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50388:130"/>
Kingdom, to whom belongs the care and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of all the affairs of that Kingdom. In
<hi>England,</hi> they have a fix'd Anniverſary Synod, on
the 3d. day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> according to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
calculation; which they pitch'd upon,
not out of any ſuperſtition, (for they are as
averſe and eſtranged from Religious obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of days, as any people in the World) but
that the time might be determin'd, and every
one have ſufficient information of the ſame.
This Synod continues ſitting for three or four
days only, unleſs ſome extraordinary buſineſs
be tabled before them, which requires much
debate, and is hard to be decided, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
in the year ninety four, in the caſe of
<hi>Keith,</hi> when it fate whole twelve days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Delegates alſo come to this Synod from
the Churches in all other Countries, or places
where the <hi>Quakers</hi> obtain any footing; but
theſe muſt be ſuch as are in the Miniſtry. At
their firſt Meeting together, liberty is given
for all manner of people to come in and be
preſent, which time is ſpent in Preaching, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Thankſgiving. After which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates
retire all into one room. They have
no preſident to their Meeting, which place
(they ſay) is ſupplied by the Holy Ghoſt; but
they have a Clerk who marks down every
thing, that is mov'd before the Aſſembly. It
would be tedious and needleſs here to inſert
any further account of their Councils; for
there be ſtories enough flying about of them;
only I ſhall here remark what are the ſubjects
moſtly treated of by them, when thus ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conveen'd. They take into conſideration,
all that may pertain to the general good of
all the Churches. They lay before the whole
aſſembly the State of every particular Church,
eſpecially if there be any thing memorable, or
worthy their conſideration. They make a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of the ſufferers for Religion; deſcribing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50388:131"/>
what their ſufferings were, or for what cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
they were inflicted. They examine all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
or rare events and accidents. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
all Controverſies and Differences. They
enquire into the Lives and Converſations of
their Miniſters; and check thoſe who perform
their tasks negligently or remiſsly; or who
through officiouſneſs and impertinency affect to
be Miniſters of the word, forſaking the offices
that become them better, and are more indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably
requir'd at their hands than this, which
they uſurp to themſelves without invitation or
call, running up and down as inveſted with this
pretended function, and turning it to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
lucre and gain. They admoniſh and exhort
one another, to be careful and diligent in the
tasks alloted them, and to conform themſelves to
the dignity and gravity of their reſpective offices.
They ſettle a ſtandard for theſe things, which
relate to Domeſtick cares of Chriſtians in their
Families, eſpecially to the education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
endeavouring and exhorting by all means
to be aware of theſe two deſtructive Evils, which
are more Conſequential than all others, <hi>viz.</hi> Indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Children too great liberty, and decking
and adorning their bodies too gaudily; leſt by
ſo doing they occaſion ſin, and contract infamy
to themſelves. They take care alſo for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of Captives, and relief of the poor
(ſuch of them as are known to be well and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly
diſpos'd) and conſult of many other
things, for giving mutual aſſiſtance to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
When the Synod is diſmiſs'd, all their Acts
and Deciſions are enregiſtred by the publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Synod; which are afterwards co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py'd
from the Records, and Printed, in order to
be ſent to all the Synods of their Aſſociates
throughout the World, or to any particular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Aſſociated with them; of which Prints I
have ſeveral Examples by me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:50388:131"/>
As not a few before in <hi>England,</hi> ſo the <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
did always invey againſt the Liturgy (which
was laid aſide, in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s, a directory being
ſubſtituted in its place, and again reſtor'd in K.
<hi>Charles</hi>'s Reign) as ſtuffed with the fopperies of
Popiſh Darkneſs, ſuperſtitious and ill placed
Leſſons and Prayers, Ornaments, Dreſſes, bodily
Actions and Geſtures, and many rites of obſerving
holy days. Theſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> did vigorouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
preferring the ſimple Exerciſes in their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
When they meet, after a long ſilence, and
quiet Recollecting of their thoughts, they make
it their whole care and buſineſs, earneſtly to wait
for the coming of the Spirit, till at length they
be mov'd or ſtir'd up to hold forth; and then
they pray, preach, or ſing, according to the Spirit's
ſudden impulſe. In like manner the reſt ſits ſtill
to hear. For while they ſtay in the place where
they worſhip, bending their thoughts inwardly
with regard to the Spirit, they look what he
does or Dictates within, and where they perceive
the ſpeaker to be, thither they direct their minds
and attentions, ſearching themſelves, they bring
all home to their own Conſcience; And thus
while the Spirit delays his coming, each of 'em
prays inwardly unto God for himſelf; ſighing
and groaning now and then deeply, for great
ſtriving, and contrary affections. They ſometimes
move themſelves, or are moved ſo far, as iſſues
in a great trembling of the body, not only of
ſome but of moſt or all of 'em. This, 'tis ſaid,
does often fall out by the reſiſtance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
inſinuations. I was told by one worthy to
be believ'd, at a certain time they fell all ſo a
trembling, he himſelf being one, that the place
was ſhaken as 'twere with an Earth-quake. If it
happen that none of 'em obtain the preſence of
the Spirit, when he is not pleas'd to move 'em to
ſpeak, they ſometimes all go away as they came,
without uttering a word among 'em. But even
then they ſay, they loſe not their labour, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50388:132"/>
one carries away ſome advantage for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and while one prays for another, thence alſo
ſome profit does reſult to the reſt; yea, while
they pray for them who come only to look on,
laugh, ſport, or ſcoff, they ſay, ſuch receive a
wonderful virtue; to better their Life, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
their Converſion. Thus they do in their
common and publick exerciſes: They worſhip
God by praying, praiſing or preaching, according
to the various Agitation of the Spirit. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they worſhip in all three kinds; not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly,
but one by one, unleſs it happen they
ſing all together. But their chief and ſolemn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
is the preaching of the word. This prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
conſiſts in propoſing a certain theme for
Edification, or exhortation to ſome duty. And
becauſe they think, the power of the preacher is
not placed in words, or bodily motions (unleſs
the compoſure of his Voice and Countenance, be
ſuitably managed with ſimplicity and gravity)
but only in the worth or weight of things; they
affect not form, or Method taken from Rules of
Art, but make uſe of plain and obvious words;
not intending to gratify the itching of the Ear,
but to expreſs the interior feeling of the Soul,
and make an Impreſſion upon the hearer's mind,
with an active Air not of geſture, but of face and
utterance. They ſharply cenſure Theologues for
becoming Ethologues or Mimicks, whoſe Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
does wholly conſiſt in Geſticulation.
Their prayers are moſtly doleful Lamentations,
the lower they be, they eſteem 'em more dutiful.
They ſing and praiſe, not by a regular pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of words, or muſical Melody, far leſs by
the Numbers of metre or verſe (which ſort of
ſinging is never lawful with them, but when one
of 'em has an extemporary faculty to compoſe)
but in the colliſion, ſound, and ſtretching of the
voice, almoſt as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Afric,</hi>
if you have ever heard 'em, as I have 'em both,
frequently ſinging in their own Countreys. And
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50388:132"/>
thus not only one or two, but all that are preſent
do ſing with a ſweet and pleaſant voice. In ſuch
exerciſes the Miniſters are the moſt frequent and
chief Actors; tho none of the reſt are excluded
but thoſe that are fooliſh, troubleſome, or ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
They don't only take heed what any of
'em ſays, but alſo what forms or words he uſes.
As many if not all things among 'em are ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
ſo they agree to no other Communion but
their own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; hence if a Cunning or Inſnaring
mocker come in, and begin to ape their diſcourſe
or carriage, with their words and looks they
mark him as a ſcoffer, and then forbids him or
elſe thruſts him out. And this is their publick
worſhip. In private they ſpend much time and
pains in meditating, praying, reading, eſpecially
the word of God, in teaching their Servants, and
Children, both in thoſe Arts and Manners that
concern civil Society; and alſo in the worſhip of
God, and Chriſtian Converſation, with a lively
inſtruction, which they call Catechizing, to
which uſe they have books very properly adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Moreover, it's alſo their cuſtom in their
houſes, never to expreſs a Religious duty with
an outward voice, as praying to God, craving his
bleſſing, e're they take meat, or go to bed, till
they feel the excitation or impulſion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
while they want this, they're content to
think with themſelves, what they eſteem conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
and agreeable, and talk ſilently with their
own mind, without External or vocal expreſſion.
From whence ariſes the miſtake of ſome, and
malicious calumny of others, that the <hi>Quakers</hi>
never pray unto God, but like beaſts ruſh upon
every thing inconſiderately. Which they wou'd
bear more patiently, came it only from the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that's ready to ſwallow up the belief of any
thing; and not from a ſeeming better ſort of
Men, that pretend to digeſt, ſpeak, or write no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what they've put to the touch-ſtone
for Confirmation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:50388:133"/>
Tho they're greatly devoted to the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, yet they're very averſe to all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
which none but the unfortunate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
or irreligious do ordinarily purſue: Thus
they often meet for the ſervice of God: For that
they've their Houſes in ſome places very fair and
large. Out of theſe now you'll ſeldom hear 'em
diſputing or diſcourſing with others, of thoſe
things they're willing to teach concerning
their Religion, or Duties of Chriſtians; though
formerly in the Streets, Markets, and other's Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
they forbore not to declaim their petty prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings.
When I ask'd the Cauſe of their diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
that practice, the ſame Neceſſity and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
remaining, they gave no other Anſwer than,
<hi>That it is not now the Holy Ghoſt's Will.</hi> They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with ſome Proteſtants, in owning no Holy-Days,
but they diſagree in this a little, wherein
ſome Proteſtants alſo herd with 'em, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
that the Firſt Day of the Week is obſerv'd,
which from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt we call the
<hi>Lord's Day,</hi> and that by the Force of the Fourth
Command. They indeed acknowledge it very
neceſſary, that a time be ſet a part for aſſembling
to worſhip God in publick, and that then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
ſhou'd refrain from working, and that the
Lord's day is very proper for that purpoſe;
wherein the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians
met in one place. Therefore on this and other
days, they have publick Meetings as occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.
In great and Populous Cities, as <hi>London</hi>
they often aſſemble almoſt every other day, and
that with ſuch a confluence of people, that when
there can't ſo many be crowded together, ſo as
one may have way for another to get out, ſome
of 'em in the throng are taken with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>unting;
but by vinegar, they have for that uſe, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd
and reſtor'd: This gave riſe to that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
ſtory, which, as every rumor, taken from an
ill reſented Action of ſome one of 'em, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreads
the Minds and Diſcourſes of all, that the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50388:133"/>
                        <hi>Quakers,</hi> at their Meeting have a bottle of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
which whoever drinks of, is immediately
made <hi>Quaker,</hi> As theſe with many other unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
Men, did moſt bitterly Tax ſome Proteſtant
practices, as preparing Licenſing, ordaining and
maintaining of Miniſters, ſo of late they've be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to jangle among themſelves, and more and
more draw one another to their contrary Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
On theſe they now more eagerly inſiſt.
They were, and as yet are greatly offended, that
thoſe, who aim at a ſacred function, ſhou'd be
form'd and imbelliſh'd with thoſe previous ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
whereby they gradually arrive at that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
And thus they reproach Parents and
Friends, who devote Children to the Miniſtry
from their tender years, as if they were deſign'd
for ſome Trade, Traffick, or civil buſineſs, that
they may exerciſe themſelves in the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for a Livelihood, ſo that the office, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Faith and Piety, are made matter of, and
not preferr'd to their gain; that Children ſhou'd
be thus educated for offices of this Nature, and
delivered to the tutelage of teachers, however
they be inclin'd, or whatever Spirit they be led
by, tho they do nothing but commanded and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd,
while as in other occupations, we conſider
what a Child's Genius prompts him to, and our
deſigns and purpoſes are hitherto referr'd. That
Boys are ſo poſted to Schools and Colleges, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
time to conſider and ſearch their Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that they may direct their Courſe according
to the ſtream of their Temper, and after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
are ſo inveigled with ſtudy and deſire to
attain, what they've been foreſtall'd with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
thoughts of, that, being unconcern'd for
the inlightning, and converting grace of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
when they arrive at ſome pitch of that ſort
of Life, they're ſo tenacious, that nothing can
occur to pull 'em from their purpoſe; eſpecially
when the change wou'd be late, and Age comes
on, ſo that they can ſcarce begin another profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50388:134"/>
project: Beſides, the rude and unpolliſh'd youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
whoſe minds are impreſſible as wax, and of ſo
ſoft a temper that they may be eaſily drawn out
into any ſhape, whoſe prelections they've once fix'd
their Attendance on, thoſe, with an inconſiderate
raſhneſs, they muſt ape and imitate, in all the
thoughts and Actions of their Miniſtry and Life:
And yet many run alſo headlong into Gaming,
Idling, Rioting, and Wantoning. So at length
they betake themſelves to their Miniſterial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
and many wholly ſtretch all the Nerves
of their skill, to talk only with a volubility of
Tongue to the hearers, and ſome Courts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
of voice and geſture, placing there the
Power of Doctrine and ſtreſs of Eloquence.
When at this rate from prating Puppets they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
perfect Orators, and are reck'ned worthy,
after a Specimen, to be prefer'd to the care of
the Lord's Vineyard, the Laurel's propos'd to him
that knows beſt to ſcatter words, ſo as to feed
the Ears and Eyes, with the grateful delight of
<hi>Debonnair</hi> and <hi>Oratry;</hi> Men taken with their
chanting, like a Shepherd's pipe, chuſe 'em for
their paſtors, while yet (ſay they) nothing that's
ſpiritual or ſavoury drops from their Lips, into
the minds of the hearers, and they receive little
but words, ſitting to hear the reading of a few
dry ſentences, as ſtones on ſtones, and dead on
the dead, which they then ſtand upon. This
they ſay of Students affectations in the Schools.
They acknowledge the underſtanding of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
eſpecially of <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi>
formerly was, and ſtill is very uſeful to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
and expound the Scripture, yet they
take 'em not therefore to be neceſſary to the
Miniſtry, which they wou'd have to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by the Spirit alone, nor ſo profitable, that
one unacquainted with them, muſt be ſtil'd <hi>Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot,
Illiterate</hi> and of no autority. But Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
as it's generally taught in the Schools, and
School Divinity from hence ariſing, they not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50388:134"/>
only think uſeleſs, but alſo pernicious, and a
plague Deſtructive of ſound Doctrine, brought
in by the Devil, as the Idol of Lyers, and a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
to the knowledge of God and Godlineſs.
They deſpiſe the diſtinguiſhing Titles of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick
Dignities, as Maſters, Licentiates, Doctors,
Profeſſors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Saying they only tend to make
him, that's inveſted with the honour, taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of with greater reſpect, and ſo to ſwell him
to a further Caprice, and affect a Lording it o'er
his former fellows. They blame Proteſtants, for
reſtraining Preachers, by Divers Conſtitutions, to a
certain Number, and preſcribing Laws of yearly
revenues, impoſing, or ſuffering themſelves to be
impos'd on, and not endeavouring that through
Churches, at leaſt greater, more preachers and
teachers may be appointed, to teach and admon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
all, publickly and privately, and execute
other Offices of the Miniſtry, or be ſent to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in Foreign Nations, that theſe, that are
ſtrangers to God and Godlineſs, may be carefully
imbru'd with the knowledge of both, that the
Borders of the Kingdom of Chriſt may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and inlarged to the utmoſt ends of the
Earth. Laſtly, they charge the Proteſtant
Churches, for maintaining their Paſtors too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely
with Salaries. They deny not the proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Food and Raiment for ſuch, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
for a convenient life, nay, they own it
to be ſuitable to the Command of God. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
then, they differ from the preſent Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
both the open-hearted and more ſimple, and
crafty and more reſerv'd, who tho liberal of
their labours, under Colour of Munificence,
draws the unwary into their Ginns, that they
may gull 'em of a daily ſuſtenance at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
They wou'd neither have the ſtudy nor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Miniſtry, ſo to confine the Actions of
ones Life, as to inforce the neglect of all other
buſineſs, whereby he may furniſh himſelf with a
competency. They won'd neither have ſixt Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50388:135"/>
given, nor pactions to intevrene twixt
paſtor and people, leſt the latter be forc'd to give
ſuperfluouſly and ſumptuouſly to cheriſh the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury,
and idleneſs of the former. They decry
driving Miniſters to their duty for gain, as ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
Mercenary, Sordid, and Conductitious, that
they may only work for wealth, which when got
inclines 'em to do little or nothing, yea, gives
riſe to Avarice, Luſt, Idleneſs, Wantonneſs, Riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
perpetual Contention, Ambitious, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering,
and very grievous Iniquities. Whoſe
houſes ſeem's dect with an almoſt Royal Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
who call themſelves Preachers of Chriſt
for Chriſt's ſake, when they become ſo pompous
neglecting their Office, deſpiſing their inferiors,
oppreſſing with Tyranny their people, they ſhew
how <hi>Antichriſt</hi> of old got firſt entrance, and then
footing in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Theſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> oppoſe, by a bare mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the manner of their Miniſtry which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
obſerve and reaſon for thus. Since all in
the Church, as Members of the Body, have their
proper gifts, they may alſo have proper operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and functions for the good of the whole.
They ſay therefore, that every Member of Chriſt
ſhou'd ſtir up and try the gifts of the Spirit in
himſelf, and Miniſter to others according to what
he has received; If he feel himſelf diſpos'd and
led by the Spirit, he may, and ought to aſpire
to be paſtor of a Church, and that when, or
where the Spirit draws or invites: And this they
make his Call, neither here do they require any
Preparatory exerciſe, or particular Call from any
certain Aſſembly, or Approbation of People,
whether they be properly enchurch'd or not. Yet
ſay they tho one thinks himſelf fit for, and by
the Spirit call'd to, he muſt not yet raſhly run
upon the Miniſtry, till, by a company or general
Meeting of Miniſters, intruſted therewith, by
whoſe invocation the Spirit may come, he be
worthily approven. And ſo they try if he be fit

for the office, or if it be expedient to confer it
on him, warning him after he has taken it on
him, ſo to labour therein that it it may be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for his and the Church's Ornament and Safety.
Thus he's Prieſted. They admit no preparing,
ordaining, or Ceremonies, which Proteſtants uſe
at Inaugurating Miniſters, eſteeming 'em fooliſh,
fruitleſs and trifling. And that thoſe new Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
may be more glib at their work, they give
letters from a general or particular Meeting, that
remote Churches, where they're ſent, may receive
'em more readily, to which ſometimes they Annex
Commendatory Epiſtles from other famous
Friends or Churches. As for the Miniſter's main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
this is their Method. They order ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
to be taken, but what is willingly given, and
ſo computed, that every ones Eſtate may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
and no more than to Anſwer the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Life to encourage Induſtry, not to kindle
Luxury. But if any Miniſter be pinch'd with
Poverty, by the narrow-ſoul'd Penuriouſneſs of
a People, they permit him to leave 'em, and
ſhake his Shoo's duſt againſt 'em. So ſay they
Chriſt commanded, and ſo the Apoſtles did. It
falls out with <hi>Quakers</hi> as with other Societies to
inſinuate themſelves with others upon ſlight Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
who, tho they carry themſelves ſo
and ſo in Company that know them, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
with Men of ne're ſo good note, their
Words and Actions betray their Inſolence; and
time lets their boldneſs and importunity creep
out of their lurking holes. The frequent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of this foments the ſuſpicion, that the
<hi>Quakers</hi> are all a diſſembling Generation, and
that they're ſo far from that Simplicity, which
pretending to be the beſt of Chriſtians they make
ſhew of; that they're the refuſe gather'd from
the baſeſt of Men. This the <hi>Quakers</hi> know, and
grant there are ſome, who do neither by the
ſeign'd pretence of that perſwaſion, nor cloaking
the Motions of their deprav'd nature; but while
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50388:136"/>
they adhere to their Fellowſhip, not knowingly
nor willingly, but by common frailty, unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
fall into groſs wickedneſs; and that there
are others diſtracted with the Blandiſhments of
this World, as not being able to indure its ſhock,
who are ſo fetter'd with the thoughts of Riches,
that they yield to the Pleaſure and Idleneſs of a
more delicate Life; ſome alſo that are remiſs and
careleſs of their Children: And laſtly that there
are ſome that revolt from the beſt Examples and
Inſtitutions, as too harſh and rigid in the Eyes
of the World, who, breaking the ſhekels that
before chain'd 'em, affect a more beau-like at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and a Courteous deportmentment in civil
Converſation, as a certain mark of a good Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
This is oft the caſe of women and thoſe
that are youthful. For thoſe delinquencies the
<hi>Quakers</hi> ſay, they have the Rod of Eccleſiaſtick
Cenſure and Diſcipline: Which by Chriſt's Rule,
in the Goſpel of <hi>Matthew,</hi> they ſay they uſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
to practiſe. They condemn no Man till they
hear his defence. They write to thoſe that can't
be preſent to Anſwer by letter, what they have
to ſay. They more meekly wink at the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Slips of time and neceſſity, than the free
faults of will and Inclination: As at preſent in
<hi>England</hi> and elſewhere they refuſe to pay Tythes
for War, or maintaining the regular Clergy. But
they've been ſo oft vex'd and haraſs'd for this,
that they may not again incur the like danger,
they pay it in its ſeaſon, not asking, why its ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd.
Tho the Cenſors of manners think 'em
here peccant, yet they paſs it as an unavoidable
weakneſs. Now for their Marrying. They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
admoniſh the younger ſort, not to ruſh on a
matter of ſuch moment, without conſent and
advice of Parents, which here may prove their
happineſs, or bane of their miſery. They, that
deſire to be married, intimate it to their Church-Fellowſhip:
They ask 'em if they be in earneſt
or have conſent of Parents, kindred or Tutors, or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50388:136"/>
if formerly married, if they've order'd their
Eſtate according to the occaſion of a Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Life. Then they ask the Company, if they
know any thing againſt 'em. After the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
there's made mention of the Marriage,
twice on Lord's days, before all that are preſent:
And ſometimes only on monthly Meetings.
When the time is expir'd, the Bride and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
with Friends and Acquaintances that are
willing, come all to the aſſembly. There they're
ask'd if they do, and will love each other mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
and to promiſe to preſerve their Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
honourably, their Soul pure, and the body
clean as its veſſel, and perform the Reciprocal
incumbent duties, and never to part till that
fate divide 'em, which is the common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
Lot of all Mankind. Then each of
'em opens their thoughts, according to what is
preſcrib'd in the Commentaries, ſubſcribing their
Names with thoſe intereſs'd that are willing.</p>
                     <p>Thus their Marriage is conſummated. There
follows ſome Feaſting and Mirth, if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
be for't but without the uſual vanities at
ſuch occaſions, which only feeds the Guts, Ears,
or Eyes, and awakens and nouriſhes Unchaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Luxury. In <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere,
their Marriages are now leſs frequent, ſince diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved
by the Magiſtrates as an illegal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, and their Children counted bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of a ſpurious Birth: Having ſpoken of their
Marriage, I ſhall alſo mention how they treat
their Children. A few days after the Child is
born, they call together the Midwife and other
women, who were helpful to the woman in
her Labour, and deſire 'em to teſtify the time
and place when ſuch an Infant was born to
ſuch and ſuch Parents, this they have recorded
in a particular book, kept for that purpoſe in
one of their houſes. Of their funeral rites we
have already. Diſcourſed; It is the general Lot
of humane Affairs, to continue ſhort while in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50388:137"/>
the ſame Condition, and have a ſhort leaſe of
Eaſe and Tranquillity; After theſe people for a
little had Reſt, a new ſtorm aroſe, which fell
firſt on their heads, whoſe coming over to that
party I mention'd at large, and then Rag'd
againſt almoſt all the Members of the Society:
For <hi>George Keith</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the year 67, was
thrown into, and continued in Priſon at <hi>Aberdeen</hi>
for many months: He then wrote a book of the
immediate Revelation of Chriſt in Man, which
is a Summary of all their Doctrine; the next
year, <hi>W. Penn</hi> on the ſame ſcore, was put in
Cuſtody at <hi>London, Penn</hi> and ſome of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
had a Conference with the Presbyterians
touching their Doctrine of the Trinity, and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of Sins, wherein neither party could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the other by Argument, Nay at laſt, not ſo
much as hear each other ſpeak: When this had
given riſe to a great Confuſion, <hi>Penn</hi> being firm
to his purpoſe, and reſtleſs till he had effected it,
betakes himſelf to a Retirement for Writing.
Shortly after he publiſhes a book, ſhaking theſe
three Presbyterian Doctrines, pretending to fight
with the Teſtimonies of Scripture, and Reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Implanted into the knowledge and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Men, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is one God, ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in three diſtinct and ſeparate perſons; that
there's no Remiſſion of ſins without full Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and that Men are Juſtified by imputed
Righteouſneſs; I make choice of thoſe words,
which <hi>Penn</hi> does in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as ſuited to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Idiom</hi> of that Tongue, which now others,
when they ſpeak of Theological Subjects, do uſe.
Theſe words I ſuppoſe he the rather pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becauſe the Presbyterians ſnarl'd at his form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
expre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ions, about the firſt Article; concerning
the ſeparate perſons in the Trinity, as if <hi>Penn</hi>
had been more verbal than real in his Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.
This did not only inſpire the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
but alſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy, with anger and
hatred which broke out into Reproaches, that his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50388:137"/>
book ſhow'd his mind, and what he was, <hi>viz.</hi>
A denier of the Trinity, and ſo, not at all to be
ſuffer'd amongſt Chriſtians. Upon theſe Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<hi>Penn</hi> was Impriſoned, where he wrote a
book call'd, <hi>The Crown not without the Croſs,</hi>
handling the Actions of Life and not Articles of
Religion, not barren of things or ſwell'd with
words but fruitful of matter, ponderous, and
ſententious for its phraſes, and poliſh'd with the
Ornaments of orat'ry, ſo that his Enemies Scruple
not to praiſe his skill and induſtry. <hi>Penn</hi> was
ſet free by the Kings deſire; who alſo, becauſe
danger ſeem'd to threaten his fortune which he
had Conſiderably in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> (by
the endeavouring of ſome ſo to ſhorten his wings,
that they might ne're again grow) did ſo protect
him as to prevent the ſeizure and confiſcation of
his goods. About this time by his Raſhneſs, Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Impudence, <hi>Salomon Eccles</hi> felt the
ſmart of what he drew on himſelf, which he
might have avoided. This <hi>Zealot</hi> whom in the
former book from a Muſician we made <hi>Quaker,</hi>
ſo Contemn'd the ſweeter Children of the Muſes,
as to expoſe their Inſtruments to the cruelty of
the flames; He was no ſooner made Preacher,
than he Acted his part with ſuch eagerneſs as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
the expectation of his own Party, and
fill'd the Ears and Tongues of the contrary. In
the year 67 he wrote a Dialogue concerning the
excellency and uſe of the Art of Muſick, betwixt
himſelf as opponent and the Defendents of that
Art, whom he brings in ſpeaking and ſo ſilenc'd
as to raiſe himſelf <hi>Trophies</hi> of Praiſe, and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
The next year, he publiſhed a Challenge
daring Presbyterians, Independents, Baptiſts, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
and all other Doctors and Paſtors, to try
by this Experiment with him, who were the true
Worſhippers of God: That without either meat
or drink for ſeven Days and Nights, they might
devout themſelves to watching and praying, and
they on whom Celeſtial fire ſhould fall down,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50388:138"/>
might be eſteem'd to receive that Eternal Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
for the true Religion that's acceptable to
God: But there was none found ſo frothy or
vain, as to enter the Liſts with ſo fooliſh a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenger;
tho theſe words paſs'd unreſented, what
followed the next year had not the ſame ſucceſs;
For <hi>Eccles</hi> in a town of <hi>Galloway</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
knowing of a Popiſh Meeting at ſome diſtance,
puts a Chaſſing-diſh with fire and brimſtone on
his head, and goes to their aſſembly with three
of his Aſſociates; and giving the fire to his Friends
who received it on their knees, on the blazing of
the flame, he denounces to all the ſudden danger
of being devour'd with fire, if they did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
forſake their Idolatry: Returning from
thence into the City, and repeating his famous
precept, and ſign, that they might alſo learn the
wiſdom to amend, who rewarded his Sermon
and ſign no better than with blows and ill words,
and then with a Jayl, upon his Enlargement,
and return to <hi>London,</hi> he Commences the like Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
in <hi>Bartholomew-fair,</hi> to the whole
Croud in the Ring of the Rabble, but, a ſharp
Man attacking him, had diſarm'd him of his
ſhield, and given him a mark, to put him in
mind of that time and place; had not another
of ſome note and honeſty defended <hi>Eccles</hi> with
his naked Sword, and deliver'd him from the
hands of the enraged Multitude: The <hi>Quakers</hi>
themſelves take ſuch Actions to be unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and inconſiderate, not long after, <hi>Eccles</hi> went
to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and at <hi>Cork,</hi> in the great Church, the
ſervice being ended, he thunders that ſolemn
Scripture ſome ſo often abuſe; <hi>The Prayers of
the Wicked are an Abomination to the Lord.</hi>
Whence, being dragg'd into Priſon, and then
whipt through all the ſtreets by the common
Hangman, he was thrown out of the City as a
Vagabond, and factious fellow, whoſe deprav'd
mind, ill cuſtom, and fooliſh humour ſtir'd
him up to pervert and trouble the people. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50388:138"/>
                        <hi>Eccles</hi> went into New <hi>England,</hi> where,
at a Sermon, being greatly mov'd with anger,
he Propheſied a Judgment as ordain'd by God to
fall on a certain perſon, within a time he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd;
but the falſehood of his Oracle giving him
experience of his vanity, and afterward to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
by a publick writing, the folly and error or
his own Raſhneſs; having at length imitated an
Ingenuous Man in this; for as it's beſt to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be repented of, ſo it's next beſt, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
to repair what's done amiſs; Whilſt
the Don's of the <hi>Quakers</hi> were thus puniſhed; In
<hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and eſpecially in <hi>Ireland,</hi> their
whole Society met likeways with great oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for refuſing to forbear their aſſemblies, which
having mention'd already what I find to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
I ſhall here content my ſelf barely to
Name. <hi>Fox</hi> this year went into <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet did
little there, but viſit his friends, and adviſe each
of 'em to what he Judg'd for their Advantage:
<hi>Fox</hi> having thence return'd in <hi>England,</hi> and till
then, by reaſon of troubleſome Incumbrances,
been oblig'd to lead a ſingle life, having now got
ſome liberty, and eaſe, grew weary of the lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs
of a Solitary bed, tho otherways free, and
pleaſant in it ſelf; and in this mind, he addreſt
himſelf to <hi>Margaret</hi> the Widdow of <hi>L. Fell,</hi> his
old Friend, with whom he had lodg'd; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
by the advice of both their Friends, he
marry'd her, neither to ſupply the beggery of the
one, nor gratify the luſt of the other, (and
therefore they were leſs anxious for dowry) but
from mutual love: They liv'd, tho without any
common off-ſpring, very lovingly to a great Age:
I thought it not unſeaſonable to mention this,
conſidering what that <hi>Frenchman</hi> has lately writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of this pair (who's now if we may believe it
a good Catholick, tho twice before a grand Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat)
and of many honeſt Men in his <hi>French</hi>
Treatiſe, not unelegant, if we look to the luſtre
of the Language, yet ſtuffed with lies for the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50388:139"/>
laughter of the people. The year 70 was more
worthy of our Remembrance: So many as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in haunting their Aſſemblies not paying
Tythes, abating informers of what they demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
refuſing to ſwear, either lightly, or Solemny,
were variouſly oppreſs'd, and afflicted in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
There were aſſembled to diſturb, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
their Meetings, as extinguiſhers of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
flame, in one place the Magiſtrates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
in another, their Officers and Miniſters;
In another Souldiers, and in others Church Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
with their Wardens, and Beadles, who
coming upon them, when met in their Aſſemblies
took a note of their Names, that after a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
they might deal with them according to
ſentence of Law; ſometimes this treatment was
with force and rigour, It was mild to box and
buſſet them with fiſts or battons, ſo violently that
ſometimes the Cudgels were ſplit into pieces; In
<hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> one taking a Ladder from the lower
to the upper parts of the Houſe, threw it down
upon them with ſuch rage and bitterneſs, that an
old widdow woman among 'em, having her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
broken, ſoon after gave up the Ghoſt; a few
were Incarcerated, a pecuniary mulct being laid
on each of their heads, of five, ten, or twenty,
<hi>lib. ſter.</hi> according to the quality, or Eſtate of
the Perſon; who had lent their houſes to, ſpoken,
or been preſent with them, were fin'd more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely;
In the mean time, much by covetous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
ignorant Souldiers, and void of humanity,
profane Citizens, the dregs of the World, who
cloak'd it from the honeſt ſort, upon a faint ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion,
were ſnatched from the <hi>Quakers.</hi> Theſe
Informers treated 'em moſt uncivilly, and baſely;
Sometimes they that were not preſent were fined,
who, in a ſuppoſition, they were never away,
were thought not to be abſent now, but only to
have hid themſelves; and tho their Meeting had
been ſilent, without uttering a Syllable, it was
held for certain, that their holy duties could not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50388:139"/>
be perform'd without ſpeaking, and ſo the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
muſt needs have been preſent; The <hi>Quakers</hi>
tell, in one of their families, a friend, and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
being only preſent, Informers came to the
Maſter, in preſence of the ſtranger, as deſirous to
talk with him of a certain affair, and on his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
little, went away and inform'd, For hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preach'd in an aſſembly of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo, a
ſevere Mulct was laid on the ſtranger and ſpeaker:
They ſay, many of 'em in the Country of <hi>Nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-ſhire,</hi>
was trepan'd by tricks of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I was told by 'em, certain Rogues came
among 'em compos'dly, and where the <hi>Quakers</hi>
were ſilent, one of the fellows got up, and began
to ſpeak, and then alſo the reſt, and falling on
the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and goods of the houſe, Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
carried all the latter away with them. In
this perſecution, the deſtruction of their Eſtates
might be eaſily effected, ſince none of the <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
redeem'd what was taken from them, nor,
were they never ſo wrong'd, or hurted, wou'd
bribe or oppoſe their preſecutors violence; which
might eaſily have been done, had their principles
ſuffer'd, when the unmannerly crowd, Claiming
ſome thing due to each of them, inſtead of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
took away what they cou'd find, Oxen, and
Cattel from their Lands, and Inſtruments for
Husbandry, from their Houſes, Merchandiſe,
Houſholdſtuff, Featherbeds, Blankets, Veſſels, and
Rayment, yea, their very meat they ſpared not,
of what value ſoever: Some carried home wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
Loaded with their goods, leaving nothing
that was either portable, or movable; Theſe
goods were often put to publick ſale, but ſome
were ſo honeſt, that they loved not to buy what
had been loſt with grief, and cou'd only be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
with ſhame; ſome of their goods were
taken ſecretly away by Night, while they're thus
ravag'd, the Tythers were not aſleep, but ready
on foot; Thus, there's a threefold ſumm exacted,
one for the Exchequer, another for the Poor,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50388:140"/>
and a third for their purſe, who pretended to
have the charge of Executing the Law againſt
the <hi>Quakers.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> Writings ſay they
were Barbarouſly us'd, eſpecially in the <hi>Northern</hi>
part of <hi>York-ſhire. Bark-ſhire, Clochester, Surrey,</hi>
and <hi>Notingham-ſhire.</hi> 'Tis incredible what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
theſe people did loſe, only for the ſham
Name of a Mulct; In this perſecution, they rag'd
moſt againſt the greateſt, and their friends, of
a higher Note, and Degree; Theſe Men being
thruſt out of their houſes where they met, ſtood
often in the open Air before them, ſometimes ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing, and ſometimes ſpeaking; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
either all, or they whoſe voice was heard,
were puniſh'd with a greater Mulit, or impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
ſometimes they were treated as Enemies
by the Law of War, even when they never reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And having all already, in their hand and
power, they pretended to deal with them by the
right of victory.</p>
                     <p>This being often practis'd, I ſhall only name
an Example of each ſort: It happen'd in <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi>
in a certain Village, that <hi>Thomas Green,</hi>
whom in the former Book I mention'd among
the Leaders of the Quakers, having met with a
few of his own Perſuaſion, in a certain place, for
performing their worſhip; Informers hearing,
runs preſently thither, and with a bitter, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
mind, falls upon <hi>Green,</hi> kneeling with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
at Prayer, and carry'd him to the Judges,
who laid the uſual Fine on him: Which while he
(as they us'd) refus'd to pay, alledging. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
he was unjuſtly fined, they ordered theſe
Mercenary Meſſengers to diſtrein for't, upon
<hi>Green</hi>'s goods, which he had at <hi>Royston;</hi> This
they go about without lingring, catching at an
occaſion they cou'd wreſt to their gain: Thus
they carry'd away his Goods and Merchandiſe,
expoſing 'em to ſale, and out of the Money,
reſerv'd more than the double of the fine to
themſelves. At another time <hi>Green,</hi> going to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50388:140"/>
Preach in his own houſe, was ſuddenly ſet upon,
and ſo deſpoil'd, by the Invaders, of the goods
of his ſhop, (for he was a threadſeller) that
nothing was left but one <hi>Clue,</hi> which not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
but accidentally drop't from 'em. At
another time alſo, while <hi>Green</hi> Preach'd in his
Houſe, ſome Informers came upon 'em, Arm'd
as for a fight, and after ſilence, they demand
the Preacher; The others deny'd to produce
him; they laid hands on many of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and preſenting them with Swords, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols,
they threaten to kill them, if they would
not preſently give up the Preacher, but their
threats were fruitleſs: But at laſt, coming to
<hi>Green,</hi> who appear'd by ſome ſigns to be the
Preacher, he was alſo dumb to their Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and deaf to their Threats; giving no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the former, and being unmov'd by the
latter, they having greateſt ſuſpicion of him,
did not kill him, but carry'd him to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate;
to whom <hi>Green</hi> when ask'd if he was
the Preacher, anſwer'd he was: He ask'd him
further, why he told not that before to thoſe
that brought him; He anſwer'd, he would not
to any ſuch Men, who had no Authority to
propound the Queſtion, tho he now did it
willingly before the Magiſtrate, who might not
only Juſtly and Lawfully ask, but alſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
The following example ſeems to be
Memorable, for the various Circumſtances of
perſons and place: There met not a few <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
in a houſe at <hi>London,</hi> about Noon, the
Room being ſcarce able to hold 'em, which
being told the Magiſtrate, Soldiers were ſent to
ſcatter the Meeting and Thruſt 'em out of the
houſe. But they in like manner throng'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the next ſtreet, Notwithſtanding the
noiſe and hiſſings of paſſers by; There were
there <hi>W. Penn,</hi> a Noble and Noted Man, whom
I've before deſcrib'd <hi>W. Mead,</hi> Son in Law to
<hi>Fell,</hi> and <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was firſt Married to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50388:141"/>
                        <hi>Fell,</hi> and then to <hi>Fox,</hi> a Man not much then
notic'd, tho a Conſiderable Merchant: Thoſe
the Souldiers ſingl'd out of the Company, ſeiz'd,
and ſhut up, that they might want their houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and liberty, on pretence, they had both
Preach'd to the Congregation in the ſtreet.
They're brought to Examination, and the crime
is charg'd on 'em in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> That
they being <hi>Quakers,</hi> had in contempt of the
King, aſſembled themſelves together with force
and arms, illegally, and ſeditiouſly, to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the peace; The Judges, as 'tis certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
according to the Laws of their Court,
were deſirous they ſhould make their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
uncover'd, that they might give a greater
proof of their Submiſſion and Humility; when
one of their officers had pull'd of theſe Mens
hats, the Judge Commanded them again to be
put on, that they might with their own hands
take 'em of; They refuſed, ſince the Judge
had ordered them to be covered, when as they
came in before, them uncovered. This the
Judges reſenting ill, fining each of 'em, for
Contempt of the King and his Court, in 40
Marks <hi>Eng. Penn,</hi> and <hi>Mead,</hi> did long diſpute
the matter, till Witneſſes were brought in,
who being queſtion'd, affirm'd nothing elſe,
than that they had heard them ſpeak certain
words in publick to the Congregation, but
what the words were, they ſaid, they could not
hear, which evidence both <hi>Penn,</hi> and <hi>Mead,</hi>
with a ready wit, and and quick Expreſſion, as
far as was needful, did ſharply, and fluently
confute. After the Judge, and Council, had
charg'd 'em I omit their Names for no Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to them) with having tranſgreſs'd the
Common Laws, <hi>Penn</hi> ſo defended himſelf, and
his party, that the Judge thinking, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy
of his words, their Authority and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
would be too much ſhaken, and Impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed,
that the Judges might be tax'd with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50388:141"/>
and Ignorance, orders him to be remov'd
out of the Court: <hi>Mead</hi> was alſo thus treated,
for vindicating his Action with too great a ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of boldneſs, and obſtinacy; after many
debates, the Jury comes in, who being ſworn,
did narrowly expend, and enquire into, all they
cou'd find objected againſt 'em; they bring in
this verdict, that <hi>Penn</hi> had ſpoken to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
in publick, that <hi>Mead</hi> was not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
without adding a word further. This Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
highly offended the Judge, and Council,
who were firmly of opinion, that they were
guilty, of what they were charg'd with, and
therefore they rag'd and invey'd againſt the
Jury, and eſpecially, <hi>Edward Buſhel,</hi> whoſe ſole
efficiency they Judg'd pernicious, in ſeducing
his Collegues, threatning him with what envy
and certain prejudice ſo raſh a Verdict might
draw upon himſelf; they remain'd ſtedfaſt in
their firſt opinion, that <hi>Penn</hi> had done nothing
'gainſt Law, and <hi>Mead</hi> was not at all guilty;
And this ſaid they is neither ſo dark, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
but any may eaſily perceive it that's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous;
as for themſelves, ſince they had done
nothing for hatred, or fear, nor any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their Duty, or Judgment, as they
were Conſcious of no fault, ſo they fear'd no
threatnings; after the Jury had finiſhed their
diſcourſe, <hi>Penn</hi> added ſome words with more
Sharpneſs, and Freedom, Implying that the Judges
reguarded not Law, but Judg'd of the matter
according to their partial pleaſure; for which
words, the Judges, that were there, were ſo
offended, that they preſently gave ſtrict charge
to the Jayl-keeper to take him in Cuſtody,
and keep him in Irons: The Court proving thus
confus'd, and Litigious, It was at length thought
fit to adjourn the Tryal for that day, and
conſequently, to enlarge the defendents till the
following; The Jury being then again Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated,
if theſe Men were guilty of what they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50388:142"/>
ſtood Indicted for, ſtill perſiſted in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
reply, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were not; after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
words, more hot than fruitful, the Judge
commanded that <hi>Penn</hi> and <hi>Mead</hi> ſhould be
detain'd in Cuſtody, till they paid that ſumm
that was laid on each of them, for their Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent
Carriage, at the beginning of the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
Making this the due deſert of their fault;
both of 'em having reproach'd, and diſreſpected
the Court: Here <hi>Penn</hi> cou'd not ſo Command
himſelf, as to hold his peace, at ſo unjuſt a
procedure. When neither would pay the Mony
that was requir'd, they were both order'd to be
thrown into Goal, but the cauſe was remov'd
from the Bench to the Bar, where each of 'em
in perſon, before a Multitude of Citizens, and
theſe of the beſt quality, and ſort, who were
led thither by the curioſity of ſeeing the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
defended, and pleaded his cauſe for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
The Harangue of <hi>Penn</hi> is not unworthy
to be obſerv'd, which was now, and then, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
Interrupted, and Intermitted; But in a
due progreſs, conſtant, and undivided: It was
to this purpoſe. <q>The nature of Man is ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that as there is no Mortals almoſt to be
found, who think not the injuries they receive
to be great; ſo, every one, for the moſt part, is
ready and deſirous to defend his cauſe, and avoid
the danger that threatens him; whether this be
our caſe before you at preſent, or whether our
Complaints be ſhort of our ſufferings, dangers
that hang over us, and Crimes that we're charg'd
with, you your ſelves may maturely conſider,
providing you'll diſarm your ſelves of paſſion,
and partiality, and grant us the juſtice of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Attention: This is the burden of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation,
and on this ſcore is our guilt founded;
we omitted ſome Ceremonies before the Court,
and did not preſently conſent to that, which
we knew, they deſign'd to build our guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
we ſpoke too boldly and freely for our
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50388:142"/>
ſelves, as if we had accus'd our Accuſers and
Judges; we muſt therefore, before this great,
and gown'd Society, dwell upon mere punctili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o's,
and triffles; and yet, whilſt our words and
behaviour are ſnarl'd at, we are not guilty of
the things for which we ſtand Indicted; Is
there any Law which commads the defendent,
not only to be diſcovered, but to diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and when our hats are put on, neither by
us, nor at our pleaſure, but your own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
how unjuſt and ridiculous is it, that a
fine ſhould be laid on us, and not rather on your
ſelves? But we anſwer'd not fully to all their
queſtions, a crime exceeding all poſſible excuſe,
that can be brought to palliate our viloated du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
being ask'd many things, we anſwer'd ſome,
tho not all, ſometimes reſtraining our ſelves not
contrary to Law; you know what each of theſe
amounts to: Certainly he that ſpeaks nothing
does not affirm, neither indeed does he therefore
deny, It's then expedient for the defendent to
ſpeak, when his own ſilence would wrong his
cauſe, but he that defends himſelf, when not ſo
much as ask'd, gives occaſion of ſuſpicion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
and calumny: Truly no Man is oblig'd
to accuſe himſelf; If any raſh, or precipitant
word drop'd out, this is nothing but a humane
weakneſs that few are ſtrangers to; it being
hard, in this, as in other matters to keep a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
when the mind is mov'd with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
anguiſh; But I ſuppoſe we are known to
be none of thoſe, who are offenſive to others,
by the Intemperance of our Tongues; neither
are we as yet conſcious of our pretended guilt.
that we have hitherto defended our ſelves with
any Impertinency; but this, this, is our crime to day,
why both here and every where, we are drag'd into
Judgment becauſe we ſeldom deprecate our charge,
or Court favour, by throwing our ſelves at your
feet, or uſing guilded expreſſions, to enſnare your
Ears, if not our own minds alſo; which would if not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50388:143"/>
at preſent, yet certainly hereafter prove detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to us, and our common cauſe: If it
be an accuſing and reproving of others, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the falſehood of their unjuſt Accuſation,
and Modeſtly, and Ingenuouſly ſhow what
they do amiſs, let us bear that Name, which
only the ſence and glory of well doing gives
us tittle to: But this is, or at leaſt ſhould be,
the ſole and proper queſtion, what is this
crime which we have done, that you eſteem
ſo hainous: Since no Law forbids it, no Man
can doubt the Lawfulneſs of our doing it,
and injuſtice of your reprehending it; For
where there is no Law, there is no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.
As to the council's Allegation of a
Common, and general Law, as the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſtrength of the whole Accuſation;
when a general ſaying is generally to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
things common cannot oblige with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſpecial ſtatute; ſo long as he applies
not his rule to the matter in hand, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſubject of our diſcourſe is hinged, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his citation is to little purpoſe, and his talk
is fruitleſs; for the wiſe and ancient Kings
that made thoſe Laws, and the skillful and
ingenious Lawyers of our Countrey who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
them, did ever take 'em in no other
meaning than applicable to certain perſons,
things, times, and Circumſtances; wherefore
thus to wreſt Controverſy to Law, is to disjoyn
it from it ſelf. Moreover, no Law can be juſt
which forbids what the divine Law Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and reaſon Dictates; or Commands
what God and nature forbids and denies, even
where the reverence and worſhip of God is
concerned. Is this their Juſtice, and Equity,
with whom we have to do; to bid ſhut our
mouths, or carry us to puniſhment, when we
ſpeak againſt injuſtice in our own defence? Since
by the common Law its provided, that he that
may do that which is more, ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50388:143"/>
liberty to do that which is leſs; what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
us, when Religion the greateſt good is at
the ſtake, to which other things tho never ſo
valuable have no proportion, to be allow'd the
common privilege of gain-ſaying? Then we
muſt be rob'd of our whole liberty, our Wives
and Children dragg'd into ſlavery, our Families
ſcatter'd, our Eſtates ſeiz'd, and carry'd away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
triumph for our own Conſcience ſake, by the
accuſation of every beggar, and Malitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former
craftily waiting for our Ruine and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
Let the Lord of Sea and Land Judge
betwixt us in this matter. The Judgement of
twelve Men was always much regarded, by the
<hi>Patricij</hi> of old, the Nobles, and <hi>Optimates,</hi> who
being ſworn Aſſeſſors, after hearing the cauſe,
and evidence, brought in their ſentence accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the equity of the matter: That book has
alſo hitherto been highly honour'd, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Rights of King, Parliament, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which is call'd <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> What reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
Judges pay unto theſe, who Arrogate the
intire power, and ſole deciſion of the Tryal to
themſelves, and that with ſo much paſſion, and
prejudice, as they are ſo unhappy, neither to be
able to govern, or conceal it; let the Judges
themſelves declare Impartially. It appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is become a noſe of wax,
ſince it's ſo often hammer'd out into every form.
If things run in this Channel, the times will
come ſoon when we may bid farewel to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to all Society, yea right and property too;
if all Tryals and Judges be like this, in whoſe
mind ſo much of the Popiſh inquiſition is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grain'd.
As for us, ſince we were not accus'd,
we could not be condemn'd, yea, ſince we're ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
by the Jury, we deſire our liberty. As
for you the moſt juſt and great God will Judge
the Juſtice of all your proceedings. </q>When <hi>Penn</hi>
and <hi>Mead</hi> perſiſted in their purpoſe not to pay
that Money which they were amers'd in, being
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50388:144"/>
thrown into Jail, <hi>Penn's</hi> father pay'd it for them
both, and deliver'd 'em from their Impriſonment;
a ſevere and warlick exploit follow'd done upon
the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey:</hi> In certain
places, Captains with their Souldiers, only by
their own Power and Authority broke in upon
<hi>Quakers</hi> houſes without any occaſion, Colouring
the Injuſtice of their Action, with a pretence that
they ſearched for hidden, and conceal'd Arms,
and other Inſtruments of Sedition and Rebellion;
thus they perceiv'd what they had in their houſes,
and afterward came upon them at their pleaſure
and ſpoiled them. This uſe and cuſtom did ſo
overflow and prevail, that Military Men of that
ſort, and ſize, both foot, and horſe without any
Command, aſſaulted thoſe people, while at their
Religious exerciſes, and Proclaim'd and made
War without any Enemy, with ſo much vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
fierceneſs, Clamour and Execution, as if
they would fright heav'n it ſelf with the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of their words; and thruſting 'em out of
the houſes where they were met, if they ſtood nigh
by, or ſpoke but a word, (which you may ſuppoſe
they often, if not always did) they dragg'd ſome
of 'em immediately into fetters, and ſmote others
moſt cruelly with their Military Weapons, this
was a common cuſtom in <hi>Harſly-down.</hi> The houſe
being full of <hi>Quakers</hi> at their worſhip many Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and Horſemen with Swords, Pikes, and Fire-Arms
fly's thither; the Footmen goes in, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
running upon them, thruſts them all out
of doors; being put out into the ſtreet, the
Horſemen rides them down; ſeeing their only
hope of ſafety to be plac'd in the ſwiftneſs of
their feet, by flight they betook themſelves to that
remedy, and endeavour'd to eſcape whither ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they could: But then the Horſemen ſpur'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them with their Horſes, and running upon
the Men and Women as they were ſcatter'd, and
alſo upon thoſe that abode in their place, inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the young and feeble, they ſtruck them
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50388:144"/>
upon their bodies and faces, with their Piſtols, as
furiouſly as they could: The footmen pouring
themſelves out of the houſe upon the people thus
enſnar'd and invergl'd, follow'd after, and beat them
with their Muſquets and Pikes ſo violently, that
ſome of them flew in peices out of their hands:
Neither did they forbear, retreat or withdraw, till
more than twenty of the poor <hi>Quakers</hi> were
wounded, Eight days after the <hi>Quakers</hi> again met,
and muſt likewiſe by a new force of Horſe and
Foot be aſſaulted, ejected, and put to flight, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded,
and oppreſs'd, and the ground fructify'd
by the effuſion of their blood; here there were
twice as many wounded as before: That day ſeven-night
the <hi>Quakers</hi> not leaving of their aſſembling,
a party of foot and horſe came up to the houſe:
One of them going in with a pale full of dirt
and Excrements, maliciouſly emptied it upon the
Innocent Multitude, not content with this, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them from their Houſe and Meeting, they
follow'd and loaded them with ſo many wounds,
that they were within a little of having rob'd 'em
of their life. Some of the Countrey people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mov'd with Compaſſion at the ſad Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
Lamentation, and tears of Men, they had
always found both harmleſs, and blameleſs, did
ſuccour and ſhelter them, with the ſanctuary of
their houſes. But thoſe Malignant rakes, finding
the way even thither, broke in, and pull'd 'em
out, and threatning ſome, holding their Weapons
o're their heads, and cutting the womens Cloaths,
handled them with a deteſtable Impudence, and
obſcenity. There was one woman with Child
taken as ſhe fled, whom a Souldier rudely ſmote
twice on the belly and once on the breaſt with his
Muſquet, and another threw dirt in her mouth,
whereby ſhe was ſo frighted, that afterwards ſhe
miſcary'd. But the Zeal of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Souldiers in perſecuting, was not as yet
chill'd. For they no ſooner return'd to their uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Meeting than the Souldiers follow'd them as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50388:145"/>
they had done formerly, afflicting them with their
wonted Rudeneſs; ſo that the very Earth was
re-ſprinkled with their Blood, and Twenty, or
more of them, were inhumanely wounded; which
a certain Countrey Officer ſeeing, and being
troubled at (a Man very diſcreet for his office) or
at leaſt not always ſo rough and rigid, advis'd the
Souldiers not to perſiſt in ſuch wild rigour, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
rudeneſs, hoping he might eaſily obtain
what he deſired. The Souldiers were ſo far from
regarding his requeſt, they fell upon him ſo forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
that they almoſt broke his pate. There were
more examples of cruelty done at this time, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places elſewhere; yet the <hi>Quakers</hi> never aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
at night, nor in a Solitary place, leſt they
ſhould ſeem to attempt any thing unworthy of
Light, and whereof they ſhould be affraid; yet
they met ſometimes more cautiouſly, and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
and with as little ſtir as they poſſibly could,
not becauſe they were diſreſpected, Vilified, and
Calamitouſly treated, but ſometimes by reaſon of
the greatneſs of the danger, they forbore the
times and places of their Aſſembling. Sometimes
they were deny'd the uſe of their own houſes,
where they us'd to conveen frequently and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
the Magiſtrate commanding the Doors
and Entrances to be clos'd up with brick, and
morter to prevent their admiſſion: But they
thinking themſelves Maſters of their own houſes,
open'd 'em without Command or Counſel of any
other, and went into their Meetings, as they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had done.</p>
                     <p>The Qnakers obſerved this Year, that there was
above Eight Thouſand of their Sect made Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
ſince the King's Return, whereof Six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
were as yet detain'd.</p>
                     <p>Things being in this condition, about the Year
<hi>Seventy Two</hi> a Remarkable War happen'd betwixt
the Confederate Kings of <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and
the States of the United Provinces: in which War
the <hi>Dutch</hi> had the better (as 'twas thought) both by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50388:145"/>
Sea, and Land; not only by withſtanding ſo great
Armies of two ſuch potent Kings, and two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
(more intent on the deſtruction than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of Men) but alſo ſnatch'd a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
victory from 'em both. King <hi>Charles</hi> fearing
leſt the War abroad might create ſome matter of
ſedition at home, that he might preſerve eaſe and
concord amongſt his ſubjects, granted not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
to Men of all Religions, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the <hi>Quakers</hi> (Papiſts being only excepted)
but alſo the free exerciſe of their ſeveral perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereby the <hi>Quakers</hi> from a tempeſtuous
ſtorm, were brought into a ſafe Haven: The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the paſt, pleaſure of the preſent,
and hope of the future time induc'd them to
compoſe, reſtore, and accompliſh the common
concern of their neglected affairs: But this reſt
and tranquillity was of no greater Continuance,
than till matters were adjuſted twixt the <hi>Dutch</hi>
and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for, in two year's ſpace the war being
ended, the Jars twixt ancient friends and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
eaſily kindled and quickly quenched, did
not only ſerve to waſh away the ſtrife but renew
and confirm their former love. So the <hi>Quakers</hi>
were toſs'd with new dangers again, as when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtorm ſuddenly falls upon thoſe, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor'd
in the ſafety of an happy Haven and drives
'em from the hopes, of the expected ſhore into
the great and dangerous roarings of the deep.
Having hitherto related concerning theſe Men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all things I thought worthy to be read or
repeated, ſince nothing follows much differing
from what we've heard, I ſhall run through what
remains, as orderly as briefly. <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> having
now travers'd <hi>England</hi> more than one; and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he had ſpent ſtudy and Labour enough in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to declare and advance his Religion,
not contenting himſelf to work only at home,
began to think upon going further abroad, there
to commence and carry on the ſame deſign: In
the year 71 paſſing over the wide Sea, he went to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50388:146"/>
                        <hi>New-England</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> to viſit friends of the
ſame Doctrine and Diſcipline; encouraging and
confirming 'em to retain and preſerve the faith
they had receiv'd piouſly and invioſably; Then
he went in to the <hi>Barmuda</hi>'s <hi>Iſlands,</hi> from thence
to <hi>Jamaica, Merry-Land, Virginia, Nova-Ceſarea,
Inſula-Longa,</hi> and to the ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>moſt <hi>Rhodes,</hi> from
which laſt <hi>Iſland</hi> in the year 72, 4th month, and
19th day, he wrote a journal in form of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
and ſent it here to his friends in <hi>England,</hi>
whereof I have a Copy: But I and nothing elſe
written there but the Climates, Seaſons, Tracts,
Borders, and Regions upon which they went out,
where they found, or form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d Societies of their
perſuaſion, whom they met every where, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> how cheerfully and
kindly they diſcours'd and entertain'd him. In
<hi>Virginia</hi> he ſpeaks of one or two of the Rulers of
that Wild and Barbarous people, who came to a
certain aſſembly of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and tho much
unacquainted with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves to the <hi>Quakers</hi> with reſpect and
civility; whilſt <hi>Fox</hi> with his friends went further
into the Countrey, and there had the fortune to
light upon others of 'em, they entertain'd him
and his friends Diſcreetly and Courteouſly. This
Journey of two years ſpace being ended, a few
months after, <hi>Fox</hi> in <hi>Vigornia</hi> by Judge <hi>Parker's</hi>
command, for their frequent Meetings was put
in Cuſtody in the Country-Jail: There he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
for a year and more, being ſometimes
brought to a judicial appearance: When no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be made out, he was remanded into
Jayl, or ſo delay'd to a certain ſeaſon upon his
promiſe of another appearance, wherein <hi>Fox</hi> did
always ſatisfy the Judges obſerving his promiſe
with a Religious tenderneſs: The ſtrife and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
was levell'd at this, to make <hi>Fox</hi> take
the Oath of fidelity to the Government, <hi>Fox</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
to make Corporal Oath or ſwear in expreſs
words, not that he refus'd to undertake or affirm
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50388:146"/>
the thing; for he was ready to give a written bill
to the Judges, tying himſelf to the performance of
all that was requir'd; thinking they could expect
or demand no more from him, he defended his
cauſe at all occaſions with many ſounding and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
Arguments, and ſuch as are thought to
be deriv'd from the ſacred fountain of the word
of God; but to no purpoſe for the Judges regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the Allegations brought by that ſort of
Men, as nothing but baſe and contemptible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.
How <hi>Fox</hi> ſpent his time whilſt kept here
in priſon, the many books written by him do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare;
eſpecially that containing the Confeſſion of
the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, enrich'd and Interwoven
with Scriptural places, cull'd out of the New
Teſtament by a ſingular order; he had alſo Divers
Conferences with Learned Men, while he enjoy'd
the leiſure the priſon afforded him; in which he
often ſhow'd the diſparity of the encounter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Learned in the Dialectick Art; and
thoſe that are wholly Rude and Artleſs, whereof
I have this Example. He had a Diſputation with
Dr. <hi>Crowder,</hi> prebendary of <hi>Worceſter</hi> concerning
an Oath, as it was lawful or forbidden under
Goſpel or Law; In which debate when <hi>Crowder</hi>
concluded, that as an Oath was of old Lawful
under the Law, ſo now it was not unlawful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Goſpel; In like manner as Adultery and
other vices forbidden by the Law, are alſo prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
under the Goſpel. <hi>Fox</hi> being offended by
ſo Ignorant a Conſequence, began to be in a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but before he had liberty to reply to what
was ſaid, all that were preſent conteſted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
and rais'd this groundleſs report aginſt
him, that he affirm'd and taught as Orthodox,
that Swearing, Adultery, Drunkenneſs, and other
vices of that nature were Lawful, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fruitleſs reſiſtance of <hi>Crowder;</hi> and that
he had broke out in obſcene curſing and lying,
who only defended a Nod might be a certain
pledge of fidelity, and one word fill the place of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50388:147"/>
an Oath, another Clergy-Man diſputing with <hi>Fox</hi>
concerning the perfection of Saints in this Life,
forming an induction from the word of God,
wherein he thought great force of Argument to
be couch'd, came to <hi>Fox</hi> and ask'd him what he
thought of himſelf, preſſing him more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
to anſwer ingenuouſly. <hi>Fox</hi> ſcarce know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng
what ſuch a queſtion was deſign'd for, at
length made no other return than this, <hi>By the grace
of God I am what I am.</hi> Thereby neither expreſly
affirming nor denying, and yet obſcurely hinting
what he thought; at length <hi>Fox,</hi> after many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments,
by the coming of the Governour,
<hi>Aleſius</hi> was diſmiſt; after ſo long abſence, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Houſe and Wife, he liv'd there with
her for ſome time ſo quietly, that there was not a
Syllable ſpoken of <hi>Fox;</hi> in the mean time he
wrote and ſent many Letters, Suaſory, Hortatory,
and of other ſorts, concerning ſuch things as he
thought his labour and pains might not be loſt on,
but be uſeful and advantagious. He wrote alſo
to the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yea,
and to the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf; as alſo to the rulers of
the leſſer <hi>Africa,</hi> and even to the <hi>Emperour of the
Turks,</hi> accoſting him with this very Inſcription
and Title of <hi>the great Turk,</hi> a name horrid and
unſavoury enough, eſpecially, in that Nation and
Language. <hi>Fox</hi> wrote, and caus'd all thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be Printed in his Mother-Tongue (the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Language), but they were not Tranſlated,
and ſent as they were Inſcrib'd; So that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prov'd tokens of a laborious, Confident and
Arrogant mind, than in any meaſure profitable and
advantagious. At <hi>London</hi> in the year 74 on the
9th and 16th days of <hi>October,</hi> there was a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
held in a Meeting houſe of the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi>
'twixt the <hi>Quakers</hi> and them, concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Chriſt; the ſpeakers on the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſide,
were <hi>G. Withad,</hi> and <hi>S. Criſp, G. Keith,</hi> and <hi>W. Penn;</hi>
for the <hi>Baptists, T. Hicky, Jer. Joes, W. Kiffin, T.
Planty,</hi> all preachers in their own perſwaſion, the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50388:147"/>
cauſe of the debate was a book publiſh'd by <hi>Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky,</hi>
in which he branded the <hi>Quakers</hi> with the
reproach of being diſintituled to the Character of
Chriſtians; teaching <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be no perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us, but that the Internal light of every Man's
mind is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> deſired them to prove
their challenge, by ſhowing which of them had
ever taught ſuch Doctrine, or elſe, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacher
might be puniſhed by his fellowſhip ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the due deſert of his delinquency. The
firſt day they handled the <hi>Quakers</hi> opinion, the
<hi>Baptists</hi> alledging ſuch words to have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the <hi>Quakers</hi> in a certain book, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
was never ſeen with bodily eyes by any Man: By
which words the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> did not yet make out
the weight of their charge againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
(for they explained the words thus, that tho it be
certain as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Man, he was Externally ſeen
by Men, but as he is <hi>God,</hi> that he is Inviſible doth
ſufficiently comport with the Analogy of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
That when we ſpeak of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> being
known, loved, or worſhiped, 'tis evident we mean
not of Corporeal viſion, but mental Intuition:)
At the next Meeting the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> took another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to prove the <hi>Quakers</hi> to be no Chriſtians,
becauſe they taught Divine Revelation to be the
Immediate Rule of Faith and Life, which Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
when the <hi>Quakers</hi> had ſhown to be weak and
childiſh, the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> having few more <hi>Topicks</hi> to
lean upon, turn'd aſide to what concern'd not the
Controverſy: But being unable by Windings and
Circumlocutions to defend themſelves, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ill to be worſted and confuted began to
place their victory in Reproach and Loquacity,
filling all with Tumult and Noiſe. The <hi>Quakers</hi>
who all this time ſat ſtill with an equality of
fixedneſs, ſedateneſs, and conſtancy, receiv'd their
aſſaults as the ſwelling floods are broken and beat
of by the Rocks. Thus they parted, ſo far from
adjuſting the matter, that they were more exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated
by the Conference they had enjoy'd. The
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50388:148"/>
next year <hi>Rob. Barclay</hi> wrote his Theological <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
and ſent them to the Doctors, Profeſſors, and
Students of Theology, Popiſh and Proteſtant, in
every Countrey of <hi>Europe,</hi> deſiring 'em to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
and return them an Anſwer: The next year
he wrote and publiſh'd his Apology, a work
greater, and better known than that I need give
account of it: He ſent two Copies of this book
to every Princes Ambaſſadour at <hi>Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iguen,</hi> that
met to treat of the Common peace, that they
might weigh, and ſend it to their Prince for their
Cognizance, and Inquiry into the matter: To each
he added a double Letter of advice, that as the
burden of the Chriſtian world was laid upon
them, ſo they might with all care and diligence
endeavour, according to their Incumbent duty,
to procure the reſt and ſafety of Chriſtians. <hi>Nic.
Arnold,</hi> profeſſor of the Theology in the College
of <hi>Frizeland,</hi> oppos'd a Theological Exercitation
to theſe <hi>Theſes,</hi> wherein he baſſles <hi>Barclay's</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
To this treatiſe <hi>Barclay</hi> anſwer'd by another
piece, ſhewing, that <hi>Arnold</hi> did only repeat what
has been often ſaid, by a changed expreſſion. A
little after <hi>Tho. Brown</hi> a <hi>Scot Barclay's</hi> Country-Man,
one of the Preachers of the word of God,
who to the Number of 2000 were depriv'd of
their Benefices, for not ſubmitting to the Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Prelates, wrote a thick and large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> againſt the great treatiſe of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,</hi>
in which <hi>Barclay</hi> taking him to miſtake
their meaning, and therefore too much to expati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and wander from the purpoſe, anſwers him
in the ſame Language, putting neither more nor
leſs in his book than what he thought neceſſary.
Afterward, <hi>Joh. G. Bajerus,</hi> Doctor and Profeſſor
of Theology at <hi>Jena,</hi> (a <hi>Lutheran</hi>) publiſh'd the
Doctrine concerning the beginning of the true
and ſaving knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> againſt <hi>Barclay</hi>'s
diſſertation in his <hi>Theſes</hi> and <hi>Apology,</hi> who carp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at ſome Expreſſions of <hi>Barclay,</hi> as not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but abſurd and obſcure, from which no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50388:148"/>
could gather what <hi>Barclay</hi> did mean, was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
by <hi>G. Keith, (Barclay</hi> being then taken up
with other affairs) a Man moſt skillful in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
and Argument, who againſt <hi>Bajer</hi> did
plainly unfold the ſence and meaning of his
friend's words, and in this reply ſo handled the
whole Argument, that afterward <hi>Bajer</hi> made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any return. Laſtly, <hi>Joh. Chr. Holthuſius,</hi> a
paſtor addicted to the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confeſſion, wrote
a large treatiſe in the <hi>German Tongue,</hi> worthy to
be ſtil'd the <hi>Antibarclaian German,</hi> ſince the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
has not hitherto anſwer'd it. In this year
75, at <hi>Rome, Mich. Molin,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> a Prieſt,
and Doctor of Theology, publiſh'd his book in
the <hi>Italian Tongue,</hi> to which he gave the Title of
<hi>the Spiritual Captain:</hi> In which book he reviv'd
the Myſtick, Theology, as they call it, which for
many years had lain Dormant in the Papacy, who
was Tutor and Pedagogue to a Number of Men,
for advancing that Doctrine of ſtudy and life:
The <hi>Sect</hi> was call'd <hi>Quietiſm,</hi> and the followers,
<hi>Quietiſts;</hi> from their ſingular Diſcipline, which
preſcribes the laying aſide External helps of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>God,</hi> meditation and reaſoning by
things outwardly Conſider'd and Compar'd;
(which are the firſt Elements that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to theſe who begin to enter into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life) and making only uſe of Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
and the ſimplicity of faith: Thoſe
who have made or deſire to make great progreſs
in the Celeſtial way, muſt employ themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
with a ready will, and ardent Love, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and perceive <hi>God</hi> in themſelves, and ſuffer
him to work in them by his Spirit, while they
wait for him with a quiet ſilence. I ſhall add no
more of this Man's Doctrine or its ſucceſs, as being
known to the Learned <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> of our Age:
As ever ſince the <hi>Quakers</hi> name had its riſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
among Chriſtians, in Religion, Behaviour,
and Converſation, ſcem'd to be hatch'd or invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with greater care, or more reſin'd, and remov'd
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50388:149"/>
from the cuſtom of the Vulgar, but what was
preſently father'd on the <hi>Quakers</hi> Authority, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,
and patronage: Thus in <hi>Italy</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
many made the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> with
their Creatures, and Confederates, the Sole cauſe
and Original of this Sect, and all the opinions
thereupon following: In like manner in <hi>England,</hi>
the <hi>Quakers</hi> were Reckon'd among the Religious
crew which they call <hi>Myſticks,</hi> and <hi>Branches</hi> of
the <hi>Quietiſts,</hi> drawing their common nature and
temper from the ſame Root with one another.
This rumor and ſuſpicion was the more increas'd,
that the <hi>Quakers</hi> eſpecially <hi>Barclay,</hi> in his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
extraordinarily commended theſe ancient <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s,</hi>
and not long after, that <hi>Keith</hi> in his book,
call'd <hi>the way to the City of God,</hi> which he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> did ſo teach, confirm, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
that Theology, that he ſeem'd to joyn with
and ſtrengthen the hands of the <hi>Quietists.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this opinion before was, and as yet is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd
in the minds of many, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are of
the flock of the <hi>Myſticks,</hi> or that the <hi>Quietiſts</hi> and
they don't much differ, I ſhall pick out eſpecially
from <hi>Keith's</hi> book a ſhort Summary of that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
adding as little of my own as I can; except
where I'm forc'd to put my own words for his,
without Impairing his meaning at all. We ought
(ſays he) to withdraw our ſelves from every vain
thought, earthly, purely intellectual, yea even Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
which are ſubjected to ſuch words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
as fall under the force of Argumenting
and Reaſoning; which draw their being from
another original. When God manifeſts himſelf
in Man, in the Seed of God which is in Man, and
hereby conveys himſelf into the mind of Man,
Man muſt betake and apply himſelf to God, in
the Seed of God 'twixt the influence and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God in him, and only to give himſelf the
leiſure to wait for theſe feelings of the mind that
proceed from God, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſeeing, hearing, ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
touching taſting of the Spirit, of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50388:149"/>
the light, and Life of God in Chriſt in that
Seed. And ſo it is agreeable to Man, when he has
thus converted himſelf unto God, to perſiſt and
continue in that State with much patience, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
and ſilence, before he fall to the uſe and
exerciſe, or daily buſineſs of his Lawful vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
When this happens, In a little time the
mind in ſome meaſure approaches to an holy and
Divine life, the beginnings of Spiritual Death,
Regeneration and Active operation. It's not then
ſit to do any thing, without the certain Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and clear knowledge of faith, but what the
internal Guide, and Spiritual Counſeller and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor
teacheth, without that apparent aſſurance
that the Spirit is ariſen or raiſeth himſelf in us,
and makes us inwardly to feel leave and liberty
to do, what the Spirit commands or ſuffers to be
done. And ſo it's convenient at, firſt, to Act
faith only by receiving and then exerciſing it; as
the <hi>Cion</hi> when firſt graffed into the ſtock firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
juice, then grows and fructifies. In theſe
things that the reſt of the <hi>Quakers</hi> both did and
do agree, its ſcarce to be doubted. Tho it ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears from what has been ſaid, that theſe
<hi>Myſticks, Moliniſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> do not ſo far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in this Doctrine and Study, as that one of 'em
does either fear or deſpiſe, to follow and imitate
the others Example; yet betwixt 'em both there's
a very great difference and jarr as the <hi>Moliniſts</hi>
adhere to the Rectors of Conſcience, ſacred orders,
and very many rites, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> reject all
theſe Rules and Principles; which being neither
abſtruſe, nor hard to be known, I ſhall not now
inlarge on with any further addition. <hi>England</hi>
being now at leiſure from War and Peace with
the <hi>Dutch</hi> again eſtabliſh'd, the long-gather'd
grudge againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the anger, that
ſometime was reſtrain'd and forborn, began to be
now reviv'd and ſtrengthen'd in order to renew
the War againſt 'em. <hi>Fox</hi> as yet thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
moſt concern'd, yea to have the overſight of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50388:150"/>
the <hi>Quakers</hi> affairs, went on preaching with ſuch
boldneſs, confidence, and care of their buſineſs,
that he run himſelf into many dangers. So alſo
did <hi>Keith</hi> and <hi>Penn.</hi> Whether with a deſign to
avoid the danger, or becauſe they ſuppos'd that
they could and ought to deſerve well by their
Counſel, and Authority, at the hands of their
friends that were living elſewhere, it's not known;
In the year 77 they went together into <hi>Holland,</hi>
and part of <hi>Germany,</hi> to viſit ſome few friends
they had in thoſe Countreys; In which Voyage
what was done by them I ſhall endeavour to ſhew
in the following book: In the mean time the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encreaſe of evil ſtarted reproach and oppreſſion
againſt many. There was afterward a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
begun in the County of <hi>Nottingham,</hi>
which being alſo diffus'd into other Provinces,
and at length, in the year 80 through the whole
Land, run through the people with an exceeding
violence. This affair, that year, <hi>Penn</hi> and <hi>Mead</hi>
did accurately deſcribe, and many others whoſe
fellowſhip with thoſe that ſuffer'd Calamities was
ſuch, that what they endur'd they thought done
to themſelves; and therefore they ſent their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to King and Parliament, to inform them of
the Injuries done to their friends, and intreat at
length a remedy and help, againſt thoſe evils of
ſo long Continuance. Tho I could inſert Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
examples of their troubles, that I may
not excur without the bounds of my intended
brevity, I ſhall content my ſelf to repeat two of
'em, mention'd by thoſe whom I have already
nam'd, ſo far I ſuppoſe from being unknown, that
tho they have been kept ſilent, their truth may be
atteſted by the memory of many as yet, for I
write nothing but what I am aſſured of. <hi>W. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig</hi>
of <hi>Banwal,</hi> in <hi>Somerſet-ſhire,</hi> being deſir'd to
give light to ſomewhat by his Oath, knowing
certainly that he would religiouſly refuſe it, upon
his refuſal, was dragg'd into Jayl, and deſpoil'd
of all his goods and movables to the value of 244
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50388:150"/>
                        <hi>lib. ſter.</hi> and alſo Immovables, whoſe yearly value
was ſuppos'd to amount to 60 <hi>lib.</hi> or thereabout,
at laſt, after thirteen years Impriſonment, all his
Eſtate was publickly Confiſcated. <hi>Mich. Renald,</hi>
a wealthy and monyed Man in the County of
<hi>Bark-ſhire,</hi> owed the Tythes of his Land for one
year, to about the ſumm of 10 <hi>lib.</hi> which he, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to pay, was ſummoned by the Creditor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo ſo unwilling to follow ſuch a ſuit, that he
rather would have ſuſtain'd any greater detriment;
the cauſe was ſo ordered in Judgment, and the
tryal given in the plaintiff's favour, that the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
for a fine, out of his Cattel or ſtuff, ſhould
inſtead of ten, take 60 <hi>lib.</hi> wherewith theſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
being cunning, ſevere, and hot for their gain,
were ſcarce contented; they took away to the
value of 97 <hi>lib.</hi> beſides, being their own Officers,
they take as their wages, out of the ſhaves of
Corn about the worth of 12 <hi>lib.</hi> more. About
this time the <hi>Quakers</hi> counted 243 that were
dead, by wounds and ſtrokes received at their
Meetings. While theſe things were done in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> alſo eſpecially the <hi>Northern</hi> part,
much trouble was raiſed againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and
that by reaſon of their publick Preachings; ſome
were greatly ſined, others refuſing to pay them,
had their goods taken from them, and that to the
double of what was laid on: Some were miſerably
kept in Cuſtody, amongſt whom was <hi>Barclay's</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mention'd in the former book, and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Skein,</hi> once famous amongſt the Magiſtrates
of <hi>Aberdeen;</hi> yet amongſt all the Calamities and
Sorrows they ſuffer'd, they had no greater grief,
torment, nor ſorrow, than to ſee and underſtand
their Religion, Behaviour, and Actions, to be ſo
execrably, and malitiouſly defam'd'd, and revil'd:
For ſo they were every where in Libels and Verſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
Baſe, and Reproachful pictures deſcrib'd, and
deſign'd, and that often by the vileſt ſort of Men.
So in familiar Conference, eatings, and drinkings,
there was ſcarce a talkative, prattling, or babling
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50388:151"/>
fellow, that lov'd to talk or act Comically, but he
muſt reduce his diſcourſe and geſture, to traduce
the ſincerity and ſimplicity of the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
There were no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ordid <hi>Vagrants, Quacks, Juglers,</hi>
or <hi>Gamesters,</hi> that had a mind to pleaſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or make themſelves be laught at; but muſt
bring in the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in their Geſticulation, and
Buffoonry. Yea, the Theatres, and ſhows in
Plays and Comedys, which are wholly exploded,
when void of wantonneſs, and not Arm'd with
the follies, and Madneſs of ſuch words, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Theſe muſt aſſign the <hi>Quakers</hi> their Acts,
Speeches and Motions, and ſo, lay open to the
view of the world they profeſs'd themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to know and diſplay the Lives, and Actions
of all ſorts of Men. Yea, in the Courts of Kings
and Princes, their Fools, and Pleaſants, which
they kept to relax them from grief and penſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
could not ſhow themſelves more dexterouſly
ridiculous, than by repreſenting the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or
aping the motions of their mouth, voice, geſture,
and countenance: I heard a pleaſant ſtory from
them: <hi>Helen</hi> which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for ſhortneſs calls
<hi>Nell</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> a moſt noted Dancer at the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
(afterward a miſs of King <hi>Cha.</hi> II.) tho ſhe
could imitate all the Actors by any geſture of her
body, yet ſhe could not by her out-moſt effort
and endeavour, even before the King and Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
(whom ſhe often pleas'd with ſuch ludicrous
Actions) Act the <hi>Quaker</hi> ſo to the life as to draw
out, compreſs, and remit the Spirit, and ſo to ape
their praying and holding forth, without betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
force and affectation, and how unhappy ſhe was
in Imitating thoſe Actions, which ſhe could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have knowledge of by any Conjecture. I was
told the like of one of the Kings fools, by thoſe
that were Eye-Witneſſes of the matter. The
<hi>Quakers</hi> were alſo greatly afflicted in <hi>Leiceſter,</hi>
and <hi>Somerſet-ſhire,</hi> in the year 81 and 82. There
is a Village in <hi>Leicester,</hi> not far diſtant from the
chief City of the whole province, thither many

of the <hi>Quakers</hi> are conveen'd and aſſembled, which
was not pleaſing to ſome Inhabitants, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Miniſters of Churches that liv'd in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Some young Men and Boys watch'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
their Meeting, and at other times Men with
ſilence and conſtancy; when they met, they Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
aſſault them unawares, take 'em, pull
the Men's hats and womens upper coats from 'em,
puſh 'em out of the houſe, throws mud upon 'em
and chaſes 'em abroad: At a certain time the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
joyn'd with the Company of Boys, and
falling on the <hi>Quakers,</hi> crouded together, beating
them with many blows, and dragging 'em out by
the necks, roll'd 'em in the Clay, and then thruſt
'em into Priſon: At another time, ſome young
Men and Boys, (who tho little chitts yet flew on
them with Manly boldneſs) fill'd one of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
mouths ſo with water and clay, that by their
Villany they almoſt bereav'd her of her life.
This theſe youths ſaid they began to do at the
command of a certain Pariſh Miniſter; this laſt
was done in preſence of one of the Miniſters, that
look'd on, and yet did not diſſwade them from
their Rudeneſs. Theſe indeed were done by the
Rabble, which we muſt always diſtinguiſh from
the Counſels, and Statutes, which the Magiſtrates
Lawfully juſtify, and approve of. There was
another and greater perſecution at <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> which,
for the greatneſs of the matter, I muſt digreſs
from my purpos'd brevity to give ſome account
of. This City in the War betwixt King <hi>Cha.</hi> I.
And the Parliament amongſt the firſt ſtood firm
to the Parliament's party, ſo it alſo principally
withſtood the King and his Brother the Duke of
<hi>York's</hi> endeavours and deſigns, adhering faſt to
thoſe Members of Parliament, who urg'd with
great Eagerneſs and Zeal, the deſtruction of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and Excluſion of <hi>York,</hi> as one that was
twiſted with, and wedded to Popery; and becauſe
the Presbyterians and Independents were of that
Number, they incurr'd the great envy and hatred
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50388:152"/>
of the Royal Family, and of thoſe Peers who
thought it their duty and intereſt to adhere to the
King in all his deſigns. In this City it ſelf there
were not wanting of thoſe, who having the power
in their hand, us'd it at their pleaſure, to gratify
the Court, and regard their own and others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and be reveng'd on others whom they knew
to be their Enemies. It was hard to gain any
thing upon the Presbyterians, they therefore
turn'd to the Independents, diſturbing their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
every where: In ſhort, the infeſting aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
afflicting, vexing, and pillaging their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenters,
broke out upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and they
were made the Theatre, and Subject of the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:
The pretence was ancient, but now more
ſtretch'd that the <hi>Quakers</hi> fomented the Civil
War, and aſſembled with Arms, being dragg'd dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from their Meetings, and brought before the
Magiſtrate, refuſing to take the Oath of fidelity
(it being contrary to their Conſcience to ſwear to
any Oath) they were immediately thrown into
Priſons and Gaols, which proving in vain, they
reſolv'd to treat them with greater force and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour:
A band of Men being thus appointed, and
furniſhed, whoſe Captain was always a pretor of
the City, (whom they call Sheriff, not he that is
Mayor) and alſo ſome pettifogging Lawyer, that
as often as the <hi>Quakers</hi> aſſembled together, upon
the leaſt <hi>Cobweb</hi> pretence of Information, they
run all to the houſe, break the door, beat out the
Men, Women, and Children, without reſpect to
Sex, or Age, drawing, driving, and dragging them
into Jayl: The firſt onſet was in the Pariſh of St.
<hi>Jam.</hi> in the middle of <hi>Decem.</hi> becauſe the Maſter
of the houſe had not paid his fine, for his Man's
abſence, when the Train-bands was view'd, becauſe
his fine had not been exacted, they ſeiz'd what was
in his houſe for the Kings uſe: Thus taking, and
ſnatching away what they pleas'd, they deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
burnt and ſcattered the reſt; again they return
after ſix days, and the little that was brought in,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50388:152"/>
in that time. In the like manner they expoſe to be
trampled and trodden on: In this expedition a
certain City-Captain was their leader. The <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
return ſeven days after to the ſame empty
houſe, where there was not ſo much as a ſeat, which
the Sheriff underſtanding, with a Tribe of
young Men and Boys following him, comes to
the <hi>Qnakers</hi> with rage, and fury, and falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them not daring to reſiſt, they ſcattered, and
defeated them without much buſineſs; and ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in upon a widdow's retirement, they ſnatch'd
away, broke and threw out Cheſts, Coffers, Boxes,
Dales, Planks, and Caſements: The <hi>Quakers</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
three days after, were treated, and chaſed
in the like manner by the Ruffians, who then
threw out the little Remnants, and pulling down
the houſe, they equall'd it with the ground. The
<hi>Quakers</hi> having taken another houſe in the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
about the 1ſt of <hi>Jan.</hi> (the beginning of the
new year, as we divide, and deſcribe it) thither
they go, the Sheriff being told, he with his Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and followers, entic'd with the new proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of prey, march'd with a quick pace, and the
ſign being given, every one for himſelf without
any order, flies on the Men, and their goods;
here alſo being none that either could, or would
reſiſt them; they ſatisfied their deſires as they
formerly had done. The <hi>Quakers</hi> once more
three days after made choice of another houſe
elſewhere, thither alſo theſe Men and Boys do
ruſh for further reward, and again aſſault, and
lay hands upon them, but this houſe was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated
to the King. After five days Interval,
the <hi>Quakers</hi> returning to their old houſe in that
Village, were ſet upon by the Sheriff and his
Crew, being ſeiz'd, they were dragg'd before the
Magiſtrate, nothing remaining in the half fallen
and whole ſpoil'd houſe that they could take
away, who, when the Oath of fidelity was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
refuſing to ſwear at all, were thrown pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
into the common Goal, but it being full,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50388:153"/>
the reſt of them were thruſt into <hi>Bridewell,</hi> and
other places, In the mean time it cannot eaſily
be told what great ſumms of Money they laid on
and took from 'em, and that for nothing, but
becauſe they had found 'em at Meetings, tho
ſometimes they were altogether ſilent; and for
thoſe that could not pay by reaſon of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
they forc'd the richer ſort to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
which was often laid at the Merchants
Doors: What violence and baſeneſs was here to
be ſeen will eaſily appear by one Example. There
was one <hi>Rich. Marſh,</hi> a noted Merchant, a certain
Informer comes to his houſe, to demand a fine of
a few <hi>Merks,</hi> having broke up his Warehouſe,
they ſearch'd it for Money, but not finding it,
they ſeiz'd on his books, and bills of debitor and
Creditor, and ſeveral bundles of Papers and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and many other Writings, pretending to
tatch them, and keep 'em to themſelves, beſides,
ravaging the reſt of the houſe, whatever wares or
utenſils they found, they make bold to meddle
with it on the like pretence, deſtroying and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down what ſtuff was in the houſe, and at
laſt having feaſted and glutted themſelves with
Wine, they went off with all the booty they had
met with: It was then the Subject of all Tongues
and Diſcourſes, that thoſe Men that were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in hatraſſing the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and dividing
their goods and money amongſt themſelves, muſt
needs be inrich'd with ſuch an acceſſion of wealth
and money they ſo often lighted on: It happen'd
that <hi>Tho. Earl</hi> the then <hi>Sheriff,</hi> a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and honeſt Man, mindful of his Dignity and
Office, call'd one that was ſuſpected to give an
account concerning the diſpoſal of that money
and goods: When he could not deny what was
really true, yet would not confeſs, he firſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to turn the ſtream of the diſcourſe, but
the other continuing to urge his query, in ſtead of
extricating, he inveigl'd himſelf more, and then,
his anger beginning to boil out, he threatn'd to

none of their Perſons or Poſſeſſions were ſafe; Yet
they forbore not their Ancient Meetings and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies:
Neither did their Enemies leave off to grieve
and afflict them, till they had ſhewed their Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Baſeneſs as far as they could. The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
Serjeants and Flocks of Boys, not only
when the Quakers aſſembled in publick, but alſo
every where, whomſoever they met they ſeiz'd;
ſome of 'em throwing 'em ſo violently on their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that they could not riſe again without great pain,
beating and bruiſing others with Canes; and while
they bemoaned themſelves under the ſmart of their
Wounds, the others inſulted with a barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty:
Yea, One of the Informers being mad with
Fury, ſometimes took a Boy; lifting him up by
the Hair, and at other times, as he had underſtood
the Intrigue of Dreſſing his Diſcourſe in a more
enticing Dialect, accoſting a Girl with pleaſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
whom, becauſe ſhe refus'd his Kiſſes and
Amorous Embraces, he held by the Arm with ſuch
Force and Violence, that he eaſily diſtorted the
Tender Joynts. Neither did he only kick Old
Men to the Ground with his Feet, but alſo Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Young, Big-bellied, or Old. If one had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to intercede for another, though it had been
an Husband for a Tender Wife, the Blows were
preſently exchang'd upon himſelf. 'Twas little
to hear 'em daily belch out ſuch Names as theſe,
Viz. <hi>Whores, Bitches</hi> and <hi>Bawds,</hi> words not to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by one Cſtriſtian to another. A certain Boy,
ſcarce out of his Hanging-Sleeves, wantoning and
playing with a young Girl, with that impudent
Levity, that he began to handle the Girl obſcene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſhe for the Roguiſh endeavour of his Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Contaction, and alſo, to preſerve her Honour
and Chaſtity, gave him a ſmall chop upon the
Cheek; the Informer knowing it would have her
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50388:154"/>
put in Jayl, becauſe ſhe had aim'd with her hand
to defend her Chaſtity from the daunings of the
young Rogues luſt, objecting that without the
leaſt neceſſity, ſhe had beat the boy out of a
Turbulent Spirit: The 16th of <hi>April</hi> in the year
following, the Sheriff and Informer ruſh'd in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitantly
upon ten women aſſembled together.
Theſe they ordered to be dragg'd to <hi>Bridwel,</hi> one
of them being with child was very tender, whom
the Sheriff dragg'd along with his own hand (for
he was one that needed not a Serjeants aſſiſtance)
neither could Prayers or Complaints induce the
cruel Monſter to deſiſt. The houſe being empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Sheriff brought, or let in Labourers, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Carriers, and ſuch like equally famous for
Rudeneſs and Inſolence, and ſo fitted for a work
of this Nature, who took their pleaſure in Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Drinking of the ſpoils and booty of
that day, while the others were enduring ſuch
Cruelty and Miſery. After they had Eaten and
Drunken what they could, providing themſelves
in Banner and Drum, they paſt the reſt of the
time in Playing, Dancing and Singing, which
the Sheriff took pleaſure to feed his Eyes with
the ſight of: The <hi>Quaker</hi> woman ſeeing this,
ask'd the Sheriff if he thought it Convenient,
that a houſe devoted to the worſhip of God,
ſhould be made a Theatre of their Luſtful
ſhows; the Sheriff, whoſe mind was always ſo
forſtall'd with hatred againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that
he could digeſt nothing that proceeded from
them, was ſo highly offended that he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her preſently to be thrown into <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
amongſt her Companions: In priſon no leſs
affliction follow'd after 'em by the harſhneſs of
the Keeper, and Cruelty of his Servants. There
was a Vault wherein Priſoners that were no
Malefactors, were ſuffer'd to Converſe, work and
diſcourſe together, but this ſmall liberty, he
would not permit the <hi>Quakers</hi> to enjoy. When
they endeavour'd any thing at ſet times, when
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50388:154"/>
they had opportunity to ſit or talk together,
he diſturb'd, divided 'em, and ſhut 'em aſſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
beating 'em upon finding what they had
ſaid or done, he threw them amongſt Theives
and Rogues, where they could not ſee and
meet one another, but muſt ſtrive and ſtruggle
with ſo odious a Company: When the Sheriff
or informer came into Priſon, they treated
them no, leſs harſhly and furiouſly: At laſt, the
Number of the Priſoners was ſo great, that
there was no Room to lye in all Night, nor
ſcarce to breath freely by day, ſo that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all fell into various Diſeaſes, and danger
of being ſoon overtaken by Death, a peice of
Comfort, ſince it would have allay'd the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of life, yet here they're diſcharg'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
their Condition: The Priſoners, and four
Phyſicians of the City whom the matter was
known to, wrote a Letter to the Mayor, and
the reſt of the Magiſtrates, that they might be
acquainted with their Calamity, the Keepers
Cruelty, and the whole affair, endeavouring to
lighten their Miſeries and Torments, and might
aſſiſt 'em againſt the Cruelty of their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
But the Mayor, in whom the greateſt
power is lodg'd, and the reſt of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy
having read their Letters, and being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with Compaſſion, reſolv'd to ſuccour theſe
diſtreſſed People, knowing that no Relaxation
would be obtain'd by thoſe fellows of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Rank, eſpecially the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> whom I have
mention'd, who fortified himſelf ſo much at

do any thing, it muſt be done amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and that thoſe that were diſpoſſeſs'd of
their houſes and ground, might have Liberty
to complain of the Injury they had ſuſtain'd. In
<hi>Apr.</hi> there was a Court at <hi>Briſtoll</hi> for the <hi>Quaker</hi>
Priſoners, where all things being duely heard and

fine, and taking the Oath of fidelity that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50388:155"/>
was tendred to them, were offeted to be freed
from their Goal and Miſery; but they chuſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in Goal, rather than the fine and Oath:
There was one <hi>Eraſm. Dole,</hi> who ſuffer'd himſelf to

                        </gap>erm of declaring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of that of Swearing: A certain Serjeant pluck'd
out a Bible unawares, and laying his hand upon
it put the book to his mouth according to the
uſual manner of giving an Oath: Whereupon not
a few did vainly boaſt that there were amongſt
the <hi>Quakers</hi> who refus'd not an Oath; and that

                        </gap>ion in the minds of Men, <hi>Dole</hi> in a book
gives a faithful account how the whole matter
was manag'd: Thus the <hi>Quakers</hi> were remitted
to Goal, and more Barbarouſly treated by the
Keepers them formerly, there being no Room left
for Prayer or price to obtain the leaſt bodily
Convenience. The <hi>Quakers</hi> not being fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to have theſe affairs known only to thoſe of
their own City, did in many writings publiſh,
and divulge 'em to the Peruſal and Remembrance
of the reſt of the Nation: About this time many
<hi>Quakers</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> for not forbearing their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Meetings, and refuſing to pay the ſines they
ow'd on that ſcore, were thrown into Priſon, and
forc'd there to remain; In the mean time, the
ſharping crew of Informers took away their goods
whereſoever they could light on 'em, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſumm was laid on, but as they pleas'd
to value them, which was at little enough. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Priſoners there were two <hi>Quaker</hi>
Preachers, <hi>W. Bringly,</hi> and <hi>Fr. Stamper,</hi> from the
latter was taken 49 <hi>lib. ſter.</hi> and more. At <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi>
in <hi>Suffolk, Jo. Biſhop</hi> a Countreyman, owed
the Pariſh Miniſter 8 <hi>lib.</hi> for two years Tythes,
which when he did not pay, the Miniſter got out
a Judgment, for 76 <hi>lib.</hi> to be Levy'd out of his
Horſes, Sheep, Cows, and Oxen. While the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50388:155"/>
Kingdom was in this State, toſs'd with the ſtorms
of Perſecution and trouble, King <hi>Cha.</hi> II. dyed
and <hi>Ja.</hi> the D. of <hi>York</hi> ſucceeded in his ſtead:
The 7th of that Name: In the year 1685, being
inſtall'd into the Throne, the firſt thing he Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
the force of his deſires at, was the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing,
and advancing the Popiſh Religion: that
he might open the way for, and abate the envy
of others againſt it, he granted a Common Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to all, to exerciſe their Religion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their pleaſures, all being tickled with the
ſpecious Allurement, that were formerly hated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their perſwaſion, ran as it were upon the
firſt Allarum to Congratulate by their ſpecial and
particular Addreſſes the tenderneſs of his Majeſties
grace and favour, and throw themſelves into his
Protection and Patronage: The Quakers alſo all,
tho leſs Courtly, and more ruſtick in a certain
writing, very Civil and Complaiſant, emitted by
the order of a General Meeting, gave him thanks,
and gratefully laid hold of his Benevolence. About
that time were detain'd in the Priſons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
1460 Quakers, theſe all by the coming out
of the <hi>Kings Edict,</hi> had Liberty to go out, and
live as they pleaſed; and afterward when 200
and more were thrown into Priſon; In the year
following, they had the ſame impunity and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Moreover, that the King might avoid all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of ſeverity, and attain the Popular praiſe
of Benignity, he gave in charge to his Courtiers
and Servants, that none of 'em ſhould dare to
trouble a Quaker, tho he ſtood or paſs'd by the
King without being diſcovered. Nay, more, he
us'd ſometimes to come to them, when he knew
they deſir'd to ſee and ſpeak with him, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them aſham'd or affraid to approach; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
and Anticipated the ſubject of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:
A thing ſeldom to be met with in the Court.
It was pleaſant and facetious when a certain
Quaker drew nigh to the King, who, tho the
Quaker was covered, yet diſcovered himſelf, he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50388:156"/>
deſir'd the King not to do it, but was anſwer'd,
wherever there is the perſon of a King, there muſt
of nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ty always one be diſcovered: Thus the
King was ingraciated into the Quakers favours;
having extraordinarily kindled their Love and
Affection. Yet ſome thought their reaſon was
therefore beſtow'd that they might be ſo wiſe as to
look further then they cou'd ſee with their Eyes,
did not prize the Kings bounty and facility ſo
highly, putting a great difference betwixt the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of a free and unbyaſs'd Inclination, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of a ſelf-ſeeking Contrivance and Deſign,
and knowing the meaſure of the Kings endeavour
took all his indulgence as an ill Omen, and ſign
of a ſtorm to follow a Clam. <hi>W. Penn</hi> was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in favour with the K. the Quakers ſole <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ron</hi>
at Court, on whom the hateful Eyes of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were intent: the K. loved him as a ſingular
and intire Friend, and imparted to him many of
his Secrets and Counſels. The K. often honour'd
him with his audience in private, diſcourſing with
him of various affairs and that not for one, but
many hours together; delaying to hear the beſt
of his peers, who at the ſame time were attending
in the preſence Chamber, or ſome other nigh by,
to meet with the King. One of 'em being envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and impatient of delay, taking it as an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
to ſee <hi>Penn</hi> more regarded then he, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
to take the freedom to tell the K. that when
he met with <hi>Penn</hi> he regarded not his Nobility.
The K. made no other Anſwer then that <hi>Penn</hi>
talk'd Ingeniouſly, and he heard him willingly,
<hi>Penn</hi> being ſo highly favour'd by the K. acquir'd
thereby a Number of Friends; Theſe alſo that
formerly were e're acquainted with him, when
they had any thing to be done or deſired of the
K. came to, Courted and Intreated <hi>Penn</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
their buſineſs by his favour with the K. He
was eſpecially thus importun'd by the Quakers.
<hi>Penn</hi> refus'd none of his friends any Office he
cou'd do for any of 'em, with the K. but was
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50388:156"/>
principally ready to ſerve the Quakers, eſpecially
wherever their Religion was concern'd. It's uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
thought when you do me one favour readily,
you thereby encourage me to expect a ſecond.
Thus they run to <hi>Penn</hi> without Intermiſſion as
their alone Pillar and Support, who always ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs'd
and received 'em cheerfully, and effected
their buſineſs by his Intereſt and Eloquence. Hence
his houſe and Gates were daily throng'd by a Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
train of Clients and Suppliants, deſiring
him to preſent their addreſſes to his Majeſty.
There were ſometimes there 200 and more. When
the carrying on theſe affairs required expences at
Court for Writings, and drawing out of things
into Acts, Coppyings, Fees, and other Moneys
which are due or at leaſt are uſually payed, <hi>Penn</hi>
ſo diſcreetly managed matters, that out of his

diſcharged all emergent expences. Tho he did
thus, yet could he not decline the virulent Laſhes
of Malicious Tongnes, and theſe of the lower as
well as the higher ſort (which came to his Ears,
but did not much affect him) that he was not ſo
Active in his friends concerns, ſo much from the
freedom of a willing Inclination, as the Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
expectation of profit and advantage; that all
that confluence of People that Courted him, and
Induſtrious Adminiſtration of their affairs was
not for nothing if it were put to the Teſt, but
rewarded with more then what was expended:
This reproach <hi>Penn</hi> only repuls'd with ſome by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,

the King, who was deſirous to know what truth
was in it, he ſo cleared and acquitted himſelf, that
he judg'd him not only Blameleſs, but them alſo
tardy, who had the vanity to think, or folly to
aſſert <hi>Penn</hi> to be guilty of ſuch Malicious aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:

this certain Concluſion, that there muſt needs be
one Society of Chriſtians, the common ſafety and

freely without any Impediment and Hinderance,
providing only he liv'd peaceably, and ſubmiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the power and honour of the Magiſtrate;
and ſince this Kingdom was deny'd that Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
having the way to that liberty obſtructed
by an Oath, which every one by Law was requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<hi>Penn</hi> treated with the King of theſe two,
who was alſo deſirous to have 'em remov'd, and
therefore receiv'd the addreſs more willingly;
<hi>Penn</hi> ſo defended and confirm'd the Kings Edict,

exclaim'd that <hi>Penn</hi> as well as the King aim'd at
Popery with his outmoſt endeavour, calling him
not only a Papiſt, but alſo a Jeſuit, an order that's
equally crafty, and hated. The Quakers thought
it not at all amiſs to have the penal Laws wholly
Abiegated, which the Quaker ſubjects moſt of
all were expos'd to, but lik'd not to have the
Law concerning the Oath repea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>'d, leſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
thereby being let into the Government might
quickly renew theſe ſanguinary Laws, and by
means thereof take, weary, drive out and kill the
Proteſtants, and eſpecially the Quakers according
to the cuſtom of their Tenets and Religion, as
if they had only been abſolv'd from former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
to be condemn'd more cruelly to ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
puniſhment: Thus they fear'd the ſnare cheifly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50388:157"/>
to be laid for themſelves. While many were thus
hurried in their minds, <hi>Penn</hi> ſo proved himſelf in
another book not to be addicted to, but an hater
of Popery, by the Teſtimony of his word, his
Conſcience, which is a thouſand Witneſſes, and of
God than whom none can be greater, that if the
words of Man may ever be believ'd, every one
may credit <hi>Penn</hi> not to ſpeak falſe, blazing it with
any Colour of ſubtility, but that he wrote truth
with Candour and Sincerity. Tho <hi>Penn</hi> cou'd not,
by that book change the opinion that many had
received of him, yet he ſo fully convinced the
Quakers that from them he retriev'd his ancient
praiſe, for ſome time intermitted, ſo that they own'd
him for one conſtant to their Religion, and yet
left him to the ſingularity of his own opinion: So
the Quakers under this King liv'd quietly and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
except a few, that were ſomewhat troubled,
by the enſnaring Tricks of ſome <hi>deceitful men:</hi>
but the Time of New Trouble, and Change of all
was at hand: For now the King, weary of <hi>wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
thinking his Deſigns not capable of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
by any, introduc'd Popery not hiddenly,
but openly: Not to mention others, theſe of the
Higheſt Dignity, even Biſhops and Archbiſhops,
that withſtood his <hi>Intentions,</hi> were, ſome of 'em,
brought over <hi>to his Cauſe,</hi> by Bribes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
put into the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> Theſe being
Reſolute and Couragious in their honourable
cauſe found by experience how far it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and yet how hard to ſuffer for the liberty of
their Conſcience. And ſince my diſcourſe has led
me hither, I can't but add what was ſaid by the
Quakers themſelves. When the Biſhops of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
were now thus Stated, ſome of the Quakers
took the Freedom to tell 'em that ſame miſchief,
return'd now on themſelves, that formerly came
out from them upon the Quakers: When it came
to their Ears, they reſented it ill, that ſuch words
ſhou'd be ſpoken and ſcatter'd of them by the
Quakers: <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> underſtanding this went
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50388:158"/>
preſently to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and told 'em all modeſtly
that was done againſt the Quakers, both by the
command and permiſſion of the Biſhops, to
which narrative they cou'd make no other reply
but that of ſilence. But after 3 years K. <hi>James</hi>'s
Reign expir'd and was ſucceeded by K. <hi>William</hi>
the Third, of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> hereditary State-holder of
<hi>Holland,</hi> Son in Law, and Nephew to <hi>James</hi> by his
Siſter, who in all the ſeries and courſe of his Life
ſhew'd himſelf the beſt of Princes and Generals,
equally adorn'd with Civil and <hi>Warlick</hi> virtue and
withal Arm'd with Chriſtian Piety, a like uſeful
to Church and State, both by his Inclination and
Education in his own Countrey, which tho it hath
no Kings, yet produces, and fits 'em for other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
Upon his firſt taking up the Reins of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
he beliav'd himſelf to all with that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
that it was manifeſt, he deſir'd rather
to be lov'd then fear'd, and to bereave none of
Liberty of Conſcience in Religion; ſo that all
juſtly eſteem'd him a moſt prudent and moderate
Prince, equal to the beſt King that e're preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him. He granted Freedom and Indulgence to
all but only the Papiſts, whoſe infidelity he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
thoſe he treated with a mixture of Grace
and Severity, making always the former the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Ingredient. The Quakers alſo cou'd not but
love him, and embrace him as their moſt effectual
defender, being ſuffer'd to perform their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
exerciſes, without the hinderance of fear and
moleſtation. This Royal benevolence was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced
by the Parliament, which the King called
after his Inanguration, according to the ancient
Cuſtom of Kings, who us'd to have a Parliament
in the beginning of their Reign, that if any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Law were to be chang'd or Aboliſh'd, it
might be legally done with conſent of the houſe.
This Parliament ratify'd a Liberty in Religion,
giving immunity to all, from the force and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that formerly reſulted from any penal Act,
excepting yet the Papiſts, who were reckoned ſuch
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50388:158"/>
Enemies that no peace cou'd be eſtabliſh'd with
them, and granting liberty to them wou'd be
taking it from our ſelves, and ſo to raiſe war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our own ſafety: Excepting alſo <hi>Socinians,</hi>
and thoſe of the like ſtamp who either openly or
by Clandeſtine practices, Aim'd at ſubverting the
Foundations of the Chriſtian faith. Thus the
Quakers had liberty; but ſince it's a matter of
ſome moment to know the Rights and Privileges
given 'em by King and Parliament, and inſerted
in Acts of Liberty in Religion, it will not be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to handle it more largely, if it were but for
that <hi>French</hi> Authors ſake whom I mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
not to his praiſe, a baſe unconſtant and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
fellow, who, after many turnings, and
windings in Religion, as both ſtrangers and they
that know him aſſure me by Letters, plays now
ſtrenuouſly the Papiſt at <hi>Paris:</hi> However it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
he treats of this theme, as if he had aim'd at
no other deſign then to bring in ſome and play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
others, with a few frothy flowriſhes of words:
This is the matter of fact. The Parliament made
it their purpoſe and endeavour, to give Liberty
of Conſcience to ſuch as I have Nam'd. A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of a ſelect number of the houſe was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to treat of this affair. They when doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Quakers Doctrine, and ſaith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſacred Scripture and myſtery of the holy
Trinity, becauſe they uſe not to call the Scripture
the word of God, (thinking that name to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
only to Chriſt, or to the internal word of
God, under which ſenſe external Letters can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fall) nor to term the Father, Son and Spirit
three perſons (that being a word not uſed in
Scripture, ordered their Articles and opinion to
be preſently inquired into. Two famous Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
at that time, <hi>Geo. Withad</hi> and <hi>John Virughton</hi>
treated of theſe matters with Sir <hi>Tho. Clargy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> a
member of the houſe. He advis'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> with
Kindneſs and Candour, to publiſh their mind
fully and fairly concerning theſe two Articles
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50388:159"/>
that were doubted of. They without delay write
and ſubſcribe their Thoughts, and willingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
'em to that honourable Man, from whom,
as they had received a wholſom Advice, they now
alſo expect a ſeaſonable aſſiſtance. The form of
each of 'em for himſelf was to this purpoſe. I
believe with my heart, and confeſs with my mouth
the ſacred Scriptures to be Divine, left us by Men
Inſpir'd of God, as an exact rule of our faith
and behaviour; and I profeſs to believe in one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God, who is the father, and in Jeſus Chriſt his
Eternal Son, very God, and very Man, and in the
Holy Spirit one, and the ſame God with the Father
and Son bleſſed for evermore. This confeſſion
having pleas'd <hi>Clargy</hi> was given to be read to the
reſt of the Members, who thought fit to call in
ſome nine or ten Quakers, that were ready at hand
for ſuch a deſign, to queſtion 'em if that were
their faith and perſwaſion: Upon their owning it
the day following the matter was preſented by the
Committee to the whole houſe; and thus it was
agreed that the Quakers ſhou'd have liberty, and
order'd it ſhou'd be recorded and drawn out into
an Act. While publick affairs were thus changed,
<hi>W. Penn</hi> was not ſo regarded and reſpected by King
and Court, as he was formerly by King <hi>James;</hi>
partly becauſe of his intimacy with King <hi>James,</hi>
and partly for adhering to his old opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Oath of fidelity which was now mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated
but not abrogated. Beſides, this it was
ſuſpected that <hi>Penn</hi> Correſponded with the late
King, now Lurking in <hi>France,</hi> under the umbrage
and protection of the <hi>French</hi> King, an enemy
juſtly and equally odious to the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> King
and united Provinces, 'twixt whom there was now
an inveterate War. This ſuſpicion was follow'd
and alſo encreas'd by a Letter intercepted from
King <hi>James</hi> to <hi>Penn,</hi> deſiring <hi>Penn</hi> to come to his
aſſiſtance in the preſent State and Condition he
was in, and expreſs the Reſentments of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and benevolence. Upon this <hi>Penn</hi> being
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50388:159"/>
cited to appear was ask'd, why King <hi>James</hi> wrote
unto him, he anſwer'd he cou'd not hinder ſuch a
thing, being further queſtion'd what Reſentments
theſe were, which the late King ſeem'd to deſire
of him, he anſwer'd he knew not, but ſaid he
ſuppoſed King <hi>James</hi> wou'd have him to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
his Reſtitution, and that tho he cou'd not
decline the ſuſpicion, yet he cou'd avoid the guilt,
and ſince he had loved King <hi>James</hi> in his proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
he ſhou'd not hate him in his adverſity, yea,
he lov'd him as yet for many favours he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
on him, tho he wou'd not joyn with him in
what concern'd the State of the Kingdom. He
own'd he had been much oblig'd to King <hi>James,</hi>
and that he wou'd reward his kindneſs by any
private office as far as he cou'd, obſerving inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and intirely that duty to the publick, and
Government which was equally Incumbent upon
all Subjects, and therefore that he had never the
vanity to think of endeavouring to reſtore him
that Crown which was fallen from his head,
ſo that nothing in that Letter cou'd at all ſeem to
fix guilt upon him. From that time <hi>Penn</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
himſelf more and more from buſineſs, and
at length, at <hi>London,</hi> in his own houſe, confin'd
himſelf as it were to a voluntary exile, from the
converſe, fellowſhip, and conference of others,
employing himſelf only in his Domeſtick affairs,
that he might be devoted more to Meditation and
Spiritual exerciſes: In the year Ninety three, two
books of his came out in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the one of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
life, the other a Key to underſtand the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Quakers faith. This year <hi>Penn</hi> went
out of his voluntary Priſon, compenſing the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of his lonely life by the comfort of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
which he now entred into, and the greater
toil he took on himſelf in managing all his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and affairs. <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> alſo after many chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

now not doubting to Conſummate and end his

                        <hi>Fox</hi> not long before he died by the Interpoſal

book in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> only with reference to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
himſelf, during the time he labour'd among

The book was publiſh'd being ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
with the Authority of a General aſſembly,
of that perſwaſion about the end of the year
enſuing. I long ſought it with great Induſtry,
and after much pains it came at length to my
hand, but not till the whole work was almoſt
finiſhed and a part of it already receiv'd from

things we've related concerning <hi>Fox</hi> to be there
omitted; but what we've ſaid in ours of <hi>Fox</hi>
doth for the main agree with what there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.
I made ſome Remarks from thence of
<hi>Fox,</hi> which tho I knew not before, I adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
to make uſe of relying on his own Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and Teſtimony. I may take the liberty to
ſay further of that great book of <hi>Fox,</hi> that it
contains but few Hiſtorical Narratives, conſiſting
chiefly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Enumerating places he Travell'd to
all the days of his Life, and the diſputes he
there maintain'd with ſeveral ſorts of Men, and
the almoſt innumerable Orations and Epiſtles he
wrote. <hi>Fox</hi> was a Man alike famous for the
temper and diſpoſition of his body and mind,
of a very ſolid and ſucculent body, and a mind
fitly attemper'd thereto, of a great Memory,
and tho not at all dull, yet not Extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
quick and acute; Always more ready to think
than to talk, and yet more forward to ſpeak
than to write: Unacquainted with no Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
or Art tho ne're ſo Vulgar, not Curious,
yet ſometimes taking pleaſure to divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
by playing with the cheats of the Learned.
Laborious and diligent tho 'twere of little or
nothing, in all the minutes of his Common lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
Indefatigable, even when ſtrugling with the

making the meaſure ſhorter than that of the
Night. So given to frugality both for Health
and Religion, that he once faſted ten days as
he teſtifies of himſelf, being equally temperate
in all the parts of his Life: Bold, and always of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50388:161"/>
a conſtant patience, doing all things ſo openly

all things as if the ſole ſuffering, and not the
Cauſe, or Action, were glorious; ſo ambitioning
the Title of a Martyr, as if he had thought the
Name alone to be ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>He was moreover couragious, tenacious of his
Opinion, and moroſe, ſo much conſiding in his
Perſon, Pains and Advice, that he thought nothing
could be done rightly, or perfected without him,
being de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and what happen'd to be done well, he
laid claim to the glory of it, pretending Title to
the Reward of the Praiſe of it from all; and yet
all this under colour of Simplicity and Humility.
Pleaſant and Bountiful to thoſe that lov'd him,
but bitter againſt others that were not of his Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not only hurting 'em verbally, but really as
fer as he cou'd, and that ſometimes not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently,
but even immodeſtly and impudently
too. One of his ancient friends and acquaintances
writes, in a certain Letter of <hi>Fox,</hi> that he was,
according to the <hi>meaſure of his Capacity devoted
greatly to the worſhip of God, and promoting of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
among Men, meek in Converſation, yet tainted
with this, which almoſt all teachers labour under, in
a new Sect or Diſcipline, that he was too harſh
'mongst the Quakers themſelves, eſpecially thoſe that
wou'd not receive ſuch forms as he had conceiv'd or
conſtituted.</hi> He left many books, which ſome of
his followers do but faintly praiſe, yet others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll
'em to the Skies; few touch 'em that are not
of their perſwaſion, and no body reads 'em that
loaths repetition of the ſame thing, in various
dreſs of words and expreſſions, or diſlikes treating
a theme with that Prolixity, as not to regard
what's ſufficient, but how much can be ſaid.</p>
                     <p>While <hi>Fox</hi> was alive, the Quakers lived with a
Brotherly Concord, though there always were
ſome that differ'd in ſome Article, beſide others
that fell off from their Fellowſhip; but <hi>Fox,</hi> as

Mind and Deſire, a great Diſcord aroſe in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
eſpecially among thoſe, who, tho they were
not much wiſer than the Vulgar, arrogated
more Wit and Accuracy to themſelves. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

in the following book: They've Diſputed
in <hi>England</hi> concerning that Article, almoſt to the
loſing of all Society. He that purſues the Life of
an Enemy, neglects the uſe of no ſort of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon;
but he that ſtudies to rob him of his Fame,
forbears to revile him with no ſort of Reproach.
That Controverſie was ſo invidious, diviſive and
troubleſome, and perſu'd with ſo much eagerneſs
of mind, that men being fluſh'd with the Deſire
of Overcoming, were not content to contend
with words, nor only to load one another with
many Suſpicions, but alſo to ſpread an ill Report
of their Antagoniſts, to hunt after, and wound
one another with Calumnies, openly denouncing
Enmity, Diviſion and Schiſm.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, it's almoſt a wonder to think what
Ignominy the Quakers did every where incur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what Reports were in all places diſpers'd of 'em,
for their ſo great deſire of ſtrife and contention,
that their whole Church ſeem'd infected with that
Itch and Contagion: And ſince the diviſion of
their parties was ſuch, there was little Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Peace and Brotherly affection to be expected,
nay, rather the time ſeem'd to draw nigh when
the Sect and its Name muſt dwindle into nothing,
and that by the force of its own endeavour.
There were ſome concern'd in this Controverſy
who, tho they managed it not by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50388:162"/>
but hidden Engines, not by open blows,
but private <hi>Laſhes</hi> yet certainly contributed to
their downfall and deſtruction: There were Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils of 'em held yearly at <hi>London,</hi> from
ninety two to the year ninety four.</p>
                     <p>In this year <hi>Keith</hi> came from <hi>Penſilvania</hi> to
<hi>London,</hi> and was called by the Council of that
year, as the principal head, and adviſer of the
whole affair. After he came and was long heard,
even that Council cou'd not compoſe theſe ſtrifes,
nor ſo much as a little decide the difference: So
that the miſchief as yet remains with Reproach
and Diſgrace. Such is the ſtiffneſs and vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of theſe Men, while now Iull'd with the ſoft
Gale of Proſperity and Eaſe, that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the leaſt ſhadow of the like before, while
they wreſtled with the rough wind of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
                     <p>But of this I'll ſpeak more fully in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Book, leſt this be ſwell'd beyond its bounds,
and there the matter comes in, in its more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place.</p>
                     <p>And now this and many other ſigns, give ſome
no ſmall occaſion to affirm that liberty, caſe, and
External Tranquillity do Miniſter to diſcord,
ſlothfulneſs, wantonneſs, and Intemperance,
which are all dangerous to Life; neither do they
always avail to the happineſs of living, for not a
few among theſe Men may be found, that have
too great a propenſion to vices of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>The Maſters and Obſervers of behaviour omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not to reprove ſuch faults very ſmartly, and
ſome of them who had alſo committed 'em for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
not to invey ſharply againſt themſelves.
Examples hereof I'll deſignedly paſs by, tho
ſome without Calumny and Reproach I cou'd
inſert, leſt they that are concerned may be
ſomewhat diſpleas'd at the ripping of that which
may rub upon themſelves: Yet one I ſhall mention
which <hi>London</hi> reſounded with, leſt fame report it
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50388:162"/>
otherwiſe than perhaps it was done.</p>
                     <p>There was a very ſincere Quaker, free from
all ſuſpicion of this kind, who being ſcorch'd
with the flames of Love, that the Charms of
his Miſtreſs's face had kindled, convers'd with
her with too much weakneſs and frequency:
but upon Remorſe and Knowledge of his
Guilt, being pierc'd with Shame and Sorrow
for his ſin, he makes a publick Confeſſion of
his fault to the Church, ſubmitting himſelf
to the Cenſure and Correction of his friends;
yea further, for deviating from Honeſty and
Modeſty ſo far, that he might not fall into
that ſnare again, or for the future repeat
the like wickedneſs, with his own hand
he Chaſtiſes himſelf by a preſent cutting off
the delinquent Member.</p>
                     <p>Tho all this time they enjoy'd ſo much
liberty, yet they neither were nor are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
free from all ſort of Commotion and
Diſturbance: Neither when the Oath of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
(that great invitation to oppreſſion) was
taken away, were other pretences of Oaths
wanting, that might prove Incitements to
bring on Perſecution. For from that day to
this, many inſtances may be ſeen of theſe Men,
whoſe inheritance for refuſing an Oath has
been forfeited; ſome having their goods
wholly taken from 'em, others beſide the
loſs of their goods being caſt into Priſon.
And ſince, as yet as well as before, the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of the one party in exacting, and
of the other in refuſing the payment of
Tythes, is not at all impair'd or abated, a
time cou'd very ſeldom be pitch'd on,
wherein there was none of 'em to be found
in Cuſtody. That the grudge of ancient, and
levity of new Enemies are the efficients of
this, and not the ſupreme Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
every one will eaſily own who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50388:163"/>
that Kings have many Eyes, Ears
and Hands, but yet muſt be always long-ſuffering
and patient, but not able at all
times to effect what they wou'd, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
willing to do what they can and
ſhou'd.</p>

Of all the Tract of the <hi>New England</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<hi>Boston</hi> is the <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and Judiciary
Seat. At that time <hi>John Endicot</hi> was Rector, or
Governour of the whole Province, one that from
a very low condition was gradually mounted to
this Honour and Dignity: Of whoſe Temper, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
and Government, which was then vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
thought and talk'd of, and whereof there were
afterwards, on both ſides Witneſſes, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my ſelf wholly to be ſilent. Next to him
was <hi>Richard Bellingham,</hi> whoſe manner of Life
and Nature I alſo paſs by.</p>
                  <p>At this time there was no where any thing like
a Law enacted againſt the <hi>Quakers.</hi> A Ship then
arriv'd at <hi>Boſton,</hi> and was no ſooner Anchor'd
than a rumor was ſpread, that 2 Quaker women
were come in the Ship. The Governour being
abſent, he that was depute immediately ſent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for ſeizing theſe women, ſealing up and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Hampers, Boxes, and Cheſts, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Books of their Sect, whereof they had
great ſtore, into the City, where they were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
burnt by the hand of the Hangman. Then
the women themſelves were brought into Town,
and ſoon after before the Judges, who preſently
as ſoon as they ſat down on the Bench pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
the women to be certainly Quakers, for
giving the ſingular title of <hi>thou</hi> to the Judge, and
not the more Courteous compellation of <hi>you</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the cuſtom of almoſt all the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
The Judges thinking this to be a ſure enough ſign,
and the matter to be clear and evident of it ſelf,
their office rendring 'em beſt Advocates for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
order'd the women to be taken and thrown
into Goal, and have nothing of the goods they
had left in the Ship, not ſo much as their Tools
and Inſtruments of Writing, leſt they ſhou'd
write of the Condition to which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
or ſomething of their New Religion and
Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:50388:166"/>
The Goaler to compleat what the Judges had
begun, had the manners Irreligiouſly to rob 'em of
their Bibles. 'Twas alſo decreed that none ſhou'd
go, ſpeak or carry any meat to them: Being kept
in ſo ſtrait and narrow a place, having ſcarce any
thing to eat, ſleep, or lie upon, till after ſome
days ſomething of their own was ſuffer'd to be
brought 'em from the Ship, which <hi>Nichol. Vpſhal</hi>
a Citizen of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and Member of the Church
there, privately agreed for a ſumm with the Goal-Keeper
to let in, and alſo to give 'em what ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
was ſufficient. They complain'd further
of their treatment, as being reproach'd and revil'd
as Whores, who ſcruple not to expoſe and defile
themſelves, and upon pretence of ſearching the
truth of the matter, of their being moſt baſely
and rudely ſtrip'd naked, and not only view'd
contrary to Chaſtity and Shame, Fac'dneſs, but
even handled with wicked and immodeſt hands,
without regarding thoſe ſecrets of nature which
modeſt Men wou'd ſhun the ſeeing or touching of:
Theſe things being ſo Villanous to Act, and ſcarce
modeſt to name, the women were rather forc'd to
ſit with and endure, than betray their own ſhame
without any Redreſs, or expoſe their Diſgrace
without Sympathy or Compaſſion. The women
abode for five weeks ſhut up in this lonely and
poor habitation: Then the Captain of the Ship
with whom they came, before he ſet Sail had
leave from the Judges, at his own proper proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and charges to carry them back, from whence
he had brought 'em. They being driven back, in
a little time after, <hi>Sara Gibbens, Mary Wartherhad,
Mary Prince, Dorothy Wangre,</hi> alſo <hi>Chriſtopher
Holder, Thomas Thunton, William Brent</hi> and <hi>John
Copelan,</hi> coming there met with ſuch Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as the women had done before. Upon this
occaſion there was a Law eſtabliſh'd that no Ship-Maſter
ſhou'd preſume to bring a Quaker there,
and if any Quaker ſhou'd Adventure to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Territories, he was preſently to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50388:166"/>
with the Confinement of a Priſon. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol.
Vpſhal</hi> whoſe civility to the Impriſon'd wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
I ſpoke of, inquiring more narrowly into the
Quakers Religion, began to withdraw from his
own Church, and betake himſelf to the Quakers
fellowſhip, and oppoſe and exclaim againſt the
Legiſlators Conſtitutions, for eſtabliſhing a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſanction or Law contrary to the Rule of
Divine precepts, warning and adviſing 'em all
to take care leſt by a willful fighting againſt God,
they pull down his wrath and Judgment on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
The Judges minds were hereby ſo Exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated,
that reſolving to make ſo new a danger
Exemplary, they firſt fin'd him in a hundred
Crowns, ſentenc'd him to Goal, and laſt of all to
Baniſhment. There was in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> part of the
province in ſight of the Countrey an <hi>Iſland</hi> call'd
<hi>Rhodes.</hi> Here ſome Quakers did live, hither
went <hi>Vpſhal</hi> to joyn with his cauſe. Whither
when he came, 'twas commonly reported, that
the Barbarous <hi>Indian</hi> Governour finding him, gave
him an Invitation to reſide in his Countrey and
Precincts, promiſing him a ſeat in his indigency
and exile, and alſo to Accommodate him with a
ſuitable habitation, adding thoſe words. What
ſort of God have the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who deal ſo with
others that worſhip their own. After the others
were put to the flight, <hi>Ann Burden,</hi> a widdow of
<hi>London</hi> in Old <hi>England,</hi> having ſome years ago liv'd
with her Husband at <hi>Boſton,</hi> came there now for
ſome Money that was due to her, with <hi>Mary Dyer,</hi>
wife to <hi>William Dyer,</hi> being both ignorant of
what was eſtabliſh'd by Law, and what miſchief
here did threaten the Quakers. Theſe women
were preſently ſeiz'd and kept in Priſon, untill
the husband did ſuccour the one, and good and
Compaſſionate people the other. <hi>Ann Burden</hi> was
ſo acquitted that ſhe was particularly prohibited,
to import theſe Warrs others had brought in her
name and account for ſumms and Moneys due by
ſome debtors, tho they cou'd have been ſold dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50388:167"/>
there than in old <hi>England,</hi> ſhe was forc'd again
to Tranſport 'em over the Sea, not without being
clipt by the Cuſtomers, and Officers, who were
Artiſts ſufficient in meddling with her goods, and
dividing a conſiderable part among themſelves.
In 75 the year following; and matters were ſtretch'd
to ſuch a pitch, that all advice and aſſiſtance to
that ſort of Men ſeem'd ſo fruitleſs, that they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
but matter of Accuſation and Calumny.
Since they cou'd not by Sea they did therefore by
Land, travel through ſtrange and deſolate places,
even ſuch Woods, Foreſts, and Solitudes, as none
before 'em ever paſs'd over, not knowing, or hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wherewith to ſuſtain themſelves, except what
they carry'd along in a bag; but when that fail'd,
being in utter want, they ſometimes met with
help and ſupply from the <hi>Indians,</hi> tho otherwiſe
the moſt Barbarous of all Mortals, who not only
ſhew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d 'em the way but things needful for life and
uſe, yea ſuch as theſe Countries take for Rarities
and Delicacies; ſo that the Quakers had reaſon
to eſteem their own <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> Enemies, and take
thoſe wild Men for Benefactors and Friends. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
theſe ſtrangers, <hi>Mary Clarke</hi> was the firſt
that adventur'd to intreat the Judges at <hi>Boston,</hi>
not to perſiſt to vex and afflict the innocent, but
rather wholly to forbear to grieve and perſecute
'em; tho ſhe did not inſiſt or reflect on the Judges,
yet they gave themſelves ſo over to rage, that they
commanded her to be whipt and caſt into Priſon:
So ſcandalous a reproach that matter was reputed.
Their whip is made of a ſmall rope or cord, with
three grains and ſeveral knots upon each of 'em
faſtesn'd to a ſtaff of ſuch a length, that when the
Executioner wou'd inflict the laſhes, he muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
employ both his hands to perform it, the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer
being often left worſe than half dead. <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoph.
Holder</hi> and <hi>John Copelan</hi> being once expell'd,
the City was afterward treated, as the woman had
been before. At a little Sea Town not far from
<hi>Boſton,</hi> having both entred into the publick
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50388:167"/>
Church, after Service and Sermon was ended, <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
began to diſcourſe to the people. They preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dragg'd him and <hi>Copelan</hi> out by the hair, daſhing
their very faces on the ground, ſtopping one of
their mouths with a ſleeve and hankerchief, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
'em out of the Church, they carry them to
<hi>Boston,</hi> where they were both laſh'd with ſuch
cruel ſtripes that ſome of the Spectators ſwoon'd
away at the ſight of it: After that they were
thrown into Priſon, and there compell'd to lie,
without either meat or drink three days and three
nights, and nine weeks in the middle of Winter
were forc'd to remain in ſo cold an habitation:
<hi>Holder</hi> the year following, returning to <hi>Boston</hi> to
ſeek a Ship to carry him back to <hi>Old England,</hi> was
again Impriſon'd without any reaſon. Whereunto
this piece of ſeverity was Annex'd. There liv'd at
<hi>Salem</hi> a little from <hi>Boſton Lawrence</hi> and <hi>Caſſandra
Southikes,</hi> dear and loving Yoke-fellows, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
moſt faithful and honeſt Church Members.
Theſe two I have ſpoken of, when they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Salem,</hi> they receiv'd willingly and entertain'd
kindly; their <hi>Hoſteſs</hi> taking the freedom to tell
'em, that the books they had with 'em were not
unpleaſing to her, was preſented with ſome of
s'em, as a Reſentment of her favour. For this
fault the two, the Man and his Wife were carried
to <hi>Boſton</hi> and there Impriſon'd, and ſhe fin'd in an
hundred florens and more. Moreover, ſome, that
were true enough Children of the Church, being
averſe to ſuch ſeverity not only to the Quakers,
but even ſuch who from tenderneſs ſhew'd 'em any
kindneſs, did therefore withdraw themſelves from
the Church's Communion, and accordingly were
ſure to be fin'd and Impriſon'd. The <hi>Southikes</hi> with
their Son <hi>Joſia</hi> were the firſt of this kind, and for
being the firſt were brought back unto <hi>Boſton,</hi> and
condemn'd to be fin'd, Impriſon'd and whipt, tho
the parents were old weakly and infirm, in a very
cold and Winterly ſeaſon, they were all ſhut up
and detained in Goal. Theſe parents had alſo two
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50388:168"/>
Children more, a Son <hi>Daniel</hi> and a Daughter <hi>Prar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deda,</hi>
who were ſo far from being terrify'd with
what their parents had ſuffer'd, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
by their example, to relinguiſh and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the fellowſhip of the Church, and adjoyn
themſelve to the Quakers Society: They were
thereupon ſentenc'd to the ſame puniſhment with
their parents, a pecuniary Mulct being laid upon
both, which if they did not pay, 'twas order'd
they ſhou'd Compenſe it by their Work and Labour
among the Chained and Slaves. Being inſolvent,
and yet as unwilling, as unable to endure that
hard and moſt cruel toil, it was order'd by an Act
of the Senate at <hi>Salem,</hi> and afterward ratify'd by
the Parliament at <hi>Boſton,</hi> that the boys ſhou'd go
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were trading in <hi>Virginia</hi> and
<hi>Barmuda</hi>'s, and the charge hereof was given to
<hi>Edward Rutter,</hi> one of the then Officers of the
Treaſury. It had been effected had it not been
for the Seamen, who approv'd the cruelty of that
butcherly hangman, that took pleaſure in the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and howling of the Boys, and extenuated
the Barbarity or theſe bitter Men, even while
they Remembred the youthful innocence of the
others; A cruelty ſo unheard of that it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
in <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, unleſs they had been
guilty of theft, or out of the Number of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites:</hi>
Theſe divine Laws of the Religious
Zealots, in Correcting faults, and inflicting pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments,
I wou'd not give my ſelf the trouble to
Repeat, had they not been ſo plainly and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
known, that they became the Subject talk
of almoſt every Tongue. One <hi>Sam. Sattor,</hi> who
had gone to the Quakers Meeting at <hi>Salem,</hi> at that
Croud in the publick Church, when the handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
was thruſt into <hi>Chriſtoph. Holder</hi>'s mouth to
ſtop his throat and prevent his ſpeaking, for pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it out for fear it ſhou'd choak him, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
caſt into Priſon at <hi>Boſton.</hi> Another <hi>William
Sattor,</hi> for declining to go to Church was admon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh'd
of his crime by a certain number of Laſhes,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50388:168"/>
and after Correction put in the ſame Goal. The
Law that was formerly made againſt Quakers,
was now in this manner inlarged and amplify'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
that if any inhabitant did happen to underſtand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
Quaker to be any where within theſe Territories,
he ſhou'd preſently acquaint the Governour of the
<hi>Sea ports,</hi> who were order'd, if the Quaker did
not immediately go thence, to cauſe him be whipt,
and driven out of that Countrey. If by means
of any perſon a Quaker were brought there, he
was to forfeit 100 <hi>l. sterl.</hi> to the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and
be kept in Cuſtody till the ſumm ſhou'd be pay'd.
If any receiv'd a Quaker into his houſe and did not
at the ſame inſtant go out of it himſelf, for the
firſt fault he was to pay 25 <hi>l.</hi> and for every hour
he retain'd him longer, he was fin'd in fourty
ſhillings; but if otherwiſe, he was detain'd till
he pay'd the 100 <hi>l.</hi> If any Quaker ſhou'd come
there from far, or any of that place ſhou'd em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Quakeriſm; at firſt if they were Males
their Ear was to be cut off, and then the other if
they promis'd not to renounce it; both times
they were cloſely to be ſhut up in Goal, till they
went into Baniſhment at their own proper Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es:
If Females they were twice ſeverely to be
whipt, and then to undergo the ſame ſentence
with the Men: If either Male or Female offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the third time, their Tongue was bored with a
Red hot Iron, and they ſhut up in Goal in like
manner as before. This Law being made <hi>Richard
Donden</hi> from Old <hi>England</hi> had the ill fortune to
come here Ignorantly; who, ſince he knew not
the Law, was only puniſh'd by Whipping and
Baniſhment, having a threatning annex'd that if
e're he return'd, the loſs of his Ears ſhou'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
his ſuffering. But the women <hi>Sara Gibbens,</hi>
and <hi>Dorohty Wangie,</hi> were treated with greater
Cruelty and Rigour, who, for three days after
Impriſonment were deny'd all Victuals, and in
this famiſhing and fainting Condition, were whipt
and beaten with a mercyleſs fury, and after their
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50388:169"/>
ſtripes kept other three days ſtarv'd as before
without any food. <hi>Dorothy Gardenet</hi> when laſh'd
inhumanely, kneeling, begg'd of God to forgive
her Tormenters; It wou'd be long to mention
many, and impoſſible to repeat all examples of
this kind. I ſhall therefore name only one or
two, paſſing by others, to purſue my intended
brevity. There came to <hi>Salem,</hi> and from thence
to <hi>Newbury, William Brand,</hi> and <hi>William Leader,</hi>
who being deſir'd by the people there, to enter
into Conference with their Pariſh Miniſter, having
got liberty from him that commanded the place,
who alſo promis'd to Patronize and protect 'em,
being led by their own Inclination and the peoples
deſire, readily liſten'd to the proffer'd propoſal:
But when they departed the cunning Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
a Man equally Malicious and Treacherous,
thinking, his ſimplicity and integrity ſufficiently
juſtify'd ſince they were not troubl'd all the time
of the Conference, and that he now kept his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
and anſwer'd their Expectation ſent to ſeize,
bind, and carry them to <hi>Boſton.</hi> Being caſt into
Goal after two days faſting their naked backs were
expos'd to the laſh, loading 'em with threats,
they thruſt 'em into <hi>Bridewell,</hi> giving charge to
the Keeper to task 'em ſeverely: Which when
they declin'd, as impos'd undeſervedly, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Maſter, but real Servant of his luſt and
wickedneſs, knowing theſe labours to be moſt
commonly his own proper profit and advantage,
to make a penny by their toil and ſlavery, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from 'em violently what he charg'd 'em to
perform: Theſe poor Men had not yet taſted any
thing. <hi>Brand</hi> exceeded the other not only in
years, but alſo in patience, courage, and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
Him the Villain, pretending the publick, tho
only executing his private Gall and envy, drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
along, ſhekel'd his neck and heels together,
and left him in this miſery lock'd in Chains 16
hours without any ſenſe of Compaſſion or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:50388:169"/>
Then unlocking the Chains he bids him fall to
his work if he did not deſign to deſpair of his
back. He reply'd he wou'd not, nor cou'd tho
he were willing. The Butcherly fellow ſeeing
him unmov'd by either hopes or fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with a Sea-Rope or Cord twiſted of hemp
did laſh the Man with ſuch rage and violence,
that the Rope it ſelf was broken into pieces; but
ſeeing the firſt did not prevail, ſeeking another to
accompliſh his end, with renewed force he gave
him almoſt an hundred laſhes, inſomuch that his
whole body was as it were ſwell'd into one lump,
and the greateſt part of his fleſh as it had been
baked in an Oven, by reaſon of an univerſal tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and blackneſs. When the fourth day was
now come, he had not yet taſted any bodily nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment.
Afterward this brutiſh and hard heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Man ſhut <hi>Brand</hi> (thus miſerably torn with the
laſhes) up in a ſtrait and Solitary place, without
bed, ſtraw, or any thing to lye on, to refreſh his
torn and half lifeleſs body; which things, when
they came to the Ears of the people, that are
prone to Compaſſion, and as ready to miſchief,
yea, ſometimes uſe to demand, that theſe whom
they hold guilty, may be preſently puniſh'd, at
other times perhaps they relent, and are grieved
if they think the puniſhment to ſeverely inflicted,
began now to rage, riſe up and run in Crowds,
that the Magiſtrates to prevent their ſedition, firſt
ſent a Surgeon to give him what help he cou'd
and on his report that it was mortal and incurable,
(tho afterward the Man recover'd of his wounds)
order'd it to be ſignify'd, by affixing bills through
the City, that they diſapprov'd of ſuch cruel
uſage, and wou'd therefore conſider of what the
Keeper had done. But a certain one of the Town
Miniſters, a Man of Knowledge, Authority and
Reputation, whom I ſhall not now Name, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
the people with words to this purpoſe:
That <hi>Brand</hi> had endeavour'd ſo to ſmite the Laws
of the Goſpel, that they might retain the marks
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50388:170"/>
of the blows, that it was therefore juſt that his
Limbs ſhou'd ſmart under the ſame puniſhment;
if he that puniſh'd him were tax'd with a Crime,
that he wou'd Transfer the guilt of it on himſelf.
Therefore an Act for the future was eſtabliſh'd,
that if any Quaker refus'd to perform his task,
the Goal Keeper might not beat him above twice
a week, the firſt time giving ten ſtripes, the next
fifteen, and ſo increaſing five every diet. The
next year <hi>Criſtop. Holder,</hi> and <hi>John Copelan</hi> above
mention'd, and <hi>John Rouſie,</hi> whoſe father was (I
think) deputy-Governour of <hi>Barmuda</hi>'s, having
been here before, and driven into Exile, returned
once more, they to <hi>Dedham</hi> and he to <hi>Boston.</hi>
Theſe three in the latter <hi>Autumn</hi> not openly and
in preſence of the people, had their right Ear cut
off by the publick Hangman, but only before the
Judge that order'd it. The mild Men, by the loſs
of their ears being rather further ſoften'd than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter'd,
contain'd themſelves with ſo much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that they only broke out in words to this
purpoſe. We beg from our heart that God may
forgive 'em, who have unwarily or imprudently
caus'd this to be done; but whoe're has maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
contributed thereto, let our blood reſt upon
their heads: And let them find in that day, when
they muſt give an account of all they have done,
that it lies heavily on their head like the weight
of a Mill-ſtone. After theſe Men as well as others
had been thus inhumanely diſmembred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
they were alſo detain'd and continu'd in
Cuſtody for refuſing that ſlavery they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
to perform, and remaining unwilling to
undergo that puniſhment, which was only proper
for Thiefes and Malefactors; one trouble ſo aroſe
upon another, that they were forc'd to bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
ſufferings, and ſtripes. There was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Man whoſe Name I know not, (ſilence or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion
has buried it in darkneſs, or at leaſt it ſeems
hinder'd it to be diſclos'd) who for being a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
was branded in the hand with the Letter <hi>H.</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:50388:170"/>
to deſign him an <hi>Heretie.</hi> There are very many
inſtances of Bitterneſs and Cruelty, that were
Barbarouſly inflicted and patiently endur'd, might
be eaſily added were it fruitful to Name 'em. The
Quakers complain'd of their Enemies fury for
raging againſt 'em for no other cauſe, but coming
there without the Magiſtrates Command, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their books to thoſe that wou'd read 'em,
or talking with others concerning their Religion,
inſtructing their own Congregations and Flocks,
and ſometimes for going to the Church it ſelf,
and there ſpeaking, when ſervice was ended, or
for any thing elſe of the like nature: Since they
had never rais'd a mutiny, nor practis'd any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
or force, but were always ſimple and quiet
Men, more ready to ſuffer whate're was inflicted,
than to Act any thing turbulently or ſeditiouſly.
That yet Men of all Orders and Degrees, Politick,
Eccleſiaſtick, City, and Crowd, ſhou'd concur
and aſſemble with an Unanimous conſent, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
and drive out ſo innocent a crew, as the
Plague and Contagion of all the Countrey, cou'd
not but ſeem ſtrange to all unprejudiced.</p>
                  <p>'Twas then ſaid of them, as it's now of the
<hi>Brow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iſts,</hi> that they conſpir'd all with one mouth
and mind, by a mutual Conſent, Counſel, Aid,
and Endeavour, to ingroſs their Region and
Religion to themſelves. The Magiſtrates often
advis'd with the Miniſters, and the Miniſters in
their Meetings conſulted with the Magiſtrates, ſo
that for the moſt part there was but one aſſembly
of 'em both. Hence, what pleas'd the Magiſtrates
the Clergy approv'd of, and what the Miniſters
took upon 'em to determine, the Magiſtrates by
their Authority did confirm: And what proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from both the two never miſs'd of a grateful
wellcome from the people. But yet all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
and Rulers in chief of the Cities, and
Preachers of the word, did not ſo willingly and
equally conſent to infeſt, afflict and perſecute the
Quakers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay, ſome of 'em were not only againſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50388:171"/>
it in their Judgment, but oppos'd it by their words
as far as they cou'd. Among the Rulers againſt
perſecuting the Quakers, they place and praiſe
<hi>John Winthoepius</hi> a very great and excellent Man,
and alſo thoſe Men whoſe names are ſubjoyn'd;
among the better ſort of Citizens was <hi>William Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington,</hi>
at that time a Merchant in <hi>Boſton</hi> very
conſiderable for his wealth and prudence; who,
the Quakers teſtify, did ſo behave themſelves,
both at home and wherever they went, as thoſe
that muſt ſhortly give an account of all their
Actions done in the Body: Among the Preachers
<hi>John Cotton</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Boſton</hi> famous for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Adminiſtring his Office, and Piety in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having
himſelf towards God and Men: They own
he was always uncorrupted and untainted, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
to this ſort of Rigour and Cruelty. The
people of <hi>New England</hi> as yet wanted one piece
of ſeverity to ſuppreſs the Quakers, <hi>viz.</hi> To take
'em out of the way by Death, whom they
thought they cou'd not otherwiſe reſtrain. This
Law obtain'd in New as well as <hi>Old England,</hi> that
no Criminal ſhou'd be ſentenc'd to Death, till the
matter be duely known and conſider'd by twelve
extraordinary Inquirers whom they call Jury Men,
becauſe they are ſworn to determine nothing till
they've diligently ſearch'd, and narrowly weigh'd
the affair, as has been elſewhere ſhewn on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occaſion. Since this Law withſtood and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
the inflicting the puniſhment of Death
upon Quakers, they began to conſult and greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeavour to Abrogate this Law by an Act of
the Senate. Whereupon 12 voted that it ſhou'd
be retain'd, and 13 that it ſhou'd be reſcinded;
and thus the odd vote carry'd it. The matter
being known, one of the Senators, <hi>Wozely,</hi> eſteem'd
a quiet, juſt and equitable Man, was then unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
forc'd to be abſent, being hinder'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by a bodily indiſpoſition, taking it ill that
ſuch an Act had paſs'd ſo, knowing that if he had
been there the deſign had been fruſtrated, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50388:171"/>
to have ſaid, that had he but known that
they were conſulting and deliberating of that,
notwithſtanding the bodily ſickneſs he labour'd
under, he wou'd have crept there on his hands
and his feet, to oppoſe the Injuſtice of ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
an Act.</p>
                  <p>By this Council, the matter is brought into the
ſole power and hand of the ordinary Judges, or
the ſupream Court of the province. There was
now therefore ſo much Zeal and Eagerneſs, in
moſt of the Rulers of Cities and Provinces, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
and puiſuing the Quakers to the utmoſt,
that if any did not revile and reproach 'em, or
ſtopt and retarded the violence of others againſt
'em, eſpecially if any defended and excus'd 'em,
he was eſteem'd a Quaker himſelf, and at leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of his place and office, if he had not great
intereſt at hand. There's a Letter of one of 'em
(<hi>James Cudworth</hi>) yet extant, who was then one
of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Boſton,</hi> but for this cauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
of that honour, written at that time and
ſent from <hi>Boſton</hi> to a certain friend of his in <hi>Old
England,</hi> which Letter ſince written in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I
ſhall not here trouble the Reader with, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my ſelf to reſume ſome words of it, which
were expreſs'd to this effect. The State of
Affairs are here ſad. The Antichriſtian <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Spirit
is wedded to perſecution. Who declines to
perſecute and afflict theſe Men that differ from us
in matter of Religion, is withdrawn from his place,
and not permitted to execute any Office in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Thus</hi> Hatherly <hi>and I have been treated.
Thus they us'd me for no other reaſon, than taking
in certain Quakers to my houſe, which I did, that I
might inquire of 'em more narrowly concerning the
foundations of their perſwaſion; this I took always to be
more reaſonable, than to condemn thoſe with the blind
World, whoſe Doctrine and Principles we're utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant of,</hi> And tho I declar'd before that I
herded not with Quakers, and that I was as far
from agreeing with 'em in many things, as I was
from perſecuting 'em, yet theſe two years they've
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50388:172"/>
ſo eſtrang'd themſelves from me, that at length
they've unchair'd me from my office in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy;
what future event the Teeming womb of
ſuch furious Actions will produce, time will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
when the birth is diſclos'd, farewell. This
kind of Judging being puſh'd out of Doors, a
Law was made that if any Quakers, did irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimably
and obſtinately perſiſt, and cou'd not
be otherwiſe repreſs'd or reſtrain'd, they ſhou'd
ſuffer the deſert of their Contumacy, and end
their obſtinate life with a halter. Soon after
<hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> was try'd for his life, but in
Judgment 'twas carry'd, he ſhou'd be clear'd,
and that only by one Vote: Which deciſion one
of the Miniſters (whoſe name I again deſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceal) a Man of a Copious torrent of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Subtilty, and Eloquence, digeſted ſo hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
that publickly in the Pulpit he broke out
in thoſe words; by whom, to whom, and on
what occaſion they were utter'd, is I ſuppoſe
not unknown to the Learn'd: Becauſe thou has
let go the accurſed Man, thy life ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
anſwer for his. After this, two Quakers
were Arraign'd before the ſame Judges, <hi>William
Robbinſon</hi> a Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Marmadue
Stevenſon</hi> a Countreyman of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> in <hi>Old
England:</hi> Of their Impriſonment, Trial, and
Puniſhment, the Quakers give a large and true
account, as matters ſo clear and known in that
Countrey, that the noiſe of their fame is not yet
quite extinguiſh'd. They came both here know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
and deſignedly, for no other end than to
preach the Goſpel, to which they had apply'd
themſelves in their own Countrey before. After
<hi>Robbinſon</hi> for ſome time had continu'd at <hi>Rhodes,</hi>
and <hi>Stevenſon</hi> at <hi>Barmuda</hi>'s, in the year fifty nine
they came to <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New England.</hi> Here they
were no ſooner arriv'd, than, without either In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former
or Witneſs, upon their own betraying of
themſelves, they're thrown into the Solitary Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a Priſon; there they find <hi>Mary Dyer</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:50388:172"/>
who was Baniſh'd from <hi>Boſton,</hi> as has already
been ſaid, and yet return'd thither again, as is
ſometimes their way, and <hi>Nicholas David.</hi> Theſe
all being brought before the Judges, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
charg'd with Sedition and Rebellion, <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi>
purges himſelf and his Companions in
Miſery from the leaſt ſhaddow of that ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But they preſently diſregarding ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
ſtopt his mouth by thruſting an Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
in his throat, and ſeeing he yet endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to ſpeak, they that were preſent raging
with fury, and the officer likewiſe more haſty
than prudent, made ready his laſh, knowing well
how to uſe it, and chaſtis'd his back for his Tongues
excuſe and defence. The cauſe being conſider'd,
they were all order'd to depart thence to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
exile. By a cuſtomary patience, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of evils, they were now ſo inur'd and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd
to troubles, that they reſolv'd rather than
forſake their faith to make a Noble retreat into
their Grave. <hi>Mary Dyer</hi> and <hi>Nicho. David,</hi>
thought it then their duty to leave that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
but in a very ſhort Interval of time, <hi>Mary</hi>
being recall'd by a new impulſe, had the Courage
yet to return unto <hi>Boſton,</hi> and came to Priſon to
talk with her Brethren and Siſters, and at the
ſame time was ſeiz'd and ſhut up, ſo that now
ſhe had power and liberty enough to ſurfeit her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with their Company and Conference, for in
all things, conſtant and daily plenty nauſeats the
fancy and cloys the Appetite. On the other hand
<hi>Robbinſon</hi> and <hi>Stevenſon</hi> thought it neceſſary to
forſake <hi>Boſton,</hi> but not the whole Countrey, and
therefore within a very few days they go to ſome
places about <hi>Salem,</hi> and there takes occaſion to
declare their Doctrine. But they were no better
dealt with than others. When they, for ſome
time, had been thus inclos'd within the verge of
thoſe little Walls, the Judges began to conſult
among themſelves what they muſt needs do with
'em at length. And ſeeing 'em ſo obdur'd in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50388:173"/>
their obſtinacy, that they deſpair'd of reducing
'em to dread of fear, and that they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
what way they took, if they cou'd but
render themſelves Maſters of their deſires, they
reſolv'd to put an end to their life and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Yet this was not ſo obſcurely contriv'd, but
<hi>Robbinſon</hi> and <hi>Stevenſon</hi> eaſily forſeeing what the
Judges had deſigned to do, the day before they
had fix'd this purpoſe, each of 'em wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Senate of <hi>Boſton,</hi> whoſe Theme and
Scope was almoſt the ſame, containing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
that induc'd 'em both, to come and viſit
theſe Corners of the Earth; <hi>Robbinſon</hi> wrote that
he did not come there to gratify at all his own
Curioſity, but only by the Judgment and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of God, while he abode at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and about
noon tide, when he was reſolving to go elſewhere,
an heavenly Command revers'd his Reſolution,
injoyning him to take Journey for <hi>Boſton,</hi> and there
to finiſh his Courſe and lay down his life, and
have no worſe reward for his ſervice, than what
God had there appointed for him: That his Soul
at laſt, after many wandrings through the vain
<hi>Theatre</hi> of this weariſom world, might be receiv'd
to a fix'd poſſeſſion, and there reſt in an Eternal
Manſion. <hi>Stevenſon</hi> alſo wrote, that while he
was in his Countrey in <hi>England,</hi> in his own Farm
Plowing a field, upon a certain day he felt his
Breaſt kindled with the flame of Divine Love,
and the word of the Lord came unto him thus;
I've appointed thee tho thou be a Plowman to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Preacher and Teacher of Nations: At the
ſame moment being mov'd Extraordinarily, that
tho he was married, and Father of ſome Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to leave his dear wife, his Mate and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of Life and Affairs, and as it were his
other ſelf, and this ſweet and tender off-ſpring,
theſe intire Bonds of Love, and Ties of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
being untouch'd with the ſenſe of ſo many
Domeſtick concerns, to take Journey preſently
for the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Barmuda</hi>'s not doubting to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50388:173"/>
leave all to the Providential care and Diſpoſal of
God: And that accordingly he went to that
<hi>Iſland</hi> and from thence to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and at length
came to <hi>Boſton;</hi> and that now for his Religion,
and Teſtimony for God, he was ready to take
farewell of this troubleſom Life. The day of
Arraignment was the 20th of <hi>October.</hi> Being all
three brought into Priſon, attainted and convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of a Capital crime, without any previous Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
or defence, they were found guilty of Death,
and Sentenc'd to be hang'd. <hi>Robbinſon</hi> mov'd
the Judge of the Court that, that Letter might
be read I ſpoke of before, aſſerting it to all be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact, without inquiring into the occaſion
thereof; this he deſir'd e're ſentence ſhou'd paſs, but
the Judge thought the letter unworthy to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd.
Whereupon <hi>Stevenſon,</hi> putting up his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
after the ſentence was actually pronounc'd,
anſwer'd with the ſame courage of mind and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
In the day when you that wou'd be
reckon'd Judges, ſhall kill the true Servants of
God, know ye, you ſhall anſwer to him who is
the only true Judge, and the day of your viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhall come upon you, and Eternal deſtuction
ſhall fall on your heads. Upon the 27th in the
Afternoon, the day appointed for their Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
two Companies of Souldiers were order'd to
be there. The condemn'd perſons were plac'd in
the front, and all the Drummers were ſet round
about 'em, who beat inceſſantly to drown the
ſound of their words, that what they ſaid might
not be heard by the people. The fellow ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
march'd all in a rank, <hi>Mary</hi> in the middle
having each other by the hand, all of a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Countenance and ready Tongue, tho the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Drums rendred their diſcourſe uſeleſs
to others. Their friends follow'd with a ſad ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
When they came to the <hi>Gibbet,</hi> having ſo
long kiſs'd and embrac'd each other, with ſuch
affection that they cou'd ſcarce be pull'd aſunder,
they wiſh'd all happineſs to one another; at laſt,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50388:174"/>
when the unavoidable neceſſity of departure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd
'em to put an end to their careſſes, letting
one another unwillingly go, they took all their
Eternal and Mutual farewell, <hi>Robbinſon</hi> firſt got
up, beginning and ending with words to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>We are not here, Citizens, to ſuffer as wicked or
evil doers, whoſe Conſciences before did vex and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
'em, but as thoſe, who, being ſtirr'd up by God,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ear witneſs to the truth. But perhaps this may
ſeem little at preſent, as what concerns you not much
to hear. That we may not therefore contend what
we have acted, to have been Lawful, our duty, and
neceſſary to be done; we wou'd have you to know
that this is your day, wherein God has viſited you,
leaving you yet occaſion and opportunity to ſhun and
eſcape the deſtruction of your Souls; but if you go
on to hedge up and obſtruct that way to turn Gods
wrath, and procure your own ſalvation, if your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
and Arrogance be increas'd and harden'd,
this is the day, wherein God is ariſen to take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of all his Enemies with an Omnipotent Arm,
and you ſhall groan with one voice under the weight
of his wrath. You've at this time made it very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
and manifeſt what you are, by your hatred
againſt us; wherefore while the light of Chriſt doth
ſhine, we as yet continue to admoniſh and warn you,
to take heed to that light while you may. For my
part I have liv'd unto Chriſt, and do die for Chriſt,
taking him now for my Life and My all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then</hi> Stevenſon <hi>follow'd ſpeaking ſuch like
words; Be</hi> it known unto you, we ſuffer not now for any
Evil by us Committed, but only for doing of theſe good
de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ds which our Conſcience always taught us to be
our Duty: And as your Conſciences in the day that's to
came, ſhall toſs and terrify you with perpetual Anguiſh,
ſo we being this day releas'd from all care, ſhall reſt
free from Anxiety and trouble, and inſtead of that
frail and fading Life, ſhall have unceaſing and
perfect happineſs with God. With theſe words he
ended. <hi>Theſe two Men being dead, their naked
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50388:174"/>
bodies were thrown into a Ditch, and cover'd up
by the way ſide, where they ended their Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now <hi>Mary</hi> goes up the Ladder with her
hands bound, her Coats ty'd down, and face co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
in preſent readineſs, to wellcome her end,
being already foreſtall'd with apprehenſions of
Death. But the Judges, among themſelves, had
granted <hi>Mary</hi> a pardon, being humbly petition'd
by a Son of hers. This was only deſign'd to
terrify and affright her, but being taken down,
and greatly in ſuſpenſe, looking up to underſtand
what the matter did mean, at laſt, before ſhe
went down from the Ladder, with a deep ſigh
ſhe broke out in theſe words, that there was no
delay in her to go with her Brethren, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that certain fruit of her Labours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of all her Dangers and Evils, as the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Trophies of her Courage and Conſtancy,
that ſhe might alſo imbalm her Religion with
her blood, if the Rulers wou'd not annull that
wicked Law. When taken away from the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſhe was firſt ſhut up in the place whence ſhe
came, and two days after carry'd out of the
Town. When this was done it can't eaſily be
told, how the Quakers minds, and mouths were
Irritated, both here and in other places: So that
every where their doleful Mournings and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
were heard; that now theſe Mens
thoughts and Deſigns did ſhew themſelves, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no further room for doubt, who were theſe
pure and upright in Life, who at all times did
ſo cry out, that there was no living without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and no Religion without Godlineſs, and
neither cou'd be without Liberty of Conſcience;
who therefore in their own Countrey, in <hi>England,</hi>
did ſo decry that violent Tyranny, and becauſe
of the injury done to them there, fled from it
as a thing not ſufferable, and leaving their own
native Soul, came into this utmoſt Region of
the Earth, ſurrounded on all hands with Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Nations. That this was ſo plain, that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50388:175"/>
they muſt be inconſiderate who doubt of it,
ſince they behav'd themſelves ſo to their own
Countreymen, and thoſe who, when under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
and trouble, had fled unto them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
and comfort, but met with nothing among
them but the utmoſt cruelty: That it further
appear'd, from the Savage fierceneſs they us'd
towards Men, that were altogether innocent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaving
'em not only of their Goods and Eſtates,
but even of their Reputation, Blood, Bones, and
Life it ſelf. There were not a few Complaints
of others alſo, who were not at all of the family
of the Quakers, who ſpoke their Abhorrence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that new ſort of Judgment, that was hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
among Proteſtants unheard of, thinking it
unreaſonable thus to rage 'gainſt thoſe whom
they reckon'd juſt, honeſt and blameleſs, or at
leaſt to be guilty of inconſiderable faults, or had
they deſerv'd ſome notable puniſhment, yet they
thought it Diſgraceful for themſelves to be the
Authors of inflicting it. Theſe and the like were
ſome matter of trouble to the Magiſtracy of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>
who cou'd as little deny the cauſe as what
they had acted; that they might, againſt all
Complaints and Calumnies, ſhield the fame of
their Name and Religion, and if any thing of
the like nature ſhou'd happen for the future,
more excuſably repeat what they had already
done, and ſeize them that ſaid any thing to the
contrary, they caus'd this Apologetical Pamphlet
to be emitted in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by their own Clerk <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Rawſon.</hi> 
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Tho the equity of our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with <hi>William Robbinſon, Marmaduc Steven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
and <hi>Mary Dyer,</hi> being fortify'd by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of our Court, and according to the
Laws both of Cod and our Countrey, do's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
us rather reaſonably to expect Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and Praiſe from all good and wiſe Men,
than diſpoſe us to think it at all neceſſary, to
make any Defence and Apology for our ſelves;
Notwithſtanding, becauſe ſome of a ſhallow
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50388:175"/>
Capacity, from perhaps a Principle of Pity and
Compaſſion (which as it is indeed a Chriſtian
vertue, ſo it's juſtly intitl'd to deſerved praiſe,
except where it too eaſily turns it ſelf, putting
on falſe and pernicious dreſſes, for want of a
Judgment better inform'd) are deſirous of ſome
ſatisfaction in the matter, and becauſe thoſe
Men that are of ill principles and practices may
unjuſtly accuſe us, and take us for Men of very
Bloody and cruel Inclinations; we therefore
thought fit, to ſatisfy the one, and ſtop the
Mouths and Clamours of the others, to order
the publiſhing of this Declaration. 'Tis almoſt
three years ſince ſome Men, who profeſs'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
openly Quakers after we underſtood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inform'd by Letters, ſent us from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
by the way of <hi>Berbado</hi>'s, how pernicious
their opinions and endeavours had been, took
the boldneſs alſo to come unto <hi>Boſton.</hi> We
only then committed them to Priſon, till we
cou'd find occaſion to ſend 'em from among us,
without uſing any further ſeverity againſt 'em.</p>
                     <p>And tho their diſcipline and turbulent beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
troubleſome to the people and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Magiſtrate, call'd loudly for a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
puniſhment, without the leaſt ſhadow of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
yet the Court was rather willing to
ſhew their prudence, in preſerving and
defend-ing our own peace, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
that was eſtabliſh'd among us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Quakers utmoſt efforts, who aim'd
at the ſubverſion of our Laws and Statutes,
and final overthrow of our Religion alſo: This
we're too well acquainted with to be ignorant
of, both by what our experience taught us of
them, and what Specimens their Anceſtors the
Papiſts have left us. We therefore made and
promulg'd a Law, that no Maſter of a Ship
whatſoever ſhou'd bring a Quaker into our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts
and Territories, if they did otherwiſe,
they were to be Impriſoned untill they cou'd be
baniſh'd and remov'd from among us. But
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50388:176"/>
ſince yet, theſe Men did conſtantly return through
many ſecret ways and wandrings, neither cou'd
any puniſhment or threatning be invented to
ſtop their impudent and raſh coming back, tho
we endeavour'd to prevent it by increaſing the
puniſhment to the cutting off the returner's ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
yet that it ſelf did not avail to withſtand their
mad and unweary'd fury; we were therefore
forc'd to take another courſe to maintain the
publick Peace and Tranquillity. Upon this all
things being duly conſider'd, finding their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
cou'd not otherwiſe be reſtrain'd, we made a
Law according to the Model of that which was
ſettled in <hi>England</hi> againſt the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that ſuch
ſort of Men ſhou'd be put to Death.</p>
                     <p>The making this Law did not hinder their
return and diſdainful continuance within our
Territories, even after the time for their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was expir'd; They were therefore juſtly
thrown into Goal, and confeſſing themſelves to
be thoſe we had driven from among us before
by the Court's order, according to the ſentence of
that Law, they forfeited their Life: except <hi>Mary
Dyer,</hi> to whom, at her Sons humble interceſſion,
We, with an equality of Mercy and Clemency,
granted the Liberty to be gone from among us
within two days, which ſhe promis'd to obſerve.
The Contemplation of that gradual progreſs
we made, in the whole ſeries of that affair, will
confute all Clamours and Accuſations of our cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty;
ſince our own juſt and neceſſary defence
did not only invite but alſo injoyn us, to ſhow
the edge of ſo ſharp a Law to Men of ſuch ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and obſtinacy, which as theſe Men oppoſed
with Contumacious violence, they freely and
willingly murder'd themſelves. It was always
our wiſh that they had not done it, and that
the ſupream Law, the peoples ſafety, might be
kept intire from all danger and detriment. Our
Antodating their danger that was to enſue, and
granting of pardon to <hi>Mary Dyer</hi> are evident
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50388:176"/>
Demonſtrations, that we were more deſirous to
preſerve their lives than take 'em away. </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Moreover
tho ſo great puniſhment was provided againſt
Quakers by Law, eſpecially thoſe, who, being eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
did return, yet there were not a few ſo raſh as
to come, not only thoſe who had not been here
before, but alſo who had been expell'd and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſh'd,
ready to ſuffer any torment that cou'd hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
yea, to welcome death it ſelf tho never ſo
cruel. A chief inſtance of boldneſs and obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
was very Conſpicuous in the ſame <hi>Mary Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
who, as it was known, tho ſhe was on the
Ladder, and her neck in the Rope, upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Borders of her laſt breath: Yet, after ſhe had
been once expell'd ſhe return'd, and yet was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd
on this Condition, that ſhe wou'd no more
repeat the ſame crime; Notwithſtanding all this
ſhe return'd once more, perſiſting in the ſame
purpoſe and mind, that ſhe muſt either have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
for her ſelf and Companions (that Law of
ejecting and murdering Quakers being Abrogated)
to reſt in eaſe ſafely and quietly, or if ſhe cou'd not
obtain it, ſhe wou'd ſeal with her Death her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
confidence in her Religion, and thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
the wickedneſs and inſatiable cruelty of theſe
Judges, and convince them, in the preſence
of all Men, to be guilty of doing the higheſt of
Injuries. She came therefore undaunted from
<hi>Rhodes</hi> to <hi>Boſton,</hi> in the year following which was
the 60th the 31 day of the month of <hi>May.</hi> She
was ſeiz'd, and immediately the next day brought
before the Judge, the Court being throng; who,
having told what charge had been formerly given
her, as the ſame time gave ſentence of Death,
that to morrow ſhe ſhou'd be hang'd by the neck
till ſhe dy'd, that they might make ſure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
her return for the future, and give her no
more occaſion to be guilty of the like. The next
day, accordingly ſhe's taken out of the Town,
guarded with Souldiers before and behind, with
their Drums beating round about her; ſhe came
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50388:177"/>
to the Gibbet with Courage in her Breaſt, and
very great Chearfulneſs in her face, from whence
ſhe knew ſhe ſhou'd not return any more; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there ſpoken a great many words, that ſhow'd
both the greatneſs of her mind and certain hope
ſhe had placed in Heaven, ſhe gave up her Spirit
and ſo fell aſleep. The Quakers, that either
knew this Woman, or had it from others Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of her, ſay in her praiſe, that ſhe was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of no mean Extract and Parentage, of an
Eſtate pretty plentiful, of a comely Stature and
Countenance, of a piercing knowledge in many
things, of a wonderful ſweet and pleaſant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
ſo ſit for great affairs that ſhe wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was Manly, except only the Name and
the Sex. <hi>William Leadre</hi> was another inſtance
of ſuch conſtancy. He being alſo upon pain of
Death ejected, and forbidden to ſee <hi>Boſton</hi> again,
as I ſhow'd before, notwithſtanding, the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<hi>viz.</hi> ſixty two, return'd thither prepar'd to
expect and endure the ſame that theſe who had
gone before had already ſuffer'd, to offer his
Blood for his Religion to thoſe, who, he knew,
were thirſty enough to drink it. When the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of his arrival was ſpread abroad, and had
alſo reach'd the Ears of the Judges, they order'd
the Man, that thus contemn'd all threats of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
puniſhment, to be ſeiz'd and hurried head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Goal, and all the cold ſeaſon of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be kept, in great hunger and want, faſten'd
to a thick and heavy log, ſo that he ſcarce cou'd
move himſelf out of his place, being only as a
dead trunk of a Man. Having at length conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
what to do with him, they accus'd him
heinouſly for daring to return; he anſwer'd as
the cauſe of expelling him was injuſt, he thought
he had juſt occaſion to return: They ſet the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his life before him, becauſe neither threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
nor fear cou'd reſtrain him. He anſwer'd,
that were he ſo eaſily to be frighted, he would
never have had the boldneſs again to return. Being
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50388:177"/>
ask'd at another time if he would go into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he anſwer'd he had no buſineſs there, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
they endeavour'd earneſtly to perſwade him
to renounce his Errors and Conform to the Church
of <hi>England;</hi> He reply'd then with greater vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
that if he own'd his own confeſſion to be
falſe he muſt deny and reject God himſelf, If he
ſhould herd with thoſe of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
Communion, he muſt joyn with Notorious
Murderers and Cut-Throats. They again threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him with an Infamous. Death; to which he
anſwer'd, he would Everlaſtingly rejoyce to ſuffer
any thing for his Faith and Religion, and that he
was not at all afraid of Death, ſo much as of the
juſt Judgment of God, yea, that he would not
decline any ſort of Death, ſince the juſt cauſe
why he ſuffer'd it was abſent; and that that pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment
they blazon'd with the threatning Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of Death, ſeem'd to him the way of Life
and Eternal felicity, ſo this diſcourſe was not
long continued: But while they th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s lingred,
doubting what to do, and could not come to a
certain Concluſion, other Quakers, to the Number
of five, who had all been baniſh'd, and prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to return, upon the ſame penalty of loſing
their Life, did yet without prudence or fear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
Whereof one <hi>Wenlock Chriſtyſon,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
what they deſign'd to determine of <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
went ſtraight way to the Court, and told 'em
that it was his ſole errand to come to warn 'em,
to ſhed no more Innocent blood: But his admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
was no worſe rewarded than with a Goal.
Moſt of 'em at this time was ſo forcibly incens'd,
that they could be broken by no Violence or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
thinking then themſelves to be truly
happy, when they were counted worthy to ſuffer
Affliction for their Religion, yea, Death tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo Ignominious and Cruel, hence it comes
that each Sect has its Martyrs. This they alſo
ambition'd as a holy ſight, running to embrace
Death as the Crown of their Religion, ſign of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50388:178"/>
faith, Mark of Society, witneſs of Communion,
Monument of their Name, matter of perpetual
fame, and not only end of this Temporary life,
but alſo beginning of that which is Eternal.
Thus the Senate of <hi>Boſton,</hi> after many debates,
being unwilling to conclude of <hi>Leaders</hi> affair,
regarding the Actions, not the words, of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
at length order'd him to be Indicted of
Treaſon, and pronounc'd him a Man whom they
Judg'd and Declar'd to deſerve to be ſever'd,
from among the Number of the Living, which
ſentence was accordingly executed upon the 14th
day of <hi>March,</hi> Then his head was lifted up on
high on an unhappy Gibbet, and he ended his
life without any fear, having ſpoken theſe words
before ſome friends, <hi>my God to thee I commend my juſt
Soul.</hi> After him the Court's firſt enquiry was on
<hi>Wenlock,</hi> who ſeem'd to them to have drawn all
ſeverity on himſelf. When no body doubted but
<hi>Wenlock</hi> wou'd fall a <hi>victim</hi> to appeaſe the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
fury, when he came to be tryed he diſputed
long, and the Judges differ'd in their Thoughts
and Intentions, whereupon <hi>Wenlock</hi> did ſo much
urge the Equity and Juſtice of diſcuſſing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
according to the Rules of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws,
arguing that thoſe Laws were only made againſt
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> and not <hi>Quakers,</hi> who might very juſtly
expect Impunity altho they err'd in the ſight of
Men: The Judges were at length ſo Inveigl'd and
Entangled, that they return'd to the old form of
proceeding, and committed the whole weight of
the cauſe to the Judgment of twelve Sworn <hi>Jury-Men:</hi>
But they alſo, having long delay'd <hi>Wenlock,</hi>
at length brought him in guilty of Death: This
was done on the 13th day of the 1ſt month of
the Summer Seaſon; but the Execution of the
ſentence was ſome days delay'd. <hi>John Currier</hi> an
inhabitant of <hi>Boſton,</hi> having been whipt through
three Towns before, return'd by the ſame places,
to <hi>Boſton,</hi> to his Wife and Children, whom he had
left there; being again whipt about the ſame
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50388:178"/>
round, he was detain'd in Priſon at <hi>Boſton,</hi> where
he had reſid'd; In the opinion of himſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men, he was to be branded with a burning
Iron in the ſhoulder, and there mark'd with the
Letter <hi>R.</hi> to deſign him, according to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, that which we call a Rogue.</p>
                  <p>There were 28 more Priſoners there, One of
'em condemn'd for all his life to remain in the
Priſon where he then was; the reſt were uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
what ſhou'd become of 'em, ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
daily detain'd and delay'd. As many things
unexpected and unlook'd for, in the life of Man
falls oftner out than when we have hopes and
expectations of the matter, ſo while the Judges
were ſo often remiſs, and the Quakers puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo frequently delay'd, and yet nothing was
ſeen, to retard it, ſuddenly and beyond all Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
it was appointed by the Magiſtrates Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that a new Law ſhou'd immediately take
place, to releaſe <hi>Wenlock</hi> and the reſt of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
from any puniſhment they were liable to,
by the old; ſo that they might when they pleas'd
be free'd from the Priſon, and for that purpoſe
the doors were ſet open. The ſignal being given,
they went out without Loitering. Only <hi>Peter
Pearſon</hi> and <hi>Judith Brown,</hi> were contrary to their
hopes detain'd and whipt at a Cart. The cauſe
of ſo unexpected a change was ſuppos'd to be the
fear of the Magiſtrates, foreſeeing that the King
and Nobles in <hi>Old England,</hi> wou'd not well reſent
ſuch Rigour and Cruelty, and wou'd therefore
take care to prevent it for the future. Not
long after King <hi>Charles</hi> being inform'd, how
the Quakers were treated in <hi>New-England,</hi> by
Rumors, Meſſengers, and their own complaints
given in by Petition to the King and Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
and that not only once but often, ſent
immediately to the Governour of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and the
reſt of the fellow rulers of theſe Countreys and
Colonies, a Letter concerning the Impriſon'd
Quakers, giving it to be carried by <hi>Sam. Sattoc,</hi> a
Quaker who had been an Inhabitant there, but
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50388:179"/>
was thence baniſh'd as I mention'd already, and
now return'd there in a Ship commanded by one
of his own perſwaſion. The Letter was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
<hi>C. R.</hi> to his dear and faithful Subjects, ſince
we've Learn'd that many of our Subjects, among
you call'd Quakers to have been ſome Impriſon'd,
others kill'd, the reſt, as we're told remaining fall
in danger; we thought good to ſignify our will
and pleaſure to you concerning that affair for the
future. Our will is therefore, that if there be
any Quakers among you, whoſe Death Corporal
puniſhment, or Impriſonment, you have order'd,
or may for the future have occaſion to determine,
that you proceed no further in that affair, but
forthwith ſend 'em whether they be Condemn'd,
or bound, into our Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> with an
account of their particular Tryals and Faults,
that they may here be dealt withal according to
our Laws and their Merits. Herein this letter
ſhall be your warrant. Given from our Court at
<hi>VVhitehall,</hi> the 10th of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1661, the 13th year
of our Reign. By the Kings command, <hi>William
Morris.</hi> This Epiſtle of the King ſo ſtay'd their
Perſecution, that it was no Crime to be reckon'd a
Quaker. The Magiſtracy of <hi>Boston</hi> fearing the
Kings diſpleaſure for what they had done, ſent
three into <hi>Old England, Temple</hi> an Officer, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
and <hi>Norton</hi> a Miniſter, to acquaint the
King with what they had done. But Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Judgment was not therefore wholly ſtopt
or taken away. But being forbidden to inflict a
final ſeverity and puniſhment, they compens'd it
by the heavier Temporary torment, making ſome,
by their Chaſtiſement, rather wiſh to die than
endure ſo great and many Evils ſo often. Tho I
cou'd inſtance many examples of this, I'll only
relate one or two, partly to avoid Prolixity, and
partly becauſe by one we may gueſs of the reſt.
That year <hi>Ann Cotton,</hi> a woman of ſixty, came
with a deſign to live at <hi>Boſton;</hi> but was ſo far
from being admitted that ſhe was thrown into
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50388:179"/>
Goal: Being at length wearied of her, they took
her to a Wood, and after many wandrings ſhe
found occaſion to go for <hi>England.</hi> There ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a pattent from the K. allowing her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
at <hi>Boſton.</hi> She renew'd her Journey, and
came boldly back to <hi>Boſton.</hi> But neither was ſhe
then admitted: She went therefore to <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
where ſhe was thrown into a dark Deu, thrice
laſh'd, then carry'd to a Remote and Deſolate
place, where, from wild Beaſts, ſhe might be in
daily danger of her life. But returning by the
ſame ways ſhe went out ſhe was alſo whipt, as
ſhe had been before. The following year being
ſcarce expir'd, <hi>Ann Coleman, Mary Tomkins,</hi> and
<hi>Alide Ambroſe,</hi> women of greater Age than Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
came into <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ver:</hi> Theſe were dragg'd hence
through Eleven other places, in the middle of a
Cold and Snowy Winter, receiving at each of 'em
ten laſhes on their naked body, and were ſo cut
with the ſtripes that ſcarce a Breaſt was left 'em.
Yet they remain'd ſo conſtant and reſolute, that
they went back to the ſame Town to a Meeting
with their friends. Upon this 2 Brethren call'd
<hi>Ruperts,</hi> Sons of a Quaker dragg'd the women
out of the Meeting through the Snow and Clay,
turning their very faces to the Earth, and the
day following brought 'em thus daub'd along to
the ſhore, remaining unmov'd at all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
drew them headlong through the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
into a little <hi>Cannoe,</hi> committing them and
it to the Sea. But a vehement ſtorm ſuddenly
riſing the poor women were taken out of the
Boat, by ſome that had more tenderneſs than
they that put them in. Tho they now were
ſtiff, their Cloaths being frozen and almoſt dead
with intolerable cold, they bring 'em far from
the Sea to the houſe whence they came, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little refreſhment drive them away from
thence. Yet the women were ſo hardy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur'd
to Afflictions, that they often return'd even
where they ſuffer'd ſuch things. The Quakers
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50388:180"/>
complain that many of 'em were branded, as
if they had been the Dreggs, and Off-ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Men, whom all good Men muſt needs
be Enemies to, and on that ſcore were rob'd
of all Liberty and Privilege, as Ignominious
perſons who're allow'd no Action or Complaint:
Yet, they ſay, there were ſome for many years,
who had their habitation and reſidence there.
In proceſs of time the Kings Authority, who
knew not their trouble, more and more prevail'd,
and their Number, Reſolution, and Conſtancy,
in overcoming by ſuffering, all puniſhments the
Law cou'd inflict; the Judgments againſt 'em
began to ceaſe, and their Impunity and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to increaſe. In the mean time the Quakers,
that cou'd not ſtay here, withdrew themſelves
to the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> which is ſo oppoſite
to, and ſeparated from the Continent that it
became a refuge and ſanctuary for them. And
the more ſuited to this purpoſe becauſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
thereof was a Quaker, <hi>William Codding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
whom I mention'd before: He was one of the
chief Planters, that came hither to traffick. He
had a houſe ſo large and fine at <hi>Boſton,</hi> before it
had receiv'd that Name, that afterward it prov'd
an Ornament to the City. He alſo ſhar'd in the
Magiſtracy ſome time. But when the perſecution
of Quakers aroſe, he diſapprov'd of the Magiſtrates
proceedings ſo much, that he exhorted 'em all
to refrain from their Cruelty againſt the Quakers;
they therefore treated him as they wou'd have
done them: He departed thence into this <hi>Iſland,</hi>
where he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had not only liberty to act and ſay what
he pleas'd, but was alſo made Governour of the
whole <hi>Iſland.</hi> But before I altogether leave <hi>New
England,</hi> I muſt touch at <hi>New-Holland</hi> bordering
upon it, leſt a longer narrative prove troubleſome
to the Reader. <hi>Dutchman</hi> for the moſt part were
Inhabitants there. In trafficking, the <hi>Dutch</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commerce with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they came and
ſtay'd mutually with each other, thus ſome of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50388:180"/>
the Quakers found the way alſo hither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more
with a deſign to Propagate their Religion, than
a deſire either of buying or ſelling. 'Tis a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
among the States, not to be Solicitous of theſe
whom they give command of other places to,
concerning Mens following believing, or aſſerting
in their Religion whatever their Conſcience
prompts 'em unto, providing they don't oppoſe
the ſupream Authority, or act contrary to the
publick Tranquillity. At this rate the Rulers of
that Countrey behav'd themſelves, maintaining
their Dignity 'mongſt Quakers and others, and
preſerving the publick peace committed to their
Charge. Of this moderation theſe are 2 inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The chief City in <hi>New-Holland</hi> is call'd
<hi>New-Amſterdam,</hi> from the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi>
of the ſame Name: Two Mile from hence is a
Village call'd <hi>Hemſteed.</hi> This Village was a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory
of our Colony, but for the moſt part peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl'd
with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inhabitants; of thoſe a few,
that formerly were <hi>Brownists</hi> (or puritans) fell off
from their own party to the Quakers, having
their Meetings and Religious exerciſes together.
And theſe things ſo long as Cantiouſly and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
done, our Magiſtrates did not ſo much
take notice of or puniſh, as they did, when
they did not uſe ſo much Moderation and Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and we find too much liberty would tend to
the ſeduction of others. An inſtance of this for
a Tenour to others, was ſhewn in one <hi>Rob. Hodſon,</hi>
who was arriv'd at ſuch a pitch of boldneſs, as he
induc'd ſeveral of his own Sect to meet together,
for ſolemn prayers, not ſecretly, but abroad in
an open Garden: The news therefore of this ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
an aſſembly being brought to thoſe, who,
had it not been for this raſh and provoking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
of theirs, would eaſily have let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
they all ran in upon them, and taking <hi>Hod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
upon whom beſides a Bible in his hand, they
found a <hi>Dagger</hi> in his Boſom, and ſince
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50388:181"/>
that ſeem'd to be a Weapon more ſit for Offence
than Defence, they ty'd his hands and carried him
to <hi>New-Amſterdam</hi> to the Governour <hi>Stuyveſand.</hi>
He, taking the Man for a Contemner of the Laws
and Diſturber of the publick Peace, caus'd him
to be caſt into a dark place full of Filth and Dirt;
and ſoon after Arraigns him for ſedition, and, by
the ſuffrages of all the Magiſtrates, pronounces
ſentence upon him in <hi>Dutch;</hi> (which becauſe he
did not underſtand, one Tranſlated it to him into
<hi>Engliſh</hi>) that either he ſhould pay a fine of 600
Florens, or be cloth'd in Sackcloth and Chain'd,
and ty'd with a Barbarous ſlave ſhould work for
two years upon the Reparations of the City
Walls. Which work when he was brought to,
and refus'd to do, a luſty crabbed <hi>Negro</hi> ſlave laid
on him 50 laſhes with a Cat with nine Tailes;
and when for all that he would not ſet himſelf to
work, he redoubled his blows, and that to ſuch a
Degree as he was not able to ſtand on his Legs.
And becauſe all this while he would not do as he
was Commanded, at laſt the Governour order'd
him this puniſhment: They ſtript him naked to
the waſte, and then hanged him up by the hands
and ty'd a great Logg of Wood to his feet, and
beat him ſeverely with whips, and ſo carry'd him
from the Court to the Priſon from whence he
came. The ſame they ſerv'd him 2 years after.
With theſe ſtripes the poor Man was ſo diſabled,
that he lay along while without ſenſe, and almoſt
without life, ſo that there had been ſmall hopes of
his ever recovering; if an <hi>Engliſh</hi> woman mov'd
with a pious grief and pity had not Adminiſtred
proper Medicines to him, and binding up his
Wounds, reſtor'd him to life again. At laſt the
Governours Siſter ſo pleaded his cauſe with her
Brother, as procur'd his Enlargement from his
diſmal Solitude. This was about the time, that
the Perſecution againſt theſe people began to rage
in <hi>New-England.</hi> Another Town in the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
belonging indeed to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but under
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50388:181"/>
the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Hollandew,</hi> was <hi>Graveſend.</hi>
And there a Noble Lady the. <hi>Counteſs</hi> of <hi>Mordee;</hi>
who was a Puritan was turn'd Quaker, and reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
chiefly at this place, gave the remaining peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of this Society the liberty of Meeting in her
houſe; but mannaged it with that prudence and
obſervance of time and place, as gave no offence
to any ſtranger or perſon of another Religion than
her own, and ſo ſhe and her people remained free
from all Moleſtation and Diſturbance. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we have made mention of this Lady and her
Company in this place; I'll relate a memorable
ſtory. There was the Son of certain <hi>Engliſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman,</hi>
arriv'd at years of Diſcretion, and of very
honeſt Converſation: Who being often in the
houſe of this Lady, and Entertaining her many
times with diſcourſes upon Religious Subjects, ſhe
invites him to come to their Meeting and hear
their Preaching, at leaſt for once. He anſwer'd
her again and again (for ſhe was very earneſt with
him) that he ſhould be always very ready to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
her Ladyſhip in any other thing, but in this
humbly begg'd her Ladyſhips excuſe. This young
Gentlewoman continuing obſtinate, and the Lady
by how much more ſhe perſiſted in the thing, by
ſo much the greater was the grief of her Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
at laſt he did that of his own accord,
which he neither would or could upon her Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Intreaties. He fancied to himſelf one
night in his ſleep, that he heard and ſaw many
things of the Quakers, and when he was awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and thought nothing had put a deceit upon
his ſenſes, he heard as it were a voice, and went
and came to a Company of thoſe ſort of people,
of whom he had form'd in his mind ſo many
repreſentations when he was aſleep. He, approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Oraculous Dream, the day following
goes to a Meeting of the Quakers, where he was
ſo taken with their Diſcourſes, that he was Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
beyond himſelf. And his mind was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
running on going thither again. But
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50388:182"/>
before he did, he Communicates his Intention to
ſeveral of his Friends, who mightily dehorted
him therefrom. Conſidering therefore their reaſons
on the one hand, and on the other the Continual
<hi>Idea</hi> of his Night Viſion never going out of
his mind; and that not deviſed, or fancied, but real
diſcourſe of theirs, was always turmoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing him,
ſo that with the horrible Agonies of his mind,
not knowing which way to turn, or what to do,
he fell into a greivous and dangerous fit of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
From which being recover'd, he not onely
Eſtranged himſelf wholly from that ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but alſo imputed what had happen'd to him
among that people, to the Effects of Incantation,
and ſaid, the Devil wrought amongſt them. Of
the truth of this I have a very worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
a witneſs, who is now a faithful Miniſter of
the Word of God in our Countrey; to whom
the young Man has often related this ſtory.
Sometimes there has been of theſe ſort of People,
who before a Magiſtrate have ſaid, they could not
ſay or do any thing with them, without their
hats on. Theſe there was no better way to deal
with than by ſeverely reprimanding them, and
ſending them away unheard, and ſoundly rated
at. There were ſome women which in the high
ways, others, tho but few, who in the middle of
the Sermon or Prayers of our people, would break
out either into an <hi>Extempore</hi> or <hi>Praemiditated</hi>
Noiſe or Singing. Theſe Women were Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or Compelled to go away, or carried away
and taken into Cuſtody till they were diſcharged.
And ſo, if their crime was no greater, they were
no further puniſh'd. Now to ſpeak a little of
the other Plantations of the <hi>Engliſh, Virginia,
Bermudas,</hi> &amp;c. I have ſaid already in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
who they were that firſt Voyaged hither;
but who they were that (firſt) went to thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
I can't ſo certainly tell. It ſeems <hi>George Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
came to <hi>Virginia</hi> in the year 56, and there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>s. Henry Fell</hi> went to <hi>Barmudas</hi> the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50388:182"/>
ſame year, and not long after return'd again. In
thoſe parts alſo the Religion of the Quakers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to appear abroad ſenſibly, and ſhew its face. As
for theſe Men till the year 60, I don't find any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
inflicted on them, only ſome Fines were
laid upon them, becauſe they us'd to entertain
one another in their houſes, or refus'd to take an
Oath, or be uncover'd before a Magiſtrate, or to
undertake any Military Services: Altho theſe fines
were often ſo great, that even for one default
onely, the third part or more of their goods were
taken away, they not having much Money, as
the generality of them were of the meaner ſort of
people. This I find, that in <hi>Mariland,</hi> a province
joyning to <hi>Virginia,</hi> this year, <hi>Thomas Thurſton</hi> was
caſt into Priſon, and the Officer deſiring one <hi>John
Holland</hi> to aſſiſt him in this buſineſs, who refuſing
(and ſaying it was unreaſonable <hi>Thurſton</hi> ſhould
be us'd ſo, and that he could not aſſiſt him in
the taking of a Man Priſoner, who was his Friend
and old Acquaintance) to be any ways aſſiſtant
to the ſaid Office (which the Laws of <hi>England</hi>
will no ways excuſe not even among thoſe, that
are of the firſt Degree and Quality) he himſelf
was put in Priſon too, and afterwards ſeverely
whipt. Then in the year 60 and that following, as
the Spirit and Courage of theſe people began to
increaſe with their Numbers, and theſe <hi>Friends</hi> to
ſet up their <hi>Meetings,</hi> and at laſt they went on
Cheerfully in their ways, then, both for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
aforeſaid. And eſpecially, on the account
of theſe Meetings, they were proſecuted with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments,
Whippings, Baniſhments, Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
into wild Woods and Deſolate places;
till at length this exceſſive ſeverity began to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
and this Sect of People to reſt and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd;
and that eſpecially by reaſon of the Kings
Interpoſition, and an order ſent like that I ſpake
of before to the Governour of <hi>New-England.</hi>
Thoſe who are acquainted with that part of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi>
which is under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Juriſdiction,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50388:183"/>
know <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> the Propriety and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of which (vacant by the Death of <hi>William
Pen</hi>) from whom the ſaid Countrey takes its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination,
deſcended to his Son <hi>William Penn,</hi>
that famous Patron and Head of the Quakers.
And he being heir to this Countrey, it became as
it were the Inheritance and Portion of the Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
eſpecially ſince the year 82, at which time
<hi>Penn</hi> going to his Government order'd all things
to his own mind, and appointed all his Officers
and Agents their proper places. Omitting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſpeak of the political Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Countrey, and its legal Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and of the Benefits and Advantages theſe
Quaker-people enjoy, both throughout the whole
Province and eſpecially in the Town, which, from
their mutual Love to one another, they have call'd
<hi>Philadelphia;</hi> theſe people at that time were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
with ſuch a Courage and Fortitude of
mind, and opinion of their own Conſtitutions,
Government, Unanimity, and good Agreement,
that they ventured to invite all the Barbarous
<hi>Americans,</hi> and indeed all Men, in whom there
was the leaſt ſpark of Religion, Moral Honeſty,
or Quietneſs of Temper, to come and live among
them, promiſing them upon their good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
the like Advantages themſelves enjoy'd, and
the free exerciſe of their own Religion. Which
the better to underſtand, it will be worth while
to ſet down their Decree. Which runs thus.
<hi>We give a General general liberty of Conſcience to
all, who acknowledge one God omnipotent, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
Preſerver, and Governour of the World, and
hold themſelves oblig'd in Conſcience to live quietly
and juſtly under Government,</hi> To that degree that
none ſhall have any thing to do, as to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
matters and opinions, at any time to compell
or force another to any ſort of Religious Worſhip
to which he is averſe, or to Contribute any thing
towards the Maintenance of Preachers, or to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſet apart for Religious. Worſhip. And that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50388:183"/>
every one ſhall have the full uſe of his Chriſtian
liberty, without ſuſtaining any detriment for the
ſame. And if any one abuſe another, or mock
him for being of a different perſwaſion from him
in religious matters, he ſhall be accounted a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturber
of the publick peace and puniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
Now tho I have hitherto onely recit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Writing, and all thoſe things I have yet
treated on, without pretending to interpret or
give the mind or ſenſe of theſe people (<hi>in them</hi>)
yet here I can't forbear taking notice that they
call this liberty <hi>Christian,</hi> when as they extend
it to all Men, who onely acknowledge one God.
Now if theſe Men will agree with themſelves,
they muſt neceſſarily take all thoſe for Chriſtians
in whom there appears, any Principle or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Piety, as being what they ſay, is from Chriſt,
yea is Chriſt. But as the Inhabitants of this
Countrey were for the moſt part Quakers, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Conveniency of the Countrey and
this liberty of Religion, confirm'd by the Edict
aforeſaid. More Quakers at ſeveral times came
thither, from Divers other parts of <hi>America.</hi> And
not onely thoſe of this perſwaſion, but alſo others
of other Principles and Opinions in Religion, and
ſeveral of none or ſlender fortunes came and fix't
themſelves in thoſe remote parts of the World,
hoping for a bleſſing from Heaven, and a better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Condition. For ſeldom thoſe that
have any Eſtate or hopes of one in their own
Countrey, travel into ſtrange and unknown
Countreys, leaving all their Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
behind them. Moreover, <hi>W. Penn</hi> the Lord
and Governour of the Countrey, a little before
the breaking out of the Mortal War which ſtill
rages between the <hi>French</hi> of th' one ſide, and the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and their Confederates of the higher and

people, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and our Countrey
folks, and ſome of the Palatinate of the <hi>Rhene,</hi>
who having nothing of their own to looſe at
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50388:184"/>
home, and hearing of the plenty of all things in
<hi>America,</hi> were got into ſeveral parts thereabouts,
and having entertain'd a good opinion of him,
many of them were drawn thither in hopes of
getting a good livelyhood by their handy works.
And ſo all theſe people addicted themſelves to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture,
and preparing and enlarging that part
of the Countrey which was before uninhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and uncultivated, and withal of their own
proper concerns. And all things ſucceeded well
and happily to them, they being indefatigably Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
and Induſtrious. So the whole Countrey
became well manured, and Laws were made for
the better diſtribution of the Lands, Alloting to
every one their particular part. And theſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
had an equal priviledge of exerciſing what
Religion they would, and living according to their
own faſhion with thoſe of their own Company.
And moreover, they were made capable of all
honours and be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ing any office or dignity in the
Magiſtracy, either in City or Countrey. Altho
this was the Prerogative of the Quakers, not that
they had Arrogated it to themſelves by any Law,
but by reaſon of the Multitude of them and their
all agreeing together, and being Ambitious to
poſſeſs the firſt and beſt places in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Whence it came to paſs that there were
ſome of whom there's no great queſtion to be
made, but that onely for profit and advantage
ſake, diſſembling their own opinions they went
out to the Quakers, and tack'd about as the wind
turn'd. Now as we ſee that for the moſt part
fortune follows the diligent, the Ingenious, and
Induſtrious; So the greateſt part (almoſt) of
theſe people, being religious Men and Men of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
but unexpert and not well verſt in the
Affairs of the World; the reſt not onely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and unexperienc'd in affairs, but alſo wild and
licentious in Diſcourſe and Converſation. And
amongſt the reſt of them were ſome of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.
In proceſs of time theſe grave and ſerious
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50388:184"/>
Men, hanging of a knot together, diligently aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at what they had always ſeem'd to deſpiſe,
and affected to get into all the Courts and Offices
of Judicature, and mightily to buſy themſelves
about thoſe Employs. And when they were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
Magiſtrates and Judges, they behav'd them-excellently
in the ſaid Offices, and oftentimes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
themſelves roughly and proudly to their Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
and Suitours, and in their ſentences, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions
of ſuits and puniſhing of Malefactours,
they fitted themſelves with ſuch a kind of Juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
Actions as always bred diſguſt; and when
the Caſe required that any thing was to be So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
affirmed or denied, they caus'd the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
to ſwear, or at leaſt uſe ſuch a kind of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
as little differs from an Oath, as: <hi>I ſpeak
and promiſe it in the preſence of God;</hi> or <hi>as true as
God's in Heaven,</hi> or which at leaſt was no leſs than
an Oath amongſt God's ancient people the <hi>Jews,
As the Lord liveth.</hi> Moreover, they alſo who
aimed at the Miniſterial offices in the Church, and
Arriv'd at ſuch like Degrees of Honour, were
choſen and appointed by them, or delayed by
them who had moſt influence upon the Senate;
whoſe minds they fill'd with a belief, that they
took a great deal of care of the weal-publick and
the Laws, and would be very mindful of them
in their places of Authority, and Accommodate
themſelves in the Offices of Juſtice, according to
former cuſtoms and preſidents. But beſides theſe
there were agreat many of the Quakers both Men
and Women, who took upon them the liberty to
Preach and Exerciſed the ſame, without any (or
any juſt at leaſt) warrant for ſo doing; after that
manner intruding themſelves, without producing
any juſt Teſtimony, either of their Ability or good
Converſation. And there are ſome of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
themſelves who aſſert, that among theſe
there were ſome, who for their profound igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the very firſt Principles of Religion, were
ſo far unfit to bear the Office of Teachers or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50388:185"/>
in the Church, that they did not deſerve ſo
much as to be taken in as members of it; Which
being a thing of no ſmall moment, and laying a
firm foundation for hatred and envy, diſagreement
and Contention among theſe People, even to this
very day, it is much to be feared, that unleſs they
agree better among themſelves, it may come to
paſs one day, that their domeſtick Quarrels invite
their Barbarous Neighbours, or other forreign foes
to ſet upon them in an hoſtile manner and put
a ſpeedy period to their Government, and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
continuance there. And we may know alſo
that whereas the War between the <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> is carried into theſe parts of the World
alſo; and altho theſe people can tell how to fight
well enough with words, yet they'll have nothing
to do with War or Armies either for offence or
defence, and conſequently lye an eaſy Conqueſt
for an Enemy, who very quietly, and without
any danger at all to themſelves, might ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them: King <hi>William</hi> of <hi>England</hi> has ſent 'em
over a Governour, one of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
with Orders, That if occaſion be, he ſhould take
care to defend them againſt any Armed Enemy,
better than otherwiſe they would themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Now ſince we are at preſent upon this Country
of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and have but now made mention
of the great diſſentions and diſtractions amongſt
them; it would not be ſuitable to this Relation,
and the deſign of this Work, if I ſhould omit
that great and very memorable Caſe, that within
theſe few years has happen'd among them in thoſe
Parts, which becauſe know'n to few, I will relate
and deduce down to this very time, when as yet
none knows what the end of it will be. I have
ſhewn, in the former Book concerning <hi>George
Keith,</hi> that famous Teacher amongſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
how the <hi>Quakers,</hi> his Friends and Acquaintaince
in <hi>England,</hi> aſcribed to him certain Errors or
Forms of ſpeaking, which they did not approve
of; but which of their good will towards him,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50388:185"/>
they attributed to his ſingular Learning. This
man came over into theſe parts, and reſiding a
while in ſome Iſlands near <hi>Penſylvania,</hi> in the year
89, remov'd thence to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> being invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſome who not only deſired him for their
Preacher, but alſo to be Tutor to their Children.
When he came thither, he undertook both Offices,
and to ſhew his Modeſty, takes the place of an
Uſher to teach Boys, and diſcharges it very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably.
And at the ſame time exerciſing his
Preaching Faculty among an unlearned and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
company of People, as for the moſt
part their Preachers were, he excell'd 'em all,
appearing as a bright Luminary, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhining
all the reſt of that Order among them.
And by his opportune diligence, and induſtry in
all the parts of his Miniſterial Office he render'd
himſelf belov'd of 'em all, eſpecially the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
ſort of People. And it had been well indeed
if ſo it had continued. But a ſhort time produc'd a
great alteration in the ſtate of Affairs. For ſoon
after there aroſe ſome, that oppos'd <hi>Keith,</hi> him and
charg'd him with many, not only, Errors in Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
but alſo high and unpardonable Crimes. For
<hi>Keith</hi> did not forbear over and over again, to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and inſtruct all his Auditors in the Doctrines
of the two-fold Nature of our Lord and Saviour
Jeſus Chriſt, the Divine and Human; and of the
Human, the one part Heavenly, Spiritual and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
the other Earthly and Corporeal, conceiv'd
in time of his Mother <hi>Mary.</hi> Then his ſecond
Tenent was this, which he often repeated to them
all; That Chriſt, as Born of <hi>Mary,</hi> was uninted
with the Divine Nature, and ſo was preſent with
his Light and Life in all the Children of God
It was difficult for him to keep the Conception
of his mind to himſelf, without divulging them,
eſpecially becauſe, when a man rightly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
a thing himſelf it is nothing, unleſs ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be made acquainted with it too. Wherefore
<hi>Keith,</hi> altho he a good while ſmother'd in ſilence,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50388:186"/>
the Opinions which he had long entertain'd, Of
the Tranſmigration of Souls after Death; Of the
laſt Judgment, and State of the Deceaſed, and
end of the World, as being unſafe, and leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to be diſcloſed; yet he could not ſo contain
himſelf, but that now and then he gave an inck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in his Diſcourſes, of what his inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of theſe things were; and ſometimes he
was not able to forbear betraying in his words,
what his true ſenſe of thoſe things was, and what
he principally aim'd at in them; whence it came to
paſs, that thoſe that lov'd <hi>Keith,</hi> and favour'd his
Doctrine, greedily entertain'd theſe Principles.
And yet for the moſt part, thoſe that were the
greateſt followers of his Doctrins and Admirers of
his Skill and Parts (whom <hi>Keith</hi> indeed, for his
own Credit's ſake, either found or made thorough
pac'd in his Principles) embrac'd theſe Notions ſo
heartily, that they relyed more upon his Authority
and Precepts, than their own Judgment, and
thought it enough to ſay, that he knew and ſaid
ſo, and ſo, and that, with them, was Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.
And ſo his Exact and Nice and Subtle
Judgment, in theſe matters, was a ſubterfuge to
cover their Ignorance. Againſt theſe Tenents of
<hi>Keith,</hi> and thoſe of his Party, there were others
that ſet themſelves, and eſpecially againſt that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Divine and Human Nature of Chriſt.
which Article <hi>Keith</hi> openly acknowledged he held,
and profeſſed; and that it was no new thing, by
him deviſed, but antiently, and always taught by
the whole Society. Againſt which Article they
objected, that of one he made two Chriſts. Of
theſe Adverſaries the Head and chief was an Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Miniſter, one <hi>W. Stockade</hi> by Name, a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
not unlearned, but in the Opinion of himſelf,
and many more unlearned and ignorant People,
a man of vaſt Parts, and Learning, and the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
and Defender of the Antient and Pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of theſe People. <hi>Keith</hi> ſtretched his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Belief of this Article ſo far, and made it
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50388:186"/>
ſo neceſſary to be known and believed, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
Chriſtianity it ſelf depended, and that the
denial of that Article, was the ſame as to deny the
Paſſion and Death of Chriſt, yea, Chriſt himſelf.
Moreover, that they who perſiſted in the denying
of this Article, the ſin of ſuch denial was ſo great,
that it gave juſt cauſe to thoſe that held it, to fly
to Extremity, and ſeparate themſelves from thoſe
who obſtinately deny it. At laſt when this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had been Controverted a long while, and no
end like to be put to it; <hi>Keith,</hi> and thoſe of his
Party, grew to that heighth, and were ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
in this Controverſy, that they ſaid, God had
called 'em to ſeparate themſelves from thoſe ſort of
Infidels. In the mean while, as this good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
were ſo diſguſted at the Opinions of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
acuter Men, they entertain'd and publiſhed
ſuch kind of Notions about the ſame Articles;
as <hi>Keith</hi> and his followers no leſs deleſted and
were averſe from; then they cry'd out, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of their Opinions was no leſs than a renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Faith, and utterly overturning the
Foundations of it. Altho theſe ſame men differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Opinions mightily amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and ſome as much from others, as all of
them differed from <hi>Keith</hi>'s ſentimeuts. So as to
that Article of the Human Nature of Chriſt, ſome
affirm'd, that Chriſt never aroſe, and aſcended
into Heaven; as he was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> and
ſuffered on the Croſs. Others, That Chriſt
took that Body indeed out of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
but in his Aſſention into Heaven, laid it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.
Others doubted of the whole buſineſs, and
could not tell what to pitch upon. Some thought
that all Controverſy about ſuch a thing as was not
only controvertible, or not worth the while, and
by reaſon of the ſlightneſs <hi>of the concern,</hi> made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the <hi>purpoſe</hi> of Faith, however 'twas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.
Theſe thought it the beſt way to lay
down the Controverſy, and keep Peace. As to
the ſtate of Souls after Death, there was ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50388:187"/>
held, That all Faithful and Religious Perſons, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
entered into the Compleatneſs of Joy
and happineſs, but that the unbelievers and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
inſtantly upon their Death, underwent all that
puniſhment that attends them, and that herein
conſiſted all the Reſurrection. Which was as
much as to ſay, That properly there will be no
further Reſurrection of the Body, and that the
Body after it is reſolv'd into Duſt, ſhall be no
where, or nothing at all, nor any future Day of
Reckoning, or of the laſt and general Judgment.
Others there were that ſaid, that the Reſurrection
and all the glorious Condition ſpoken of ſhould
at laſt be conſummated and perfect in this Life,
for this Reaſon, becauſe Chriſt Aroſe, and liv'd
ſuch a happy and bleſſed Life; which in other
words, is all one as to ſay that there is no Heaven
or Hell, but what is within Men. Theſe Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>Keith</hi> took notice of, and reprehended in theſe
men's Diſcourſes and Sermons, as being contrary
to the Articles of the Catholick Faith, eſpecially
as they are propounded and declared to us in the
Scriptures of the Old and New-Teſtament; and
told thoſe of his Party, That theſe men taught
and dellvered ſuch Doctrines, as when they came
throughly to underſtand, they ought not to give
any the leaſt Entertainment to 'em.</p>
                  <p>At laſt in the year 91, there was an Experiment
made, to put an End to theſe Controverſies in a
Meeting of the Friends and Brethren. Time and
place was appointed by Common conſent. The two
principal Adverſaries, <hi>Keith</hi> and <hi>Stocker</hi> diſpute
together with great heat and vehemence, but ſuch
was the end of it, that the difference inſtead of
being compos'd was but ſo much the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd.
Whereupon the cauſe was deferr'd to
the General yearly aſſembly, which that year was
held at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in <hi>September</hi> In which
aſſembly the Doctrine of <hi>Keith</hi> was brought
on the Stage: For whereas <hi>Keith</hi> did not ſo much
define as ſuppoſe or leave to be examined as truth,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50388:187"/>
what was attributed to him of the Tranſmigrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Souls, and their ſtate after their departure
out of the Body; therefore that was not call'd
into queſtion, but this; Whether to Preach faith
in Chriſt within <hi>a Man,</hi> and Chriſt without <hi>a
Man</hi> is not to Preach two Chriſts. There were
ſix Seſſions or Acts held about this, in which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
there were ſo many Teachers indued
with and taught and led by, the Holy Spirit it
ſelf, immediately, as they call it, and being of
the higheſt form of Chriſtianity, yet they could
not come to a Concluſion, or Definitive ſentence
about this Controverſy. For the Diſputants on
both ſides even in this Supreme and Sacred Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
did ſo ſcold and rail one at another. <hi>Keith's</hi>
adverſaries uſing all the Reproachful and Oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious
Terms they could think of againſt his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
inveighed bitterly againſt <hi>the Man himſelf;</hi>
and not onely ſo, but alſo in a Contentious chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
way us'd a great many Scurrilous bitter words,
and that they might not ſeem to talk more than
do, they handled him very courſely and dragg'd
and thruſt him about very unhandſomly, not that
they were ſo furious by nature as <hi>Egg'd on by</hi> the
cauſe <hi>they had in hand.</hi> And on the other hand,
<hi>Keith</hi> and they that were of his ſide, tho <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe</hi>
a Man of wit and ſenſe enough yet at this
time and on this occaſion likewiſe, not naturally
or of his own accord, but as he was forc'd to it,
and not able longer to contain his juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their Injurious dealings with him, at
laſt broke out into invective Speeches againſt his
Adverſaries, as being the Effects of his juſt Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
againſt them, not railing, but giving them
anſwers worthy of their heat and malice. At
laſt one urg'd another with the Terms of Dolts,
Fools, Hereticks, Infidels, Heathens, Profane,
wicked Wretches. So they, how far now theſe
people, in this caſe have forgot themſelves both
in Doctrine and Diſcipline, and how far off they
have been from that perfect Agreement and Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50388:188"/>
Modeſty <hi>they pretend to,</hi> as the more cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and clear ſighted, have long and often ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
ſo now all, both wiſe and unwiſe, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
ſee. Theſe wrangling Diſputants being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a-weary; thoſe of the Brethren which were
the preſidents and moderators in this famous cauſe,
conſidering, that by theſe endleſs Jarrs and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
of the contending partys, the Fame and
Glory of the Quakers Name, was like to ſuffer;
made an end of this affair thus at laſt. Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
both partys, (as indeed both were to
blame) they acquitted <hi>Keith,</hi> and acknowledged
his Doctrine concerning Jeſus Chriſt, to be
true and right; and order <hi>Stockade,</hi> to confeſs
himſelf to have dealt unfairly with <hi>Keith;</hi> and
give him ſatisfaction for the damage he has
done him. So for a while theſe Contentions ceas'd
and all was quiet. Now in this time of Peace
and Quietneſs <hi>Tho. Fitzwater</hi> a Quaker Miniſter,
being puft up with the conceipt, ſome people had
entertain'd of his Wit and Learning, in a certain
Monthly Meeting accuſes <hi>Keith</hi> of <hi>Hercſy,</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the light of Chirſt to be ſufficient for Men.
Here again both ſides were mightily heated, and
ſaid many things of the ſuddain, which was the
more eaſily Excuſable from the Trouble and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of mind they were in. Nor here could
the whole Senate reconcile theſe two people, or
bring them to any Terms of Agreement. Then
the Caſe was reſerv'd to another aſſembly, to
which were invited <hi>Tho. Lloyd</hi> the Governour, and
others of the Magiracy of the whole province, that
by their prudence and ſuffrages the matter might be
brought to a Concluſion. There <hi>Keith</hi> brought a
great accuſation againſt <hi>Stockade</hi> that, he had not as
yet given him ſatisfaction according to the decree
of the former Council. And here many quarrels
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> out of one. The Governour and Magiſtrates
lay many things to <hi>Keith's</hi> charge. At laſt the
greateſt part of Miniſters and Elders incline on
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Whereupon the Governours fall to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50388:188"/>
him too; And make an order of Council, that
<hi>Stockade</hi> himſelf ſhall Condemn himſelf of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and Infidelity. <hi>Stockade</hi> denies to do any
ſuch thing, and ſtands upon his defence inſiſting,
that what he had ſaid of <hi>Keith,</hi> he had ſaid with
very good reaſon. The difference too between
<hi>Keith</hi> and <hi>Fitzwater</hi> was brought on the Stage,
which had been handled in the former Monthly
Meeting. And they all agree and paſs this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
ſentence, that <hi>Stockade</hi> by a publick
Writing ſhould take the blame upon himſelf of
his offence againſt <hi>Keith,</hi> and that <hi>Fitzwater</hi>
ſhould do the ſame for himſelf, for as much as
relates to <hi>Keith</hi> and over and above ſhould give
an account of his faith in Writing before this
Council, and therein ſatisfy them as to what he
held of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
State of his humane nature in Heaven; and
that in the mean while both of them ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
from Praying and Preaching in their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
till they had done what was order'd them.
The determinations of this aſſembly, tho <hi>Stockade</hi>
and <hi>Fitzwater</hi> at firſt either expreſly or ſilently
ſubmitted to, yet now at laſt ſentence being paſt
upon them, they flew off, and refuſed to obey it,
alledging: <hi>That whereas this was a buſineſs Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical,
and was a Controverſy wholly amongst the
Miniſters of the Church, and that a very hard and
difficult one too, which they themſelves could ſcarce
comprehend, therefore it was onely proper for the
Cognizance and Deciſion of the Miniſters of the
Church: Now that part of thoſe that had undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Judge and Determine theſe affairs and they a
Conſiderable part too, were of thoſe whoſe office theſe
things don't belong to, and whoſe aptneſs to enlarge
their own Power and Authority was ſufficiently well
known; Wherefore, neither was their ſentence or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
Valid, nor would they obey ſuch an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</hi>
Therefore <hi>Stockade</hi> and <hi>Fitzwater</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all this went on in their Miniſterial fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and withdrew and ſeperated themſelves
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50388:189"/>
from thoſe that were the followers of <hi>Keiths</hi> Yet
<hi>Keith</hi> and thoſe of his party did not preſently
take notice and allow of this ſeperation, nor like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
disjoyn themſelves utterly from their Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but waited in hopes to ſee them repent of
what they had done, and give ſatisfaction for their
Injurious dealings, or at leaſt in words to own their
faults, and ſo in good time to return into Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with them again, and wholly unite together in
ſtricter Bonds of Friendſhip than ever. The moſt
part both of City and Country held on <hi>Keith's</hi>
ſide, and from thence were called <hi>Keithians.</hi> As
things ſtood thus this Governour and reſt of the
Magiſtrates, fearing leſt the difference ſhould
ſpead further, and be the forerunner of greater
diſturbances, came to a Concluſion that it would
be beſt to put a ſtop to this Inconvenience as ſoon
and as well as they could. Wherefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
that it would be beſt not to reſcind the
former Judgment; but yet to recall thoſe things
which were done before under a new Cognizance.
At their Command therefore there met together
at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in the year 92, the 20th day of
the 4th Month eight and twenty Men, of which
the greater part were Miniſters or Preachers,
among whom were ſome, who exerciſed the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
both of Miniſters in the Church and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
in the Common-wealth; of which one was
<hi>Sam. Jennings</hi> a great Enemy of <hi>Keiths</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Arthur Cook,</hi> no great friend to him. To
theſe Men was Committed the care and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of this affair, to adviſe as Friends and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators
on both ſides, and to put a final end to
the Difference and Contention that was between
<hi>Keith</hi> and his Adverſaries. But theſe Men meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, not ſo much to decide theſe Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
which were now become General, as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<hi>Keith</hi> and thoſe of his party, and abſolve
thoſe of the other ſide, in their firſt Seſſion paſs
this ſhort ſentence upon him without hearing
him, or any thing on his behalf, and Seal it in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50388:189"/>
Writing. <hi>That</hi> Keith <hi>is a Man that has not the
fear of God before his Eyes.</hi> Than which ſentence
<hi>Keith</hi> could not have had a ſeverer paſs'd upon
him by open Enemies, than was done by theſe his
Judges. And now, according to his Adverſaries
principal wiſh, the Magiſtracy forbid <hi>keith,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further delay, all exerciſe of his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
function in the Church; and if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
he ſhould continue ſo to do, he ſhould
be proſecuted as an adjudged Enemy. And now
the Enemys of <hi>Keith</hi> applaud themſelves that
they have compaſſed their Ends, and obtain'd
their revenge on him. Wherefore <hi>Keith</hi> and one
<hi>Tho. Bud,</hi> publiſh a book in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Entituled,
<hi>The Vindication of an Innocent cauſe againſt a falſe
Judgment paſs'd upon it.</hi> Wherein they relate the
form, Continuance, and order of the Judgment
paſs'd againſt the <hi>Keithians,</hi> and alſo the deprav'd
Morals of ſome of the Judges, that had combin'd
together in this Cauſe, and ſpecially of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the word. Not to caſt any Reflection
upon the Magiſtracy, nor Sully the Honours of
the Miniſters of their Church, or diſcover the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of any order of Men; but to ſhew, what it
was they ought to beware of, leaſt the evil ſhould
be diſpers'd from the head through all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
and ſo the Enemies might take occaſion to
reflect diſgrace upon this Church, and Arrogate
Glory to themſelves. Upon a time <hi>Keith</hi> entred
into Diſcourſe with the Governour, and makes a
long and heavy complaint to him, of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that was paſt upon him in his abſence,
without being duely cited or the cauſe heard;
that of the Judges Divers were prejudic'd againſt
him, and he had thereupon ſuffered Divers Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
unuſual and unheard of amongſt juſt and
upright Judges. After which the Governour as
it were directing his diſcourſe to <hi>Keith's</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
ſaid, that if he had ſuſtain'd any Injury in
the aforeſaid Meeting he ſhould complain of it,
and ſeek redreſs, in the general and yearly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50388:190"/>
which was ſhortly to be held at <hi>Philadelphia. Keith</hi>
being oppreſſed, with ſo many adverſities and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
yet not overcome, conſidered that it was beſt
for him to do ſo; and ſo being egg'd on with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
of the Injuries he had receiv'd. He writes
a ſharp appeal to the Council, and lays down
twelve Articles, containing an Expoſition of his
and his Friends's Doctrine and Belief: And that
the whole ſtate of the Caſe, after ſo great and
long a Controverſy, which in a ſhort ſpace of
time could not ſo eaſily be comprehended in all
its parts, might the better be apprehended and
more commodiouſly decided by the Synod; and
they in their great Wiſdom and Vigilance might
briefly adjudg for the one, and againſt the others,
as might be convenient; and preſcribe to each
their Duties. And becauſe it ſeem'd dangerous to
write out ſo many Books in Manuſcript, <hi>Keith</hi>
cauſes both Books to be Printed, to the intent, in
time, to ſend a Copy to them all, that they might
from this time weigh and conſider the Caſe, and
then, being prepared, be ready to give it a quick
diſpatch. The Title of the Book was, <hi>An Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
from twenty eight men, to the Spirit of Truth.</hi>
Printed by <hi>William Bradford.</hi> Two Copies of it
were diſtributed by <hi>John Comb;</hi> which ſo ſoon as
it was known, the Magiſtrates pronounces them
all guilty, as breakers of the Peace, and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Government; and ſends the Mayor,
<hi>Wyth,</hi> who ſeizes the Printer and Publiſher, and
carries them from their Houſes, into Priſon; and
withal, as if he had been in his own Poſſeſſion or
Eſtate, takes out of their Work-houſes what
Tools or Utenſils he pleaſes, and carries them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
The next day the Magiſtrate orders the
Mayor to lay his Action againſt <hi>Keith</hi> and his
Companions, and partners in his Crime, joyning
for help, two of the Colledge of the Magiſtrates,
who were not Quakers, namely, <hi>Lucius Coke,</hi> a
<hi>Lutheran,</hi> and <hi>John Holmes,</hi> a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who, as
being of a different Perſwaſion, and partial to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50388:190"/>
neither ſide, might paſs for upright Judges. But
theſe Gentlemen declin'd the Office for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
becauſe the thing which theſe Men were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
of, aroſe from Religion and Tending
thereunto, had nothing of concern with the civil
Government, and therefore was more proper to
be decided by thoſe Men from whom it came, and
who were concern'd in it. To which they added,
that ſince neither Humane nor Divine Laws al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
that any one ſhould be Condemned without
being firſt heard, it was juſt and right that <hi>Keith,</hi>
before any Judgment paſs'd upon him, ſhould be
heard. This was an anſwer that did not pleaſe
thoſe, whoſe deſigns ſeem'd not to aim at the
quieting of the preſent Diſorders, but rather to
the increaſe of them, and raiſing of new. And ſo
they go on with their Intention, and without
hearing of <hi>Keith</hi> proceed to ſentence. They give
Judgment for <hi>Keith's</hi> Condemnation, in a long
Writing, of which theſe were the heads. That
the Governours have declared <hi>Keith</hi> to be a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Man, an ill Citizen, a Teacher ill Principled,
and Diſaffected to the Government, King and
Queen. And this they order the Cryer to publiſh
in the Court, before a great Concourſe of People.
In the Eccleſiaſtical Convention, where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
between <hi>Keith</hi> and his Adverſaries was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the Governour and other of the Magiſtracy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſent, there happen'd a diſpute between
<hi>Keith</hi> and the Governour himſelf; about a place
which the Governour had quoted out of a book
formerly written by <hi>Keith.</hi> Which place when
<hi>Keith</hi> had ſaid it made nothing to the purpoſe,
nor was it rightly cited by the Governour, he went
on and added that the Governour was alſo one of
thoſe, who had not cited him to the hearing of the
cauſe, but had Condemned him unheard. This ſlipt
from <hi>Keith</hi> in his heat and ſuddain tranſport of
mind, and by a ſlip of the Tongue, which often
happens in hot diſputes, that the Governour was
an Impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ent Man and his Name would rot.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50388:191"/>
Which words, tho the Governour had more than
once ſaid that he would not take notice of as
ſpoken upon ſuch a time and occaſion, yet now
he lays to <hi>Keiths</hi> charge as an Egregious reproach
to Magiſtracy, not to be paſs'd by without pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment:
It was added; that <hi>Keith</hi> at the ſame
time Reproached the Governour as a perſon not
capable for the due diſcharge of his Office. But
as to that <hi>Keith</hi> ſays, that he neither ſaid nor
thought ſo. In the ſaid ſentence of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alſo it is contained; that <hi>Keith</hi> ſhould call
another of the Magiſtrates by a Name which in
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Signifies one or all of theſe, <hi>viz. Scolder,
Quareller, wrody deceiver, Sordid fellow, Seoundel,
Knave.</hi> Which accuſation <hi>Keith</hi> thus wip'd off,
Not denying the fact, he ſaid he call'd that Man
by that Name; as being one who indeed was not
of the Magiſtracy, and yet notwithſtanding ſate
in that aſſembly that Condemned <hi>Keith,</hi> and as
ſuch concurred with them in the ſame ſentence,
and ſubſcribed his Condemnation. Amongſt
theſe Diſputes and Wranglings there was a New
Court of Judicature held at <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> for the
paſſing an Impartial Sentence upon theſe three
Men, who had lain under ſo much prejudice.
<hi>Jenings</hi> was Preſident, and <hi>Cook</hi> one of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
who, I have both ſaid before, were Quaker
Miniſters. Now hither were cited to plead their
own Cauſe, <hi>Keith, Bradford, Combe, Bud, Buſs,</hi>
and others of the <hi>Keithians,</hi> who all came; all
and every of them were Indicted of this Crime,
of Writing, Uttering and Deviſing a Book, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
an <hi>Appeal,</hi> being a very Seditious, Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Book, and full of a great many Lies, in
which particularly <hi>Jennings,</hi> the Preſident of this
Aſſembly, was Charged as a proud, imperious
Man, and inſolent in his Diſcourſe and Demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and the ſaid book did Print, concealing the
Printers Name, <hi>Buſs,</hi> whoſe Chriſtian Name was
<hi>Peter,</hi> was charged over and above the reſt, to
have ſaid many other things of <hi>Jennings,</hi> more
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50388:191"/>
than was contained in the book. Wonderful this.
The caſe with <hi>Jennings</hi> the preſident and the whole
Senate, was whether they that were brought afore
them as Criminals, or <hi>Jennings</hi> himſelf were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
he an untainted and unblamable perſon, or
they foul Detractors, worthy the higheſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
The Court was full of Scolding and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling.
Whatſoever (they alledged) had been
ſaid or written againſt <hi>Jennings</hi> was not againſt
him, as a Magiſtrate but an Eccleſiaſtical perſon,
a Preacher, and if he pleaſed his Colleague, not
with an intent to reproach or accuſe him; but
for his Correction, and to try all things; as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
us'd, or ought, to do. And theſe Criminals
prov'd by good Witneſſes and Evidences; that
they, who complained ſo much of the Calumnies
laid to their Charge, were worſe than the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
againſt them inſinuated; Namely that
they were not onely Proud and Imperious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
but ſo far from having the Command of
themſelves, that they could ſcarce contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
within any bounds of their Luſts and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.
In this troubleſome aſſembly, <hi>Keith</hi> made
many grave Speeches; whereof this was the ſenſe
and ſum. <hi>Will there never an end be put to theſe
ſort of Controverſies and Quarrels, or will theſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
be always continued which (whether we be
Victors or Vanquiſhed) are ſo Shameful and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
to us, and wiſh'd for and laughed at by
thoſe who once ſeeming deſirous of our Friendſhip
and Amity, now are turn'd our Haters and Enemies
and curſe us. And as if in this Caſe we had loſt all
our wiſdom, and there was no further place left for
a remedy to this miſchief, which if it remains, and
ſpreads farther, will not onely reflect an Eternal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
upon our Truth, but alſo, will ſo afflict and
ſpoil it, eſpecially in theſe parts, amongst theſe</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,
<hi>as will at laſt bring on it all manner of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and Deſtruction to its utter Subverſion. The
State of the Caſe lies here. While thoſe whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
it is to take care of the ſafety of this Country
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50388:192"/>
and Religion, find it a difficult task, to pleaſe all
parties; but much more ſo to ſet themſelves open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt all; hence comes there to be called ſo
many Concur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ions, and ſo many various and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
events, till its come to that paſs, by the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up a few bold Men againſt all Laws; that
ſome narrow Soul'd people, terrified in Conſcience,
and fearful of appearing Criminal; not only now
don't ſtand as Criminals, but themſelves ſit and
act, as Judges in their own Cauſe, and as ſuch
paſs Sentances, as their own private Animoſities,
and prejudice and deſire of revenge which they
have been now along while Hatching and Conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amongſt themſelves, promp't them to. And
what ſuch great Crime is there Committed, that
ſhould occaſion ſo great diſputes and ſtrife.</hi> Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
<hi>that great and excellent Prophet cries out, that
there are thoſe who make a Man guilty for a word,
and lay a ſtumbling block for him that is ready to
fall in the gate. And lately, into what Snares,
what Streights have I been brought; and all for
a word, which beſides that it was ſpoken haſtily and
not ſtood in, if it were examined to the bottom,
and might receive a true proper and fair Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
or if taken in the beſt ſenſe, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ought to be follow'd, would not onely have
been pardoned, but brought me Commendation too,
now for the like cauſe of Truth and Virtue, are I
and my Companians arraigned as Criminals. For
here we are charged with Sedition, Diſhonouring
the Magiſtrates, Treaſon. Yea, as if we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all guilty of every of theſe Crimes, who are
ſo far from them, as we ſtudy nothing more than
obedience to lawful Power and Authority. But
what Conviction is there of this? What the leaſt
proof of it? Or what that bears the leaſt Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50388:192"/>
of it? For if to accuſe alone be enough,
neither any of you, or any Man living will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and there will be no need to fear thoſe pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments
that theſe Men deſerve. But here lies
the Conviction and proof of the Crime, becauſe
we have ſpoken ſomewhat tartly againſt ſome of
your order and have us'd ſharp Language. We
hear it. After a hoſtile manner? No, this your
modeſty will not give you leave to ſay, tho all the
reſt you affirm with a geeat deal of Confidence.
But we have written and ſpoken a great many Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
things againſt them. Whom? Thoſe who
were and as yet are of our order. Who tho they
are, Eccleſiaſticks, Doctors, Miniſters, now at this
time lay aſide thoſe Characters, and take upon them
to be Magiſtrates and Judges. But what are
theſe Scandalous things? Are they ſuch, as both
they and we do mutually exhort one another to, and
if that be not enough, ſuch as our places and duties
oblige us publickly to admoniſh thoſe that are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to our charge? Is there any thing more than
this? That the Printers Name is not prefixt to the
Book. But what harm is there in that? What ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
or Law, Cuſtom, or Example is there for
that? I appeal to you O my Companions, who have
publiſhed ſo many famous books in</hi> England, <hi>and
the moſt Illuſtrious</hi> Penn, <hi>the Lord and chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of this Countrey, of whom there are ſo
many Monuments extant, not bearing thy Name,
or the Names of thoſe that Printed them: Which
ſince it is ſo, let all Honeſt and Impartial people
ſee and Judge, who in this place principally are to
be eſteemed innocent, and who guilty; whereof the
one do not in any wiſe refuſe to ſtand before their
Judges, and to have their whole cauſe plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined;
The others fly from Juſtice and mock
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50388:193"/>
their Judges. Now ſee and conſider ye, what ye
have to determine, that it may be that againſt Truth
and Probability, falſity and fraud, which Tempeſts
and Impure breaths are againſt the Sun; and that
it may come to paſs, if not at preſent, yet that at
last, oppreſſed truth may have a Glorious reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and light up her head, and ſlighted and injur'd
vertue ſhine forth ſpendidly, as the Suns raies break
out ſo much the more Illuſtrious after the Gloomy
Clouds are diſpelled; and at laſt that happy time
may come, in which the allwiſe, incorrupt, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Judge ſhall lay open and make manifeſt thoſe
things that are at preſent obſcur'd in an abyſs of
Darkneſs, and ſhall reveal the thoughts and counſels
of the Heart, and every one ſhall receive their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
from God.</hi> After a long, Quarrelſome, and
Confus'd diſputing of the Caſe <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> in
which ſome of 'em ſo thought their Tongues to
be their own, as they ſaid what they pleaſed, the
Judges having concluded, and all people a-gape to
hear the ſentences: They laid upon <hi>Keith</hi> and
<hi>Bud</hi> the penalty of five pounds each. <hi>Bradford's</hi>
Tryal was put off till the next Seſſions. That
which with theſe Men ſeems unjuſt, they call the
Judiciary Court of the whole province. What
theſe Judges ſeem to think of themſelves, as if
from them there could be no appeal, they don't
allow of King <hi>Charles</hi> had reſerved to himſelf (in
the aſſignment he had made of the Countrey to
<hi>W. Penn,</hi> in the Grand <hi>Charter,</hi> or Grant he gave
him,) the final Deciſion of ſuch Caſes, wherein
the Inhabitants of the Countrey themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
in the higheſt Tribunal of that Countrey,
and no other redreſs was to be had. Therefore
theſe Men appeal, to the Cognizance of the King
and Queen in <hi>England,</hi> and to ſtand by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.
And this was denied them, by a bold
and ſtrong power than which nothing is more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
or pernicious. Wherefore theſe Men
yeilding to their pleaſure, and the preſent time
reſerved their own right to themſelves till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50388:193"/>
time. There came in this time of great
ſtreights and trouble of mind and dejection theſe
Men lay under, two of theſe kind of people from
<hi>England,</hi> who adviſed <hi>Keith,</hi> out of the ancient
Friendſhip nearneſs and dearneſs, which he had
enter'd into with them and the whole Society,
that as much as in him lay and as <hi>Much as</hi> he
could, and ſhould forego his own private Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
for the ſake of the publick, and follow
peace, and avoid the ſcandal of ſuch a Diſcenſion,
and ſo great a Diſtraction. And that thereunto
they would lend him their advice. Which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of thens <hi>Keith</hi> liked and approv'd of very
well; and altho he knew how uncertain a thing
it was and full of Danger, and that it was no
part of a wiſe Man to follow that that he could not
overtake, yet that a dubious probability of
good, was better than an uncertain Evil. And ſo
weighing all things well firſt, he propoſes to his
Adverſaries ſeveral Terms of Accommodation by
Letters ſent to them. But they, things ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now according to their wiſhes, and their hearts
being harden'd with inveterate hatred, Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Change of his for an inconſtancy unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
wiſe Men, and were angry at him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting
this at their hands. Wherefore the <hi>Kei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
ſeeing that neither ſo could this buſineſs be
brought about, and conſidering that it would be
labour in vain, and to no purpoſe, but rather
hurtful, to make any further overtures of peace,
or if they ſhould obtain any thing, that it would
not be peace but a Slaviſh kind of Agreement,
therefore they kept themſelves to themſelves, and
within the bounds of their own Confeſſion, which
<hi>Keith</hi> and ſome others in his own Name, and of
thoſe of his party ſigned. And ſo much for the
paſſages in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> till towards the end of
the year 93. But when the News of all theſe
things was ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and to <hi>London,</hi> it is
hard to ſay, what a great Grief and Trouble theſe
things were, to theſe Friendly People, and gave
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50388:194"/>
Occaſion to their Enemies to inveigh againſt, and
inſuit over the whole Sect; hitting them in the
Teeth, that now they plainly ſaw what they had
long ſuſpected, of their diſtinction and difference
of Religion; and now they both heard and ſaw
what they profeſs'd themſelves, and what they
practiſed.</p>
                  <p>This was no ways pleaſing to the Quakers in
theſe parts; nay, it was very grievous and intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for them to hear of. And they laboured
might and main to wipe off all Suſpicion from
themſelves; and ſhewed, That if any where, or
at any time, there ſhould be ſuch an unwary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
in Doctrine and Manners amongſt thoſe
of their Sect; That theſe Objections therefore did
not lie againſt them all, and that they in <hi>England</hi>
and theſe parts, did agree very well together, and
were conſonant in Faith and Prayer, and kept up
the ancient Glory of their People. But they were
ſo far from beating any body off of this Opinion
by their Speeches and proteſtations, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
it the more; For in a ſhort time there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe
amongſt the Quakers themſelves, ſome that
ſo engaged themſelves in this Difference, every one
taking his ſide; and ſo proſecuted one another
with Hatred, Ignominy and Reproaches, that at
laſt they began to talk of diſſenting and departing
from one another, and making Schiſms; So that
there was no body, of any Parts or Senſe, who
did not ſee that that Excuſe was not only very
uſeleſs, but alſo extreamly vain and ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>Things going thus, there were nevertheleſs ſome
of theſe People, of the greateſt Name and Place
amongſt them, towards the ending, as I ſaid of this
Year, who gave in charge to ſome of the Leading
Men of the Church at <hi>London,</hi> and thoſe of the
moſt ancient Profeſſors. <hi>Whitehead, Park, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal,</hi>
and Eight more; that in the Name of the
Society, they ſhould write, ſubſcribe, and publiſh a
Confeſſion of the Faith of them all in their own <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Tongue, as an Anſwer to their Adverſaries Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50388:194"/>
Which work they perform, entituling
their book, <hi>The Chriſtian Doctrine and Society of
the People called Quakers, Vindicated from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the late Diviſion of ſome, in ſome parts of</hi>
America, <hi>as being unjuſtly charged upon the body of
the ſaid People, either here or elſewhere.</hi> And
when they come to declare and profeſs their mind
and belief of the ſeveral Articles of their Faith, in
that Article that treats of Chriſt, they deny that to
preach Chriſt within, and Chriſt without, is to
preach Two Chriſts. But when they treat of
Chriſt's Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Hell, they oppoſe themſelves to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
New Doctrines. At laſt, in the end of the
Work, they reject the Notion of the Tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Souls, after the Death of their Bodies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
New Bodies, and declare they know none who
ſay, that God has revealed any ſuch thing to
them. In theſe things they make mention of no
Mens Names, and before they conclude the
Work, they take occaſion to exhort all to ſound
Faith, Peace and Charity.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, divers Complaints, both of
the <hi>Keithians</hi> and their Adverſaries, were at ſeveral
times ſent over to <hi>London,</hi> to the General Yearly
Meeting: This Meeting, which was thereupon
firſt held, conſidering, what a diſgrace and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
this Diſſenſion would be to their People,
not only in theſe Parts, but alſo all the World
over; and that if they ſhould delay the time,
and go ſlowly to work, to remedy this Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
it would be in vain to bring help afterwards;
if they would; they leave no ſtone unturn'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
this Miſchief and Danger. Yet this Meeting
loſt all their labour. And that was not all neither:
For now at <hi>London</hi> and elſewhere, and all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
over, there were ſome of the Quakers that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed
themſelves in this Diſpute; and growing
ſharp upon it, while ſome of them could not, or
would not, without Paſſion, refute the others,
they ſtood ſtiffly to their own Opinions, and would
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50388:195"/>
not be refuted. Hence Hatred, and at laſt, Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ariſing, they were diſtracted among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſome ſtrive to diſſolve the Society alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Theſe indeed at firſt were not many, but
as ſometimes a little Cloud raiſes a great Tempeſt,
ſo this inſolence and Vehemence of a few, ſtirred
up greater Concuſſions and Motion, amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
Wherefore the next Year's General Meeting,
who eaſily might ſee, that ſuch Diſſentions and
Strifes, could have no other end than their mutual
deſtruction, being very deſirous of Peace and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
were ſo much the more intent upon this, to
bring things to that paſs, That all, laying aſide
their Controuerſies, and Enmities, and Quarrels,
the Event of which was ſo dubious, and no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
or next to none could redound to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
but the detriment would be mortal and
perpetual, ſhould ſtudy to preſerve Peace, and
without any fraud, deſiſt from ſuch Wars; and
ſice what they had hitherto done, in accuſing one
another, and quarrelling together, could not be
helpt, that they ſhould not go on ſo to do, and
blot out the memory of all things ſaid and done,
that were paſt, by a perpetual Oblivion of 'em,
and thereupon ſhake hands together, in Token of
Faith and Amity. But neither could this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
altho they imploy'd all the Vigour both of
their Minds and Diſcourſe to this purpoſe, decide
the Controverſie, or put an end to this buſineſs,
and bring the Contending Parties to an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But they were ſo far from leaving off the
thing they had attempted, that though they heard
theſe Parties as Brethren and Judges, yet the ſtrife
did but increaſe, and the longer it continued, the
ſharper it was. The time of the laſt Meeting, or
of the laſt Year 94. came on. And now <hi>Keith</hi> was
come back from <hi>Penſilvania</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
he on whoſe account all this Difference had
riſen. Therefore it ſecond good to the Meeting
held that Year, that in ſo great and long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
motions of their diſtracted People, the Heads
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:50388:195"/>
and Chieftains of the contending Parties, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<hi>Keith</hi> ſhould be preſent, and plead their own
Cauſes before this whole Aſſembly. So in the firſt
place there were read ſeveral Letters, writ and ſent
from <hi>Penſilvania</hi> to this Aſſembly upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Then the Parties were heard, and every one
had the liberty of Defending and Proving. But
here the Diſſention and Vehemence of ſome of them
was ſo greet, and they were ſo provoking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
in their Language, that the more the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was debated, the farther off ſtill they were.</p>
                  <p>This Meeting laſted for Twelve Days; whereas
never any before had been above Four Days. So
after a long while, ſince the aforementioned Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for Oblivion, ſignified nothing, and there was
no End made of contending, no Ceſſation of the
Aſſembly's Trouble, and and at laſt there ſeem'd
to be more need for doing ſomething than further
conſulting, the <hi>major</hi> part of the Meeting, and
thoſe of the greateſt Anthority, concluded upon,
and determined this Sentence; And having conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Caſe, ſince there was no hopes now of a
Reconciliation; That <hi>Keith</hi> ſhould acknowledge
himſelf to have very much burthened the Church,
and take upon himſelf the Occaſion of this ſo
great Diſturbance, and beg pardon for this miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
and moreover, leave off the maintaining
and diſperſing of, and forſake his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Novelties and Sophiſms, whereby he has ſo
much either adulrerated the Church, or deſpoiled
her of her former ſplendor, and enfeebled her; and
that he ſhould follow after this, to conſult the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Intereſt of the whole Society, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
and promote that.</p>
                  <p>Which Sentence ſtruck this man with ſuch a
ſudden and vehement Impulſe, as made him break
out into a Speech, in theſe Terms: <q>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be better entertain'd by him, than
this Endeavour of the Meeting, as it relates to
the Eſtabliſhing a mutual Peace and Concord,
and that there was nothing that he would more
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50388:196"/>
willingly perform than Obedience to this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and to have the happineſs to be ſerviceable
to them and all theirs. And therefore that he
did in no reſpect decline the Authority and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of this ſo great aſſembly, but ſo. While
theſe things conſiſt with Equity and Reaſon,
and he may without prejudice to himſelf and
them? But now ſince he is free from Error, and
no fault or Crime is found in him, he has nothing
to excuſe himſelf for, or ask pardon of, and
that it was not he that is liable to blame, or
had involv'd himſelf in guilt, but they which
do not Comprehend what he had taught, and
preſently and raſhly believe and ſpread about
reports of things, that they do not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.
And ſo, that they deſerve moſt to
be blam'd, that they may not go on ſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
over the name and fame of other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and
thoſe their Brethren, and to ſet the whole
Church in an uproar, that every one of them
may receive ſuch a ſentence as they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.
Laſtly, ſince that it had happen'd ſo,
that his Adverſaries would not forſake their
private Animoſities and Singular Opinions, as
for their own, ſo for the peace and profit of
the publick; but lay the faults which belong to
themſelves, at his door, that he relying upon
the juſtice and innocency of his Cauſe, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſatisfied with the Teſtimony of the Spirit
and Witneſs of his Conſcience, whatſoever
ſhould happen, ſo long as he was not Culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he would moderately bear, and in the mean
while he would unburthen himſelf and do what
became a good Chriſtian, to defend his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and good Name, leaſt ſeeming regardleſs
of that, he ſhould ſeem, not to value, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
his Religion and Honeſty.</q> So ſince there
was no hopes of a peace, the Meeting being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
after it had held ſo long; <hi>Keith</hi> appears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
again, and defends his Speech, and excuſes
himſelf in the beſt terms he could; both by ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50388:196"/>
in his Sermons; and publiſhing Books in
Print; and altho he confeſſes that thro' miſtake,
not wilful culpability, he had formerly written
ſome things, which now a-days were not approv'd
of, yet that as for his Doctrine of the humanity
of Chriſt, being what he had the greateſt reaſon
himſelf to approve of, and being indeed moſt
juſtly approvable and a principal Article, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Doctrine and Faith of Chriſtians he
would to his utmoſt power Preach it abroad. On
the other hand his Adverſaries alſo with equal
Zeal go on to obſerve <hi>Keith</hi> in the Meetings, to
refute his opinions, and inveigh againſt him with
hard Speeches. Amongſt which the chief were
<hi>Dan. Whirley</hi> and <hi>W. Penn,</hi> which <hi>Penn,</hi> as <hi>Keith</hi>
was in the middle of his Diſcourſe, before the
whole Meeting, could not forbear more than once
to call him Apoſtate, and an open Enemy to the
truth and the whole Society. Others, as <hi>Tho. Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
and <hi>John Pennington,</hi> not onely by their books
impugned the Tenents of this Man, and refelled
his Arguments; but alſo traduc'd his perſon, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
him infamous. So at laſt ſome began to
find fault with others, and uſe a greater liberty in
accuſing them, and to hate them, and provoke
them to anger, and fury as it were, and euery one
ſtrove to bring others to his own party, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
them with Enmity againſt the others. Theſe
things laſted till the late General Meeting held at
<hi>Lon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> this year 95. Which as ſoon as it began to
be held. <hi>Keith</hi> came hither with an Intention to
lay all things clearly open, in hopes to find more
Equitable Treatment from his Judges. But when
he came to the door, which he did the firſt day,
he was ſtop't by the Door-Keepers (who knew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
what his mind and Intentions were) but
the day after, tho 'twere late, firſt getting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance,
he came before his Adverſaries (who he
knew were within, and whoſe Intentions againſt
him he was ſenſible of beforehand) and not <hi>Viva

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> which would have had more of a forcible
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50388:197"/>
Energy in it, but in Writing, the more carefully
and moderately to Expreſs himſelf, he deliver'd
a Speech to this purpoſe. That he was never
convinc'd either by any aſſembly, or by that
which was held in that place the year before, of
any Errour of his either in Doctrine or Life, tho
he don't pretend to exempt himſelf from Errour,
being a frailty incident to all Men, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
to himſelf; but he Confeſſed himſelf to have
ſaid and written ſeveral things heretofore, in which
at this time he acknowledges his frailty. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
no aſſembly of thoſe people who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called Quakers, lawfully and rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veen'd,
has condemned him of them, as by the
ſilence of them all on that account appears, he
therefore looks upon himſelf as free from all Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
That he well knows the Council the laſt
Meeting gave him; but ſince that was onely
Counſel, which obliges no Man, and infers no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
equal to a Command, that he was at his
own liberty, either to follow it or let it alone.
But that he had omitted it, becauſe, he thought,
he had done all that was his duty to do in this
buſineſs, and that there was none of the Brethren
of the Society, who, if they would but conſider
the deeds both of him and his Adverſaries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prejudice, or being byaſs'd by others opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or making a raſh Determination of things;
and weigh them in the Ballance of the ſacred
Scriptures and right reaſon, but what would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of his doings and condemn theirs. This
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> was ſearce read, but it rais'd a mighty
commotion in the minds of them all. But the
principal adverſaries of <hi>Keith</hi> and ſpeakers in this
Contention were <hi>W. Penn, W. Bingley. G. Withale,
J. Vaughton, J. Feild,</hi> and <hi>J. Waldenfield.</hi> And
<hi>Penn</hi> and <hi>Withade</hi> had ſo little Command of their
minds and tongues, as <hi>Keith</hi> alſo was ſo una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to contain himſelf (by which you may ſee the
Prudence and Moderation both of him and them)
that they urged one another with this Crime; that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50388:197"/>
each of them ſpread abroad deteſtable and curſed
Doctrines, and enſnared Men in them to the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
or loſs of their ſalvation. And <hi>Keith</hi> told,
that <hi>Bingly, Vaughton,</hi> and others, when any of them
ſeem'd to ſpeak to another, either not in good
time, or not readily or plainly enough (becauſe
they firſt ſtaid to meditate, or wait the motion of
the Spirit, before they ſpake) were us'd to nod one
at another, point, or make ſigns to them to ſpeak,
and if that would not do, to pluck them by the
ſleeves, and ſo to put them upon ſpeaking. Which
certainly was not that that they had in their
minds, or what the Spirit mov'd them, to ſpeak,
which was contrary to the Doctrine and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Principles of theſe Men. But as there was
neither Meaſure nor end of theſe diſputes; nor
was there any reſpite of this Contention and Scold,
tho they were now grown hoarſe again; and it
was not time as yet for them to break up; <hi>Bing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>Waldenfield</hi> perſwade the reſt not to treat
with <hi>Keith</hi> any further, and ſo preſently diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the aſſembly they go away, and withal cauſe
all the reſt to do ſo to and diſperſe. After they
had left of dealing with <hi>Keith,</hi> they conſulted,
what was beſt to be done about him. In which
Conſultation ſome of them complain'd with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to <hi>Keith,</hi> that they had not the priviledge
given them of ſpeaking their minds, and that there
were ſome, that by their talkativeneſs, and proud
way of ſpeaking, and with their looks and aſpect
took the words out of their Mouths, or made
them hold their Tongues, or altogether ſilenc'd
them; there were others who were ſo frighted and
overaw'd, that they could not bring out what
they differ'd and were of a contrary mind from
others, in: And there were ſome alſo, that diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingly
and againſt their wills had ſpoken, and who
were ſorry for what they had done, and retracted
from the ſentence that was given. At the laſt
with the ſuffrages of the greateſt part of them,
this decree was made and agreed to: <q>That

                        <hi>Keith</hi> was of a Spirit no ways Chriſtian, and
was the cauſe of theſe differences and diviſions,
and openly Injurious to the Brethren: And
therefore that he had withdrawn and ſeparated
himſelf from the Holy Communion of the
Church of Chriſt, and was gone off from the
power of Preaching and Praying in the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Friends: Wherefore he was not to be
accounted or receiv'd as one of them, unleſs he
firſt publickly confeſs'd his Crime, and gave
ſome tokens of amendment.</q> And moreover,
by the Acts of the Meeting, this ſentence was ſent
in Writing to all the Meetings of the Quakers all
the World over: <q>That this Meeting in <hi>London</hi>
was no ways concerned in the late differences
in ſome parts of <hi>America,</hi> tho now there was
hopes things would ſucceed there better than
formerly. But that the Chriſtian Advice and
Councill that had been given to <hi>Keith</hi> and others
in the yearly Meeting before, <hi>Keith</hi> had openly
in his Printed books, ſet himſelf againſt and
oppos'd, and ſo betray'd himſelf to have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
aſide from the peaceable Spirit of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, and to perſevere in the Spirit of
Diſcord and Contradiction, and by ſo doing has
given great trouble and grief to the Church of
Chriſt, and eſpecially, to the laſt, and likewiſe
to this Meeting too. And ſo, that now they
had born Witneſs againſt him, untill he had
truly repented and reconciled himſelf to the
faithful friends and Brethren.</q> So then, in this
Meeting now ſo lately held, when all hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
was taken away, and no other end of
any other advice likely to be; and a Man Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
and caſt out, whom the Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of People looked upon as one of the moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
and beſt defenders of the Quakers and
their Religion; this ſeem'd to be a Schiſm amongſt
Men ſo joyn'd and united together amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as they were. And now redounded to their
great diſgrace, thro' the accuſations and ſharp
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50388:199"/>
Speeches of thoſe that withdrew from amongſt
them. Wherefore theſe now are their Adverſaries,
and now and then have a fling at them after this
manner, that now they may ſee themſelves, what
a ſort of Men they are, and how much worſe than
thoſe they would Condemn; and this was laid to
their Charge, that having been free from Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
jars within, and fears from without, of a
long while, that now with ſuch inteſtine and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hatred, ſtrife, and ſedition, they ſhould fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the Ears amongſt themſelves, inſtead of
that Spiritual and Heavenly Wiſdom and Prudence
they always bragg'd of; and that incredible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and Concord, that by a nod or ſign onely
they could have had any thing one of another;
that it ſeem'd they would ſhew, that thoſe that
formerly were ſo unconquerable without were
now ſo very weak within, and in a ſhort time
would fall by their own Weapons; and that now
the times were changed they would bring upon
themſelves the total loſs of that liberty, in hopes
of which they promis'd themſelves Perpetuity.
And thus much of the beginning, progreſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of theſe People, and of their Actions and
Sufferings in their own Country and thoſe depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon it, to this very time, in which, that odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to be nam'd and terrible perſecution, is quell'd
and taken off, and not onely theſe Men, but all
thoſe differing from the publick Churches, are
protected in their Civil Liberties in all thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys,
and peace and liberty of Conſcience is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
and that Confirm'd by the Laws. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Which Favour and Indulgence, how it was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to theſe people both by the equal bountys of
that King, than whom a better can't be wiſh'd for,
and to whom therefore all good Men wiſh a long

Virtues that concentred in her Royal Perſon;
and alſo by the joint Conſent of the Lords and
Commons in both Houſes of Parliament, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
readily Complying with the Royal pleaſure
herein, I have likewiſe before ſet forth. This I
muſt note before I go any farther, that this pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and clemency, of the King and Queen, and of
thoſe great Men, was ſo much glorious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and worthy to be acknowledged by theſe
Men, becauſe in all the times aforepaſt there were
not onely, ſo many and great Vexations, Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Afflictions, unſufferable Slaughters, every
where laid upon all ſorts of People, which, either
indeed, were Acted by Erronious Principles, or
the Pride and Envy of ſome Men, had a mind to
load with falſe Accuſations; as if they were very
great <hi>Hereticks,</hi> when as they onely differed from
them in Church Government, and ſome Eternal
Rites and Modes, and otherwiſe held the ſame
true and Catholick Faith and Doctrine with theſe
Men, but alſo becauſe all thoſe penal Laws, which
were made and ordained, before the time of the
Reformation, againſt <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as they call'd them,
ſtood ſtill in force and none of them was repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not ſo much as that <hi>De Comburendo Haeretico,</hi>
or for burning the <hi>Heretick;</hi> ſo that if at any
time, any one of Eminent power had a mind he
might by Virtue of that Law Arraign any one
and bring him to that diſmal and horrid puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and have it Executed upon him. Which
appears by the Examples of two Men under the
Reign of K. <hi>James</hi> the 1ſt, in the 11th year of
this Century. Which becauſe it has not of a long
while been taken notice of by moſt Writers, and
yet it is not amiſs to be known, eſpecially at this
time, I ſhall briefly relate. One of theſe Men was
<hi>Bartholmew Legate,</hi> of the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50388:200"/>
Man of an unblamable Life, ready wit, and well
read in the H. Scriptures, but diſliking the Nicene
Creed, and denying the plurality of perſons in the
God-head, and the Divinity of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt; after he had been for ſome time kept in
Priſon at <hi>London,</hi> and being enlarged again, more
boldly defended his impious Errors, and could not
be brought to deſiſt from it, even by theſe reaſons
the King himſelf brought, at laſt in an Aſſembly
of Biſhops, was Condemned of Contumacious and
Irreclaimable Hereſy, and delivered over to the
ſecular Judges, and by the Kings command ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Act <hi>de haeretico comburendo,</hi> the 18.
day of <hi>March,</hi> about Noon, was publickly burn't
and Conſumed to Aſhes. The other was one <hi>R.
Wightman</hi> of the Town of <hi>Burton</hi> near the River
<hi>Trent,</hi> who was Condemned by the Biſhop of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry</hi>
and <hi>Litchfield</hi> of ſeveral Hereſies, the firſt
was that he was an <hi>Ebionite,</hi> the laſt an <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi>
and burn't at <hi>Litchfield</hi> the 11th day of <hi>Ap.</hi>
'Tis true indeed, that this Law for burning
the <hi>Heretick,</hi> as alſo for putting him to Death in
any wiſe, was repeal'd in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second; but this is true alſo, that that repeal was
not made without a great deal of Difficulty and
Repugnance of ſome Men, and it was ſo done too,
that tho the Clergy had this power of Life and
Death taken away from them; and yet ſtill out
of this power they had ſo much Authority left
them, as to Excommunicate, as they call it, thoſe
that they ſhould account <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to deprive them of their Liberty, and take
away their goods, and the Conſequences which
follow thereupon. Which thing I have thought
fit to take notice as being not well known, and
yet worth the while to know. This repeal was
made in the 29th year of his Reign, and 77th of
the Century, in that memorable Parliament
Which was continued from the year 61 by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Propagations down to that time: There was
a certain Man of the Country of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50388:201"/>
Name was <hi>Taylor,</hi> who had defil'd himſelf with
ſo many and great Crimes and Vices, that he had
no fear, notice, or Apprehenſion of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was ſent to <hi>London,</hi> and brought before the
Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical Court. In which Court,
as they were deliberating what to Determine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a Man ſo very impious, or rather an impure
beaſt, one of the younger Biſhops, being more
vehement and hot in his Cenſures than the reſt,
gave his Judgment that this Man ſhould be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated
from humane Society by burning, and
alledges that Law for the Burning of <hi>Hereticks</hi>
with fire. Which ſeeming ſomewhat harſh to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Biſhops, and ſome giving their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one way, others another; The Earl of <hi>Hall,</hi>
the next day, in Parliament in the Houſe of Lords
propoſes and perſwades, that that Law for the
Burning of <hi>Hereticks</hi> might be Aboliſhed, for as
long as that Law was not yet taken away and
repeal'd, it might come to paſs that what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or Sect ſoever came uppermoſt, the profeſſors
of that, by Virtue of this Law, might put to
Death by burning all thoſe that they ſhould count
<hi>Hereticks.</hi> The Biſhops oppoſed and cried out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this Petition. But when it came to the
Vote the preſent Earl of <hi>Hallefax,</hi> and likewiſe
the Duke of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> and Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>
and other great Men, Conſidering that at that
time things look'd with a fearful aſpect, and that
it was often ſeen in the Courſe of Nature, that
many times things which had been hindred and
delayed might break out again (as in that curſed
Popiſh Plot, and the preparations of the Papiſts
for the Deſtruction of the reformed Religion, at
that time was eaſily to be ſeen) and that that Law
particularly might one day be ſignally Injurious
and Deſtructive they ſo perſwade the reſt, and
make it out ſo plain by force of Argument that,
the repeal of that Law is concluded upon and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
contrary to the mind and will of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
which Bill being carried down to the Houſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50388:201"/>
of Commons, ſome Excellent Men (among which
the principal was <hi>W. Ruſſell,</hi> a great Lover of his
Countrey and Religion (and a Man worthy of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
honour) preſently Vote for it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the Bill to paſs. And ſo by Authority of the
King and both Houſes of Parliament, this ancient
Law was Abrogated and Repealed by this Act:
<q>That from henceforth, by Authority of the
King and Parliament, the writ <hi>de heretico com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burendo,</hi>
(or, for burning <hi>Hereticks</hi>) and all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
puniſhments, following upon any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Cenſures, ſhould be taken off: Not
taking away nevertheleſs or diminiſhing, the
Juriſdiction of the Proteſtant Arch-Biſhops or
Biſhops, or any other Eccleſiaſtical Court to
puniſh Atheiſm, Blaſphemy, Hereſy, or Schiſm,
or any other Damnable Doctrines or Opinions;
So that Nevertheleſs, it ſhall and may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to them to puniſh ſuch Men according to
the Kings Eccleſiaſtical Laws, by Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
Deprivation, Depoſition, and other
Cenſures, not Extending to Death.</q> What, but
alſo, how fraudulent a Liberty to all Religions
was granted by K. <hi>James</hi> the 2d, and what care
the Biſhops, moſt of them, but not all, took to
oppoſe it, is not neceſſary now to be inſiſted on,
But to return from whence I have digreſſed; Now
becauſe theſe Quakers had made no inconſiderable
progreſs in their Affairs in <hi>America,</hi> that new, and
to the Ancients unknown part of the World;
there were ſome of them, who thought it might
be a work worth the while to attempt the like
all over this part of the World, which we inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
and of which for the moſt part we have a
more ancient knowledge of; and that not onely
in the <hi>European</hi> Countreys, where we have great
dealings, but alſo in <hi>Aſia</hi> it ſelf and <hi>Africa</hi> among
the remoteſt Nations, Deſtitute of the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, and brought up in the profoundeſt
Ignorance of the truth and true Religion, with a
deſign to enlighten them, and by their Arguments
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50388:202"/>
and Sollicitations to bring them over into their
Society and the ſame belief with themſelves. And
ſo <hi>John Stubs</hi> and <hi>Henry Fell</hi> took up a reſolution,
and prepared themſelves for a Voyage into <hi>China,</hi>
that farthermoſt bound of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and moſt Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Region of the Earth. But when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
how difficult, or indeed almoſt impoſſible, it
was to gain acceſs into thoſe parts, eſpecially for
ſuch ſort of Men as they, who, wherever they went,
were the laughing ſtock and hatred of all people,
and found matter of diſcourſe and ridicule for all
that ſaw them; and Conſidering that the ſafeſt
way for them to go would be if firſt they could
get into the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and there travel about the
places that were poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi>
and under their Juriſdiction and Government, they
apply'd themſelves to the Governour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of the <hi>East-India</hi> Company in <hi>England,</hi> for
leave to make a Voyage thither in their Ships. But
they ſlighted theſe peoples requeſts. So they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the ſame favour of the Governours of the
<hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Company. But they neither
did not grant them their deſire. Wherefore both
of them, ſeeing all hopes and opportunity of this
Voyage loſt, laid aſide their intended deſign. A
like memorable inſtance there is of one <hi>Alexander
Parker,</hi> who not only propoſed, but made a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
into <hi>Africa,</hi> to endeavour if there were any
opportunity to bring thoſe poor people to the
knowledge of the Truth and Godlineſs. But he
came back again after he had been gone a year,
but gave no account (as theſe people are us'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to know more than they ſay) what he had
done in thoſe parts, and why he had made ſo quick
a return. So theſe Men made a great buſtle and
ſtir to no purpoſe at all. And when thereupon
they became very Deſpicable and Ridiculous in
the Eyes of their Adverſaries; who had not fail'd to
pry into, and to take exact notice of all that they
did, and thence raiſe objections againſt them, they
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50388:202"/>
made uſe of this excuſe to defend themſelves
with, when they had not accompliſhed what they
aimed at, that it appear'd plainly that they were
not frighted, or deterred by any dangers or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
from Proſecuting what they deſired and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but only were compell'd by neceſſity to
leave it off; and that as the Deeds of all Men, ſo
theirs too, ought not to be meaſured and approv'd
of by the Event, but from the goodneſs of inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and well meaning the deſign was begun with.
Now leaving theſe remote quarters of the world,
I will return again into <hi>Europe,</hi> and firſt into our
own Country. For ſo it was that whilſt theſe
Men, as we have ſeen, travers'd the remoteſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of the Earth; others of them came over
into our provinces, and from hence went to other
places, to propagate and ſpread abroad their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines;
theſe being of the moſt skillful and fit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them for theſe purpoſes, and eſpecially
being indefatigably induſtrious in labours, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
under Adverſities. But nevertheleſs, as none
of theſe Men, except one or two, was ſo furniſhed
by the Holy Spirit, as to be able to ſpeak the
Language of the Nation they came to wherever
it was, without the help of an Interpreter, who
himſelf ſeldom knew how to tranſlate their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
into the ſame ſenſe and words, as they ſpake
them, and beſides might either, through miſtake
or on ſet purpoſe render them amiſs. So all of
them with great vehemence, Zeal and Induſtry,
ſet about this work, but for all their care and
pains could not do much good at it. Beſides,
that they alſo, which follow'd thoſe that had gone
afore them, altho they underſtood the Languages
of the Countreys they went into well enough, yet
made but ſmall progreſſes. Wherefore in all thoſe
parts where theſe Preachers had travelled, at this
day you ſhall find very few or no Quakers. Now
theſe Emiſſaries came over I believe into our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
firſt, I believe becauſe of the nearneſs of
the Country and Liberty and toleration of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50388:203"/>
and the Multitude of Divers people follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own particular Sects of Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there were ſeveral of them that did not much
differ in Principles of Religion, and very little
in their way of living from the Quakers. The
firſt of theſe Emiſſaries and Miſſionaries, that came
over hither, were <hi>William Ames, John Stubs,</hi> and
<hi>William Caton.</hi> This was in the year 55. Not
long after theſe, followed <hi>John Higgins, Steven
Criſp, William Baily, Joſias Cole,</hi> and others. When
<hi>Ames, Stubbs</hi> and <hi>Caton</hi> were come over to <hi>Holland,</hi>
they mov'd ſome of their own Countrymen with
their new Doctrines, to ſuch a Degree, that they
raiſed <hi>ſome little Diſturbance in the Reformed Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Church,</hi> and brought a few of our Countrey
<hi>Mennonites,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> over to their ſide And
theſe made the Name of <hi>Quakers</hi> to be firſt known
in theſe Provinces. After theſe things <hi>Ames</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
to other places, but <hi>Stubs</hi> and <hi>Caton</hi> betake
themſelves to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where at that time, as
well as now, a great many Engliſh Merchants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided.
And here <hi>Caton</hi> held forth, in an Engliſh
Merchant's Houſe, to a great Number of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Dutch</hi> there aſſembled, in his own mother
Tongue, <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but his words were rendered in
<hi>Dutch</hi> by another Man, for the ſake of thoſe <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
that did not underſtand <hi>Engliſh:</hi> But this
was labour in vain, for which they gave this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
that their Interpreter had not rightly given
the Auditors the true ſenſe and meaning of what
<hi>Caton</hi> had ſaid, and the due <hi>Emphaſis</hi> of his words:
So <hi>Caton,</hi> leaving <hi>Stubs</hi> at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> goes back
again to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in which City there was now
a little ſmall Church gathered, and that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
of <hi>Dutch Anabaptiſts.</hi> Where coming into
the Aſſembly of theſe people, and there making a
long Diſcourſe by an Interpreter, for here alſo they
did not underſtand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he met with the ſame
ſucceſs as before at <hi>Rotterdam:</hi> For before the
coming of theſe Men to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> there were
certain Citizens of that City, for their ſingular
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50388:203"/>
way of living and manners, however ſuſpected
and hated by the others, that met together in a
certain houſe. There was a rumour ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
that within that houſe, there was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of fooliſh, triffling, juggling fellows met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
So there runs a great Concourſe of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
thither, ready to ſet upon them in great fury.
But the <hi>Burgomaſter</hi> of the City, comes thither
with the officers that uſually attend him. They
knockt at the door, and becauſe no body opened
it, they break it open, and there find out this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
Meeting, and ſee one <hi>Iſaac Ferner</hi> a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them, not out of a Pulpit, but ſtanding
upon the ſtairs. Him the <hi>Burgomaſter</hi> commands
to be apprehended and 3 of his hearers, for the
reſt of them were fled away in a great fright.
Theſe 4 Men were preſently carried away to a
<hi>Bethlem-houſe,</hi> or place where Madmen and thoſe
that were diſtracted us'd to be kept, as if they
were ſuch a kind of people. There was one
of theſe, to whoſe feet they ty'd a Wooden Clog
ſo that he might walk indeed, but could not
go far. He takes his Clog, and as if he had got
a battering <hi>Ram,</hi> falls a beating the Wall with it,
to ſuch a degree, that at laſt he broke it thorow,
and made a whole big enough to Creep thorow,
and ſo away he runs with his Clog on, and gets
home to his own houſe. The reſt of them, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Example, and get away too, all but one
ſoftly fellow, who thought, that if he ſhould go
away without the Magiſtrates leave, it would be
a betraying of his cauſe, a Condemning of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and Confeſſion of his Guilt, and therefore he
thought it was better to ſtand to it ſtoutly, than
to run away ſhamefully. But when the <hi>Burgo-maſter</hi>
had more exactly conſidered theſe people's
Caſe, and reflected that their Crime was not of ſo
high a nature as to deſerve a very ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he recall'd his own order, and cauſed him
that ſtaid behind to be ſet at liberty, and made
no ſearch after thoſe that were gone away. But
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50388:204"/>
theſe Men were no ways belonging to the Society
and Communion of Quakers, as was then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
believed and as our little News-Mongers writ
in their Letters, following the Common Vogue,
Whereof this is an Argument that happen'd a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after, for <hi>Caton</hi> and others of his Society, coming
hither, and hearing of what theſe people had done
blam'd their doings as being a fooliſh and mad
action, and utterly refuſed to joyn Communion
with them. As thoſe people themſelves after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
did not joyn with the Quakers, but alſo
mightily oppoſed them and ſet themſelves as great
Adverſaries againſt their Diſcipline ways and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
And altho, <hi>Ferner,</hi> he who had been their
Preacher, afterwards joyned himſelf with the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
yet at laſt he fell off from them again, and
caſting of all manner, of goodneſs, probity, and
religion, he turn'd Phyſician, but he took more
care of and looked after his own body, and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
himſelf in Riot and Luxury, than regard to
the health of his patients, and after he had rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly
conſumed his Eſtate, he betook himſelf to
little triffling Vanities and joyn'd in Communion,
Friendſhip, and faith with the Papiſts, in which
State not long after he died, and like a good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
ſtept aſide into ſome of the better ſort of
the internal Manſions And ſo I have ſaid enough
of this Meeting, and the more becauſe I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to Vindicare thoſe that truly are Quakers
from this Crime, of which they are innocent;
and to undeceive others that may lye under a
miſtake about it, by relating the whole ſtory as
I have been certified it was tranſacted. To return
therefore to the main ſtream of our diſcourſe,
when neither <hi>Ames,</hi> or his Companions could do
any thing, or very little to the purpoſe, <hi>Caton</hi> and
<hi>Stubs</hi> truly they lay ſtill for one while, Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what to do. But <hi>Ames</hi> left <hi>Holland</hi> and went
into <hi>Germany,</hi> to the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but
notwithſtanding, a while after returns into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
again, and goes to <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> But it being

                     </gap>hat he came for, and what he would be
at, the <hi>Burgomaſter</hi> ſends for him by a Sergeant,
and one one of the Citizens of the City with him;
and when they were come with undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages;
he commands them within 24 hours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the City. Which they delaying to do the
next day the <hi>Burgomaſter</hi> gives them the ſame
charge again. Which new order, beſides that they
refus'd to obey, they ſpoke againſt, and ſaid that
they neither deſerved to be uſed ſo, nor could
they bring themſelves to Comply with it, ſo the
<hi>Burgomaſter,</hi> finding them ſo twice diſobedient,
and giving ill Examples to the City, commands
them to be apprehended and publickly kept in
Cuſtody for ſix days, and then in the Evening to
be obſcurely, and ſecretly carried without the
Gates of the City, and there left with a charge
never to return again. But this command alſo
they took no notice of, ſo that notwithſtanding,
they returned back again the next day, and <hi>Ames,</hi>
in the middle of the day, in the ſight of all the
people, walked in the Market and went up to the
very Court it ſelf: Which one of the <hi>Burgomaſters</hi>
ſeeing through the Lattices, is ſaid to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
himſelf to his Colleagues thus, Denoting
not his own deſire, but the merit of the Man,
Lo, yonder's that Quaker that we might make a
Martyr of now if we would. Yet theſe great Men,
who would have puniſhed ſuch a deed ſeverly,
if it had been in another caſe, thought fit to
wink at this, Concluding amongſt themſelves,
that as long as it was doubtful and uncertain,
what the deſigns or doings of theſe people were,
that mercy was to be prefer'd before the ſtrictneſs
of juſtice; and that whatſoever the Enterpriſes
or Intentions of them were, yet that a Command
of Prohibition was alwaies leſs available, than
one that preſcribed any thing to be done; and
that many Men, if they are not reſtrained from
any thing of their own accord, are but ſo much
the more eager after, and deſirous of it if they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50388:205"/>
are forbidden: Moreover, that in a great Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
ſometimes it is a point of principal prudence
to take no notice of ſome things which we know,
and that in great Governments oftentimes, the
Authority is better preſerved, by diſſembling, than
puniſhing, ſmall faults. And indeed it was not
long, before <hi>Ames</hi> ſeeing that he could do no good
by his preſence, boldne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, or confidence, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of his own accord out of the City. From
thence he goes to <hi>Scheidam,</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and
<hi>Goud,</hi> and ſtaid in theſe places for ſometime, and
oftentimes went and return'd the ſame way, and
trys the ſame thing over and over, and ſounds
the minds of the people; when at the ſame time,
he could do, almoſt nothing by all his great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and pains and travel, but onely ſet the
minds of ſome people againſt him, and brought
upon himſelf and his followers the hatred of the
Clergy. For as ſome of thoſe, who were <hi>Ames</hi>
his moſt Zealous Auditors and followers, which
for the moſt part were <hi>Mennonites</hi> a bold ſort of
people, very talkative and Litigions, began more
freely and petulantly to give out their Speeches,
and hold their Conventicles; ſo alſo thoſe, who
look'd upon it to be their duty and place, to
ſuffer no Diminution of the eſteem and dignity of
their Church, began to hate thoſe Men, and look
upon them not only as Fools, but as Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Men of a Malignant ſeditious temper,
whoſe aſſemblies were nothing elſe, but Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of diſcord and wickedneſs. Wherefore theſe
Men gave warning to their Auditors both private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and publickly, that they ſhould have nothing
to do with them in any wiſe: And thoſe that were
moſt zealous and intent upon this Argument inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
them to be a ſort of Hereticks, and that
they ought to be puniſh'd and their Meetings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtramed:
And at laſt adviſed Claſſes and Synods
to be held for aſſerting the rights, and warding off
Injuries from the Church, and that nothing ſhould
be wanting thereunto, and to make ſatisfaction
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50388:205"/>
for any Dammages ſuſtained. This was done firſt
in the Synod of <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> An. 57. It happen'd
at <hi>Goud</hi> that one <hi>William Tick,</hi> a Man much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to the Quaker's opinions and ways, call'd
a Council or Aſſembly, of ſome of his own Gang;
which the Magiſtrate looking upon as a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Infidels, and ſending for <hi>Tick,</hi> he would
neither declare what his intention was, or in the
leaſt uncover his head, ſo he was ſent into an
Houſe of Correction. There was a Town not far
from <hi>Goud</hi> in the way to <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> In which
<hi>Ames</hi> had drawn a certain Cooper, one <hi>Martin's
Son</hi> into his Society, and here this Man alſo one
time inviting <hi>Ames</hi> to his houſe, gets together
there ſome of his Neighbours to diſcourſe of the
Things of Faith, and the good ordering of their
Lives. News of this being brought to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Place, and known to others, they ran
from every ſide to this houſe, crying out, That there
was a Conventicle of ſeditious wicked men aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
there. Which Tumult rouſed up <hi>Ames,</hi>
ſo that he walks out in a Calm Mood, and very
leiſurely paces it along, but all of a ſuddain they
fall a reproaching him with a thouſand opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
terms; and handle him ſo at laſt, that if he
had not betook himſelf to his heels, he had run
in danger of his Life. But a little while after,
theſe ſame Men, nothing fearing the violence of
the Mob, reaſſembling in the ſame place again,
ſome run away and told the <hi>Burgomaſter,</hi> what
they were a doing. And when they had told him
what theſe Men had done heretofore, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
induc'd to believe, that theſe Meetings were
Conſpiracies againſt the Common Weal and the
peace and ſecurity of the State; he ſent Sergeants
and Officers, to take <hi>Ames</hi> and his Landlord, and
carry them to <hi>Rotterdam;</hi> and there put them in
the <hi>Bethlem-houſe</hi> I made mention of not long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.
Which coming to be known in the City, ſome
of the Miniſters, both of the reformed Church,
and the Remonſtrants too, go to <hi>Ames,</hi> to ſee

him and talk with him. And they diſcourſe much
with him of many points, both of his Doctrine
and Religion, and that ſeveral times; but he
handling things ſo obſcurely and perplexedly to
any Man's apprehenſion; that other people could
ſcarcely tell what he would have; and they on
all occaſions ſtarting ſuch objections; as he, either
could not tell how or declin'd to give a plain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to, this Diſcourſe was to no purpoſe at all
<hi>Ames</hi> publiſhed a little book not long after, in
which he propoſes to the Miniſters of our reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Churches, 83 queſtions of ſeveral Articles of
Faith, for them to ſolve. To theſe Anſwers <hi>James
Coleman,</hi> then a youth, and then alſo of a happy
wit, and Eloquent Tongue, as alſo one of known
piety and probity, integrity, and uprightneſs, both
in life and manners (for all thoſe that were any
ways conſiderable for Age or Learning, deſpis'd
and paſs'd by in ſilence, as things not worth
the minding, thoſe little triffling queſtions of this
Quaker, propos'd onely for oſtentation and ſhew)
and that leſt theſe people ſhould boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as if we were ſilent and refus'd to anſwer
them, in deſpair of the Victory. And he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them not with a youthful heat, but with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
and wiſdom. And this young Man in
like manner propoſed 60 queſtions to <hi>Ames,</hi> and
the reſt of his Brethren the Quakers that they
might have whereon to exerciſe themſelves, and
ſhew their wit and parts. Now whileſt <hi>Ames</hi> was
conſined to this ſolitary place he ſpent his time
principally in Writing. And ſo beſides ſeveral
Letters to his friends, he makes and publiſhes a
reply to <hi>Coleman's</hi> Anſwers, not forreign indeed
from the purpoſe, but bitter and not to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in thoſe that ſo much reprehend the ſame
fault in others. But as to the Queſtions that <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
propoſed to the Quakers, thoſe, not <hi>Ames,</hi>
but <hi>Higgins</hi> Anſwers, but ſo as not onely, partly
declining that wherein the State of the Caſe lay
partly improperly and abſurdly, partly obſcurely
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50388:207"/>
and in dark terms, but alſo roughtly and with ill
Language he mannages, and if it were but by
this alone, betrays his cauſe. <hi>Ames</hi> at laſt being
ſet at liberty from this place comes to <hi>Leyden,</hi> and
there alſo going on with the ſame work as before,
he was caſt into ſuch another like place, full of
Spiders and Cobwebs, and there he was kept, till
the <hi>Burgomaſter,</hi> weary of his Idleneſs, or Miſery
and Sickneſs, ſent him away from thence. Then
away he travels into other provinces of <hi>Holland.</hi>
'Tis a wonder, he being a Man, than whom there
was ſcarce any of thoſe people more forward, and
travelling, over ſo many Towns and Places, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
both Languages very well, both <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
and <hi>Dutch</hi> and beſtowing ſo much labour and
pains amongſt all ſorts of People, that there were
no more that joyned themſelves with him and the
Quakers, not even in the moſt populous Cities
where there were ſo many Inhabitants <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
all ſorts and kinds of Men, and ſome very near
the Quakers in a great many things. But as the
coming and motion of theſe Men had rais'd theſe
little Diſturbances here and there, and greater
troubles and confuſions were fear'd in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
theſe things principally ſtir'd up the Careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Diligence of the Clergy, every where,
as there was occaſion to be on the watch, and look
out, leaſt they ſhould cauſe any inconvenience or
do any damage to their flock. And ſo this gave
occaſion to the Synod of <hi>Goud An.</hi> 59. To make
this decree, that all Paſtors ſhould take a diligent
obſervation of theſe Quaker's Meetings, and the
books they ſhould diſperſe, and apply themſelves
to the Magiſtrates by their Authority to ſuppreſs
theſe things, and that, if theſe Men ſhould any
where give any Trouble to our People, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the word ſhould well confirm the minds
of their Auditors in their Sermons, Catechiſings
and Viſitations. After this there was little heard
of the Quakers. For it was a long while before
the people knew what the Quakers were. Whence
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50388:208"/>
at firſt they were look'd upon as a poor ſort of
people without a Name, or place of habitation,
as a kind of Fools, and Madmen. Then as an
unquiet and troubleſome ſort of people; For
which reaſons they were caſt into Bonds and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
And at laſt they were accounted for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
up of ſome new Sects of Religion, which
wanted a new place of reſidence. And therefore
now as defiled perſons they ſeem'd fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
a far off. Some therefore in their progreſs
ſate down amongſt the Anabaptiſts or Mennonites,
an unquiet ſort of people, alwaies hunting after
Novelties. Others are believ'd to have gone over
to the Socinians, a peſtilent deceitful ſort of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
from whom nevertheleſs they are ſo far off,
that except the Papiſts there's none they are more
averſe from. It happen'd that in the year 64, the
Socinians, of which there was a great Number in
thoſe Countries, every day grew more and more,
and made ſome Commotions again and again, and
alſo here and there began to raiſe Diſturbances.
Nor muſt I paſs over in ſilence, that among the
principal Aſſerters and Defenders of the Socinian
cauſe, there was one eſpecially; who, as a Cock
can Crow beſt upon his own Dunghil, who, not
onely upon all occaſions rail'd furiouſly againſt
the Quakers, and not onely thwarted their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and Deſigns in ſome parts of theſe provinces,
but alſo could not reſtrain the force of his anger,
before he had done Conſiderable dammages to
ſome of them. Now this I find by the Acts of
the Synod of <hi>Woerd,</hi> held the year aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that our people then alſo were afraid of the
Quakers, and took care leſt by any means, any
dammage ſhould accrew to their Churches by
them. And moreover the Quakers to be Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with the Socinians.</p>
                  <p>Hence a <hi>Decree</hi> was made in that Synod, <hi>That
care ſhould be taken, that the Interdict of the States
ſhould be put in Execution;</hi> by which they had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
provided a few years before, <hi>That none ſhould
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50388:208"/>
bring the Socinian Errors, or Books into theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
or keep any ſuch ſort of Meetings, or Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
under the Penalty, That if any one ſhould do any
ſuch thing, for the firſt time as a Blaſphemer againſt
the Divine Name, and Diſturber of the Peace, he
ſhould be baniſh'd out of the Province; and for the
ſecond Offence ſhould be puniſhed for ſo great a Crime,
at the Will and Pleaſure of his Judges.</hi> Then Two
years afterwards the Legates of the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi>
preſented a ſupplicatory Treatiſe to the States, in
which they pray the order I before mentioned may
be put in Execution. The States refer that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
to the Seſſion of their ſenate. The ſenate, by
reaſon of other grave and difficult buſineſſes of
the common Weal which they had in hand, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
and delay the Cognizance of this affair. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
the Treatiſe was not to be found. The
<hi>Legates</hi> write it over again and tender it <hi>De novo.</hi>
And yet for all that could get no Anſwer. So now
three whole years were run on. Wherefore in the
year 69. In the Synod of <hi>Goud</hi> and that other of
<hi>Schonhove</hi> ſince the <hi>Legates</hi> had been for ſo long
time imployed in this affair to no purpoſe at all,
and every one eaſily ſaw, what it was that caus'd
this delay, the further Proſecution of this affair
was quite left off. But <hi>Ames</hi> and his firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
departing out of theſe Countreys, the
Quaker's affairs in <hi>Holland</hi> were principally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
by the Council and Aſſiſtance of one <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin
Furley,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant, firſt at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
then at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> who, together with his
Merchandize, had addicted himſelf to the ſtudy of
Learning, and in the favour of theſe Men, wrote
ſeveral little Tracts in Divers Languages. But
yet refrain'd himſelf from exerciſing the office of
a Teacher or Miniſter amongſt them, alledging
this reaſon for it, that he could ſafely enough be
taught at all times, but could ſcarce be a Teacher
himſelf without danger. Altho, as time and age
teach Men many things, this ſame Man afterwards
found fault with and went off from many things
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50388:209"/>
in the Doctrine and Manners of the Quakers.
From hence it appears what the Number of the
Quakers might be in <hi>Holland,</hi> and after what manner
at this Day it is included in a few familys, there
are not ſo many as that the Number of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes
can equallize that of the Citys throughout the
whole Province. And ſo long as they uſed all
manner of moderation in their way of Living, and
only took care about their own Religion, without
concerning themſelves with that of others, they
enjoy'd as much Liberty as themſelves could wiſh
for,</p>
                  <p>While theſe things were doing in <hi>Holland;</hi> in
<hi>Zealand,</hi> in the City of <hi>Middleburgh, Chriſtopher
Bertrad,</hi> an Engliſh Seaman (the ſame Man who
cauſed ſuch a Diſturbance in the Church at <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> and carried himſelf ſo inſolenty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Magiſtrate as we took notice of in the Firſt
Book) in an Aſſembly of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
in Prayer-time, he made ſuch a noiſe with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
and Clamours, and angred them to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that they thruſt him out of the Church;
Whither he preſently runing in again, they ſent for
Officers who conducted him to Priſon. Where,
when he had remained for a year and a half, there
came to him, moved at his long Confinement, and
affected with a like Senſe of his Griefs, <hi>Caton,</hi> who,
aſſoon as 'twas known who he was, was put into
the ſame place. Then both of them, at the requeſt
of the <hi>States</hi> Ambaſſadour to the Commonwealth
of <hi>England,</hi> at <hi>Newport,</hi> were ſent and put into a
Man of War, and carried over into <hi>England,</hi> being
jeered, reproach'd and vex'd all the way by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Soldiers. Now <hi>Ames,</hi> who was always
the chief man in action, as long as he remained in
theſe Parts; Conſidering, that things did not go to
his mind in <hi>Holland,</hi> and that <hi>Caton</hi> had reap'd ſuch
fruits of his Labour in <hi>Zealand;</hi> he undertakes a
journey into <hi>Gelderland,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſſell,</hi>
and goe's thro' almoſt all the Meetings of the
<hi>Mennonites</hi> in both thoſe Provinces, trying if he
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50388:209"/>
could bring over any of theſe people, who ſeem'd
better affected to his party, and indeed were pretty
near the Quakers, if not in all, yet at leaſt in many
Opinions and Cuſtomes. But here neither <hi>Ames</hi>
could make any advantage or do any thing worth
the ſpeaking of.</p>
                  <p>After this he and <hi>Caton,</hi> who was now come back
out of <hi>England,</hi> took a journey into <hi>Frieſland,</hi> to
try the <hi>Mennonites</hi> there, who, in that Province,
more than in any other part of theſe Countryes, not
only in their Inſtitutions, but alſo in their Country
Cuſtomes, and the Nature of the people, were
harmleſs, temperate, preciſe, and came nearer the
Diſcipline of the ancient Anabaptiſts, not that
which of late dayes has prevailed amongſt that
ſort of People. But here, theſe men onely ſhew
themſelves, and go away again as wiſe as they went
without any good or hurt done. But after theſe
men were gone, there were not a few, that embrac'd
the very ſame Doctrine, that theſe men came to
<hi>declare,</hi> and join'd themſelves to them with the
ſame ninds and deſires. Theſe <hi>Mennonites,</hi> and
a pareel of <hi>Socinians,</hi> that ſhrouded themſelves
under their Meetings; and that ſort of Men,
[the Family of Love] who are full of Love and
Humanity, croſs to none, open and free to all, who
hold this Notion of God, (and herein their Worſhip
of God lyes) That God is not Evil; and that they
themſelves are not ſo nither, nor would do any ill
to any body. Which ſort of men increaſing every
day more and more, and now coming abroad and
meeting together both publickly and privately, and
holding their general Aſſemblys for publck Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and conſtantly obſerving their meetings, and
by this meanes making way for the comiſſion of
many other penicious and ill things; the <hi>Menno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>
being a more Religious and ſtrict ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
began to look upon them with evill Eyes, and
be diſpleaſed with them, and lay many things to
their charge, and fill their Sermons with them.
And the Miniſters and Overſeers of our Churche
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50388:210"/>
complain'd much of this new ſort of People, and
painted them in all their Colours, and accus'd
them of being the worſt of Hereticks, guilty of all
maner of Vices, and admoniſhed their Auditors in
long and Earneſt Diſcourſes, that they ſhould by
all meanes have a care of them. Moreover there
were Councils and Synods held to Conſider of the
beſt ways and meanes to Suppreſs and Extinguiſh
in the bud this growing miſchief, and it was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained;
that they ſhould be debarr'd both from
their private Conſultations, and alſo, their publick
meetings; Whereupon the Delegates of the Synod
preſent a Writing to the Counſelors or Delegates
of the States, (we call both the one and the other
Deputies) in which they grievouſly complain,
<hi>That there were to be found in theſe Provinces, both
elſewhere and in</hi> Frieſland <hi>ſeveral of the impious ſect
of the Quakers,</hi> and they deſire of them, <hi>that the
States would maturely adviſe about it and take care
to put a ſtop to the farther Spreading of thoſe diabolical
Errours:</hi> Whereupon the States of <hi>Fri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſland</hi> make
this Law, <hi>That no Socinians, Quakers,</hi> or <hi>Dippers (for
what other Name to give them I cannot tell) ſhould
come within thoſe Territories; or if they did ſhould
be ſhut up in a Bride-well, and there kept Conſtantly
to hard Labour, with a reward moreover of 25 Gelders
of</hi> Frieſland <hi>for any Perſon that ſhould diſcover any of
theſe People.</hi> This fell out in the Year 62. After
this Order <hi>Frieſland</hi> enjoyed peace and quiet from
theſe People, either they keept themſelves cloſe
within their own houſes, or the Government was
not very inquſitive after them, and thought they
had a ſufficient awe upon them. And now alſo, in
the reſt of the Provinces, after this time there was
no great account made of theſe People, both by
reaſon of the ſmal numbers there was of them, and
that they themſelves grew more moderate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tho at the firſt they were had in Contempt of
all People every where, and in their Meetings, and
goings in and out, and at their funeral Solemnities
and Burials, the Boys and Mob, often us'd to abuſe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50388:210"/>
them to a high degree; yet afterwards they grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more cautious and circumſpect in their Actions,
in ſome things, and omitting others, even this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence
of the People againſt them was left of
by degrees. Nor muſt we paſs over, how that for a
long time, a great many Pamphlets, written not
ſo much for the inſtruction of others, as the Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of their own Sect; and beſides, a great many
of thoſe bolted-out-Extempore, ill-compoſed, raſh,
tumultuous, weak, triffling, unfit not only to be
Read again, but alſo to be look'd upon, came out of
theſe men's Shops, and little Libels of Queſtions were
put out, in favour or for the defence of that Sect;
or for the exalting that, and depreſſion of other
Religions, (although ſome of theſe Libels and
Pamphlets were made and writ by ill Men, and
with a baſe deſign father'd upon the Quakers.)
Afterwards this kind of Writing, and that plenty
of Writers, was diſpleaſing to the wiſer men among
the Quakers, and they concluded that theſe fooliſh
Triffles, and the multitudes of them, had done
more hurt than good to their Doctrine and People,
and procured them more diſgrace than Credit.
Then by degrees there aroſe others, who treated
of their Affairs with a finer Wit, and more polite
Judgment, uſing more cogent Arguments, and a
more exact ſtyle of Diſcourſe, with eaſie and fluent
Language, not like the former Scriblers; And theſe
took of the ill-will and averſion which ſome had
entertained againſt them, and reconcil'd them to
a better Opinion of their Religion, making it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
more Weighty and Momentous. There came
over in the year 1670. into <hi>Holland,</hi> one <hi>James
Park,</hi> and from thence he went on into <hi>Frieſland</hi>
to <hi>Harling:</hi> And in that City obſerving many
things that he diſlik'd, both amongſt the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and amongſt the <hi>Mennonites:</hi> Of which two
ſort of People, almoſt all the whole City confiſted:
He returned back again into <hi>Holland,</hi> and coming
to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> writes a Letter to the People of
both thoſe Churches: 'Twas a tart Letter, and full
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50388:211"/>
of contumelious Accuſations and Reproofs, as if
the Religion of them both were only a barren Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and their Lives the heigth of all manner of
Hipocriſie and Impiety, and a Denial of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
with a denunciation of Threats and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations
againſt them, as if it were in the Name,
and by the Command of the Divine Being himſelf.
This Letter was ſent to <hi>Harling,</hi> by <hi>Cornelius Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph,</hi>
and <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Iſaac Buylard,</hi> the Father
and Son, all of them Citizens of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and
formerly <hi>Mennonites,</hi> but now turn'd Quakers.
So to <hi>Harling</hi> they all go. They purpoſed firſt to
Read the Letter in one of the <hi>Mennonite's</hi> Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and then ſend it to the Miniſters of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches in <hi>Frieſland,</hi> for them to Read.
Moreover, they concluded to ſend and diſperſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Pamphlets treating of their Opinions, up and
down the Country; and to poſſeſs People's Minds
as much as they could, and try all ways and means
that they could poſſibly think of to promote the
intereſt of their Society throughout <hi>Friſeland:</hi> For
which thing, the <hi>Buylards</hi> ſeem'd the moſt proper
Inſtruments, both by reaſon of their long Dealing
and Commerce, and Acquaintance and Familiarity
with many in thoſe parts.</p>
                  <p>With theſe deſigns therefore and hopes they all
three together go directly to <hi>Harling,</hi> the entrance
and gate of that Province. <hi>Cornelius Rudolph</hi> (it
being an Holiday) goes preſently into one of the
<hi>Mennonite's</hi> Meetings; (the <hi>Buylards</hi> ſtaying in the
mean while in their Inn to reſt themſelves) and
after all the Exerciſes were over, draws the Letter
out of his Boſom; and the Chief of them not
ſeeming averſe to it, tho' many of the People were
againſt it, yet at leaſt he reads it over to them all,
that they might all know what they were to be
accounted of, who they were that corrected, and
took ſuch care of them. This almoſt all of them
reſent as a very hainous thing; and ſet upon him
with great clamour and violence. Not to make
more Words of it, they fetch the Beadle of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50388:211"/>
and he carries <hi>Rudolph</hi> away into a ſecret place.
Then the <hi>Buylards</hi> are fetch out of their Inn and
carried thither too. And thence, two days after,
to render their Undertaking the more contemptible
to ſome, and inſpire others with the greater Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
againſt them, they are tied together by night;
and becauſe they would not go of themſelves, are
carried to <hi>Leeweward,</hi> the Capital City of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and put into the <hi>Bridewell</hi> there. Where
at their firſt coming they were kindly received and
civilly entertained by the Governors of the place,
who did for them what they would, that they might
go into the Conclave which they would have them:
Afterwards, when they were grieved to accept the
offer'd civility, they thruſt them into ſuch a kind of
a Cellar, as they, not being us'd to ſuch a horrid and
dark Habitation, and accuſtomed at home at their
own Houſes to live plentifully, through want and
grief within a ſhort ſpace of time fell very Sick
together. Several ſorts of men come to viſit them,
and they Diſcourſe with them all of Religion, and
beſtow their Pamphlets upon ſeveral of them. They
write alſo to the Magiſtrates, complaining that they,
being innocent People, ſhould be ſo uſed as if they
were the greateſt Criminals in the World. After this
they are taken out of this place, and carried into the
City Priſon, which they call the <hi>Fort,</hi> and were
brought to their Trial, which was held before three
of the chief Council of the Court; They deny no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was alledged againſt them, but only
plead that they did not know, that what they had
done was contrary to Law; for they had heard, and
were of that Opinion, that the Decree that the
Law had made againſt the Quakers, was ſome time
ſince repealed. And indeed, ſince there was no
reaſon to ſuppoſe that theſe Men ſhould tell a Lie
in this caſe; and ſince for a good while there had
no force or effect of this Law appeared; and, as
'tis a Maxim in Law, that a Law ceaſes for want
of being put in Execution, it might be likely enough
that theſe People might not know it. And they
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50388:212"/>
gave great Commendations of the Moderation and
Temper of the Senator <hi>Vierſſen</hi> in this Cauſe. But
whereas theſe Men alſo did not, nor indeed could
deny the Fact charged upon them; That they had
done ſuch a thing amongſt the <hi>Mennonites;</hi> and
that that was the deſign they went upon, with an
intention alſo by the ſame Letter to defame and
diſturb our Churches: And moreover all of them
refuſing, during their Trial, to be uncovered, and
to Sit in the ſeats where the Priſoners, or Criminals
as they call them us'd to Sit; the Judges reputing
their intended Crime as if it had been a thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed,
commanded them to be carried back
and put in the ſame Priſon from whence they came.
Now <hi>Iſaac</hi> grew very ill; therefore he had a Bed
ſent him for him to lie upon; but his Father, and
Companion <hi>Rndolph,</hi> being ſoon taken away from
him, were thruſt into the company of divers Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
and wicked Men, wich afflicted them with
a double grief, both becauſe they were dragg'd away
from their dear Friend, and he too drawing near,
as it ſhould ſeem, to Death, and ſo he ſhould be
taken from their Embraces who was a Perſon ſo
deſirable to them; and they penn'd up amongſt a
parcel of wicked Varlets, and as they aggravated
it, wild Beaſts diſguiſing their Cruelty under the
appearance of an human ſhape. And now theſe
Captives, being ſhut up in a Priſon together among
theſe curſed Villains, were plagued and tormented
night and day continually, not only with the beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Diſcourſes, but alſo the filthy and villanous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of thoſe wretched Rogues; at laſt they grew
very weak; <hi>James</hi> moreover being an old man of
70 years old; <hi>Rudolph</hi> indeed began to grow much
worſe; but <hi>James</hi> to ſuch a degree, that he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a deadly Diſeaſe. So this old Man had the favour
of a more open and commodious place granted
him; but then it was too late: for now his Breaſt

                     </gap> with a Cold and the ſmoaky Air,
after three days time he died of a Ptyſick. After
theſe things were over, in 7 months time, his Son
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:50388:212"/>
is let out of Priſon, but ſo as he is baniſh'd that
whole Province for the ſpace of ten years. <hi>Rudolph</hi>
is not only kept in Priſon, but is alſo order'd not
to ſtir out thence till after 5 years were over.</p>
                  <p>The Quakers make a great complaint, and alſo
publiſh it in Writing, What great injury and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is offered to their Friends in <hi>Frieſland</hi> by the
<hi>Mennonites,</hi> and Reformed, and the Governors there,
they as the Beginners, theſe as the Promoters, and
thoſe as the Executioners in their Perſecution. And
when it was objected to them, What they had done
in a Congregation of the <hi>Mennonites,</hi> and intended
to do in our Churches, they replied; That they had
done nothing elſe, but only publickly reprov'd
thoſe that had caſt Aſperſions and Reproaches upon
them and their Doctrine; and ſo that it was not
they that were the Revilers, but they had only given
an anſwer to the Calumnies of thoſe that had ſet
upon them firſt. And that the <hi>Mennonites</hi> had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
reaſon to complain or find fault with ſuch a
thing in other People, whereas 'twas common with
them to do the ſame thing among themſelves every
day, and that they often fell from their Duty in this
caſe; ſo that there was ſcarce any City, but in which
they gave a great deal of trouble to the Magiſtrates
by their Quarrelli <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. But to return from whence
I have digreſſed; <hi>Cornelius</hi> remains in Priſon for
3 years; till that firſt, moſt pernicious, and to our
Provinces almoſt fatal War with the French, at what
time the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> drew his Troops to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this Province of <hi>Frieſland.</hi> At what time
they diſmiſſed this Man out of Cuſtody, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to depart out of their Territories.
And from that time the Quakers began to ſhew
themſelves more in <hi>Frieſland,</hi> and to increaſe more
and more, and more freely to act; they now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
better acquainted, and reconciling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Opinions and Diſcourſes of the People,
and being leſs uncouth to their ſight and hearing.</p>
                  <p>At ſeveral times there went through theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
to viſit their Friends, <hi>Fox, Barclay; Penn,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50388:213"/>
Keith,</hi> and others. But there was nothing worth
remembring done by theſe Men; ſave that <hi>Barclay</hi>
at ſuch time, as the Ambaſſadors of ſeveral Kings
and Princes were met together at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> to
Treat about a general Peace; he alſo interceeds
to procure a Peace for all their Churches, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
a Letter thereupon to each of theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and withall certain Theological Theſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Heads of their Doctrines, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
affixes them to the Doors of a certain Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
and ſubmits them to the Examination of
all Men: And alſo, That <hi>William Penn</hi> and <hi>Galen
Abraham,</hi> a Phyſician, and alſo a Preacher amongſt
thoſe <hi>Mennonites,</hi> which we account all, or for the
moſt part of them at leaſt, to be <hi>Socinians:</hi> At the
ſame time almoſt at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> diſputed in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Houſe, of the ſigns of the New Church, and
extraordinary Call of Miniſters; and that after
ſuch a manner, as <hi>Penn,</hi> who, after the manner of
his Nation, ſpake nothing but in a premeditated
and ſet form of Speech; ſhew'd upon this occaſion
that when he had a mind to it, he was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the faculty of anſwering Extempore, to the
ſuddain and large Diſcourſes of others; but the
other ſo abounded in multitudes of words, as he
never came at the ſtreſs of the matter where the
cauſe lay; And where he could not tell how to
bring cloſe Arguments to the purpoſe, he either
very ingeniouſly put of giving an anſwer at all, or
turn'd it into Joke and Banter, and ſo it ended after
the ſame rate as Diſputations moſt commonly do.
The Quakers are wont when they talk of the
Things that happen'd to them in theſe Countries,
to ſay, That they never ſuffered ſo much, but that
the benefits they now enjoy do more than counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
it; and that whatſoever they have ſuffered,
that they have ſuffered nothing for any ill Deed or
Crime, which even thoſe that are moſt inraged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, never pretended to object againſt any
one of them; and that indeed they have not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for their Doctrine and Religion, ſince that at
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50388:213"/>
the time they ſuffered, thoſe who were their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
did not ſo much as know what their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Religion was; and ſuch their Religion
was looked upon as Error through miſtake had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
it; and when afterwards, what their
Doctrine and Religion was, began to be more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known and conceived by Men, and that not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuſpicion and by conjecture only, but certain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
and due apprehenſions thereof, that thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
no Injury or Violence was offer'd to them
by any Perſons whatſoever, upon the account of
their Doctrine and Religion. Moreover, thus they
will go on to argue with you, and ſay, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they cannot abſolutely forget, nor totally
blot out of their mind the remembrance of what
had befallen them in theſe Countries, yet that this
they can do nevertheleſs, to take no notice of, but
bury them in perpetual ſilence, and to rejoyce in
their preſent enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>Now there ſprings up a new race of Men, a new
Sect, Diſcipline, and new way of living, in theſe
Provinces. Theſe were comprehended in that
Communion and Society, which they called <hi>Labadiſtic,</hi>
from the Author and Gatherer of it, one
<hi>John Labadee,</hi> a French Walloon, formerly a Papiſt
and Jeſuit; afterwards coming over to our ſide, a
Miniſter of the Goſpel in ſeveral of the French
Churches; laſt of all, at <hi>Middleburgh</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi>
but he was put out of his place for refuſing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Judgment and Decree of the Walloon
Synod, (for ſo here they call the French Churches)
of ſome Fact he had done; A very ripe-witted and
ſubtle Man he was indeed, moderately Learned,
but above meaſure Eloquent and Rhetorical, and
beyond expreſſion, prompt and ready to ſpeak Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore
upon any ſubject: Of this Man various
were the Opinions and Senſes of the People. For
thus they that were Adverſaries to him deſcribed
him, as a Man of a ſickle temper, and always
changing, diſdainful, yielding to none that were
his Superiours, to his Equals arrogant and proud,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50388:214"/>
and to his Inferiours altogether intollerable; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Mind nor Manners the ſame ſort of a Man
that in Countenance and Habit he ſeem'd to be,
making ſhew of a great deal of Modeſty and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
but full of Craft in Counterfeiting and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation;
though better at playing the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
of what he was not, than Diſſembling what
he was; ſo that there was no Man living more fit
or better qualified, under a ſpecious pretence of
Goodneſs, and ſhew of Religion, to tickle the
Minds of unwary People, and circumvent them as
he pleas'd. There were others that lov'd the Man
well, and were his Followers, and familiar Friends,
and moſt intimate Acquaintance, as could ſcarce
ever endure to be out of his Sight; and theſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
his Praiſes, as one that far exceeded all the
Doctors of the Churches, and a Man ſent on a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Embaſſy from Heaven to Mankind, who
thought and did all things Divinely, and with a
Mind perpetually converſant in Heaven, and from
thence deriv'd, inſtituted, and was to perfect the
Work of Reformation, to others either altogether
unknown, or an ungrateful task they would not
care to undertake, or that it would ſeem an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
burthen, or of ſuch a kind as no body
would be able to go through with. Others there
were that had entertained a middling ſort of an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of him, between both theſe Extreams, and
they look'd upon him as a very excellent Man,
and a very uſeful and neceſſary inſtrument for the
Reformation of Life and Manners, and likely to
become their undoubted Reſtorer, but that he was
a little too haſty and ſevere, and almoſt paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intent in the weighing and correcting of Men;
and ſo by over-doing, did undo and ſpoil what his
Intentions aim'd at.</p>
                  <p>Of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Society there was as it were another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
one <hi>Anna Maria a Schurman,</hi> a noble Maid, and
very Rich; and more than that, which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50388:214"/>
abounding in a univerſal Learning and

and the Knowledge of very many Languages, not
only of the European, but alſo of the Oriental
Tongues, and that not only of thoſe that were
more anciently in uſe, but of the modern times;
ſo that in this Sex there has either never, or at leaſt
very ſeldom been ſeen, a more illuſtrious or emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Example; ſo that hereby ſhe was become the
love and delight, and as it were, the Lady Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Learned of her time; which ſhe her
ſelf afterwards took notice of, and deplored, in a
Book which ſhe Writ, and Intituled it, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.
Of this Society there were Members, many of the
Nobility and People, but they were ſuch as were
of the beſt Eſteem, and Monied Men in whom
there was either an inclination or intention of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and a forſaking of evil Company, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and avoidance of the frail and fleeting
things of this World. A fit Society this, for thoſe
that were thus diſpoſed; for thoſe I say, who in
this light, tranſient, and ſoon periſhing ſtate of the
Affairs of the whole Univerſe, and in ſo great an
abundance of the wickedneſs of Mankind, and thoſe
great numbers of Chriſtians as they pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
who only are ſo in name, and not reality,
were nauſeated and tired with what they heard and
ſaw, and to whom Chriſt alone and their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Souls by him, was their only deſire
and care. The firſt Houſe this Society had was
at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> Then at <hi>Altona</hi> upon the <hi>Elbe,</hi>
where <hi>Labadee</hi> deceaſed, being a Man mightily
belov'd by all thoſe of his Party. Laſt of all at
<hi>Wiewerd,</hi> a Town in <hi>Frieſland,</hi> not far diſtant from
<hi>Leeweward,</hi> where they had a very ample Houſe,
formerly the Manſion-Houſe of the <hi>Waltars,</hi> and
then afterwards Hereditary to the Family of the
<hi>Sommeldices.</hi> In which place not long after this
Society was diſſolved and diſpers'd about, rfter the
manner of the Primitive and moſt bleſſed State of
the Church, which a great many People preſag'd
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50388:215"/>
and foretold from the very firſt, and ſo all this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
was loſt, and all thoſe Treaſures which
ſeveral of the Society had contributed towards it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
were turned into Aſhes. Now before this came to
paſs, this noble Maid, being now ſtricken in years,
and almoſt decripit, arriv'd at the end of her Race,
and Dying, was Cloth'd with Immortality: Happy
ſhe, had ſhe not in the very midſt of her Glory
turn'd aſide to this By-Way, and having run through
part of her life, in that very Houſe, on which ſhe,
had, with thoſe prodigious Endowments of Mind,
beſtow'd ſo much Coſt, ſhe was forſaken of all thoſe
that gap'd after her Eſtate, and all her Family, and
left all alone; but only not forſaken of God, or
abandoned to Deſperation, and ſo in her mournful
Seat ſhe breath'd out her Soul, when ſhe had firſt
recommended it to God in Chriſt. Of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Maid, (to add this by the by) What was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and periſhing was repos'd not in the Sepulchral
Monument or Tomb belonging to the Family of
the <hi>Waltars,</hi> erected in the Church, as it might
have been; but without in the Church-yard, or
Ground lying about it, in the common Earth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt of her Brothers and Siſters, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to her own deſire, leaving that Monument out
of Modeſty, that Familiarizer and Governeſs of all
other Virtues, of which this Lady in her life-time
was always the perfect Pattern. But ſince, what
the Doctrine of theſe People was, what their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and how their way of Living, what their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and what their aims and enterpriſes about
the Church and other Men were, may be fully
known by their Writings, which ſeveral Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, yea, and ſome Women too, have
publiſhed concerning themſelues, and many of our
Learned Men, of them; I ſhall not now ſtay to
Recapitulate. But becauſe all this Relation tends
to this end, to ſhew what Agreement there was
between the Quakers, of whom alone in this Work
we treat, and theſe Labadiſts (I call them ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I know no better name to call them by) in
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50388:215"/>
Doctrine, and what Inſtitution to one and the ſame
purpoſe; and laſtly, what intentions they had to
joyn in Friendſhips, and contract Acquaintances,
I will ſhortly and in few words relate it. As to
their Doctrine, although theſe Men at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
little or nothing which was different
from our Faith, yet in proceſs of time they brought
in divers Innovations about the uſe of the Holy
Scriptures, and the guidance and operations of the
Holy Spirit, and Prayers, and the remaining parts
of Worſhip, and the Sacraments and Diſcipline of
the Church, ſo that they came nearer to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of the Quakers in theſe things, than to our
Doctrine. Now it appears that theſe Men, no leſs
than the Quakers, reprehended and found fault
with many things in our Churches, and thoſe of
all Proteſtants, that they were all ſo corrupt and
deprav'd, that no effect, no fruit of the Spirit of
God appeared amongſt them, nor no Worſhip of
God, but only a carnal and external One; no
mutual attention, no conjunction of Minds, no
love, no will, no endeavours for the good, one of
another, or the common good, that was to be
ſeen. Laſtly, That no one's Life and Manners
anſwered what they all profeſs'd, or the Example
and Precepts of Chriſt. And as this was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
and quarrel of the Quakers, ſo in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was it of theſe People too, that with theſe
vices above others were infected thoſe that were the
Prelates and Preachers of the Word, and Stewards
of the Myſteries of God. Laſtly, theſe People
thought thus, that they were the Men from whom
the beginning and firſt Examples of the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church was to be expected, who alſo
were wholly intent upon the famous work of this
Reformation; Juſt as the Quakers thought, that
this was chiefly reſerv'd for them, and that they
were in a ſpecial manner obliged to go on with
this Work of Reformation. So great was the Fame
of this Society, that there was ſcarce any place in
theſe Countries where there was not a great talk
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50388:216"/>
talk about theſe Teachers and Workers, ſo that
in Foreign Countries there was ſcarce any where,
unleſs it were among ſuch People, who have no
regard to what is done abroad, who had not heard
ſomething of them. Therefore when theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
were gone over into <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi>
at firſt indeed there were ſome of theſe Men who,
being averſe from the State of the Church as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Biſhops, contained themſelves within their
own Churches which were more remote from, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
rites and ſplendor, and a worldly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
polite, as they call it, and elegant Life and
Converſation, who alſo undertook the Miniſterial
Function. At laſt, alſo the Quakers, who as ſoon
as ever they heard of this ſort of Men, and their
plain Religion, and way of Life that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
they began to think in good earneſt of
this Society of People, and to be better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them, and to conſider ways and means
amongſt themſelves how they ſhould come to
enter into Conſultation with them. I know that
there was one of thoſe Miniſters of the Goſpel, ſo
averſe from the Epiſcopal way, and addicted to
Presbyterial Churches, who not only himſelf writes
to this Society, but alſo communicates his thoughts
upon this ſubject to an eminent Quaker, which
Man when after that time he foreſaw many things
from the face of the Kingdom, which tho not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
true indeed, yet ſeeming very probable and
likely to come to paſs, at that time he was not
ſuch a fearer of Epiſcopacy, but that one might
read in his Countenance, and ſince he was a Man,
that one time or another it would come to paſs,
as afterwards it happen'd, that he was made a
Biſhop. The firſt of the Quakers that came from
<hi>Scotland</hi> to the Labadiſts to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> was
<hi>George Keith,</hi> a Man both very skillful in, and
much us'd to Controverſie and Diſputes. After
him, comes out of <hi>England, R. Barclay,</hi> a Man
likewiſe of great Experience, and well ſeen in
the Defence of his Religion. Theſe Men, one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50388:216"/>
another, treat about this matter with <hi>Labadee,</hi>
and the reſt of them, on whom the Government
of the Society lay. But when the Quakers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
their Mind briefly, and in a common Style,
but they on the other hand us'd ſuch deep and
far fetch'd Speeches, and thoſe ſo round about the
buſh, and turning and winding, and ſo much Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
or endleſs Talkativeneſs, that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
knew not what theſe Men would ſay, or how
to know or find out and diſcern their Opinions,
Inſtitutions, and Intentions, or where to have them,
(which alſo had often happen'd to our People en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
of theſe Men about theſe things) and now
began to ſuſpect, that they were not ſuch a pure
ſort of People, and were either bordering upon
ſome Errors, or privately entertain'd and bred ſome
monſtrous Opinion. And when the Quakers
tried again at another time, to ſee further if by
any means they could bring things to a Conſent
and Agreement, and a conjunction together that
they might act in common Concert, the Laba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts
not only drew back, but alſo reſented it ill,
and were ſo angry, that they thought it would
be to no purpoſe to try any farther Concluſions
with them. And either upon the occaſion of
theſe Meetings together, or from the deſigns of
ſome of their Adverſaries to reproach them, it
came to paſs, that from that time the Labadiſts
came to be call'd Quakers, which name followed
them from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to <hi>Hereford,</hi> and there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
them, ſo that Men all abroad not only
call'd them by the Name of Quakers, which to
them appeared as a horrible Title, but alſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
us'd to throw Stones at them. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
which reproach, and withal to ſhew, how
much they hated both Name and Thing, they,
out of their Printing-Office which they carried
about with 'em, publiſh'd a Writing by the Title,
ſhewing what the Argument of the Book was;
<hi>An Examination and Confutation of the Quakers.</hi>
Nevertheleſs after this, there went to theſe Laba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50388:217"/>
in <hi>Frieſland, William Penn,</hi> that moſt famous
Man amongſt the Quakers; A Man of ſuch Spirit
and Wit, as was both willing and able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with all their Adverſaries. But the end
of all was the ſame.</p>
                  <p>To which I will add this Relation, That <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Penn</hi> at this time being ſo near the—Wood,
the Summer Reſidence of that Illuſtrious Lady, the
Princeſs of—of whom, as indeed ſhe was, and
is a Princeſs who has a peculiar Talent of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Piety, and Greatneſs of Soul, in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and promoting the Intereſt of Religion, he
had heard much talk, and this Princeſs being now
there preſent, it comes in his mind, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats
it as an extraordinary Favour, that he may
have the Liberty of Acceſs to wait upon her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And ſhe her ſelf too having heard much of
<hi>Penn,</hi> admits him; but ſo, as what ſhe had heard
many ſay, runs in her highneſs's mind, that <hi>Penn</hi> was
not the Man that he deſired to be taken for, but
was either a Jeſuit, or elſe an Emiſſary of his King's
ſent to ſound the minds of the People and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees
of this Country, and therefore ſhe fore-armes
her ſelf againſt him. But when this Princeſs had
admitted <hi>Penn</hi> to her Speech; and he compoſes his
Speech not with thoſe Artificial Elegancies and
Courtly Niceties, which his former Inclination,
Education, and Cuſtoms had enabled him to; but
with the higheſt gravity, and as far as Religion
would permit, in the moſt exquiſite terms he
could deviſe; and thinking this diſcourſe might
not be diſpleaſing to the Princeſs, at the end of
it, he begs leave to make a Sermon before her
Highneſs. To which the Princeſs, to make ſhort
with him, Anſwers, that ſhe had very good
Preachers of her own, whom he might hear; and
ſhe had not far off <hi>David Fluda Giffen,</hi> a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
worthy of ſuch a Princeſs; as who beſides his
natural parts, Learning, and ſweetneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> with Probity of Life, and endued
with a ſingular gift in Preaching, was now the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50388:217"/>
worthy paſtor of the Church at <hi>Dort,</hi> a Man to
us well known and our very great friend. Which
Anſwer <hi>Penn</hi> taking in the ſtead of a civil Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
with a chearful Countenance and in kind
terms asks her Highneſs, if in any other reſpect
he might be ſerviceable to her; and ſo takes his
leave of her Highneſs. Now from <hi>Frieſland</hi> a
province of our <hi>Belgium,</hi> which is ſimply called
<hi>Frieſland,</hi> I go on to that they call <hi>Eaſt-Frieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
In that Countrey, in the chief City call'd
<hi>Embden,</hi> in the 74th year of this Century, there
were a few Quakers that appear'd there, of whom
the Principal or chief Men were <hi>John William Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asbaard,</hi>
a Doctor of Phyſick; <hi>John Borſome</hi> and
<hi>Cornelius Andrews.</hi> Theſe Men began firſt to hold
their Meetings privately, afterwards more openly,
then to publiſh books of their Tenets; to allure
and invite the more to their Communion. Which
being known, and growing publick, to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
convened moſt of the Quakers before
them into their Courts. They appear there. By
the Magiſtrates order there came thither two of
their Miniſters, one the Preſidents of the Meeting
of <hi>East-Frieſland,</hi> and another next to him, <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric
Vlderic,</hi> and <hi>John Alardin.</hi> The Senate has
under Deliberation, that whereas, as yet, they
did not rightly underſtand, other than by Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from other hands, what the ſentiments of
theſe Men was, what they did, or what they
aim'd at and pretended to, that therefore it would
be their beſt way, to hear and underſtand theſe
things from themſelves, leaſt they ſhould
ſeem to paſs a ſentence upon people before they
had heard, or known what their Cauſe was; and
on the other hand, if they were indeed found to
be ſuch as fame reported them, that they might,
in due time, obviate and prevent their attempts,
and mix them as it were in the bud before they grew
to greater ſtrength. But when theſe Quakers appeared
before the Magiſtrates, they ſtood with their hats
on, and would not pull them off altho they were
ordered ſo to do; not out of Pride or from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50388:218"/>
or Contempt of them, but becauſe it was
the Cuſtom and Faſhion of thoſe of their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and they thought that ſuch ſort of honours
were not due to Men. A great deal of Diſpute
there was about this buſineſs between the Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and thoſe Eccleſiaſtical perſons. Which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
being drawn out to a great length, and
nothing brought to the purpoſe that was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Magiſtrate <hi>Haasbaard,</hi> as being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
and moſt skillful mannager of this affair
that 2 days afterwards he ſhould appear before a
Convention of the Paſtors, and Synod of the
Church, and there, before them, ſtate the Caſe of
his Religion, under the penalty of 10 Imperials
<hi>Haasbaard</hi> refus'd this Meeting, and appears not
at the Stated day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Quakers however go
on, and in the mean while; and afterwards meet
in <hi>Haasbaard's</hi> houſe. Wherefore the Magiſtrate
lays a fine upon them of 100 Imperials a time,
as often as they met together after that manner.
They take no notice of that, neither. So the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
taking this as an affront to his Authority
and Diſpiſing of his gentle Government and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
concluded to take another courſe with this
People. Which yet before he would do, he
thought fit once again to try if he could pick out
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Men, what their Intentions, deſires and
aimes were, therefore the next day he cauſes them
to be call'd into Court before him, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with them the two Miniſters before
mentioned were order'd to be preſent, that they
might Examine them about theſe things,
and maturely deliberate upon them. For they
thus thought that it was abſolutely belonging to
the Duty and Buſineſs of the Political and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Order, to look after and enquire, what
was done in the City, and in the Church, and
with all Care and Diligence, to provide and take
Order that no Diſturbance, Faction, Tumult, or
any pernicious Error, Deceit, or Seduction
ſhould ariſe, and ſpread about among the People;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50388:218"/>
and that the Quakers themſelves, in this caſe,
ought not only to pay their Obedience to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
but alſo themſelves, of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and free will, by the impulſe of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and monitions of our Lord Chriſt, and the
Motions of the Holy Spirit, not to decline the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of what it was they inſiſted on, and the
Principles they ſo much Gloried in, but with all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginable
Readineſs to comply with the Magiſtrates
deſire herein, and to render an Account of their
Faith and Actions before theſe men.</p>
                  <p>The Quakers made their appearance, and ſtood
with their Hats on to plead their own Cauſe, and
Firſt the Magiſtrates began to reprove them, not
only for refuſing to obey their Order, but alſo,
that they had ſo far caſt of all manner of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to them, to whom, by the Laws of the City,
they were ſubject; and the Confeſſion of their
Life and Faith they left to them to declare to
thoſe, who with ſo much mildneſs attended their
Anſwer as to theſe things; Then both thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
began, with a great deal of Modeſty and
Simplicity, to ask them their Opinion of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
chief Heads of Divinity, and the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and where they Eſteem'd them to lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any Error to inſtruct them. To whom the
Quakers oppoſing their Anſwers, both Parties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into a Diſpute amongſt themſelves; and in
the Diſputation the Quakers at laſt grew ſo far out
of patience, that they inveighed againſt the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and Miniſters of the Word, and term'd their
Examination a <hi>Spaniſh-Inquiſition,</hi> and them Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Miniſters; and thereupon cry'd out, That
they would have nothing to do with them; with
which immoderation the Magiſtrate being moved,
againſt forbid them to Meet under the ſame Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty:
And tells them withal, that if yet they
would ſo do, that he would take Order that they
ſhould depart the City, and his Jurisdiction.
This was done in full Senate; But yet this
Threatning was ſo far from deterring them, that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50388:219"/>
preſently after, in the very ſame place, they held
their Meetings again. The number of the Quakers
was found to be about 10, or at the moſt, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
12 Families. Therefore the Magiſtrate ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that ſo far he might poſſibly give Licenſe
to their obſtinacy; but their Confidence increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that it would be a troubleſome thing always
to Conteſt with People of this ſort of Temper,
and that therefore it would not be Proper to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Puniſhing of them any longer, but to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
it as far as his Power, and the Condition of
the City requir'd it; ſo he calls the Quakers afore
him again, and they continuing ſtill to be in their
former tune and Refractory as before; by his
Edict and Command he orders them within 3
days to depart the City, and his whole Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and if they would not Obey, they were to
expect a ſevere Sentence to be paſſed upon them, and
this interdict they deſpiſe, and again reiterate their
Facts, and meet together nevertheleſs. This was
told again to the Magiſtrate, and the Penalty
they had incurr'd was found and read; So they
together, being ten in number, both Men and
Women, as being Diſobedient to the Laws of the
City, were ſent aboard a Ship, and carried out
of the juriſdiction of the City, with Charge that
they ſhould never, in their whole life-time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into the Province again. So the Magiſtrate
unwillingly, and contrary to his Nature and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,
dealt the more ſharply with theſe Men,
only to ſet an example before other ſtubborn
Perſons, and thoſe that might be ready to do ill
Deeds; as not, unleſs compell'd, we cut of a
Limb of the Body, leaſt it ſhould infect the reſt,
and bring the whole to Deſtruction. But they
being ſent away, ſcarce tarried one day before
they came back again. Then they were all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Priſon, which was a Cellar under the
<hi>Burgo-maſter's</hi> Houſe, and had nothing elſe allow'd
them for Food, but only Bread and Water, and
were denied the priviledge of having their Friends
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50388:219"/>
come to ſee them, or bringing any better Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for their Accommodation. But if any of
them was not well, he had the liberty granted
him of going home to his Houſe, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
till he was recovered. A little while
after they were again ſent out of the Country,
all but <hi>Haasbaard:</hi> And though they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
ſo many Hardſhips, yet reſolved to loſe
their very lives rather than give over their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes,
they return back again. Being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd,
now after the uſual manner, and as it
were, made a joke and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aughing-ſtock, they were
clapt into the ſame Priſon again, and afterwards
tranſported in a Ship out of the City and all the
Province; except <hi>Haasbaard</hi> again, upon whom,
as the Ringleader of the reſt, the Indignation and
Anger of the Magiſtrates principally fell. And
the Quakers complained and wrote, that ſome of
the Magiſtrates, eſpecially the Conſuls (they give
you both the Deeds and Names of them, I only,
which is enough for my purpoſe, ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the thing it ſelf) at this time were very
vehement againſt their Friends, and eſpecially
very high in their Words. They added alſo,
that the Miniſters of the Word were alſo more
hard and rigid againſt them, except one of whom
they ſaid and wrote, that in a publick Sermon he
had declaim'd againſt the Perſecution of the
Quakers. They paſs over his Name. I ſhall
ſpeak both of the Name and Paſſage, what was
told me by Reverend Men, who both at this
day are Paſtors and Elders of the Church of
<hi>Embden,</hi> and chief Men in the Eccleſiaſtical Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of that Tract; to wit, That there was
none of the Miniſters and Paſtors of the Church
who, beſides Refuting the Opinions of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
in Words, did any thing more; And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe Miniſters there was then one <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Holthuſe,</hi> now of Pious Memory, of whom
I remember that he was a Man both of great
ſtrictneſs as to other things, and alſo as to his
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50388:220"/>
Life and Converſation; joyned with the higheſt
lenity and goodneſs towards all other Men;
who deeply Commiſerating the Caſe and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Quakers, thought and ſaid, that
they were too too ſeverely proſecuted, but this
in his private Diſcourſes, never abroad and in
the Pulpit. Now an ill Omen follow'd; there was
an Order iſſued out to the Chamberlain to confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the Goods of the Captives and Exiles. When
neither <hi>Haasbaard</hi> nor his Mother, being called
upon, would lay down the Fine, his Goods were
all Sealed up in the Houſe, and he again driven
into Exile; from whence nevertheleſs he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
returns, with the freſher and more eager heat,
becauſe of his loſs by Death of the dearer part
of himſelf, his Wife, and his little Children left
behind; the Mother now, out of her Goods fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
to her, paying the Chamberlain the Sum of
200 Imperials. The Goods of another, a bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
Maid, were ſold by publick Outcry. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
about the end of the year there was an
Order ſet out, <hi>That no body ſhould let his Houſe
to a Quaker, or take any of them for Lodgers.</hi>
Now return back as I ſaid before all the expelled
Quakers. But all of them are again thruſt into
the ſame place, and alſo a Woman with Child,
but not ſo near her time as the Quakers thought.
As alſo, that was too great a glory of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which the Quakers told of a certain Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
Child of 3 years old, or ſcarce ſo much,
which upon a diſturbance made in the Houſe, fell
into ſuch a Fit of Trembling, with Convulſions
of the whole Body, that that day prov'd to it
the laſt of its Life. But not to repeat the ſame
thing ſo often over and over again, and to reduce
our diſcourſe to a narrower compaſs, this ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out and coming back, expulſion again and
return was made about 20 times in this and
the enſuing year. For it ſeem'd hard to the
Magiſtrate to enact any thing ſo grievous againſt
his own Citizens, againſt whom there could no
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50388:220"/>
other Charge be laid than Conſtancy in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and to the Quakers ſo to forſake their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country and Houſes, and whatſoever elſe
that was dear to them; and not endeavour to
regain their old Seats, and way of Life and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the exerciſe hereof, and without which
it cannot conſiſt. The Quakers writ boldly and
amply of this to the Magiſtracy of <hi>Embden,</hi> as
well the Dutch as Engliſh, in the Sentences and
grave Language of <hi>Fox, Green, Crocius,</hi> and <hi>Penn.</hi>
The ſubject and ſcope of them all was he ſame.
<hi>What fury poſſeſs'd their Spirits, or what weakneſs
their Minds, that had enraged them to ſuch a Degree
againſt thoſe People, that had never done any thing
that could merit their Just Diſpleaſure, or in the leaſt
diminiſh their Rights. For that they loved their
Houſes, and were ready on all occaſions to return to the
City, and to their Families, and to their Native Soil;
and preferr'd this before the Will of the Magiſtrates,
the Magiſtrates might eaſily know the Cauſe of that,
unleſs that being impatient of the Truth, by prejudice
againſt theſe mens Diſcourſe, they hindred their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and themſelves a right Judgment. For that was
not their Principle to think themſelves exempt from all
Laws, ſubject to no Government, or touch'd with no
fears, or any Expectation of Evil. That they were
not ſo lame or faultring in their Duties, nor had ſo put
off the Senſe of all common Humanity. But they were
of another Opinion, That it was God, and the guidance
of the Spirit, and their Conſcience, which carried them
on; and that there was a Religion which they had
from God, in which the firſt principle head, Strength
and Defence, was Liberty, and that not only private,
but open, publick and common; That we ſhould not
abſtain from the Preſence or Companies of Men, or
ſight and ſpeech of friends and acquaintance, or be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hindhand
in the daily performance of Good Offices and
Turns one for another; which things they that deny or
take away, totally ſubvert not only, Liberty, but alſo all
Religion. Wherefore alſo this thing ought not to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
as a Diſgrace to theſe Men, or a Crime, but
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50388:221"/>
rather in their praiſe, as a good Action that they might
eſtimate them by themſelves, if they re-call'd to mind,
that if any humane Affection, or any deſire of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſhew, had put them upon theſe Thoughts, that they
might, if they travell'd elſewhere, live a quiet and
honeſt Life, remote from theſe Storms of Contentions
and Ignominy; whereas they choſe rather to undergo
ſo many Miſeries and Calamities. And that that they
could affirm, which they ſaid without Arrogance or
Pride, That if the Magistrates were reſolv'd to go
on as they had begun, that their Friends alſo were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd,
rather than forſake their Places, or forego
their Religion, they would ſuffer the laſt Extremities,
and not only endure and undergo the moſt continual
Torments, but even the cruelleſt Deaths that could be
inflicted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo <hi>Haasbaard</hi> ſent a Leter to the Senate, out
of Priſon, whoſe laſt words, at the End of it, are
memorable: <hi>That he long'd for the time wherein God
would open the Eyes of Men, that they might ſee how
that himſelf and the Quakers were injuriouſly and
falſly accuſed, and to that Judge they committed their
integrity.</hi> In the time following, the Edict againſt
the Reception of <hi>the Quakers,</hi> was put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon thoſe who were thereof convicted, as the
Mother of <hi>Haasbaard,</hi> for receiving her ſaid Son in
her houſe, was fined 50 Imperials; and a certain
woman, a member of the Reformed Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe did not deny her Husband, who was a
Quaker, to lodge, bed and board with her, was
mulcted 50 Golden Florens. In the mean time,
<hi>Haasbard,</hi> beſides his Exile, being oppreſſed with ſo
many Cares and Griefs, which lead to Diſtempers
and Death, was over-taken by his laſt Day, and
dies. Who being dead when the perſecution ſeem'd
to die too, it reviv'd again a little after in his
3 Siſters, whereof two were unmarried, and one
Married, but who at this time did not Co-habit
with her husband. For when theſe women and
likewiſe 6 Men of their Acquaintance met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſee one another and for mutual Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50388:221"/>
ſake, by and by the Sergeants and Souldiers
come in unto them, and run upon them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
them away to Priſon, and take away out of the
Womens pockets Money and Silver Caſes, and a
watch of great Value, which they wear not out
of Pride, or for Ornament or Oſtentations ſake,
but for uſe, and while theſe <hi>Varlets</hi> ſpend one part
of their prey and ſuppreſs another part, the reſt
they carry to the <hi>Burgomaſter.</hi> Yet theſe people
ſome daies after were diſmiſſed, inſtead of a fine
which they would not pay, the things that they
had taken from the Women being detain'd. The laſt
aſſault was in the year 79, Then the hatred began
by degrees to grow leſs and leſs, and to wax old,
when it was <hi>better</hi> ſeen and known, <hi>That the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
were not ſuch a ſort of people as the Magiſtrates
and Citizens had taken them for.</hi> A Wonder <hi>this,</hi>
but yet neither new nor unknown. <hi>Charles</hi> King
of <hi>England</hi> dying, and <hi>James</hi> ſucceeding him,
ſome rich Quakers flying out of <hi>England</hi> came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Embden.</hi> Theſe the Senate were ſo far
from repelling that they receiv'd them very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and not onely granted them houſes, but alſo
the Exerciſe of their Religion, and acceſs to it,
and leave to build a publick Meeting place and
proffer'd them ground to build it upon, hoping
that that would now tend to the Increaſe and
Riches and Splendor of their City, and Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
without any Detriment, or Diſgrace to their
Religion. Moreover, the year following, after
that, a Quaker-woman, a Citizen of <hi>Embden,</hi> a
woman of eminent Condition, and ſome other
Rich and Honeſt Citizens, who had been againſt
the Perſecution, had well prepar'd the Matter; the
Senate, that had been ſo ſevere againſt the baniſh'd
Citizens, do now no leſs Hoſpitably invite them
home, than formerly they had in hoſtile manner
expell'd them, and permit them the free Exerciſe
of their Religion, and promiſe and engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Protect and Defend them therein, and
Confirm the ſame by a Decree, of which I have
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50388:222"/>
had the liberty of Peruſal. Altho this Liberality
and Beneficence of theirs was now in vain, and
too late, for theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> afterwards having heard
that <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was made King,
whoſe alone Name allur'd the minds of theſe Men
to return home to their former Seats, and theſe
Exiles of <hi>Emden,</hi> now reſiding in other places,
without fear or care Tranſacted in their affairs
with good ſucceſs, and therefore return'd their
very hearty thanks to the Magiſtrate, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
themſelves to have forgotten all former Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and that they ſhould ever retain a grateful
ſenſe of the preſent favour, Nevertheleſs that they
ſhould more willingly chooſe to remain in the
preſent repoſe and haven, wherein they were now
ſettled than to return back from whence they
came.</p>
                  <p>There are no Quakers at this day in <hi>Eaſt Frieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
ſave four or five Families at <hi>Embden; Ames,</hi>
one of thoſe Quakers who came firſt into our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
thought fit to go from thence to <hi>Germany,</hi>
and paſs through the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> as
being one who was not only ſufficiently ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in his own Countrey Language, and ours, but
alſo in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue; And here he firſt makes
his Application to his Electoral Highneſs, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had ſome Account of theſe ſort of men, and
being very deſirous both to ſee and diſcourſe with
ſome of them, as 'tis the Genius of thoſe Great
Men often to hear, learn and attain to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of many Things, he ſends for <hi>Ames</hi> to come
to him, and after he had ſeriouſly diſcourſed with
him, diſmiſs'd him kindly. When <hi>Ames</hi> had left
the Court and City, he wanders over the Countrey,
and there makes ſeveral Eſſays to promote his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
but it came to nothing; and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to <hi>Holland.</hi> But having afterwards taken
Two of his Companions along with him, to wit,
<hi>Bat</hi> and <hi>Higginſon,</hi> he goes again for <hi>the Palatinate,</hi>
and addreſt himſelf to the Prince, offering, both to
him and to his Courtiers, the books of his Sect,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50388:222"/>
deſigning thereby to engage the Favour and Good
Will of the Prince towards himſelf and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers.
But the Prince was not ſo readily taken
therewith; and beſides that, the Princes Eyes and
Ears were intent upon thoſe Affairs that concern
Religion; The Eccleſiaſtical Orders were alſo in
the way, who informed the Prince of the Nature
of theſe Mens Inſtitutions and ways, and adviſed
him, that he ſhould rather ſilence them as Men
bent to raiſe Storms and Tempeſts in his Country,
and keep them off and ſend them away parting
before they did any miſchief: So they went their
ways elſewhere but yet kept in this part of the
Countrey, and followed their deſign, and after
many windings and turnings, found ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
at <hi>Kircheim,</hi> near <hi>Wormes,</hi> whom, after
they had for ſome time heard them, they brought
over to their way, and this was all they could, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all their indefatigable Labour and Toil, effect
and bring about.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance to theſe mens Practices, <hi>William
Penn, Barclay</hi> and <hi>Keith,</hi> at that time they came
with <hi>Fox</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> ſteered their Courſe for
theſe Parts, but being ignorant in the <hi>German</hi>
Tongue, they took ſome of the Natives of the
Country along with them to be their Interpreters;
but there was nothing done by them that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of mentioning. But thoſe few Quakers, who
I have ſaid, lived in theſe places, did afterwards
increaſe to Seven or Eight Families; who after
they had by little and little united Men, and Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
together, they declined to go to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Churches, and refuſed to pay for the ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Clergy, and therefore as well the
Rectors and Paſtors of the Churches thereabouts,
as alſo the Prieſts of the Territories of <hi>Wormes</hi>
looked with an evil Eye upon them, and ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on from one thing to another began to accuſe
and ſue them, and when they could not be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their demands, which the others would not
comply with, alledging the unlawfulneſs of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50388:223"/>
ſuch Tythes and Products from their Lands
they did, inſtead of the Money due upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
take what they pleaſed from among their
Sheep, Swine, and other Cattle, whereas thoſe Men
did in the mean time by their diligence, as it were,
ſingular Providence bear up ſtill againſt their loſſes
and poverty, ſo as that they had yearly where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
both to ſubſiſt upon, and for fear of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or greater conſtraint and violence to ſatisfy
their Adverſaries; but after they had for ſome
years lived in this manner, they did that very year
that preceded the <hi>German War,</hi> wherein all that
Fruitful and Delicious Countrey was waſted with
Fire and Sword, by thoſe Men who ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo much more skillful and ready to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
then to Conqer eſpecially theſe late years, of
their own accord and in a conſiderate manner, ſo
as if they had foreſeen ſo great a War and been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of ſuch an impending Calamity, forſake
their Native Countrey thoſe Villages and Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
which they could ſcarce bear up with props
and ſtakes, and entred into a voluntary and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Baniſhment, ſo paſſed over into <hi>Penſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
being that part of <hi>Engliſh America</hi> that I
have before deſcribed in which part of the world,
each of them having Land Diſtributed and Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto them by the Proprietor of that part, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Penn,</hi> they live now in the greateſt Freedom
and plentifully enough: I have a little before
ſpoken of <hi>Penn,</hi> and ſome other of his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Travelling from <hi>Holland</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> to
thoſe People that were of their Sect at the ſame
time; <hi>Iſabel Fell, Fox's</hi> Daughter in Law and
Wife to <hi>Keith,</hi> together with a certain <hi>Dutch Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
went from <hi>Amsterdam</hi> to <hi>Herword</hi> in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia,</hi>
there to ſpeak with the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
eldeſt Daughter to <hi>Frederick</hi> once King of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
and Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> a Lady truly renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the goods of Fortune, a Princeſs the moſt
happy and famous of any of her Age, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
by their Converſation and Pamphlets, to work
ſomewhat upon her, that might tend to the uſe
and benefit of their Religion and Society. <hi>Fox,</hi>
who thought that the Fame of his Name was no
leſs known to this Princeſs, than it was in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
his Native Country, delivers theſe Women
a Letter for them to carry in his Name to the
Princeſs, that they might, by that means, have ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
acceſs unto her, and their Diſcourſes be of
more weight with her; in which Epiſtle <hi>Fox</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt
himſelf unto her in a little more neat and
civil manner, than he was wont to do, laying aſide
that fuſty harſhneſs and Ruſticity he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd
to, whereby he made no diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Perſons of high Birth and Quality, and the
meaneſt Gar-men and Porters, but now he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes
and ſaluteth the Princeſs in the moſt engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manner, and highly extolls her Piety and
Modeſty, as being Vertues worthy of a Princeſs,
and ſets forth how much all mankind at this time
receed from theſe offices and duties incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and as the State of the Church ſtood at
this preſent time, there was more need then ever
to keep faſt to them, and at laſt exhorts the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that, as ſhe had been engaged in the work, ſhe
ſhould go on more and more. When theſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
came to the Princeſs's Court, and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
liberty to ſpeak with her, ſhe who was full of
humanity and gentleneſs, and never diſdained any

that deſired to apply themſelves unto her, admits

and, according to their vain and vile Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Examples, united together and entred
into a Fraternity more feignedly then truly and
really. Now theſe itinerant Quakers found ſome
of theſe Men at <hi>Hamburg,</hi> which is the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
City of <hi>Holſatia,</hi> as alſo at <hi>Fredricburg,</hi> (a place
upon the <hi>Eyder,</hi> and frequented and partly inhabited
by the Arminians and Remonſtrants of our Country)
who looking upon theſe Men to come up very near
to their Opinions, Tenets, and Ways, and ſo begin
of their own accord prepared and fitted thereunto,
they did eaſily fall in with them; though there
were alſo ſome that were not of this Sect, but
intenſly addicted to the <hi>Mennonites,</hi> who now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated
together, and applied themſelves with all
their might and main to maintain the Aſſertors of
the Quaker's Doctrines; All theſe that lurked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Anabaptiſt, and even others alſo, tho'
they were like unto them, and followed their
ways ſtill in many things, were always ſuffered
upon the account of their Ignorance, and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Innocence, to live quietly; untill that about
two years before, the Mayor of the City of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dricburg,</hi>
then newly created, and that he himſelf,
might do ſomewhat new, and make himſelf
to be taken notice of, began to diſturb the Peace
of theſe Quakers that had hitherto been left alone,
and to create them ſome Moleſtation and Trouble;
Which when the Remonſtrants of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> came
to underſtand, and particularly, <hi>Ph. Limburg,</hi> their
Paſtor and worthy Profeſſor; and being careful
of the Safety of thoſe Men, and concerned to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the eſteem of their own Religion, urge, leaſt
that now all Men, both good and bad, ſhould ſay
they were become other ſort of Perſons and cruel,
whom moſt Men looked upon always remote from
all manner of Perſecution, that they ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
their Proceedings againſt thoſe Men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
for the continuation of their Liberty, that
had been hitherto unviolable, and entirely reſpite
them and ceaſe their Perſecution. <hi>Fox</hi> Travels
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50388:225"/>
from <hi>Holland,</hi> through the Countries of <hi>Frieſland</hi>
and <hi>Aldenburg,</hi> to go to theſe Men, taking more
Conſolation with his Friends than doing any good
to others. Thoſe fame Itinerants and Emiſſaries
of whom I have made mention before, went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and came to Regal <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> as far as the
<hi>Baltick Sea;</hi> where at <hi>Dantzick</hi> a very few alſo
of the remainder of thoſe old Fanaticks and of
the <hi>Mennonites</hi> (Men who could diſcern little
what belonged to Religion, or was to be purſued
therein, and poor, who could ſcarce by their daily
and hard labour get daily ſuſtenance) applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to them, and fell in with their Doctrine and
Counſels. Theſe Men from this time forwards
have been continually harraſſed by the Lutherans,
in whoſe Hands the Supream Power and Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is, and heavily Fined and Impriſoned. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>G. Fox</hi> did upon their behalf, as being his
Friends, Brethren and Equals, in the year 1677,
ſend a Letter to <hi>John</hi> III. King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes
with him thereby for a Tolleration for
them; concerning which Epiſtle, which <hi>Fox</hi> took
care ſhould be publiſhed in his long Diary after
his Death, this is worthy to be noted, That at firſt
it was written in <hi>England</hi> in the Engliſh Tongue,
then ſent into <hi>Holland</hi> and there Tranſlated into
the German Language; and laſtly, ſent from thence
and delivered to the King. The ſubſtance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was this: <q>That it was a moſt equitable and
righteous thing, that all Kings, Princes, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
ſhould grant Liberty of Conſcience to all
their Subjects; and by no means diſturb nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
their Aſſemblies and Divine Exerciſes:</q> He
ſet forth, that this was the judgment of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and ancient Doctors of the Church, as alſo
the modern ones, and even the Learned Men of
the preſent time we live in; And that many
Kings and Princes had Indulged this Grace and
Favour to their People, and for that reaſon were
highly worthy of Praiſe, and were really extolled
by worthy honeſt and wiſe Men: He alſo col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50388:225"/>
and pick'd out ſeveral Sayings and Sentences
turned out of Greek, Latin, French, and other
Languages; as alſo Examples and Precepts found
in Hiſtories, to preſs this matter more upon him.
But this Epiſtle was ſo written, that it look'd and
repreſented not the Work and Sentiment only of
one ſingle Perſon, but of many, and ſeemed to
take in the Complicated Sence and Advice of the
whole Society of the Quakers: Yet this Letter
had the name of <hi>George Fox</hi> only ſubſcribed to it,
and that without any other Mark and Deſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Perſons or Authority; ſo that <hi>Fox,</hi> though
a moſt-illiterate and unlearned Man, and who,
beſides the common Engliſh Books; had ne're
looked into any other, nor could he Read them,
would by no means have it thought or doubted,
that this weighty Epiſtle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o full of Learning,
and compos'd and written in ſo Elaborate a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and with ſo much Pains and Study, was not
Written by him, and his own Production, and
that he was not the Man who had daily peruſed
all thoſe Books, and made them his own; or that
it was thus Written by a Multitude or whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Men; yet ſo as that they ſhould leave it
to the Judgment of one <hi>Fox</hi> an ignorant Fellow,
and upon his Approbation look upon it to be firm
and good; and he to approve of the ſame, by the
greatneſs and Authority of his Name affixed to
it. And hence it's apparent, that there is no mind
ſo Humble, but is apt to be carried away with
the Air of Glory; yea, many times Glory and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
is moſtly coveted by thoſe who moſt contemn
it, and endeavour to introduce a Contempt thereof,
glorying and taking Pride herein, in that they
deſpiſed all manner of Glory ſo much. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it were; the Letter pleaſed the King, and
the Matter of it was very grateful to him; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that the King, either by his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or other Engagements, brought it ſo about,
that they ceaſed to perſecute them; But the ſame
Perſecution was in a ſhort time after revived and
introduced upon them: When <hi>Fox</hi> writes a new
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50388:226"/>
Epiſtle to the King; and deprecates the Injuries
and Dangers brought upon thoſe People his Friends,
interceding with the King thereby on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half;
diſcovering now, in this his Letter, himſelf
entirely as he was, and not as before, hand over
head, without all manner of ſhame and bluſhing,
Arrogating to himſelf the Work of other Men,
and a falſe praiſe: But this Letter did not pleaſe
the King ſo well, ſo as either to purge them from
what was laid to their Charge, or to free them
from their Sufferings. Theſe Quakers are even to
the preſent time a prey and a laughing-ſtock to
almoſt all the Inhabitants; and they had long
ſince been utterly ruined and deſtroyed, all of
them, had it not been for a few among them
that had ſome ſmall Subſtance, who out of their
own Neceſſities have ſuſtained them under their
oppreſſive Poverty; And had it not been alſo for
thoſe Quakers in <hi>Holland,</hi> who are ſuperiour to
theſe in Fortunes and Eſtates. And now, that I
may paſs over nothing that may appertain to the
State and Concerns of the Quakers, before I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from theſe Men in <hi>Germany.</hi> It will not be
impertinent to inſert the ſhort Hiſtory of thoſe
Men, lately ſprung up in <hi>Germany,</hi> and who ſtill
coverſe and are ſcattered up and down in divers
parts of the ſame Country, which are called by
the name of <hi>Pretiſts,</hi> and whom many look upon
as the Brood and Offſpring of the Quakers, or
Enthuſiaſts, ſprung up again in theſe times, and
being as it were lopped off, grow again, and bud
out from the old Stock; concerning which Men,
there are many who have taken upon them to
write, who have diſcovered themſelves to have
heard and imagined more things concerning them
than they really know; but I ſhall not take
in all herein, but will leave out the larger
paſſages, and only take notice of the Principal
Heads. For ſeeing that in ſo great a multitude
of Chriſtians, as well elſe where as in <hi>Germany,</hi>
who declare themſelves to be the Diſciples of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50388:226"/>
bleſſed <hi>Luther,</hi> and to follow his Doctrine, and
way of Living, moſt of them all were indeed
affected with a great deſire of, and love to their
Religion, but yet retained, through great Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and intollerable ſuperſtition, the obſervance
of ſome Rites and Ceremonies, and which in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deed had little or nothing in common, with
ſome Religion, Piety and Holineſs, and this was
not ſo abſtruſe, but that it was apparent to all, ſo
as that they might behold it with their Eyes, and
handle it with their Hands; yea, and the ſame
was now conſined, and, as it were, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ealed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
and manners, ſome Godly Men, zealous
towards God, and for the good of Men, and
ſuch as were alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both Learned and Experienced,
bethought themſelves, that it was every ones du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with the utmoſt care and Diligence, to heal,
or cut off this Malady, or Peſtilence in the
Church, which crept dayly more and more into
Men's Lives and Converſations.</p>
                  <p>Among theſe, in the Year ſixty one, one <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus
Broſgeband,</hi> a Deacon of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church,
in the City of <hi>Roſtock,</hi> in the Duchy ef <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>chelen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
ſets up in Oppoſition to theſe Practices, and,
ſo in a book written by him in the <hi>German</hi>
Tongue, ſets forth, and notes the various Errors
that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> were conſcious of; and at the
ſame time ſpeaks moderately and gently concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Controverſies that were between the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi>
and other Reformed, concerning the
Lord's Supper, and ſets down his own Opinion in
the matter, with his Reaſons for the ſame. He was
indeed a man that ſtudied, and was a lover of
Concord and Peace between Friends, who held the
ſame Faith, which is very good, and the very name
delectable: but he got little Praiſe and Thanks for
his Pains; nay, this his labour and endeavour went
ſcarce unpuniſhed; for there were many Perſons
that forthwith fell at variance with him hereupon,
reviled him, were very bitter againſt, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to him, which he by his long-ſuffering and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50388:227"/>
patience, wore out, and diverted. After this <hi>Henry
Muller</hi> became one of this number, who in the
ſame City was Teacher and Profeſſor of Divinity
in the Church and Univerſity, and a Perſon of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
Learning and Piety, and who about five or
ſix years after <hi>Broſgeband</hi> did in like manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
thoſe of his own Religion, concerning their
Errors, and Lives and Converſations, that were
unſuitable to Religion, and eſpecially in a book
written alſo in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue (that it might
come into the hands of all thoſe to whom it did
more peculiarly belong) handling that Paſſage of
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> which is in his Firſt Epiſtle to
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 12. c. 2. v. (in which place the
Holy Apoſtle, that he might make way for to
ſhew to thoſe Men, how much they were now
Honoured and Enrich'd by the Spirit of God,
puts them in mind, how in times paſt they were
carried away to dumb Idols, led and driven there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by unclean Spirits) he wrote that Chriſtians
now a-days, had not left their dumb Idols, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they cleaved, to whom they attributed all
things (neglecting true Religion, and ſetting true
Godlineſs at naught) to wit, The <hi>Pulpit, from
whence they Preach to the People, The Baptiſmal
Font, The Confeſſor's Tribunal,</hi> and <hi>the Altar.</hi> By
which words many that were of the ſame Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with him, took themſelves to be much Inſpired,
and ſo lookt upon him to be their Enemy, and
did not only content themſelves with injuring of
him in his fame, and the eſteem had of him; and
ſeeing that the Name of the Quakers was at this
time very rife every where in <hi>Germany,</hi> and that
the ſame, eſpecially with the rude multitude, and
men of the moſt abject Condition; who catch
hold of all things without any diſtinction of
Truth or Falſhood, was much envied and hated,
and not free from danger. There was a certain
Perſon of ſome note at <hi>Hamburg</hi> (for the thing
may be ſaid without nameing his Name) though
of no great fame as to his Learning, and of an
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50388:227"/>
immoderate and proud Diſpoſition, and full of
words, who was ſo tranſported with Rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Muller,</hi> that he accuſed him, and laid to
his charge, That he was not only guilty of other
Errors, but more eſpecially of Quakeriſm, and
thus by ſtirring up the People, did, as it were, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the Laws with Menaces, that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
and proceed no further, which matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Muller,</hi>
though he was willing, but not able to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to his deſigned purpoſe; yet he was deſirous
to be freed from the ſcandal caſt upon him, and
to remove the ignominy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rging, That he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
no perverſe or ſtrange Doctrine, and was
not the man his Enemy repreſented him to be,
which he brought ſo about, that having got the
clear Teſtimonies of ſeveral Profeſſors in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities
of his Orthodoxy, and of Doctors in
Churches; he Publiſhed the ſame in his Apology,
and ſet them in oppoſition to the Reflections and
Scandals caſt upon him by his Enemies: Now
<hi>Philip James Spener,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Francford</hi> upon
the <hi>Meaſe,</hi> of a Church Conſtituted according to
the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Confeſſion, did within a few
years proſecute the Foot-ſteps of theſe Men; as
alſo <hi>John Heari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the ſame Confeſſion at <hi>Trarback</hi> on the <hi>Moſel;</hi>
both of them men of that Induſtry and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to be able eaſily to keep up the Fame of
their great Learning and Probity, and not be
thought to ſeek after the Favour and Glory of
Men herein; theſe Men did, in their Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
Diſcourſes, and Private Exerciſes, bend all
their Endeavours this way, that they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
and root up theſe Evil Weeds and Thiſtles
from Mens minds. <hi>Spener</hi> began his Work with
thoſe things, which did more immediately incu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
into the Senſes of Men, and which ſeemed to
imitate, and have relation to Popery, that was ſo
hateful to the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> by reaſon of the dull,
fooliſh and profane Rites and Ceremonies that are
therein, and ſuch as are not barely eſtranged from
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50388:228"/>
true Worſhip and Sanctity; to wit, in their
Churches and Publick Aſſemblies, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their Pompous Tables, Organs, Altars, Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Garments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from hence he proceeds
to other things, which men do meaſure by uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and meer handling, ſo as that a pretty num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of People, in a ſhort ſpace of time, did, by
his means, not only Loath all that Pompouſneſs in
their Churches, but alſo laying aſide many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Rites, applyed themſelves to Exerciſe the true
Faith and Life of Chriſtians: But this was not all,
but they did often times meet together in their
Houſes, and ſo did inſtruct and exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
every one, as well as they were enabled out
of the Holy Scripture to follow the ſame Sincere
Life and Faith, and to do all the Duties incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
upon them towards Men: Hereby alſo in the
ſame manner, by his Inſtructions, did ſo ſtir up
and affect the Minds and Conſciences of his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that very many of them, in thoſe places,
and adjacent to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> did often times meet
together in one place; and this they did aſſume
as a common Rule and conſtant Practice among
them, that laying aſide thoſe Diſcourſes which
concerned Queſtions and Diſputes, or idle and
unneceſſary Enquiries, which were more fit for the
Schools than for the Formation of Manners,
they only imployed themſelves herein, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to know and diſcern Chriſtian Truths,
without which, Faith and a Chriſtian Life cannot
be; they inſiſted upon the ways and means how
to attain to this Life and Faith, and Inſtructed
and Exhorted one another, in ſhewing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
of the Same. <hi>Spener</hi> is called from <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
to <hi>Droſden,</hi> into the Elector's Court, there to
exerciſe the Office of Chief Preacher; and ſeeing
there were many things to be Corrected and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
in the Court, and that this could not be
done by gentleneſs and pleaſant Artifice, but by a
Tragick Gravity and ſeverity, and that there was
not, beſides this, ſuch a number and choice of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50388:228"/>
then for the purpoſe, which withal, required
one endued with much Religion and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
in the mean time, there were ſome Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in the Univerſity of <hi>Lipſick,</hi> deſigned
and appointed for the Miniſterial Office (they
were only two at firſt) that began to ſtir
in this matter, and this they made the chief
exerciſe of their capacities, this was the bent of
their ſtudies, that being themſelves ſtored with
this knowledge, and exerciſed in this ſort of Life,
they might afterwards teach their Auditors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their care, the like documents and ſtir
them up to the ſame; and therefore they daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
their people and held their Aſſemblies,
and did not only urge their Diſcourſes from the
Scripture-Authority, but did draw out from the

of the ſacred Trinity, to the increaſe of the New
Man, of holy Inſtruction, and exegetical Divinity,
as alſo to an example of an holy Couverſation.</hi> They
were termed the <hi>Philobiblick Colledges.</hi> Theſe
Students Endeavours and Studies were ſome time
after imitated by others, and even by ſuch as were
of greater years, and Maſters themſelves; ſo that
ſome of them handled the ſame with the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
Conſent, in the Publick Auditories, in their
Academical Lectures; the Chief whereof were
<hi>Auguſtus H. Francus,</hi> the Diſciple and Companion
for a long time of <hi>Spener,</hi> and <hi>John L' Schadeus,
Francus</hi>'s Chamberber-Fellow both of them Maſters
of Art, and Learned and Eloquent. There was
moreover a new Acceſſion of Citizens, and of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50388:229"/>
too to theſe Collegiates, who alſo encouraged
their Paſtors and Guides in Divine Things, to the
ſame work; but as for the moſt part it happens in
ſuch Aſſemblies, there was in proceſs of time ſo
great a deſire in ſome to frequent theſe Colledges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that ſome Students declined to go to the Publick
and Private Schools; ſome of the People would
not go to the Churches, ſome deſpiſed them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
went thither to partake only of the Lord's
Supper ſparingly, and ſome diſregarded all other
ordinances and inſtitutions in compariſon of theſe
Congregations and Meetings. But theſe Students
were for the moſt part perſons of a mean conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and of no fortune, and but of very indifferent
Parts and Learning, or only of ſuch a plebean
ſtamp, or late initiation into the republick of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature,
and that their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>udition, as a natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
and Principal vice attending of it, was
tumultuary, but Maſters over Boys, and for that
reaſon ſeeming themſelves to be capable to do any
thing, yea, as, the ſaying is, to hit the Crow in the
Eye, whereof there is good ſtore in that City and
Country; and the people, eſpecially the women,
were very rude and mean, who every where fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Crows through dirt and mire, and lived
from hand to mouth, and were in the mean time
puffed up with the oſtentation of being honoured
and eſteemed, and with ſome enſigns of a triffling
glory. And tho ſome of thoſe Maſters and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
of whom I have juſt ſpoken, would not ſeem
to be of the like Sentiments and Act in the ſame
manner as theſe Men, yet they did not gain-ſay,
when it was not expedient they ſhould be ſilent;
wherefore that ſilence of theirs did at length bring
them under no ſmall ſuſpicion, and they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to be not much remote and diſtant from
thoſe extreams. Whence they became at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
and hated by the other Students, Citizens,
Teachers, Profeſſors and Paſtors, then they put an
ill Conſtruction upon all their doings and ſpoke
evilly concerning them, and laſt of all, became to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50388:229"/>
be interdicted and prohibited: But thoſe Counſels
were found to be of no effect; for the more the
one was enraged and bent to ſuppreſs, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to extinguiſh the Sect the more did the other
hold to it stiffly and obſtinately. But leaſt too
great a diſturbance might be wrought and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
enſue thereon, for the further avoiding of
danger, ſome of the Colledges were diſſolved or
diminiſhed: While theſe things were in Agitation
<hi>H. Francus,</hi> and ſome other Students came accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Citation of the Senate, and order of the
Profeſſors of <hi>Lipſick</hi> into that City; where each
of them were by ſome delegated for that purpoſe
Interrogated and wearied with innumerable cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and fallacious queſtions in reference to their
ſentiments concerning every Article of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and what it was they did reject, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therein abundantly ſatisfied their inquiſitors,
they were diſmiſt, upon condition that they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
themſelves ſo as to have a regard both to their
Dignity and Advantage, and neither publickly
nor privately to teach the people any otherwiſe.
Next year, there were Letters ſent from the great
Conſiſtory or Eccleſiaſtical Senate from <hi>Dreſden,</hi>
of which Conſiſtory the Elector is Principal, to
the Academical Senate of <hi>Lipſick,</hi> wherein they
were Commanded to Aboliſh all ſuch Colledges,
and that he ſhould commit all that made reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to Priſon, as a juſt puniſhment of their
Contumacy and for a check upon their further
oppoſition; which thing ſtruck ſuch a fear into
ſome of them, that they loſt all their courage and
withdrew from the whole aſſembly and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
purpoſes. But others on the other hand with
great conſtancy and contumacy, proceeding from
the greatneſs and hardineſs of their minds, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
and went on in their deſign and purpoſe.
And others of theſe thought it their duty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
unweariedly in the reformation and to apply
themſelves to that work with all their might, but
to Act with Moderation not by Popular Tumults,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50388:230"/>
but that ſo neceſſary a thing was not to be omitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for all the many enviers, adverſaries and enemies
they had and what injuries, Inconveniences and
Dangers ſoever befell them. Others moreover
would have it be looked upon as a firm and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
way and method to meet together, and inſtruct
privately among any ſorts of men, whether Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
Men or Women; neither did they think they
ought to depart thence, tho they were ne're ſo much
hated, and ſuffered never ſo many afflictions; ſo thoſe
who ſtood in oppoſition to them, thought fit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that they had gathered greater ſtrength, to deal
with them another way: I ſhall, in the firſt place,
ſpeak of the more maddeſt ſort of them; for thus
it was, That thoſe who were more moderate of them
(and they were all of them followers of <hi>Sener,</hi> or
moſt part of them) did prove their deſign and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe,
and refelled the wrath &amp; perſecution of their
Adverſaries againſt 'em, &amp; together with the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and furious outrages of ſome towards 'em, by
ſaying and writing, That they fully Embraced the
Doctrin and Confeſſion of <hi>Luther,</hi> (as he was always
in the mouths of the Adverſaries, and the only hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and Divine Man in his Doctrine), and of the
<hi>Lutherans;</hi> and that their Deſire was only this, <hi>That
in reference to the Modes and Propoſitions, ſome Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters
might be more clearly and explicitly taught:</hi>
ſuch as theſe are, <hi>The Knowledge of God and ones

                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They added, <hi>That the Miniſters and
Paſtors of Churches, did not, as they ought to have
done,</hi> diſcharge their Functions in inſtructing and
ſtirring up their Hearers to theſe more neceſſary
Duties, neither in their Sermons, nor Catechiſings;
and that the Profeſſors and Doctors in the Schools,
did not inſtruct, encourage, form and prepare
their Students for theſe things; and the Students
did not take care to apply their Minds thereunto,
yea, that they rather thought the ſame to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
a Diſgrace unto them, and ſo contenting
themſelves in this manner with the inſtruction they
receive, and ſticking faſt to their former youthful
Ways and Practices, the ſame evil Diſpoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill ripe in them, and the remembrance of their
preceeding Life not obliterated, and only filled
with a vain noiſe of Philoſophy, but void of the
Spirit and any inward Experience, they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Miniſtry; And when by theſe Arts,
they come as it were to their own Poſſeſſions, then
they deliver from the Pulpit what they have learnt
of Men, and ſtrenuouſly apply themſelves to be
skillful at Words only, to handle the Tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and if they attain to the knack of it, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
copiouſly of ſome Word or Sentence, but
with no Argument, no ſubject Matter, that tends
to Ingenerate Piety, as Declaimers do in the
Schools, or Petty-Foggers in Courts of Judicature,
and Places all their Duty herein, and ſo finiſh it;
but otherwiſe take little care of their Auditors,
but of themſelves are very tender and nice, and
their Families live deliciouſly, and they eſteem
nothing more honourable and deſirable than this.
On the other hand, their Enemies lay a long Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of foul Errors to their Charge, and ſend
them up and down every where, and ſo recount
them all, and confute them in the Chairs and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditories
of the Univerſities, and Churche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

the Students and People, who at leaſt are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
inclined; and when there is ſo great a ſtreſs
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50388:231"/>
laid upon it, to run altogether head-long there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
ſo as to take all things in a perverted Sence,
and to entertain a moſt ill Opinion of thoſe Men.
And that the Sect might be the better known, and
a ſummary given of their Errors, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and horridneſs of their Faults, they gave thoſe
Men the Name of <hi>Pietists,</hi> and the Sect it ſelf they
dignified with the Appellation of <hi>Pietiſm,</hi> which
name thoſe Men in the mean time looked upon to
be their Honour and Glory, theſe their Enemies
put upon them as a mark of their Crime, and a
term of Ignominy and Reproach, as if they thought
all Vices were to be couched under this one alone;
And the Envy and Rage of ſome proceeded ſo
far, that if any one explained who thoſe <hi>Pieteſts</hi>
were, and how this name might rightly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be taken, they inveighed alſo againſt this,
as a moſt horrid Wickedneſs, and a capital Crime.
An Example, where you have in theſe four

                  </p>
                  <p>But that theſe Men might be diſtinguiſh'd by
their proper Forms and Characters, they called
them alſo by the Names of the <hi>Illuminate, Cathari,
Puritans, &amp;c.</hi> as being thoſe who were full of
their own moſt proud but vain Conceit, or boaſted
themſelves to be the only Perſons that had the
Light, when in the mean time they had not a
ſpark of Knowledge and Truth, and in their whole
life ſeemed to be ſo pure and perfect, when as in
truth there was an Ulcer within them, which in
time would break out, that in publick, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
carried a counterfeit face of Goodneſs, but did
in the mean time defile themſelves ſecretly, and
in their Receſſes, with the moſt notorious Vices:
This was the common Opinion, By-Word, and
Laughing-ſtock of all, that theſe Men were Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50388:231"/>
of the old Enthuſiaſts, and the Inventors of
new; That they were like the Quakers, and that
they followed their Doctrine and Diſcipline through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
when, at the ſame time, all, or the moſt part
of them, ſcarce knew what the Opinions, Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
and Hereſies of the Quakers were; which
thing is evident from <hi>Spener</hi>'s Book in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Tongue, wherein that Perſon defending his
own Cauſe, and as to Quakeriſm, going about to
remove that ſuſpicion Men had of him upon that
account, while he quotes the Opinions of the
Quakers, he alledged them in ſuch a manner, that
he, to whom the Opinion of the Quakers was
known, underſtood at the firſt Reading of them,
(ſaving the Man's Honour) that he had not known
what the Quakers meant: And ſo grievouſly were
theſe Men dealt with, after they had thus loaded
them with theſe obnoxious Names, that thoſe Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
who would not leave theſe ways, and who
from their Dependencies were called the Elector's
Scholars, were deprived of their Stipends, others
of all hopes of Preferment by Men of their own
Functions, who moſt of them betook themſelves
to the Territories of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi>
who granted theſe Diſtreſſed Men not only a place
of Refuge, but alſo whatever they had occaſion for;
and did moreover aſſign to their principal Doctors
a place in the Univerſity of <hi>Halen,</hi> that every one
might inſtruct his Pupils as he pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Horbius,</hi> upon the French War, if that may
be called a War, wherein there has been ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of Devaſtations made, and Barbarities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
went from <hi>Trarback</hi> to <hi>Wiſhenheim</hi> upon
the <hi>Neckar,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Hamburg,</hi> and there
was made Miniſter of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s Church; where,
according to his wonted manner, he applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to inſtruct his hearers in true Piety, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in his Catechiſings, to inſtil his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
into the Youth, and even young Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but ſoon after, the Fame and Dignity of <hi>Horbius</hi>
ſtirred his two Colleagues, whoſe Eyes and Ears
he had offended above the reſt of the People, to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50388:232"/>
Envy and Cavil at him; as if <hi>Horbius</hi> brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alſo theſe odious Precepts and Opinions of
Enthuſiaſts and Quakers; which accuſation, 'tis
ſtrange too believe, how it increaſed, after that
<hi>Horbius</hi> had diſtributed a little Book among thoſe
that were Catechiſed by him, not written by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
but by another, concerning the Rudiments of
Chriſtian Education; for when the elder of the
two Colleagues aforeſaid, who became <hi>Horbius</hi>'s
Adverſaries, (there is no occaſion to name his Name,
ſeeing its common in the Mouths of all Men) had
concluded with himſelf that the Book was Writ
by a <hi>Pietiſt,</hi> he immediately proſcribes it as an
Heretical Book, and ſets <hi>Horbius</hi> forth to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors;
and by his Rhetorical Flouriſhes, as if he
were an Heretical Doctor, a Quaker, and ſuch an
one as ought to be expelled out of the City. And
as there is nothing ſo eaſily given out, and harder
ſtopped, nothing nearer received and further ſpread,
then Lies, and Mens Evil Reports, concerning their
Guides and Rulers; ſo the ſame report in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
(as it were) of an Eye, without any more ado,
did ſo dilate it ſelf not only through the whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but all the Country over, ſo as that <hi>Horbius</hi> was
known by no other Name than the Quaker-Doctor.
Moreover, the rude multitude, and the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
ſort of Men, ſome of them through a ſtupid
Ignorance, as being not able to diſtinguiſh the
firſt Principles of the Chriſtian Doctrine; others,
partly through Ignorance, and partly through an
uncertain Authority and blind Guidance of other
Men, as if they were Slaves or Brute-Beaſts; Some
ſeeing themſelves unable to try the thing it ſelf,
and being very much afraid of the Evil, leaſt that
alſo ſhould fall upon them, ſo referring the firſt
beginning thereof to one which they much ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
And laſtly, others through a blinded pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
and accuſtomed to raillery, and to do ill
turns, received <hi>Horbius</hi> every where with Hiſſing
and Reproaches, railed at him, and did really per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
the Man; ſo as that unleſs his Life had been
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50388:232"/>
preſerved, through the faithfulneſs of honeſt Men,
and they his Friends too, he had through the fury
and violence of thoſe his Enemies been certainly
deprived of it. Wherefore, when <hi>Horbius</hi> ſaw,
that his hopes was over-born by the Malice and
Envy of ſo many Men, and that there was nothing
now left for him but Dangers, he choſe rather to
forſake his Miniſtry and the City, and by giving
way rather than by reſiſting, to break thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
Spirits: For ſeeing that all the reſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thoſe two Colleagues aforeſaid, ſtuck to <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>'s
ſide, there was at that time very great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention
and Strife between thoſe Paſtors who ſtood
in oppoſition to <hi>Horbius</hi> and thoſe that were on his
part; and that by Sermons, Pamphlets, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
every one according to his Faculty in Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Writing, putting forth his utmoſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of his ſide, and in oppoſition to his Enemies,
and placing the victory in the laſt action, untill at
length, the matter was brought to that paſs by
the Interpoſition and Authority of the Senate,
Magiſtrates, and Supream Power of the City, (a
ſpecial and principal Remedy for ſuch ſort of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Men and Aſſemblies) that all the quarrel
and difference in Words and Writings was taken
off by an Amneſty, as they call it, or General Act
of Indemnity; and each of them were to forgive
what was paſt, as much as all good Men hoped it
would be ſo. It's ſad to conſider what a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of things have been written all this time, through
all <hi>Germany</hi> that is of the Lutheran Religion, not
in the Latin Tongue, ſave a very few, but in the
German Language, that ſo now the whole Diſpute
which ſo many Learned Men could not find an
end to, ſhould be equally committed to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Learned and Unlearned, and eſpecially
be the entertainment of the vulgar and abject ſort
of Mankind, whoſe Judgment, they who thus
contended, are ſo far from expecting, that they
even Deſpiſe, and deſire not to have them named
with them. In the mean time we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50388:233"/>
that the Quakers abiding elſewhere, and
very well knowing and retaining an account, and
the particulars of all their own Conveniences, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
nothing wherein they thought there was
any thing to their Advantage, that might be done
in this Commotion and Diviſion of theſe Men.
They had certainly in thoſe places, at this time,
a certain Hope wrought in them, and their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
were raiſed with ſome joy, that it might come
thereby to paſs, that there ſhould be ſuch Perſons
that would Judge more favourably of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Quakers, and that perhaps they would
apply their Minds to them, the Words of their
Epiſtle in an Anniverſary Meeting at <hi>London</hi> the
preceeding year, writ to all the Churches of the
Quakers, bear witneſs hereunto, which were to this
purpoſe; <hi>That they had Thoughts, and ſome Hopes,
that the falling out of the</hi> Lutherans <hi>in thoſe places
amongſt themſelves, might tend to a farther Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
and Promotion of the Truth in thoſe Parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, there was in <hi>Germany,</hi> as it were,
three ſorts of <hi>Pietiſts</hi> (pardon the expreſſion.) One,
which I have deſcribed, conſiſts of thoſe who
ſought, and preſſed nothing elſe, but ſincere Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and true Piety; and the greateſt part of
thoſe are among the Learned and better ſort of
men, through <hi>Saxony</hi> and all <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another ſort of them was that cryed, That
the Church was much Corrupted, and loved Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but ſuch, who themſelves on the other hand,
ſtagger not a little in the Faith and True Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and theſe ſame are commonly leſs moderate
and more violent in Celebrating their Aſſemblies
together. Theſe came near the <hi>Weiglian Sect,</hi>
and ſuch ſort of Fanatical People that ſprung up
about an hundred year ago, and not dead in all
that intermediate time in <hi>Miſnia</hi> and other
Countries about, who imagined, as if it had been
an Opinion not yet received in the Church, and
yet neceſſarily to be delivered, That there is one
certain Divine Seed in all Men, and that God and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50388:233"/>
Chriſt do ſo infuſe themſelves into Men, that they
are one. Moreover, That man becomes God and
Chriſt, and that ſo he ought to Worſhip God and
Chriſt in himſelf, and a great deal more of ſuch
ſtuff: Which Tenents, ſeeing they were of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
very obſcure and incomprehenſible, or only
an empty ſound without any Sence, they by their
winding cants did yet further involve and make
more intricate; and theſe men dreamt of I
know not what Millenary Kingdom and Golden
Age, and continued watching among all who
ſhould be no longer Mortal, in which Kingdom
all things ſhould be reſtored to their former ſtate
and condition, and the Bleſſed abound with all
Spiritual and Corporal Pleaſures and Delights,
and ſhould be ſatisfied at a Thought in what they
deſired or Wiſhed, from the Divine and Celeſtial
Affluence of the Holy Spirit; wherefore ſeeing,
that they now thought the ſame time was at hand.
They ſo ſettled their Rules, that laying aſide all
Controverſies among Chriſtians, they now with
one mind, by mutual inſtructions and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
looked to that Kingdom, prepared themſelves
for it, and invited other men unto it, and made
it their buſineſs ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>The Third ſort of them was that which may be
called <hi>Behmiſts</hi> or <hi>Teutoniſts;</hi> theſe called back,
as it were, <hi>Jacob Behman,</hi> the Shoemaker of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingen</hi>
in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> from the Dead, who was called
<hi>Tutonick,</hi> and did both Broach thoſe Opinions,
which had been really delivered by him, as alſo
thoſe Errors that had been falſly laid upon him,
and aſcribed to him, yea, and horrid and helliſh
Blaſphemy, and cried them up as worthy of all
Eſteem and Glory. But before I give the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
hereof, I do not think it abſur'd to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
concerning the Doctrine and Writings of this
<hi>Behman,</hi> and the rather, becauſe of the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Opinions, and Obſervations of Learned
and famous Men concerning them. He had wrote
and publiſhed in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, ſome
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50388:234"/>
Books, or rather Pamphlets, wherein (as he
would perſwade himſelf) he diſcovered many
things neceſſary to be known, or the Foundations
of true Religion, and Piety, in dark words, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
from the uſual and known names, and
ſuch as he that would, could not perceive and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend;
producing ſome of his own, and adding,
as his own invention, ſome other things which he
had heard or road elſe where: But when it came
to paſs, as it often happens, that thoſe <hi>Germans,</hi>
eſpecially the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who Aſſumed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the Appellation of Learned Men, and who
were eager in a ſearch after Knowledg, Science and
Truth, and durſt attempt any thing; and were
already puffed up with their own and other mens
Opinions concerning the Excellency of their
Learning, alight upon theſe Notions; theſe, as
coming nigh unto <hi>Behman's</hi> Principles, but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon them, yet to be ruder, and as it were,
but rough drawn, as being what he had only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
they go on to compleat them; and from the
Store-houſe of their own Wiſdom, build up, and
heap together many Opinions, but ſuch as were
Monſtrous and Horrid, and digeſt them into books
and Publiſh them, and render the <hi>Behman</hi> Name
well known in <hi>Germany, Holland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> by
their writing in thoſe ſeveral Languages: Some
things alſo they Publiſh'd in Latin; and they prove
and extol the whole with a wondrous Character,
as if they were Golden Books, and to be got all
by Heart, by thoſe who followed the Chriſtian
Religion, and loved their own Everlaſting Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In the mean, as every Man has his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to Judg, there were various Judgments
made concerning the Writings of <hi>Jacob Behman</hi>
himſelf; ſome thinking moderately concerning
them; and tho there were ſome Light things and
miſtakes in them yet they adjudged there was no
Hereſy contained in them, but others again deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
otherwiſe, that they were very Heretical
Writings; to which ſome added alſo, that they
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50388:234"/>
had been all written by a Man, who if he was not
ſtark Mad, was yet highly diſturbed in his Mind
and Underſtanding, and that he himſelf had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
confeſt the ſame thing, when he came to
his right Mind, and ſo at length by confeſſing and
bewailing his own Temerity and unconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as indeed it was highly to be Rejected, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fooliſh, and unfruitful as to any good; yet
his Offence pardoned by his Country-men the
<hi>Sileſians,</hi> wherein, becauſe the Fame of the Man
has certainly been injured, I do not think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to declare in a few words, what his caſe
was, and how terminated, as to the Event there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
therefore ſeeing there were ſuch various Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
concerning this Man made by the World;

Divines, who after they had ſeriouſly and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
Examined him, and tryed his Sentiments
alſo as to every Article of faith, and what he
meant in his Books which he had Publiſhed; they
not only Abſolved him of Hereſy, but did more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over

Threefold Principle in a Succeſſive Order: That
he is the Spring of, and doth influence all things;
to wit, a fire, wherein there is the Light, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
and Wiſdom of God, which is the Son of
God; and Oyl, wherein that Light of God
burns, which is the holy Spirit. And that in this

own proper Nature, and that of Three Principles,
which Three Principles are in Nature called by the

That God created all Things in Number, Weight

                  <p>Theſe ſame Sentiments of theſe Men, which I
believe they acquired by revealing upon, but not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
the <hi>Platonick</hi> Writings, by poliſhing and
mixing of them, they heaped up together into a
Book. And this, which is not Chriſtian Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
but is uttered by men that think themſelves in

their Noddles were not ſouud altogether, yet there
were certainly others of ſound Underſtanding, and

made ſo much account thereof, that unleſs any one
had attain'd to it, held it and profeſt it, he knew
nothing of Divine Matters. If any denied it, they
adjudged him by no means capable of Salvation.
On the other hand, their Adverſaries looked upon
this their Theology to be ſo gaſtly, and even ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to be uttered; and upon all the Writings
which theſe Teutonicks put forth, with ſo hard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

a Collection of the moſt vile, fooliſh and baſe

him that agreed thereunto, and approved of
them, worthy to be expelled, and far enough remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from all Chriſtian Community, ſeeing they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
their people to read, or as much as to look
upon thoſe Writings; and ſo there was not ſo much
as place allowed theſe men in theſe provinces: The
Principal Leaders, and Enſign-bearers of theſe new
<hi>Pietiſts,</hi> were certain Doctors of <hi>Wirtemburg,</hi> whoſe
Doctrine was ſcattered not only among their Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
who conſtantly heard them, and followed
them, and therefore eaſily ſtuck to their Precepts,
and became themſelves like unto them, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many others, who yet while they were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a deſire alone to attain to Godlineſs, were
called by the only Name of <hi>Pietiſts,</hi> and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
took upon them to follow the Party of <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
and <hi>Spener;</hi> inſomuch that now upon the

towards <hi>Cleve,</hi> many even of our Churches
did alſo ſo embrace this myſtical Theology, ſome
according to the <hi>Weigelian,</hi> ſome the <hi>Tentonick</hi>
mode, and did ſo vigorouſly promote it, cheriſh
ſuch as received it with ſo much Ardency, that
they began to unite and gather together, ſo as that
our Divines had no ſmall task upon them for to
inſtruct and teach them better, that they might
not withdraw from our Churches. And there is
no occaſion here to relate how much vexation and
trouble their Miniſters, and other good Men had
in <hi>Holland,</hi> both from the old <hi>Weigelian</hi> family,
and from this new brood of <hi>Teutonicks;</hi> ſeeing
this is ſo well known there and in every bodies
mouth; but this is not to be paſt over ſo far as it has
relation to the affairs of the Quakers; among theſe
new myſtical Men there was one <hi>John Jacob Zimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Paſtor of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church in the <hi>Dutehy</hi>
of <hi>Wirtemburg,</hi> a Man skilled in Mathematicks
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50388:236"/>
and, ſaving what he had Contracted of theſe erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
opinions, had all other excellent endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of mind, to which may be added the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
of his Life, wherein he was inferior to none,
and who was of conſiderable fame in the world;
Who when he ſaw there was nothing but great
danger like to hang over himſelf and his Friends;
he invites and ſtirs up through his own hope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſixteen or ſeaventeen Families of theſe ſort
of Men, to prefer alſo an hope of better things
tho it were dubious before the preſent danger,
and forſaking their Country which they through
the moſt precipitous and utmoſt danger, tho they
ſuffered Death for the ſame, could not help and
relieve as they ſuppoſed, and leaving their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which they could not carry along with them,
to depart and betake themſelves into other parts
of the world, even to <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> the Quakers
Country and there divide all the good and the evil
that befall them between themſelves, and learn
the Languages of that People, and Endeavour to
inſpire Faith and Piety into the ſame Inhabitants
by their words and examples which they could
not do to theſe Chriſtians here. Theſe agree to it,
at leaſt ſo far as to try and ſound the way, and if
things did not go ill, to fortify and fit themſelves
for the ſame. <hi>Zimmerman,</hi> having yet <hi>N. Koſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
for his Colleague, who was alſo a famous Man,
and of ſuch ſevere manners that few could equal
him, writes to a certain Quaker in <hi>Holland</hi> who
was a Man of no mean Learning, and very weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
very bountiful and liberal towards all the
poor, pious and good. <hi>That as he and his followers

might have a good Ship well provided for them to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50388:237"/>
carry them into thoſe places, wherein they might mind
this one thing, to wit to ſhew with unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
their Faith and Love in the Spirit in convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of People, but at the ſame time to ſuſtain their
bodies by their daily Labour.</hi> So great was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
inclination and affection of this Man towards
them, that he forthwith promiſed them all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of aſſiſtance, and performed it and fitted them
with a Ship for their purpoſe, and did out of that
large Portion of Land he had in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> aſſign
unto them a matter of two thouſand and four
hundred Acres, for ever of ſuch Land as it was,
but ſuch as might be manured, impoſing yearly to
be paid a very ſmall matter of rent upon every
Acre, and gave freely of his own and what he got
from his friends, as much as paid their Charge
and Paſſage, amounting to an hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pounds ſterling; a very great gift, and ſo much
the more ſtrange, that that ſame Quaker ſhould
be ſo liberal, and yet would not have his name
mentioned, or known in the matter. But when
theſe Men came into <hi>Holland</hi> they Sailed from
thence directly for <hi>Penſilvania; Zimmerman</hi> ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
dies, but ſurely it was unſeaſonable for
them, but yet not ſo, but that they all did chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
purſue their Voyage, and while I am writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hereof, I receive an account, that they arrived
at the place they aimed at, and that they all lived
in the ſame houſe, and had a publick Meeting
three times every week, and that they took much
pains, to teach the blind people to become like
unto themſelves, and to conform to their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
This Commotion and Diſturbance made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> has been not only noted here
for a Commemoration of the preſent time, but for
a perpetual memorial of that people and I ſhall
return to the Quakers, and briefly ſay ſomething

pierced her Heart; and therefore ſhe Exhorted
the Queen to endeavour, at least, to bend her ſtudy
this way, for to end this War, that Peace may be
made, and ſo gain great reſpect and affection from
all.</hi> The Queen, who was of a moſt free and good

deſires, <hi>That the Queen would grant her

this to our People in</hi> England, <hi>they would believe
what they are all of them already perſwaded of, that
the King of</hi> France <hi>is ſo high and proud that none can
ſpeak with him.</hi> Which paſſage, when the King
came to underſtand, he, in about three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
grants her liberty to come to his Preſence; the
Room was full of Princes and Princeſſes, Prelates
and great Men, the King Enters the ſame, and
having ſeen the Woman, ſpeaks to her, with his
Hat under his Arm; whereupon ſhe asked whether
he was the King, the King anſwers, yes. Then ſaid
ſhe, <hi>What is the meaning that the King is bare, it's not
the faſhion of the Kings of</hi> England. Upon this the
King puts on his Hat, ſo the Woman run over
briefly what ſhe had before written in the Letter,
in the King's Preſence, to whom the King, with a
Kingly Gravity and Brevity, replyed: <hi>But Woman,
I deſire Peace, and ſeek Peace, and would have Peace,
and tell the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>ſo,</hi> So in envy and
ſpight do they in <hi>France</hi> call <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>great
Brittain</hi> to this very time, wherein now for fear
they begin to acknowledg and own his Regal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
in their pompous words and names; this K.
I ſay, a K. ſo conſtituted according to all Divine
and Human Laws, that if any one would decipher
a Lawful and Juſt K. he can do it no better than
by defining of it under the name of this; when as
at the ſame time that name of Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
has been throughout this Age, and before through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the World, as Glorions and Venerable, as that
of King, and as much feared by Enemies. At theſe
words the K. went his ways, and ſo did the Woman
likewiſe, and having got Paſſes from the King, goes
to <hi>Holland,</hi> and from thence returns for <hi>England,</hi>
having, with all her endeavours, effected nothing;
and ſo far is the Woman's Account of her ſelf,
whom the Quakers think, ought not to be miſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
herein, becauſe related by her ſelf, of whoſe
Sinceriry and Honeſty they make no manner of
of doubt; but others think it a thing more to be
heeded, becauſe the Woman did ſhew the Letters
delivered to her, before the one ſigned by the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50388:240"/>
Queen's Secretary, and the other by the King's
Command, and with his own Hand: Strange are
the things which theſe Men relate; and ſome
Write concerning the Travels of <hi>Samuel Fiſher,
John Stubbs, John Perrot,</hi> and <hi>John Love,</hi> Miniſters
of their Church, into <hi>Italy,</hi> and from thence to

                  <p>I ſhall only perſue theſe Men's Relations, as they
refer to that ſame expedition of mine formerly
from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Ionia,</hi> and what is worth Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
ſhall be taken notice of briefly, and ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

delightful are our paſt Labours, and the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
thing moſt unpleaſant, if we may not ſome

four Men which we have already named, arrived
in <hi>Italy</hi> by Sea, and came aſhore at the Port of
<hi>Leghorne,</hi> as 'tis now called, but formerly <hi>Portus
Herculeus, &amp;c.</hi> There they delivered ſome of their
Pamphlets to the Governor, who delivered the
ſame to the Inquiſitors and Cenſors of Matters
that appertain to Religion, who, when they found
nothing in them that belonged to the Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and that they had done nothing, for which
by right they ought to be diſſatisfied with them,
they diſmiſs them. They go forwards, and get
to <hi>Venice,</hi> and there offer their Pamphlets to the
Doge, who holds the Chief Dignity in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and from thence without ſtop go to <hi>Rome,</hi>
the compendium of the whole Papacy, and there
ſee ſlightly and haſtily the vaſt heap, and maſs,
of ſo many things that are to be ſeen in that
place, and having viewed them, leave them as an
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:50388:240"/>
evil Omen, and return without any delay to <hi>Venice</hi>
from whence they came. Then <hi>Perrote</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>
take Shipping at this place, and go for <hi>Smirna,</hi>
touching all the way no Land, no Port, nor ſo
much as any Shore; where, when they were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
becauſe they had an intention to go for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
when the Engliſh Conſul came to hear
of it, and had wiſely conſidered the Life, and
rough Demeanours of thoſe Men, who knew not
how to forbear, and to ſerve the times, and ſo
fearing leaſt they ſhould act ſomewhat raſhly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Emperor, that might tend not only to
their own Inconveniency, but to the Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Engliſh Nation, he ſends them againſt
their Wills back again into <hi>Italy;</hi> And ſo when
they arrived there they returned to <hi>Rome;</hi> while
they were at <hi>Rome, Love</hi> and <hi>Perrote</hi> being Men
not able to hide their Diſpoſition, and moderate
the ſame for ſome time, and in the place they
were, and to the Men they came amongſt, and not
willing to diſſemble and form Lies; when by this
their Carriage they came to be known, what they
were, and what their Deſign was, they are by
the Inquiſitors thrown into Priſon. <hi>Love</hi> died
under his Confinement, as ſome Monks declared,
by Starving himſelf to Death; but as afterwards
ſome of the Nuns reported, (ſo hard a thing it is
to keep a ſecret, moſt difficult when once blabbed
out to ſuppreſs, for the more 'tis concealed the
more it's diſcovered) he was Murdered in the night;
<hi>Perrote</hi> continued ſome time in Priſon, and was
afterwards ſet at liberty; About the occaſion of
which Enlargement there was at firſt various Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
but afterwards there was no vain Suſpicion,
that, he being ſhut up in this place, choſe rather
to go backward than forward in his Work, ſeeing
that after his return into <hi>England,</hi> he forſook the
Quakers, and ſet himſelf directly againſt them,
drawing others alſo off along with him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
of them to embrace his new Opinions and
Precepts: The other two being ſtruck with fear,
fled away. And here I ſhall ſubjoin the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50388:241"/>
of a <hi>London</hi> Youth, one <hi>George Robinſon</hi> by
name: He when he had ſailed from <hi>England,</hi> in a
Merchant Ship to the end of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi>
and arrived at <hi>Scanderoon;</hi> and from thence, as
'tis the way of many that Travel thoſe parts, as
being a ſhorter and eaſier way, continued his
Journey towards the place which they call <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
with a deſign to ſee if he could behold or
effect any thing there that might be advantageous
to his Religion; Here he many ways diſcovered
himſelf to be a Quaker; the which when it came
to the Monks and Popiſh Prieſts Ears they in
their Monaſtery, which is as it were the Store-Houſe
and Treaſury of all manner of Villany, take
Counſel together, whereby to bring him to ſuch a
danger, from which there ſhould be no eſcape, and
ſo put this villanous trick upon him. There was
ſuch a Law among the Turks formerly, tho' not
many years paſt, made, That, if any Chriſtian
enter into any of their Churches, he is put to
Death unleſs he redeem his Life with the change
of his Religion; which Law was made not by
the invention of the Turks themſelves, but by
the inſtinct of Ambaſſadors, and European Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls
on thoſe Coaſts, who thought it to be their
Prudence to provide in that manner, leaſt their
Mariners, who are ſo ſerviceable to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
but a ruffling ſort of Men, and prone to all
impetuous and ſaucy Actions, ſhould offer any
violence to the Churches and Porches of the
Turks, and demean themſelves inſolently upon
that account, and that ſo from that foreign Evil,
another worſe Evil ariſe, and befall the whole
Nation; therefore that they might bring this
young Man into the utmoſt peril of his Life; they
by their cunning Machinations, order the matter
ſo, as that he entred into one of their Moſques or
Churches: There the Turks ſeize him, and having
got an Interpreter, which ſort of Men, who are
of the Greek Nation, is never wanting, they
threaten him, that unleſs he would change his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and forſake his Chriſtianity, and embrace
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50388:241"/>
the Mahometan Way, they would burn him alive
upon Camels Dung. He chooſes to Die; they
prepare for it; but a Turkiſh Officer comes up to
them with great ſpeed, who had found out by
what Methods, Cunning, and Craft, they had
trappan'd the young Man, and crys to them, that
they ſhould be quiet, ſtop, and ſee what they did;
he ſhews them the whole matter, and ſo frees the
young Man, who was ready to Die, and almoſt
Breathleſs, from the very Jaws of Death; and
after that, brought him to his own Houſe, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
and ſuccoured him, and does as it were hug
and adore for ſome time, as 'tis the manner of the
Turks to love, venerate, and eſteem ſuch worthy
of eternal Monuments, for undergoing ſuch a
Death, as to be Martyrs for their Religion; and
at laſt commanded thoſe Papiſts and bald Monks,
who had not an Hair of Humanity to conduct
this young Man, but one who was endued with
a manly Nature and Fortitude into a place of Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
unleſs they were minded to incur the like
danger, or ſome other vindictive diſpleaſure for
the ſame. Theſe manly Examples were imitated
by ſome of the Female Sex, both Wives and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
not out of a Womanly precipitancy and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but upon a determinate Advice, taking good
reſolution of Mind, and raiſing up the Fortitude
of their Bodies, contemning the danger of their
lives, changing as it were their Sex, or being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted
from Women to Men, which ſays <hi>Pliny</hi>'s
credit, in reference to a Tranſmutation of this
Kind, of which ſort <hi>L. Mutianu</hi>'s ſhewed a Boy
at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which he had ſeen. For ſo did they
ſteer their Courſe towards thoſe ſame Places, and
ſtudied to obtain the ſame Glory and Praiſe for
the Preaching and Propagating of their Religion.
Of theſe Women, the firſt two were <hi>Catherine
Evans</hi> and <hi>Sarah Chevench,</hi> who in the year 61,
went by Sea from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> to the intent
they might get a Ship to go from thence to <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi>
and ſo on to <hi>Judeae;</hi> which VVomen, while
that the Ship as they ſailed touched upon <hi>Malta,</hi>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:50388:242"/>
went out of the Ship and drew near the Iſland:
There they forthwith deliver their Pamphlets to
ſuch as they met with, and in the mean time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
and abhorring ſo many Signs of an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
People, ſeeing they could not by their Tongue
and Language expreſs the Sence they had of it to
theſe men, (for they uſe partly the Italian, partly
the Turkiſh, and partly a mixt and medley Speech,
as having been Conquered, and the place inhabited
by both People ſeveral times) they did it to them
by Signs and Nods, and other Geſtures; being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
brought to the Inquiſitors, and having
an Interpreter aſſigned them, they refuſe to do
what the Papiſts would have them; Diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them; and at laſt, reject and ſo deſpiſe their
their Worſhip, Adoration, and Religion, that the
Malteſes ſeized upon theſe chattering Women, and
threw them into Priſon, and there kept them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two years; and then at laſt thruſt them out
of their Iſland; There were two other Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
who were alſo Engliſh Women, one of which
was afterward Married to a Citizen, and eminent
Merchant of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> (for there is no need of
naming her or her Companion) that even as theſe
Women had done, did with the ſame deſign go by
Sea as far as <hi>Scanderoon;</hi> but being there not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to go any further by the Engliſh Conſul,
they did at length, with much Grief and Sorrow,
return to their own Country. I ſhall add another
Example of the ſtrange and ardent Reſolution of
Women, which is almoſt too great, and therefore
the leſs Credible; and therefore every one may
make Judgment thereof as he pleaſes; but it's ſuch
as that the Quakers who have received it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
the ſame unto me, do ſo atteſt; that for
all they have no other Teſtimony of the Truth of
the thing, no manner of witneſs, none conſcious
or judge of the ſame beſides the Woman her ſelf,
they ſay they doubt ſo little thereof as if the thing
had been done in their Sight: She was an Engliſh
Maiden, her name <hi>Mary Fiſher,</hi> who would not
be at reſt before ſhe went in Perſon to the great
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50388:242"/>
Emperor of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and inform'd him concerning the
Errors of his Religion, and the Truth of hers. It was the
ſame Emperor, who in my time, and long after, governed
that Empire, called by the name of <hi>Mahomet Han</hi> the 4th
of the Name, a Monſter of a Man, a Deformed ſight both in
Body and Mind, as if one ſtrove with the other how to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
of a black Complexion, with a flat broad Noſe and
Mouth, ſtupid, logger-headed, cruel, fierce, as to his Aſpect,
and beſides other marks upon his Body, had a Scar beneath
his Eye-lid on the upper part of his Cheek, which came
from a wound and cruel Cut given him by his Brother's
Guards and Followers, a Teſtimony of his Boiſterous and
Cruel Diſpoſition, becauſe that upon his Brother's Acceſſion
to that Throne, he attempted to take him off, and cut off
his Head with his own hands. Tho others have given a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fent
Relation of this matter, to wit, that this <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s
Father, becauſe he had underſtood by ſigns and Propheſies,
that the Son ſhould expel the Father from the Throne,
had endeavoured to cut off this his Son, and that in the mean
time, while the Son was kept from falling into the hands of
his Father, in this manner, he gave him this mark of the
miſchief he deſigned for him. This paſſage has been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac'd
here, not that there is any great connexion between the
matter in hand and it, but for curioſity's ſake, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them who are deſirous of Novelties; and that this
Maiden might come to the ſight of this Man, ſpeak with him,
and put him in mind of the Juſtice of her cauſe, ſhe goes on
board an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, and Sails for <hi>Smyrna;</hi> but when the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul at <hi>Smyrna</hi> came to know her deſign, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes
the young Woman, by all means to forbear, but ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in her Reſolution, ſo the Conſul not enduring that ſhe
ſhould expoſe her ſelf to ſo many, and ſuch great hazards
and raſh undertakings, and being not able to divert her any
other way from her purpoſe, he puts her on board a Ship, &amp;
go her Convey'd to <hi>Venice:</hi> She having loſt the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but not the will ſhe had to accompliſh her deſign; after
that ſhe had ſailed up as high as <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> or the <hi>Morea,</hi>
ſhe made them put her a ſhore on the next Land: There
having got this freedom, and regarding neither the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Nature, nor the weakneſs of her Sex, being all
alone, and ignorant of the Way and the Language, that
ſhe might avoid the danger of falling into the hands of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50388:243"/>
Thieves, ſhe Travails on Foot all along the Shoar and Sea-Coaſt
of the <hi>Morea, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Macedon;</hi> and from thence
over the Mountains and craggy places of <hi>Romania,</hi> or <hi>Thrace,</hi>
as far as the River <hi>Mariza</hi> came to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where the
Emperor did then continually reſide, becauſe he was very
much hated by thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſo he, in like
manner, ſhunned the preſence and ſight of them. There
was a vaſt Retinue and Concourſe of People attending the
Emperor, beſides his Army, which lay there, ſo as that there
was ſcarce room enough to contain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſuch a multitude. The
Woman was lucky, tho' ſhe did not know it, to alight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch Men, who tho' they are called by the name of Turks,
came not ſhort, in their Kindneſſes to Strangers, of any other
Nation, eſpecially the nobler and better ſort of them, (which
I my ſelf have not ſo much underſtood as experienced) yea,
do ſo reſpect and eſteem Women-kind, that if any injure
them in VVords or Actions, he runs in danger of his Life.
It was a very difficult thing to come to and ſpeak with the
Emperor; but as there is nothing pleaſant to a Lover but
what is ſought after and hard to be obtained, ſhe trys every
way, looks about her narrowly, follows cloſely her Buſineſs,
and after many Sollicitations and Traverſes backwards and
forwards, through many places, at laſt ſhe found one who
ſpoke for her to the Grand Viſier, who is the chief Man in
Authority next the Emperor, and acquaints him, that there
was an Engliſh VVoman, who had ſome good Counſel to
give the Emperor in the Name of the Great God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This
Viſier was <hi>Achmet</hi> Baſſa, very Renowned among the Turks,
becauſe he ſucceeded his Father in that great Office, which
Honour none ever before him attained to in that kind; The
Viſier ſpeaks to the Emperor on the Womans behalf, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
grants her Liberty to come to him: She came accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with the Dragmans or Emperors Interpreters; but I
could never learn what it was the Woman ſaid to him;
The Emperor after he had given her Audience, commands her to
withdraw, and ordered her to be conveyed to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that ſhe
might from thence return to her own Country; This is that which
the Woman after her return was wont to relate to the Quakers, and
none able to confirm or confute it; and this is that ſame perſon who
together with <hi>Anne Auſtin,</hi> was the firſt of all the Women that went
to Preach their Religion in New <hi>England,</hi> and who for her great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
not only of mind and wit, but alſo for her great dexterity
and experience, was by <hi>William Ball,</hi> a Preacher of no ſmall fame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Quakers, thought worthy to make him a VVife, as I have
ſaid in the beginning of this Book, that ſo that which was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

the Exiſtence (or in-being) of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in

underſtandeth it in that ſenſe, as the Sun is ſaid
to ſet, or go down in the Weſt; or to ariſe, or
come up in the Eaſt, it is in ſome manner tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
But if by that Latine word (<hi>occidit</hi>) he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth
as if God did dye in any Men, I do
not acknowledge that ever I ſaid, or Writ, nay, nor
either thought any ſuch thing. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
when <hi>Thomas Fitzwater</hi> ſaid in his Prayer at
the yearly Meeting in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> theſe words, <hi>O
God, who dyed in us, and haſt riſen in us.</hi> I did
publickly in the Meeting reprehend him, as ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Blaſphemouſly: So far was it from me, that
I never thought any ſuch thing, for God is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way Immortal. Indeed the Man Chriſt (who
is God) was Born and Dyed, but not as God, but
as Man. But if at any time I have ſaid, that
Chriſt is Crucified in any one, I did no wiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it, ſo as that he ſuffered in the leaſt as
God) but as that Seed of God ſiffereth in Men by
their sins, which Seed of God belongeth to Chriſt,
as a certain member of Chriſt (myſtically ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;)
for if the Saints and Believers are called the
<hi>Members</hi> of Chriſt in Scripture, Why may not this
Seed of God much more be called ſo? Becauſe by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50388:245"/>
that Seed the Faithful become the <hi>Members</hi> of

                     <hi>The Annot.</hi> That the Seed of God in the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is a ſubſtance, I own that I have affirm'd, and
I do ſtill affirm it: But I ſaid not, as I do not
now ſay, that it is a Particle of God, nor doth the
Author fix this upon me. But that I ſaid, that
Seed of God, was a Particle of Chriſt the Divine
Man. I would not be ſo underſtood, as if it were
a Particle that could be divided, or ſeparated from
Chriſt, in that manner, as a Corporeal Particle
can be divided or ſeparated from the Body whoſe
part it is, for it is undividable from Chriſt its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

ſo ſaid than Allegorically, and by a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,</hi>
as when it is called <hi>Milk, Wine, Oyl, Fatneſs,
Bread.</hi> I grant alſo, that the Saints in all Ages
have eat the Fleſh, and drunk the Blood of Chriſt,
in the common ſenſe of Proteſtant Writers, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
by the Fleſh of Chriſt, his outward Fleſh,
and by his Blood, his outward Blood; but ſo,
that they did not eat his Fleſh, and drink his
Blood by the mouth of the body, but by Faith,
according to theſe excellent words of <hi>Auguſtine;
Why</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>prepareſt thou the Teeth and the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to eat Chriſt's Fleſh? Believe, and thou haſt eat
it.</hi> And I do not think that ever I ſaid, that
the inward Blood of Chriſt was that Blood which
[by way of Atonement] doth reconcile us to
God. But I alwayes believed, and ſtill I ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Blood of Chriſt, which reconcileth us
to God [by way of Atonement] is that moſt holy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50388:245"/>
Blood of his moſt holy Body outwardly ſhed;
which Blood was a neceſſary part of the Sacrifice
of Chriſt which he offered for our ſins, joyned
with his moſt holy Obedience, and his moſt great
Dolors and Sufferings, both of his (moſt holy)
Soul and Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 280. And often by the Infamy and Tearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder
of his Body he is ſo afflicted with grief, and
ſuppreſſed, as if he were nailed to the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Annot.</hi> I do not remember that ever I ſaid
or Writ ſuch words, or ſo much as thought
them: I own that I have Writ, that Chriſt, or
the Life of Chriſt in ſome manner (or reſpect)
is Crucified in men when they commit heinous
Sins, who have formerly experienced Chriſt, after
a ſort, to live in them; but all this is to be taken
with a grain of allowance, and in a ſober ſence.
Nor did I ever think that Chriſt ſuffereth ſuch
griefs in men, as he ſuffered when he was nailed
to the Croſs, when he did bear on him the weight
of the Sins of the whole World: but this I did
mean, that the life of Chriſt (as it were) doth ſo
ſuffer in ſome men, committing heinous ſins, as
the life of man ſuffers, when a Finger or a
Toe of his Body is wounded with a mortal
wound; but that ſuffering is neither ſuch, nor ſo
great, as when the Head or Heart is mortally
wounded. Again, it is one thing for a manss
Finger to be killed, and far another for his Head
and Heart to be killed. And whatſoever is the
Suffering of Chriſt in ſome men, I do neither think
nor remember, that either by Word or Writing,
I affirmed, that Chriſt's Sufferings in any men
were, or are, in any part or degree Propitiatory,
or by way of a Propitiatory Sacrifice; I know ſome
have ſo Writ (<hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt, in men, offereth
up himſelf a Sacrifice to pacifie the Wrath of God)
but I have publickly ſhewed my Offence, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
againſt it: But ſtill I acknowledge, and
perhaps ſomewhere I have ſo Writ, that the Life
of Chriſt in the Faithful, is (not a Propitiatory
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50388:246"/>
Sacrifice, but) as an Heavenly and Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,
moſt ſweetly ſmelling before God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P. the ſame.</hi> Thus Chriſt, as he is that Divine
Man, is to be worſhipped and adored by all, but not
as outward, born of <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Annot.</hi> In this alſo he doth not rightly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
ſuch Doctrine to me, as if I deny'd that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worſhip were due to the Man Chriſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
Born of <hi>Mary;</hi> for I have plainly Taught
the contrary; particularly in my Book called, <hi>The
Way caſt up:</hi> which Book, I ſuppoſe, this <hi>Author</hi>
has both ſeen and read; therefore I the rather
think ſtrange, that he ſhould attribute ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to me; for, in that Book, I ſet down ſome
words of Prayer to the Man Chriſt, who ſuffered
without us, calling him <hi>Son of David:</hi> and, in
this point, I did diſſent from many called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
and I ſtill diſſent. But this I alſo affirm,
that the Divine Worſhip which we give to Chriſt,
is ſo to be directed to Chriſt our alone Mediator,
that by the Man Chriſt it may be directed to God,
and doth ultimately terminate in God. Alſo, he
doth not aright aſcribe to me, that Doctrine of the
rending aſunder, or laceration of Chriſt's Body in
Men, for laceration implyeth diviſion, or ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the parts aſunder, which cannot happen to
the life of Chriſt in men. Nor did, or do I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
Chriſt to have Fleſh, or a Body in the
Saints, but only in an Allegorical and Figurative
ſence; as when that of Chriſt, which the Faithful
perceive in them, which they taſt, and which is
to their Souls Meat and Drink, whereby they are
Spiritually refreſhed and nouriſhed, is called in
Scripture, <hi>Milk, Honey, Bread, Wine, Oyl, Fatneſs,</hi>
and the like, all which are Names of a Bodily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and therefore cannot be applyed to this
Myſtery, but by way of Allegory, and that for
the defect of proper words.</p>

                     <hi>The Annot.</hi> Altho in ſome words and phraſes, I
may ſeem to agree to theſe, in this Author's eſteem,
or others, yet I no-wiſe agree in ſenſe with them,
nor have I followed their words, but the words
and phraſes of Scripture, which the Hereticks uſed,
but wreſted to a forraign and contrary ſenſe to the
Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if by the preſence and inhabitation of
God and Chriſt in Men, theſe Men were deifyed,
and made God and Chriſt, and the ſame honour
were due to them as to God and Chriſt, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
came into my mind, yea, I always abhorred
ſuch ſort of Doctrine, as not only Heretical, but
Mad, and only proper to Men demented. And as
concerning <hi>Gulielmus Poſtellus,</hi> I ſaw but little of
his Writings at any time, and what I ſaw I did not
well underſtand, for the obſcurity of his ſtile, and
diverſe things in him did not pleaſe me. But what
I have Writ concerning the Birth, or Begetting,
and Formation of Chriſt in the Faithful, I would
not be underſtood to mean it in the ſenſe of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
but in the ſenſe of Scripture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19.
which ſpeaketh after this manner. And in the
ſence of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who both have
Writ, If <hi>Mary</hi> had not conceived Chriſt in her
heart (or Soul) although ſhe did bear him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Fleſh, ſhe could not have been
Saved by him. Nor did I ever dream there was
ſuch an Union, betwixt Chriſt, and the Faithful,
as to make up one Perſon, as the Soul and Body
of Man, make up one Man. But ſuch an Union
I did, and do underſtand betwixt Chriſt and the
Faithful, and betwixt God and the Faithful, by
Chriſt, as is by the ſincere Faith and Love of the
Faithful, begot and wrought in them by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God. Moreover, that I have Writ ſome
things of the <hi>Incarnate Word</hi> in the Faithful (in
my Book called, <hi>The Way Cast Vp.</hi>) I meant
it no otherwiſe than Allegorically; for I never
thought that our corruptible fleſh, which we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
about, is the Fleſh of the Word; but in an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical
ſence I underſtand it as <hi>Orig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50388:247"/>
Ancient Writers, by the Fleſh of the Word of God,
Myſtically ſpeaking, they underſtood the inward
Life and Virtue of Chriſt, which feedeth the Souls
of the Faithful, as the fleſh of a Lamb or Calf
feedeth the Bodies; and by the like Allegory the
ſame Life of Chriſt in the Faithful is called Bread,
[but there is a ſhortneſs and diſparity, and that
great, in all theſe Similitudes] which Life of
Chriſt in the Saints, is a certain influence, or efflux
from the Man Chriſt, or from that fullneſs of life
and Grace in him, as he is without the Saints, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
with the Father in Heaven. But this efflux,
or influence, flowing from the Perſon of Chriſt,
without the Saints, into the hearts of the Saints, too
few Chriſtian Teachers do acknowledge. They
confeſs indeed, that Grace is given us of God, for
Chriſt's Merits, and ſo they affirm, that the Man
Chriſt is the Moral Cauſe of the Grace which we
have of God, [which is true.] But that the
Man Chriſt ſendeth down from Heaven the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of Grace, the Divine Rain, and Dew of
<hi>Grace,</hi> out of his fullneſs, to few acknowledge, for
they underſtand the <hi>Grace of Chriſt</hi> to be nothing
elſe, than a certain quality, (after the manner of
an accident) inherent in the Soul. And becauſe
it is the very being of an accident to be inherent
in its ſubject, therefore they will not own that it
comes down from Chriſt out of Heaven: In which
<hi>I</hi> acknowledge <hi>I</hi> much differ from them in my
Perſwaſion.</p>

about the year 1678. defended it againſt the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying
of Three Miniſters of Note [among the

have riſen up againſt me, after a moſt offenſive

Heads of Chriſtian Religion, contained in theſe
Books, and generally confeſſed by all True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
againſt theſe moſt ignorant men, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
them in <hi>Penſilvania:</hi> The which doth
plainly demonſtrate the great Hypocriſe of theſe
two men. The Heads of Doctrine were chiefly
Three, on which theſe three <hi>Miniſters</hi> above-mentioned,
accuſed my Book, and me, being the
Author of it. The firſt was, that in my Book <hi>I</hi>
had affirm'd, <hi>That the ſame Body of Chriſt, which
was Nailed to the Croſs, and was Crucified and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
Roſe again, and afterwards was taken up into
Heaven.</hi> The Second was, <hi>That it is the Duty of all
Chriſtians, to Pray to the ſame Jeſus Chriſt, who
was then Crucified, and to Worſhip and Adore him;
and, by him, our alone Mediator, to Worſhip, Adore,
and Pray unto God the Father.</hi> The Third was,
<hi>That the moſt Holy Men, in their higheſt Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Holineſs, are to approach unto God, with
Prayer and Thanksgiving, by the Mediation of the
Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> But theſe three men above-mention'd,
who had divers others [even of the
<hi>Miniſtry]</hi> who favoured their Errors, did openly
and boldly, in that Solemn <hi>Meeting,</hi> deny theſe
Three Heads of Doctrine above ſpecified; and my
other Book called, <hi>The Way to the City of God,</hi> cited
by the Author in this Hiſtory; ſome of the People
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50388:248"/>

he Writes concerning me, not fixing that

moſt certain, that he cannot produce any one
Witneſs, that did, or could certainly inform him,
that <hi>I</hi> did any ways embrace all, or any of theſe
propoſitions, either as any Article of Faith, or as
any poſitive Dogma, or Principle in Philoſophy.
And <hi>I</hi> know not any one that doth poſitively em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

not <hi>touching</hi> the chief Queſtion, propoſed

<hi>I</hi> might ſeem to ſome to favour it, as an Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,

granted, the Revolution of many Souls muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but the laſt is abſurd, and therefore is the firſt
abſurd alſo.</hi> And <hi>I,</hi> in my Anſwering to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
have ſometimes ſaid, on the Hypotheſis,
that if ſuch a ſequel of the Major, or firſt Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were admitted, it were better to admit, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that Hypotheſis concerning the Revolution of
the Souls of ſome Gentiles dying in pure Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſme
[or Deiſme] who have, in any manner, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Piouſly towards God, and Soberly and Honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
towards Men; ſuppoſe it be not true, then to
aſſert that ſuch Dying in a pure Gentiliſme, are
[wholly and finally] deprived of Eternal Life:
On the other hand, to affirm, that immediately
after Death, ſuch (dying without the leaſt grain
of the Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt Crucified,
either expreſs, or implicite) do enter into Eternal
Life. Let now any Impartial Man Judge in this
Caſe, yea, let the <hi>Author</hi> of this Hiſtory himſelf
Judge, whether for my Chriſtian Zeal, in ſtanding
up for the neceſſity of the Chriſtian Faith, againſt
theſe Deiſts lately riſen up in theſe parts, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> either redivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
or at leaſt-wiſe calling back again to life, the
moſt filthy Errors of the Old <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who were
extreamly bitter Enemies to the neceſſity of Faith
in Chriſt Crucified my Adverſaries have juſtly
accuſed me of a Crime in this matter? Nor do <hi>I</hi>
think that this Author (whom <hi>I</hi> judge to be a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Man) when he hath well weighed the caſe, will
joyn himſelf, a Neighbour, or Conſociate himſelf
to theſe my <hi>Pelagian</hi> and Theiſt-Adverſaries, (Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
to Chriſt with the Mouth and Words, but
really, and in the true Sence of Scripture, denying
him,) to Accuſe me, as they do, as guilty of a
Crime in this thing.</p>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 384. The Cauſe, was the Controverſie, that
aroſe ſome few years agoe in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated
betwixt <hi>Keith,</hi> and his Neighbours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Two-fold Humanity of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Annot. I</hi> marvel with what reaſon this <hi>Author</hi>
could affirm, that the Controverſie about the Two-fold
Humanity of Chriſt, was the cauſe of the
Strife betwixt my Adverſaries and me in <hi>Penſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
[or here in <hi>England.]</hi> For <hi>I</hi> do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that I had the leaſt Controverſie with my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
either there or here, concerning the Two-fold
Humanity of Chriſt but concerning Chriſt
within, and Chriſt without. For becauſe <hi>I</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Preached in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meetings, Faith
in Chriſt; being Man without us, as well as in
Chriſt, the Life, the Light, the Word in us, and
that this Faith, that reſpected him both ways, was
neceſſary to our Eternal Salvation; therefore, firſt,
<hi>William Stockdale</hi> accuſed me, of being guilty in
Preaching Two Chriſts; and after him <hi>Thomas
Fitſwater,</hi> publickly, in a Monthly Meeting accuſed
me, for denying, That the Light within us was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to Salvation, without ſomething elſe. Now
my Adverſaries in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> by Chriſt within us,
underſtood no other thing than the God-head; and
they had this ſenſe, or meaning of Chriſt within,
that this only ſhould be called, and eſteemed
Chriſt, which they did feel in their hearts to
reprove ſin, and to refreſh them with a certain
Joy, if at any time they did well. Bnt that in
ſome of my Writings <hi>I</hi> had ſaid ſomewhat of the
Exiſtence of Chriſt the Heavenly Man, before he
aſſumed Fleſh in the Womb of the Virgin: I ſee
not by what juſt manner he would fix it on me,
that <hi>I</hi> held a Two-fold Humanity of Chriſt, as if
there were Two Men Chriſts, the one Heavenly,
the other Earthly, and Corporeal; unleſs by ſuch
a method of Arguing, he would infer from the
Scripture it ſelf, that every Man is Two Men, as
conſiſting of a two-fold Humanity. Becauſe <hi>Paul,</hi>
after a Myſtical-way familiar to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Writeth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50388:250"/>
of an inward and outward Man. And perhaps
by ſuch manner of Arguing, one given to quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of arguing, might ſtudy to prove out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that many men have four Humanities; for,
beſide that, the Scripture ſpeaketh of our inward
and outward Man, which are Soul and Body; it
ſpeaketh alſo of the Old Man, which we are bid
put off, and the New Man, which we are to put
on. But, if this <hi>Author,</hi> or any other, charge me
with an Error in this point, that I hold, that the
Mediatory Soul, or Spirit of Chriſt did exiſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he aſſumed Fleſh: it is not enough, with bare
words, to blame me for Error, without ſolid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;
but let them produce ſolid Arguments, if
they have any, to convince me, and ſolidly anſwer
my Arguments I have brought from Scripture, by
which I judge <hi>I</hi> have proved my Aſſertion. Nor
am <hi>I</hi> ſingular in that caſe, that <hi>I</hi> believe, that
Chriſt the Mediator, did exiſt before he took fleſh,
although not in whole, yet in ſome part and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
even from the Beginning of the World, to
wit, in reſpect of his Mediatory, Celeſtial Soul and
Spirit; for diverſe Pious men, even among Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
have affirmed the ſame, no leſs than ſome
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, and alſo ſome <hi>Gentile Philoſophers</hi>
had the ſame perſwaſion; for becauſe they did
obſerve, that the higheſt and loweſt beings in the
Univerſal Creation, were joyned by certain middle
Beings; hence they concluded, very agreeably to
Reaſon, that there was ſome mediatory Being (<hi>i. e.</hi>
a <hi>Mediator, betwixt God, that infinite and infinitely
high Being,</hi> and Mortal Men; who, being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with God, are juſtly to be eſteem'd but as duſt
and aſhes before him; as indeed the Saints did
expreſs the ſame, and eſpecially that excellent and
moſt humble Man <hi>Abrham,</hi> called in Scripture the
Friend of God, the Father of the Faithful, and
Heir of the World, did ſo humble himſelf before
God, that he called himſelf duſt and Aſhes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 446. Then according to that Dogma, to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
this unto all, that Chriſt, as he was Born of <hi>Mary,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50388:250"/>
is united with the Divine Nature, and ſo is preſent
with his Light, and with his Life in all the Children
of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Annot.</hi> And here alſo he doth not rightly
declare my Faith; for by the Preſence of Chriſt in
all the Children of God, <hi>I</hi> do not underſtand that
the External Perſon of Chriſt, or the Body
which was Born of <hi>Mary</hi> is in them, nor yet the
Soul of Chriſt, in reſpect of its center, or of the
fullneſs of virtue, which only, and alone, dwelleth
in the External Perſon and Body of Chriſt, that
was Born of the Virgin. But this <hi>I</hi> ſay, as the
like <hi>I</hi> have ſaid many years ago, and have Writ in
diverſe of my Books publiſhed in Print, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ray, or ſubſtantial influence is derived from
out of the Man Chriſt in Heaven, and floweth into
the hearts of the Faithful, after ſuch manner, as
the Beams of the Sun, that are truely ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
come out form the Center of the Sun, and paſs
into the Earth, and the Fruits of the Earth, to make
them grow, and come to maturity: the which ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude,
and diverſe others, the Scripture frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſeth; as that of the Vine, and Branches, the
Head and Members of Man's Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 455. They publiſh a Book, which they call, The

Guilty Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Annot.</hi> For a guilty Man, read guilty Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for the word guilty is as well Plural as ſingular:
and, in the Title of our Book, we underſtand the
word guilty in the Plural; for, there were Twenty
eight Men guilty in giving forth that falſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 459. That <hi>Keith</hi> called another Man of the

and is given in Scripture to Falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and to other bad Men. And let the Impartial
Judge, whether that Perſon was not worthy of
ſuch an Appellation, who (though profeſsing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Chriſtian) did affirme boldly to me, before
diverſe Witneſſes, that he did not expect to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by that which died at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to wit, the
Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that was Crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if a <hi>Jew</hi> had ſaid this, it had been more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
but, that one called a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Firſt Rank among Chriſtians, ſhould ſpue
out his Filth ſo Blaſphemouſly againſt the Saviour
of the World; and ſo wickedly, might have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
any Chriſtian, having the leaſt grain of true
Faith, not only to call him ſo, but ſomewhat more
hard. And the ſame Perſon did vehemently urge
me [at that ſame very time I ſo Named him]
that I would ſubmit my Self, and my Faith, to
that Meeting, wherein <hi>I</hi> ſo called him, in that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
Whether God was preſent in all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
Some in that Meeting, and theſe even Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
openly denying it: for ſo he ſpoke to me,
becauſe <hi>I</hi> refuſed to ſubmit my Faith, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in that Queſtion, to the Determination of that
<hi>Meeting,</hi> Will thou not ſubmit to the Church?
Doth not the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> ſpeak in the Church?
Doth the Spirit ſpeak in Trees? becauſe <hi>I</hi> had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
that the Spirit was in Trees. What more,
<hi>I</hi> pray, doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> preſume? yea, <hi>I</hi>
know not: If ſhe doth preſume ſo much, that if
ſhe determineth, that there is no <hi>God:</hi> (or which
is the equivalent, that <hi>God</hi> is not every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,)
her <hi>Members</hi> muſt ſtand to her Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And becauſe <hi>I</hi> refuſed to ſubmit my Faith
to the Determination of that <hi>Meeting,</hi> in that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
Whether <hi>God</hi> be preſent in all his Creatures?
that <hi>Meeting</hi> would not give any Judgment in the
caſe. And, as <hi>I</hi> heard afterwards, that man was of
the <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> but obſcurely put in, and known to
few, and not at all to me as ſuch; nor was he any
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50388:251"/>
                     <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> in that place when <hi>I</hi> ſpoke that Word.
And <hi>I</hi> obſerve that this very Author in this Hiſtory,
P. 376. hath called a certain Frenchman a Papiſt,
(who had ſometime ago writ ſome falſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>) by the like name,
to wit, <hi>Nequam &amp; impurum hominem, A Knave
and filthy Man:</hi> And I doubt not but he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how frequently his [much eſteemed] <hi>John
Calvin</hi> in his Writings, hath called the Papiſts <hi>filthy
Dogs,</hi> and yet many of them were in an eminent
degree of the Magiſtracy. But I ſpeak not this to
juſtifie my ſelf or any other, when by human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
we may be carried with too great heat of
Mind in reproving the Errors and Faults of others.
But it was moſt loathſome Hypocriſie in my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
to blame my heat with ſo great a noiſe, and
to make nothing of their own Iniquity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
yea Blaſphemy, againſt both God and Chriſt;
and who in the heat of Mind, and in hard Words,
did far exceed me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 440. So that to them, [to wit, the People called
<hi>Quakers]</hi> all are Chriſtians [to wit, <hi>Jews, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,
Painims]</hi> in whom any good Seed of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
appeareth, and which they ſay is from Christ, yea
is Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Annot.</hi> He may well indeed affirm this of
many of them, and eſpecially of <hi>George Whitehead,</hi>
who earneſtly contendeth in that late Book, called
<hi>The Chriſtian Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. cited by the Author
Pag: 467. that theſe Heathens or Gentiles (who
are obedient to the Light within, who are without
all Knowledg and Faith of Chriſt without) are
Chriſtians, wherein I have much differed from them,
and do at preſent differ. For although I contend
with all good Chriſtians, That Chriſt as he is that
eſſential Word, is in all Men; yet it doth not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to our Eternal Salvation, to know only, and
believe that Chriſt is the Word, but that we both
know him, and believe in him, as he took Fleſh,
Died for our Sins, and Roſe again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and how
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50388:252"/>
in that reſpect, he is our Saviour, as he is the intire
Chriſt, God-Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 452. Neither could this whole Deified Senate
reconcile theſe two men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Annot.</hi> Whither the Author calleth that
Senate Deified, by way of ſcorn or otherwiſe, I do
not determine. But if by the word <hi>Entheatus,</hi> he
meaneth, <hi>Deified</hi> or <hi>Godded,</hi> as to ſay, <hi>made God,</hi> or
<hi>equal to God,</hi> certainly ſome of the <hi>Quakers</hi> have ſo
affirmed, that who have the Spirit of God are equal
to God; but I never had any ſuch madneſs, nor
have.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P. 474. Pen</hi> and <hi>Whitehead</hi> could ſo little rule
their Minds and Tongues, and <hi>Keith</hi> alſo could ſo
little contain himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Annot.</hi> I was indeed preſſed with ſuch
grief of Soul, and warmed with ſuch heat of Mind
againſt their Injuſtice and Hypocriſie, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I could not contain, but ſharply reprove their
Faults; and however I might have exceeded with
reſpect to the inward frame of my mind, yet I
ſaid nothing that was falſe, when on the other
ſide they did caſt out many falſe and unjuſt things
againſt me; And <hi>William Penn,</hi> in that very
Meeting, did juſtifie his falſe Accuſation againſt
me, when in the publick Meeting at <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> he
called me Apoſtate, ſaying, He did it not in any
Paſſion, but he was ſo tranſported out of himſelf
by the glorious Power of God, that he did not at
all know, whether he was Standing, Sitting, or
Kneeling; which many who heard him ſo falſely
accuſe me, knew well enough, was a moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Falſhood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 113. For neither is the Scripture to them,
(<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi>) as we underſtand that word,
the perpetual and abſolutely neceſſary Mean, and
the only and intire Form and Rule of Faith and
Manners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:50388:252"/>
                     <hi>The Annot.</hi> I deny not but that it is true
what this Author ſaith of the moſt, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of many Miniſters and Preachers among
them. But as to me, when I was enough in
favour with that People, (and to uſe their Phraſe)
when I was in Unity with the Body of Friends,
I did affirm, both by Word and Writ, that the
Holy Scripture, to wit, not the bare Letter, but
the Doctrine of the Scripture, whether delivered
by Voice or VVriting, [in God's ordinary way]
was the perpetual and neceſſary Mean, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
ſo to be, of our obtaining the Faith
[of Chriſt Crucified] the Holy Spirit working
together with the Doctrine in Men's Hearts;
which doth plainly appear out of my Anſwer
to <hi>W. Bayer,</hi> Profeſſor of Theology at <hi>Jeninge</hi> in
<hi>Germany,</hi> [firſt publiſhed in Latin and ſent to
him, and then in Engliſh] for <hi>Robert Barclay;</hi>
which Anſwer I ſuppoſe this Author has read, for
he maketh mention of it in this his Hiſtory, and
doth relate the general Contents of it fairly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
And let the Author read again, if he
pleaſeth, that Anſwer, or let any other read it,
and they will find, (eſpecially if they read the
Chap. 5th and 3d) if they well weigh what
I there delivered in that matter, that either
the difference is none, or but ſmall, betwixt my
Faith and the Faith of the more ſound Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
any where, in that particular.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 114. Hence that God hath given to all men,
a new Birth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Annot.</hi> The Author (I judge) doth not well
aſcribe this to the People called <hi>Quakers, viz.</hi>
That God hath given to all Men a new Birth:
But this they ſay, That God hath given to every
Man an inward Light, or a certain Seed of the
New Birth, which yet in many Men cometh not
to a New Birth: And although in this I aggree
with them, That God hath given to every Man
an inward Light, as a certain Seed, yet in this <hi>I</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50388:253"/>
greatly differ from many of them, that many
yea the moſt, or rather indeed almoſt all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
among them (very few excepted) do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that this inward Light is ſufficient to bring
forth the New Birth, and to give Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
without any thing, without us, that is,
without the Man-Chriſt, that was outwardly
Born, and Crucified and Roſe again, whom ſome
of their Miniſters in my hearing, have called an
<hi>outſide thing, a ſhell, a husk, that doth little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
profit us,</hi> and the Faith of which doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
profit us. And <hi>William Penn</hi> in that Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> where he falſely called me an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
did publickly proclaim after this manner:
<hi>Friends,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſee no great need of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Faith of Chriſts Death and Suffenings, for
all</hi> England <hi>and all</hi> Chriſtendom <hi>have that Faith,
and it doth not profit them. But the Faith which
profitteth Men is the Faith of Christ within, and
this Friends Preach.</hi> Let now the Author judge,
or any other intelligent Perſon [profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,]
whither <hi>William Penn</hi> hath not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
by theſe words proved himſelf an Apoſtate
from the Chriſtian Faith? And mark the neceſſary
conſequence of theſe words. All <hi>England</hi> and all
<hi>Chriſtendom</hi> have the Faith of Chriſt's Death and
Suffering, and it doth not profit them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is no neceſſity of Preaching it; but
it were beſt that that Faith were wholly forgot
and buried in Oblivion! Is not this manner of
Preaching enough not only to prove him that ſo
Preacheth, an Apoſtate, but that it is the way
with open face to bring in Anti-Chriſtianiſm
into the VVorld! But although it muſt be granted,
that too many [in <hi>Chriſtendom]</hi> have no other
but a dead and hypocritical Faith, concerning
Chriſt, and his Death and Sufferings, for <hi>which
dead and hypocritical Faith, I never did contend
with any, nor do I at preſent:</hi> Yet this doth
not hinder, but that many both in <hi>England,</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50388:253"/>
throughout <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> conſiſting of divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
under the common name of Chriſtians, have
a ſincere and living Faith of Chriſts Death and
Sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which doth greatly profit them
[to Eternal Salvation.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 115. Which when it is brought to paſs, <hi>[viz.</hi>
the New Birth] Chriſt, who is altogether Holy and
Righteous, doth exiſt, live and work in that Man;
and by that the ſame Man becometh juſt, by the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs
of Chriſt exiſting in that Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Annot.</hi> He doth truly enough here relate
what is the judgment of many, yea, the greateſt
part of the Miniſters of that People, who do not
diſtinguiſh betwixt the Righteouſneſs of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereof a great part is Forgiveneſs of Sins,
(by and for Chriſts Sake, and for his Merits
Sake) apprehended by a ſincere and effectual
Faith, and the Righteouſneſs of Sanctification,
whereby the Faithful are made inwardly Holy
and Righteous, by the inward Virtue and Life
of Chriſt, and of the Holy Spirit inwardly work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Hearts of the Saints, which ſanctifying

that very many, both Males and Females among

Preaching [in their publick Meetings,] who are
very ſottiſh and miſerably ignorant in the firſt
Elements and Rudiments of the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.

<hi>Briſtol,</hi> the ſentence or falſe Prophecy being
by him pronounced againſt <hi>John Story,</hi> an ancient
Preacher among that People, who never was in
<hi>New England:</hi> The great and only offence that
<hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> and his Party had againſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he did not agree in all Points to ſome
Orders and Methods of Church Diſcipline given
out by <hi>G. Fox,</hi> eſpecially about Womens Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Church, which <hi>John Story</hi> and many
others did think, the other party did extend too
far, and did too ſeverely and rigidly impoſe upon
their Brethren: But after the time of this falſe
Prophecy was expired, <hi>John Story</hi> lived ſome years,
againſt whom nothing was ever juſtly objected,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50388:254"/>
either as to his Doctrine or manner of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And though what the Author writes in true,
that <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> aferwards when he had the
experience that his Prophecy was vain and falſe,
did by a publick Writing confeſs his Error, yet
too many of his party greatly ſought to extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
his Crime, by alledging that it was true as to
ſubſtance, though it failed as to the circumſtance
of time; and <hi>I</hi> did not hear that for any time
<hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> was put to Silence, and a ſtop put
to his Miniſtry for that treſpaſs, though it was
very great; for if Men but flatter their Miniſtry,
great Treſpaſſes will be connived at; but if any
deal plainly and roundly with them, and tell them
their Faults, it ſhall be eſteemed next degree to
impardonable Sin.</p>

Prayer, both in their Houſes, and at their Tables,
although not ſo very frequent vocally; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50388:257"/>
vocally, as God is pleaſed to give an utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

that true Prayer may be, and is, moſt frequently

of our Doctrines and Practices, after 28 years
converſation among us as aforeſaid: though now,
in his late Books, ſince he is gone out from us, he
