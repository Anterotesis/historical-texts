         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>For ye are Dead, and your Life is hid with Christ
in God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the Death and Resurrection of
our blessed Saviour, it will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable,
especially in these times
of Danger, to meditate upon our
own. Loe therefore <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi>
not now proposed to your Choice,
but to your Meditation. The matter
of my Text is the whole Race of
Man, both while he is, and while he is not: he still Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells
to and fro, betwixt two Stages; which are ever the
same, though the order be mutually inverted. For we are
no sooner enterd into Life, but we are Dead, dead and
buried with Christ in Baptisme; no sooner dead to the
World but new borne to God through the same meanes;
when we are thus borne againe, (notwithstanding this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Parenthesis,) we still proceed in a naturall course of
Death; no sooner dead so, but our <hi>Life is hid with Christ
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100340:3"/>
in God.</hi> Thus on the Corner-stone we ketch Corners, alive
and dead, dead and alive: and 'tis quickly done: for Life
and Death, or Death and Life are not so farre disjoyn'd
as we account, none indeed so neare Neighbours; they
are sever'd not onely but by an Inch, as the Poet phansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
at Sea, <hi>Tabula distinguimur,</hi> but on Land also they are
scarce distant by a moment of Time: we finde them so
close united in my Text, that they meet in the selfe same
Instant, nay further in the very nullity of Time. For now
even now <hi>Ye are Dead,</hi> and Then even Then after Time
<hi>your Life is hid with Christ in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that my Text affords a contrary Assurance in two
contrary Cases; Assurance of Death while ye Live,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for <hi>ye are Dead,</hi> and Assurance of Life when
ye Dye, for <hi>your Life is hid with Christ in God:</hi> the first is
the <hi>Death of Life,</hi> the second the <hi>Life of Death;</hi> that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
sure, for ye are surer of nothing on Earth then of
yourselves, and yet howsoever ye are, <hi>ye are Dead,</hi> the
second surer yet, for God is surer then your selves, <hi>your
Life is hid with Christ in God.</hi> In the first part I shall strike
you Dead; <hi>ye are Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How Dead? yes already; in the <hi>Aorist;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which
we render not, ye shall dye, but ye have died, or now <hi>are
dead.</hi> Man borne of a Woman is not borne (as you may
think) into Life, but into Death. Ye that are most awake
sit asleep with your Eyes open; and when ye walk about,
ye walk like Ghosts. What? shall I tell my Hearers they
are Dead? who then shall heare me? I know to whom
I speake, to the Dead, that come hither to learne the way
of Life. Thrice Noble and thrice worshipfull, thrice
worthy and thrice welcome, that ye may truly know how
dead ye are, I say, ye are thrice Dead; yes, three wayes,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100340:3"/>
Dead <hi>in Law,</hi> Dead by the <hi>Course of Nature,</hi> Dead by the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>ye are Dead in Law:</hi> the Generall Sentence hath
already passed upon all: <hi>In the day thou eatest of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
fruit thou shalt surely dye.</hi> From that Day to This,
every sprig of <hi>Adam</hi> lives meerly by reprieve. For which
we have nothing to pleade but our Book and Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing;
our Book which containes Gods mercifull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and the Child-bearing of Christ, whereby we
become Consanguineous with the Innocent and Holy
One of God.</p>
            <p>If so, let me turne the Inference of my Text to the
Consequence, <hi>For</hi> to <hi>Therefore,</hi> and so read backward,
<hi>Therefore set not your Affections on things on the Earth,</hi> as
you are warned in the precedent verse. When we draw
neare to the End, we minde nothing else, and onely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
we set our strength. Would you not think the man
mad, who being sentenced to death should be sollicitous
for Titles to set forth <hi>Hìc jacet;</hi> if being streight to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molish'd
in Person, he should seek out Surveyors to build
Castles and Barnes; if being strip'd for the Axe, he should
send for the Taylour; if when he should gaine Peace with
God by sacrificing his Affections, he should chuse to die
like <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi?</hi> so vaine, so mad are we: all our
toyle is for an Epitaph; we build Houses when we must
dwell in the Grave; we take measure for Clothes when
Death takes measure for the Coffin, we and the wormes
look for Provision at once, and we dye in our Lusts. The
Iudge, under whose Repreive we stand, forbids Anxiety
for things that perish, yet still our wisedome teacheth us
to be thus foolishly Anxious: and therefore God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
our Projects as he did the project of that uncertaine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100340:4"/>
rich man in the Parable: while he was driven into agony
of thought what he should doe with his great increase,
while he became extreme miserable through much pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity,
and was ready to burst for want of a larger Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
his Repreiver sayes unto him, <hi>Thou Foole, this
Night will I take away thy Soule,</hi> this Night; for the Soule
is alwayes due, because we are Dead in Law. That which
Christ spake concerning the End of the World, <hi>Let not
he that is on the house top come downe to take any thing out
of the house, nor he that is in the Field returne to fetch his
Clothes, Mat.</hi> 24. the same may I apply to the End of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular Person, that promiseth Life to himselfe for
the accomplishment of remote projects; let not he that
is below thinke of cutting downe Trees to make Ladders
for his advancement, nor he that stands above thinke of
securing his Condition by descending lower; for we are
dead in Law. The Goard, wherein <hi>Ionas</hi> delighted, had a
worme inbred to make it wither, so have all Earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights:
if that will not weane us from them, we have a
worme of Corruption within our selves to make us let
goe our hold. <hi>Abraham</hi> the Representation of all the
Faithfull, had no Inheritance in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> not a
Foot of his owne Perpetuity, save onely a place of Buriall:
of this we are capable by Law. <hi>Dust thou art and to Dust
thou shalt returne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 19.</note> Indeed a Grave we cannot misse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Body will consume and bury it selfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are Dead by the <hi>Course of Nature.</hi> Beleeve
it, ye are all dead men (as we say of those that are despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
sick) for ye cannot hold out long, ye are Going
while I speake. Ye finde that the Dust flyeth away: are
ye not made of Dust? that the winde vanisheth; is not
your breath in your nostrills? that the shadow creepeth;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100340:4"/>
doe not your Bodies cast a Shadow? as the Element such
is the Compound; and as the Shadow, such is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
But more expresly <hi>Dust ye are,</hi> Psal. 103. 14. v.
<hi>Your Life is a winde,</hi> Iob. 7. 7. v. Your <hi>dayes a Shadow,</hi> Iob.
8. 9. v. You see the Dust Raised, not the Rising of every
Atome; the wind Past, not the Passage; the Shadow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
not the motion; and so your dayes slide away
without present observation of declining. That ye are
changed ye feele, though not the changing: you perceive
in your Age, a Spring, a Summer, an Autumne, a Winter,
and happily severall Months of these great quarters: for
every seaven-yeare brings a sensible Change: within the
number of 70 yeares, (which <hi>David</hi> accounted a full
Pitch of Life) <hi>Solon</hi> observed ten Changes, for ten times
seven; Teeth, Youth, Beard, Ability, Wedlock, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
Wisedome, Vertue, Equity, and then Recesse;
these Changes we plainly discerne at the Stages, though
not in the course: the Items in their summe, the granes in
their Pounds we easily comprehend, but the little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in themselves passe undiscerned, and we are stolne
from our selves unawares. Sometimes <hi>merrily,</hi> for <hi>we
bring our yeares to an end as a Tale that is told,</hi> Psal. 90. 9.
sometimes <hi>painfully,</hi> for <hi>our dayes are like the dayes of a
Hireling,</hi> Iob. 7. 1. sometimes <hi>idly,</hi> for our Life is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
a <hi>dreaming shadow,</hi> halfe of it sheere sleepe; and ever we
passe them <hi>swiftly;</hi> for <hi>our dayes are swifter then a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Shuttle,</hi> Iob. 7. 6. v. and so runs our thread of Life, just
so; as that from hand to hand, so this from Morning to
Evening, till we come from the beginning of the Web to
the Fag, from the Wombe to the Grave. Howsoever we
move, still we move forward, we never stay; the present
tense is but a moment, that which is past is nothing, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100340:5"/>
Future is not yet. What can we call our selves, who are
changed before the word is pronounced? <hi>I am</hi> is the
Name of God, the Name of the Creature is <hi>I am not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are much deceived, if we thinke we die not till the
last Gaspe. The beginning of Death is our Birth; we
bring it with us; because we bring both Flesh, and Sin,
whereof one makes us capable of Death, the other ready
to earne it; and therefore as our Strength and worke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth,
so doth our wages, Death comes on the faster
from the first day to the last. We thinke sometimes we
are growne younger by Recoveries; as when we proceed
from Creeping to walking, from weakenesse to strength:
'tis not so; for the yeare turnes about, as well in faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as in foule, no lesse in Spring then in Autumne; and
as the Time such is the Timed, our very growth leads to
decay, all addition to Life is but an Abatement. Turne
your Conceit a little from Time to Motion, you shall
finde the Pilgrims Life such as his Way, which by further
progresse, whether up-hill or downe-hill growes ever
shorter and shorter; or lay the Voyage not by Land but
by Sea; in a Ship whether we stand or sit, lie or goe, sleepe
or wake, play or worke, on we sayle, till we arrive at the
Port: so is our Life still bound for Death, through all
Varieties of Posture in Rest or Motion, through all chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Condition by chance or purpose. They that tary
within dores, cannot misse a significant Embleme of their
owne Fading;<note place="margin">Isa. 51. 6.</note> 
               <hi>All Flesh</hi> (saith the Prophet <hi>Esay) waxeth
old as doth a Garment;</hi> which whether it be worne, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in a Chest, is consumed by degrees; and as the Cloth
such is the Wearer; I may adde, (since every thing farre
and neare Preaches the same Lecture,) as the House also,
such is the Dweller; and as the Meat, such is the Eater;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100340:5"/>
and as the Thought, such is the Thinker; in the best Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
ever vanishing: but if the Garment be neglected,
the house unrepaired, the meate ill cook'd, the Thoughts
destructive, if the Master too become more ruinous by
Sin then by Mortality, how swift is the decay of Nature
so hastened by wast, how headlong is the race of a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice

so follow the Generations of men; though the
World be ever full, yet they that fill it are ever voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Roome; so you may see the high wayes filled
with unabiding Passengers, and Channells with fleeting
streames.</p>
            <p>Is it so? then what Counsell in such a case? First, <hi>be not
over grieved for the losse of a Friend by Death,</hi> considering
that thy selfe also doest lie wounded by his side, thou
dead <hi>in Fieri</hi> as he <hi>in Facto,</hi> Fish tumbling in the same
Net. Thou shalt follow him, but he shall not returne
to Thee; and sorrow for necessity must needes be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary.</p>
            <p>Next reckon to thy selfe <hi>how Death invades thee:</hi> know
that every gray haire is a summons, and that every Ach,
every Swelling is a Venny or Thrust made at thee, take it
for a warning. Likewise cast thy account, how thou art
chang'd ever since thy birth, or within a certain distance
of time; then by proportion of declining, thou maiest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
how near thou art to thy naturall period. But thou
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100340:6"/>
must further add the <hi>various contingence</hi> of possible dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
though the way be smooth, the Robbers may be
rough and many; our escape from infinite Casualties, if
well considered, makes every day a Birth day. This mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of danger may teach us the <hi>warier provision,</hi> and
by provision death may be stav'd off. For though we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
travell to it, yet our travell may be to and fro, long
in passage of a little space, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> through fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Meanders were travelling forty yeares from <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
to <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After sufficient Provision, the next Caution must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Anxiety and Immoderate Pensivenesse for more perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
safety then belongs to our share:</hi> when all the world tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and so many eminent Worthies are dayly sacrific'd
by the Sword, now to cover a particular Exemption from
danger is too much partiality of tendernesse. The onely
meanes of security is to expect none upon Earth, but to
stand armed with Patience and Resolution to indure the
Lot which God hath appointed. The heart being thus
setled and prepared for Death, nothing else can seem ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
<hi>quid ad me quàm magnis moriar, ipsum mori non
est magnum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the best use is, dayly <hi>to add to our future life as much
as we loose of the present,</hi> and as fast as we perish here, so
with all speed to lay the Foundations of Immortality in
Heaven; selling both profit and pleasure for one inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Iewell, and making friends of the <hi>unrighteous Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
Since die we must, let us learne betimes how to die;
that we may turne our necessity into Vertue, and meet our
Destiny not in Horrour, but in Honour; not as a Losse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but as an Advantage; not as a Trapdore swallowing up in
Destruction, but as a Gate opening to everlasting Life.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100340:6"/>
And this is done, first by <hi>recounting our looser dayes in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse,</hi>
so shall we unlive the time we have lived amisse;
then by <hi>frequent Meditation and foretast of Death;</hi> Think
thine Eyes grown dim in the fainting twylight of life, and
thou shalt soon turn them aside from vanity; think thine
Eares grown deafe with sicknesse, and thou wilt soon stop
them against Idle words; think thy Tongue grown stiffe
with drowth, and that thought will be a watch before thy
mouth, to Examine what thou lettest out and what thou
lettest in; think on the cold sweat of Death, so thou wilt
abhorre to swim in Lust; think how naked thou must goe
hence, even as bare as thou camest, onely with a shrowd
as thou camest in with a Cawle, and almost with as little
flesh, then thou wilt easily contemne all wordly pomp, and
subdue thy carnall Tumours. Thinkest thou, that Death
drawes nearer when it is thought of, or dares not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
unlesse it be call'd? no such matter: this practice
of dying dayly will not make us to die the <hi>sooner,</hi> but so to
live as that we may die the <hi>happier.</hi> And this or the like
practice belongs to our Christian Profession assumed in
Baptisme, where by the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> we become
Dead in a third Acception.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dead in Quality;</hi> Dead to all Wordly and Carnall
Lusts; though we may sometimes fall upon them by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
yet to pursue them is against our Profession. The
Desire is Dead, and the Renunciation made against them
is a kind of Death. The spirituall <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with all his.
Hoast lies drown'd in the Font, representing a Red Sea,
the Blood of <hi>Christ:</hi> there Christ and We enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
he to free us from Sin, and we to forsake it; he to
strike off the Dominion and Guilt thereof, we the Service
and Confederation. Because by nature we are born Dead
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100340:7"/>
in Sin, and subject to Corruption, therefore by a second
birth we are born Dead unto Sin, the spirituall Death is a
Countermine against the Naturall. For by the Power of
Baptisme the Old man together with his Lusts is taken
and crucified, nayl'd hand and foot to the Crosse of our
Saviour, quite disabled from acting what he would, and
at length with much adoe, with striving and strugling;
with Gall and Vineger, with Piercing or Breaking forc'd
to die outright.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How then shall we that are Dead to Sin live any longer
therein?</hi> 'tis the Use of the Apostle, <hi>Rom. 6. 2. v.</hi> Is it not
strange to heare that a dead man walkes? is it not stranger
to heare that he speakes and workes, yes eates and drinkes
abundantly, and yet dead? how is it then that the Old man
so long since crucified, dead, and buried, doth yet so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exercise the Actions of Life, moving the Tongue
to Idle words, Lying, &amp; Swearing, the Throat to Excesse,
the Eie to Adultery, the Hands to Oppression, and all the
members to severall Iniquity! how is it that the Church
of God is haunted with such Evill Spirits and Goblins!
sure there is some Spell or Magick in this foule Prodigie;
otherwise without the help of the Devill it could not be.
I grant, that a rotten Tree after it is hewn down and laid
in the Durt, may put forth a Sprig, a Leafe, or so; but they
come to no Strength, they never prosper. Haire may grow
on a Carcasse, but such haire is never dressed nor keemed.
So may the Reliques of the Old man have a Counterfeit
shew of Life, but must not gather Head, never be cherish'd
within any Christian bosome. Death frees us from all
worldly Relations, and Bonds (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> disputes in the
sixth to the <hi>Romanes</hi>) it frees the Wife from the yoake
of her Husband, the Servant from the Task of his Master:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100340:7"/>
shall we then who are freed by Death forsake a fresh and
lovely Spouse who died for our Love, and be reunited to
an old rotten Carcasse? shall we forgoe this new Master
who bought us with his blood, for an Old tyrannous Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball
that feedes on our destruction? God forbid.</p>
            <p>So much for this point; wherein you have heard, that
we are now dead already, and in three respects: Dead in
Law, through the sentence pronounced on sin, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought not to be over-sollicitous for much provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
where we have no right to tarry longer. Dead by the
Course of Nature, as appeares by the mutability of those
elements whereof we consist, and of things appertaining;
by dayly declynations, insensibly but yet continually
growing into sensible changes, in our owne Persons, and
by the successive defluction of all mankinde: from whence
we should gather patience for the losse of others, Caution
for our selves, but without Anxiety, and above all godly
Preparation for a better life. Lastly, that we are Dead by
the Covenant of Grace, Dead to sin, and sin to us, that
therefore sin ought not to rule and exercise our Members.
Then if the Old <hi>Adam</hi> Die within us while we live, we
shall live in the New when we Dye; as we were Buried in
Baptisme, we shall be Baptized in Buriall, and returne
with Bodies as clean from the Grave as we did with soules
from the Font. So from the <hi>Death of life</hi> I passe to my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Generall, the <hi>Life of death, Your Life is hid with
Christ in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Death having lost her sting cannot kill us utterly; some
Life is left, else it could not be hid. You may then observe
these three degrees of Comfort, the <hi>safety</hi> of life in the
Chamber of Death, <hi>'tis Hid;</hi> the ready <hi>Meanes</hi> of safety,
<hi>'tis hid with Christ,</hi> the strong <hi>Author</hi> of the Meanes, <hi>'tis
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100340:8"/>
hid with Christ in God.</hi> The Subject is aptly disposed to a
resurrection, the Meanes are already prepar'd, the Author
is All-sufficient and Infallible.</p>
            <p>First, our <hi>Life is Hid.</hi> then it is <hi>not quite extinguished,</hi>
but <hi>safe laid,</hi> as coales rak'd up in Ashes, safe though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen,
alive though close covered. It lies like Treasure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Ground, not out of Minde, though out of Sight, and
shall again be dig'd up, if not for the worth of the Mettle,
yet for the Image of God which it beares.</p>
            <p>Death is but a longer and sounder sleep, and life is hid in
sleep, as well as in Death; for in sleep the senses are fetterd,
as in Death all bodily Faculties. Howsoever from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of one part an utter Destruction of the whole is not
concluded. When halfe the body is struck and possessed
by a dead palsie, there still remaines a living Body, because
there is life in some part. So when the whole Body is seazd
by Death, there still remaines a living Man, because there
is life in the best part, the Soule. <hi>Abraham, Isaack,</hi> and
<hi>Iacob</hi> have being enough to preserve their Names, and
our Saviour proves them to be also Living. What though
the Union of parts be Actually dissolved? Yet the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
is not Totall, because there still remaines a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and a Naturall Desire of reuniting. The parts which
stand separate are in want and Imperfect, as without the
whole they needes must; therefore the widowed Soule
longs for the Bodies Fellowship, to supply this want, and
to gaine the fullnesse of Perfection: <hi>How long</hi> (cry the
Saints under the Altar) <hi>O Lord Holy and True, how long?
Rev. 6. 9. v:</hi> This Naturall Desire cannot ever be frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
So then upon the matter, the Dead are but asleepe;
and <hi>if they sleepe,</hi> then (as the Apostles well answered)
<hi>they shall doe well:</hi> for as men, that have slep'd soundly,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100340:8"/>
arise from their Couch more fresh and lively, the dull and
cumbersome humours being well concocted; so the dead
roused with a loud summons from the Grave, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
more Glorious and Agil, all Imperfections being
worne off by the Furnace of Corruption. In the meane
time, while the Bodies of both Sleepers lie senselesse, their
Soules are alike busied; as in the living sleepe they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with dreames, so in the dead sleepe with heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Visions.</p>
            <p>But shall we call it a Sleeping or Hiding, when the Body
is turn'd to the substance of the Bed, Flesh to Mold? still
we may. For what think you of the Seedes sown in your
Ground? is that sowing a destruction, or onely a Hiding?
say then, doth our Creed, in this point extend to our
Corne, and not to our selves? Behold in a little seed there
sleepes the bulk of a rising Tree: when 'tis grown to a vast
extent, consider in what secret crany so spacious vertue
lodg'd: where was the ruggednesse of the bark, the soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of the trunk, the verdure of the Leafe, the pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the fruit? feele and examine the Seed, 'tis not
rough, whence this grate of the bark? 'tis not tough,
whence in processe this hardnesse of the wood? 'tis not
greene, whence this tincture of leaves? it smells not,
whence this fragrance in the fruit? wherefore in Secrecy
they all at once lay dormant, though at once they doe not
break forth. From the Seed is the Root produced, from
the Root the Trunk and bark, from them the Twig, from
the Twig the Leaves and Fruit, and againe from the Fruit
the Seed. Now man like Seed lies resuscitable in the
womb of the Earth: If from a small kernell having no
distinction of parts, wood, bark, leaves and fruit be dayly
raised into the massy bulk of a Tree, what more wonder,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100340:9"/>
if out of dry Homogeneous Dust, Bones, Sinewes,
Veynes, Flesh, Skin, and Hayre, be reduced into Man. He
that askes a Reason of the manner, must be cunningly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by asking other questions, of things continually
obvious to sight, yet no way comprehended by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
that since by seeing we cannot penetrate the depth of
things <hi>Visible,</hi> we may beleeve by hearing the Truth of
the <hi>Invisible.</hi> So S. <hi>Gregory</hi> on the twentieth of S. <hi>Iohns
Gospell.</hi> The Philosopher may object, that the raising of a
Tree out of Seed is rather a Reparation of kind then of the
particular, and so an Instance of Generation rather then
of the Resurrection; but since this Generation is from the
womb of the Earth, not from the Stock of the Tree, we
reply that it is also an Argument of the Resurrection, so
urged both by <hi>our Saviour</hi> and by S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to make this Doctrine more familiar, the Steps of
the Resurrection are imprinted in most of the Creatures.
The Phoenix waxing old fills her Nest with billets of
Spice, on her funerall pile she turnes into Ashes, and after
by the dew of Heaven springs up a new Phoenix. Divers
imperfect bodies, which yesterday lay labouring in some
deep puddle, now start into Life; Bees in the Hive, Flies in
the Clefts of Walls, which lay all winter without sense
or motion, suddenly revive at the Suns approach: Day
it selfe dies into night, and the life of the Sun is hid with
the Antipodes, yet within a few houres he appeares in his
sparkling dresse, to cheere the forsaken world. All things
are preserved by perishing, and are new trim'd by Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
So <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Though these Arguments seeme
meerly Rhetoricall, and farre short of demonstrating the
Resurrection of man; yet upon better consideration,
since they plainly demonstrate an Aptitude of Reviction
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100340:9"/>
in nature, under the power and providence of the Author,
from the raising of these inferiour Creatures, we may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
conclude, a proportionall likelyhood of raising that,
which beares his own Image.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I returne to the meditation of Nature, whose
reparation is most apparant at this present season: behold now
the Revolution of the whole world is an earnest of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;
now all the Emblems of mortality enjoy their spring;
Grasse and Flowers rise from the sullen clod, under which
their life lay hid. Shall we borrow their names onely in time
Fading, and not when they flourish? Why so? for all these
things are renew'd for man, and man doubteth not of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing:
shall he for whom they are reviv'd, dispaire of his
owne Resurrection? What though he lye long, and wast in
the earth? so he ought. Creatures, that soon fade againe, may
have quick returnes of their spring, but man, who after his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
is sure to wake for ever, may well endure a long sleep.
Again, Creatures lesse Noble, unlesse they spring quickly, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
spring at all; but man consisting of a reasonable soule, and
indued with vegetant power in the most Excellent manner, is
ripened more Deliberately, (saith <hi>Athenagoras</hi>) and must rise
the last of all: he hath a Priviledge to rise after many thousands
of yeares, out of any Elements, Fire, Ayre, Sea, and Earth,
wheresoever he hath been scatterd. Nothing springs before the
due time, at the due time Man shall also: Would you have the
Harvest before all the graine be sown? <hi>Mundi tempora homini
Annus est,</hi> the end of the world is mans Harvest; and best of all
so, least again he should rise to sin: but when men have been
all sown, when the Winter of dying is past, when God the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
hath sufficiently purged us, and clarified the Flesh
from drosse, he will call us up to an endlesse Summer; a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
answerable to the past Winter. For which purpose, we
also have our peculiar Sun, and proper Dew; Sun and Dew as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100340:10"/>
well as the Creatures: our Sun is the <hi>Sun of Righteousnesse; when
He appeares, then</hi> (as it followes after my Text) <hi>we shall appeare
together with him in glory:</hi> our Dew, whether it be the <hi>Dew of
Teares,</hi> it ushers in the <hi>Reaping of Ioy,</hi> or whether the <hi>Dew of
God's promise,</hi> it shall not faile of <hi>performance. Awake and sing</hi>
(saith he) <hi>Ye that dwell in the dust, for thy Dew is as the Dew of
Hearbs; and the earth shall cast out her Dead, Esay. 26. 19. v.</hi>
When this comes to passe (as who dares doubt it?) then it shall
appeare, that we lay as <hi>Flos in Hyeme,</hi> that we Winter'd in
Christ our Cause, and only sunk into his Root, who is the <hi>true
Vine,</hi> and <hi>Tree of Life.</hi> This is our second degree of Comfort,
that our <hi>Life is hid with Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>With Christ, he is the Meanes:</hi> under the power of his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
our life is hid. Shall not he be able to effect for us,
what the Sun can doe for Flowers? some will ask, <hi>How shall
the Dead rise, or with what body shall they come?</hi> Christ an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers;
<hi>With my dead Body shall they rise, Esay.</hi> 26. at the 19. <hi>v.</hi>
By vertue of his body already risen from Death. <hi>Vbi gloria
praecessit Capitis, eòsequetur &amp; spes Corporis,</hi> (saith <hi>Leo</hi>) whither
the Head hath gloriously gone before, the Members hope to
follow after.</p>
            <p>At the first veiw there appeares no more in Christs Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
but a man Risen; but when we consider the Condition
and Relation of that Man; that being the <hi>Innocent and Holy one
of God,</hi> he was neither <hi>worthy of Death,</hi> nor <hi>Tenable</hi> by it, that
therefore he dyed not for <hi>Himselfe,</hi> but for the <hi>Guilty,</hi> not as
an <hi>Offendor,</hi> but <hi>Vndertaker,</hi> and <hi>Laid downe his Life with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to take it up again,</hi> for the benefit of those for whom he
laid it downe; that Death unadvisedly seizing upon an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
prize, forfeited the Lawfull hold of sinners together with
the Iust; when the Gospell hath yeilded this Discovery, then
we find that this Sonne of Man is become the Everlasting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Lord and giver of Life to all Mankinde; that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100340:10"/>
is virtually included under His; and that though
power thereof, we shall rise as surely, as if we had his power
to raise our selves. For as <hi>to us a Childe was borne,</hi> and for <hi>us a
Man was Crucified,</hi> so for <hi>us a Saviour is risen.</hi> Whatsoever
Christ did on Earth, the same he did in our behoofe, not for
Himselfe, so that if we rise not, in vaine is Christ risen. Why
is he cal'd the <hi>Foundation,</hi> the <hi>Head,</hi> the <hi>Roote,</hi> the <hi>First fruites,</hi>
but in relation to <hi>Vs?</hi> If the Foundation be laid by wisedom,
it implies a rising Structure, if the Head be above Water, the
Members are safe, if the Roote be quick, the Branches will
sproute, if the first Fruites be Holy, so is the whole Crop.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ is our Life</hi> (in the next words after my Text) this Life
lay <hi>Hid in our Grave,</hi> and therefore it is but a correspondent
exchange, that <hi>our Life should be hid with Christ;</hi> that since he
lay in a sepulcher hewd out for another, others should be quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd
by his Rising. But how was Christ hid in our Grave?
himselfe hath shew'd in the 12. of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn, 24. v. Except a
Corne of Wheat fall into the Ground and dye, it abideth alone, but
if it dye, it bringeth forth much fruite;</hi> he lay then in the Grave
as a graine of Wheat in the furrow, so purposely sowne for us,
that our Life might be hid with him, as increase in the Graine
which was sown. It is not to be forgotten, that as Christ at
his Passion compar'd Himselfe to a <hi>Graine of Wheat,</hi> so the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
in his Resurrection hath fitly compar'd him <hi>to the First
Fruites. Cor.</hi> 15. 20. the compleat Allegory declares this
Vertue in Him, this Dependance in us; that since he lay in the
Ground not like a stone, but like Corne, therefore in springing
up he rose not single, not as <hi>Ionas</hi> from the belly of the Whale,
(unlesse to <hi>Ionas</hi> you reckon the <hi>Ninivites</hi> rais'd by his
Preaching) but multiplyed to more then Fifties, to more then
Hundreds, to a world of Graines besides Himselfe: that since
at His Resurrection he likewise became the first Fruites of
them that sleep, he hath consequently obtain'd a blessing for
the whole field.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100340:11"/>Wherefore as the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> (who is blessed for evermore)
hath return'd Victor in spite of invading Death, and all Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
wherewith he was blocked, so shall it be, that all his
Dependants in the utmost skirts of the world shall rise from
Death, notwithstanding the drowning, burning, mangling,
confounding, scattering of Carcasses, whose disorderd destiny
makes a distinct Recollection of Parts to seem impossible. But
in presence of a sufficient meanes, and unresistible Power, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
must Vanish. We finde in the Generall Course of
Nature, things as much beyond our reach dayly renew'd; we
finde in Humane nature no Reluctance, no repugnance against
the Resurrection, but rather an Aptitude and desire, if there
come a sufficient cause to reduce it into Act. Now when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion hath discovered to Reason an able Meanes in
Christ, who for this purpose became the first fruites of them
that slep'd, and hath gotten power to be judge of the Quick
and Dead, that the Dead might rise and appeare before his
Tribunall, now the Resurrection is more then possible, more
then fecible, 'tis in Vertue already perform'd; and when I shall
shew you that the <hi>Author,</hi> who hath chosen and appoynted
this meanes, is God, it will be found to be necessary. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
consists the third degree of comfort, <hi>our Life is Hid with
Christ in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In God.</hi> Where could our Life be better or safer plac'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For as the Soule is the Life of the Body, so God is the Life of
our Soules, and consequently both Soules and Bodies are in his
hand; hardly to be poynted out, but safe kept in an Invincible
and Infallible Custody. The same who of his Infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
hath appointed Christ to be the meanes of our Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
he having Power and will to produce the deserv'd Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
will not faile of his Iustice and Truth to bring it to passe.
If yet you can doubt, consider your own Creatures, the works
of man: when a musicall Ayre hath been plaid, is it quite lost,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100340:11"/>
never to be called for againe? or what is become of it? is it
hid in the Bowells of the Instrument, in the prick'd or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivd
Copy, or in the hand and Power of the Musition? in all
these? so when the breath of man is expired, he is hid in the
<hi>Mold</hi> as in the <hi>Matter,</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi> as with our <hi>Idea</hi> and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
in <hi>God</hi> as in the <hi>Author</hi> and harmonious Composer. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
when a Printer dissolves his Impression, and casts it into
the first Elements or Letters, is it quite lost, or what is become
of it? is it hid in the Boxes which contain those Letters, or in
the book out of which it was copied, or in the hand of the
Printer that sets the Letters together? in all these? such is the
Case of Man: though all his quarters be divided into the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the world, though his parts be distributed like those of
the <hi>Levites</hi> wife, or digested into other bodies, or scattered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all Elements, they are still within Gods Boxes; though his
Figure be lost to the memory of men, it remaines fresh with
Christ, and <hi>in his Book are all our Members written;</hi> though
they cannot meet of themselves, yet God can finde them out,
and will joyne them together after his Sonnes likenesse, and his
particular Register. Who turned the round world, who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned
the parts of man at first? was not God that Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and Christ his Sonne? Now which is harder, to make a
Table and the Timber too, or to joyne the parts taken a sunder?
to create that which was not, or to new cast that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
That Potentiall being, which man had within the hand
of his Maker before his Creation, the same, and more, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
after his Dissolution. Look on Nature, the Creature
is potentially couch'd under her Power in the Seed; look on
Art, so is the frame within the Artificers call in the wood; look
up to God, so are they that shall rise, within the Mold, before
him: how grosse is it to beleeve <hi>Nature</hi> in her Naturall Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
<hi>Art</hi> in her Artificiall, and onely to mistrust <hi>God</hi> in his
workes Divine? Ask not, how the Bodies confounded one
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100340:12"/>
with another shall be sifted and sever'd; for God is the Keeper
of Bodies and Elements, he knowes where every Atome lies,
what belongs properly to every Person, and how to call it
forth. How vaine is it, to question Gods Power in things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to our scant Apprehension? yet to widen your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
in this particular, and to shew you an Answer to
more then ever was objected, Though all adventitious matter
should be separated, and none should remaine but that which
issued from the loynes of our Parents, and was also derived
from our first Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> God out of those few
drops could raise distinct and proper bodies to all mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nihil Deo Impossibile nisi quod non vult,</hi> (saith <hi>Tertullian</hi>)
nothing is Impossible to God but what he will not doe, and
what he will that's necessary. Now God hath reveal'd his will
by appointing and using the <hi>meanes of Raising us,</hi> and hath past
his promise by his Son <hi>Iesus;</hi> that through him he will raise us
up at the last day. <hi>This is the Fathers will which hath sent me</hi>
(saith our Savlour) <hi>that of all which he hath given me, I should
lose nothing, but should raise it up againe at the last day, Ioh.</hi> 6.
39. <hi>v.</hi> so that now Gods Iustice and Truth are deeply at stake,
till there come a Resurrection. His Iustice would have stood
ingag'd however, though no such meanes, no such promise had
been reveal'd; if we grant, there is a God, it may be evinc'd
out of morall principles, that of necessity there must be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
though we knew not how: for either there would
be no difference of Vertue and Vice in respect of Reward and
Punishment, and so divine Iustice would be but a Bug-beare,
or else there would be need of a Resurrection, that they who
have been prosperous in their wickednesse might be called to
account hereafter, and they that have here suffered by Vertue
might then shine in Glory. But since the meanes are expressely
revealed, since Christ hath paid the price of our Resurrection,
and God hath promised to make it good, since many Martyrs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100340:12"/>
have died in defence of this Hope, upon Gods word, God is
further ingag'd both to Christ and Them, both in his <hi>Iustice</hi>
and <hi>Truth,</hi> to performe his purpose and promise. And we may
be sooner induc'd, to yeeld, that there is no <hi>God,</hi> or that he was
not at all our <hi>Builder,</hi> nor Christ his <hi>Corner stone,</hi> then that <hi>he
should begin to build and not make an End,</hi> or <hi>Promise</hi> an End
and not <hi>fulfill</hi> it. Wherefore without doubting, let us here rest
our Hope, that as the Glory of the Father hath raised his
Sonne, so he will perfect his Glory in raising his Sonnes
Attendants.</p>
            <p>Thus you have heard the three Degrees of our Comfort;
the <hi>Safety</hi> of Life in Death, in <hi>that it is hid;</hi> the sure <hi>meanes</hi> of
safety for that it is <hi>bid with Christ;</hi> and the strong <hi>Author</hi> of
the meanes, in that it is <hi>hid with Christ in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remaines now on our part, that we be not affrighted with
Death, because it is no longer the Iaw of Destruction, but the
Gate of Life, and a Passage into Everlasting Happinesse.<note n="*" place="margin">Cics de contem: morte.</note> If
those bold Spirits, that having heard of the Immortality of the
Soule, or at least her Rest from misery, presently dispatched
themselves out of this World, without any other call, or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
warrant, but onely this Notion; if those undaunted Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers
had been likewise taught the Resurrection of the Body
to a better Life, and had such an occasion to spend their lives,
as is now offer'd to us, the defence of Religion, Lawes, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties;
doubtlesse their Courage had been so inflam'd, that
either through too much Valour they would undeservedly
have found their seeking, or have gotten such honour, as might
stay the desire of death by pursuing the death of others, and by
taking content in Acts of Glory. I doe not wish any to run
this Course unadvisedly; a sober Expectation of Death or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
in usefull Service, both by charging and sustaining,
is Valour sufficient, and not too much, for any Souldierly
Martyr.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:100340:13"/>Further since Christ by the wood of his Crosse hath sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
our bitter waters, and died for Sin to make Death easie,
since he hath risen againe to lead us the way into Life Eternall,
I cannot too much inculcate this other Lesson; that we walk
not disorderly in this our Pilgrimage; least we turn the Gift
of Life into double Death, the Ioy of our Hearts into Horror
and Iudgement, our Rising into Bottomlesse Falling. In it
selfe, nothing can be so sweet and desireable as the Appearance
of the Lord Iesus in the Resurrection. Why should we so
confound the Conscience with unrepented Guiltinesse, that
we should need Mountaines to cover us from his Presence?
Let us rather amend our wayes, and live carefully, that we may
die with Comfort and Rise with Ioy; that the Hope of a Ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Rising may remaine comfortably seal'd unto us in the
time of our Hiding, by Assurance of the Holy Ghost, through
Christ the Meanes, and God the Author. To whom be all
Thankes, Praise, Dominion, and Glory, now and for evermore.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
