            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

supplying some of the <hi>Words</hi> that were worn out of the <hi>Manuscript Copy,</hi> and for correcting some Passages, which the <hi>Copyer</hi> perhaps writ wrong, and it is upon that <hi>Edition</hi> that this <hi>Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is made.</p>
            <p>The Importance of this <hi>Book</hi> will be easily apprehended, by those who consider that <hi>Lactantius</hi> was the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litest Writer of his time, in whom one finds somewhat very like <hi>Augustus</hi>'s Age revived; he had also particular Opportunities of being well informed of his Subject, by the Post to which he was advanced in <hi>Constantine's Court,</hi> of being his <hi>Son's Tutor.</hi> It is true, his Eloquence carries him often into strains that become an <hi>Orator,</hi> better than a <hi>Historian:</hi> for he has a heat of stile, that ought not to be imitated by one that would write <hi>History.</hi> But he seems to have designed this <hi>Book</hi> to be a mixed sort of writing, between a <hi>Discourse</hi> and a <hi>History;</hi> so that the Figures that agree not to the one, may be allowed to the other.</p>
            <p>The Account that he gives of <hi>Saint Peter's</hi> coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> cuts off the Fable of his being there for <hi>five and</hi>

               <hi>twenty years:</hi> but if what he sayes of things at so great a distance from his own time, is not thought so Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and if his Authority seems not strong enough to cut off all those <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions</hi> that are said to have risen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign and <hi>Decius</hi>'s, since he represents all that Interval as a time of a long Peace to the <hi>Christians;</hi> yet we must at least suppose him, to have been much better Informed of that which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fell out during the <hi>last Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution;</hi> so that the beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61829:4"/>
               <hi>Legends</hi> there are to be cut off. For the truth is, that very soon after this <hi>Persecution</hi> was over, some that loved either to make (or at least to report) very tragical Stories concerning it, seemed to give no Bounds to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention upon a Subject that was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough of it self, and so needed not to have been swelled up by such Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. The Destruction of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> that the <hi>Christians</hi> kept, which were so carefully searched after during this <hi>Persecution,</hi> gave some colour for those pretended <hi>Discoveries;</hi> for it served turn to give them credit, to say, that such <hi>Relations</hi> had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from the <hi>Searches</hi> of those <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors,</hi> and so that they were by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident found out in some corner, where very probably those that forged them, both laid them and found them: and the matter would no doubt have been received with more Credit, if some Dream or Vision had been pretended, as that which had made the Discovery. Of all those <hi>Legends</hi> none is more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, nor less credible than that of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> and that upon many accounts; but as the silence, not

only of <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> but of all the other Writers of the fourth <hi>Century,</hi> gave a just Prejudice against a <hi>Story</hi> that begun not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear till the middle of the fifth <hi>Century;</hi> so the positive Testimony of <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> who excepts the <hi>Gaules</hi> from the <hi>Persecution,</hi> puts an end to the <hi>Fable.</hi> For tho he shews so great a disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to speak well of <hi>Constance,</hi> that this may seem to lessen the Authority of one, who to make his Court with the <hi>Son,</hi> would naturally raise the <hi>Father's</hi> Character; yet so remarkable a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action as that was, could not have been supprest with any sort of <hi>Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> by one that must have certainly heard of it if it was true.</p>
            <p>The false appearance of a greatness of mind, that was inferred from <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>'s resigning the <hi>Empire,</hi> is also ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off by this <hi>Relations;</hi> since it is plain, that both <hi>Diocletian's</hi> Brain was turned, and that he was forced to it; so that his <hi>Resignation</hi> was not the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of his <hi>Philosophy,</hi> but of the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Ambition</hi> of his <hi>Son in Law Maximian.</hi>

the Application to which a <hi>Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it tyed me, together with the <hi>present</hi> seene of affairs, led my mind very naturally into more general thoughts. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

drive away those less decent sallies of his mind, to which he is carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is aware, yet the Importance of this matter leads to speculations that are more General, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence less offensive. And since the Melancholy State of things at <hi>present</hi> carried me in those Intervals in which I discontinued the dry work of <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating,</hi> to consider the grounds on which those cruel and persecuting <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> are founded, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Motives from which they rise, the Characters that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them, and the Effects that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; I thought I might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given a little, if I took the liberty to swell up the bulk of this small <hi>Book</hi> with a <hi>Preface</hi> of some length; in which my design is not only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this ill natured <hi>Principle,</hi> and to shew, that where-ever it is authorised, it is a more infallible mark of an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Church,</hi> than all the other Characters are of an <hi>Infallible Church,</hi> to which those pretend, that have died themselves so red in the Blood of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but likewise to form in the Minds of those who hate <hi>Persecution,</hi>

perhaps only because they either feel it, or are affraid of it, such a Notion of this Matter, as may preserve them from falling into the same Excesses if a Revolution in the State of Affairs should put it in their Power, to use others as hardly as they have been used by them. It has been often observed, that tho a <hi>Plea for Moderation</hi> is the Sanctuary of all the Unfortunate, yet their Fortunes came no sooner to be changed, but that they insensibly got into that <hi>Principle</hi> which was so much decried by themselves, when their Affairs were in an ill condition: as if the only quarrel that they had to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,</hi> was because they had not the managing of it themselves. I will treat this Subject with all the closeness that the Matter deserves, or that I am ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of; and will avoid the serving up what I am to propose with the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishings of the fine <hi>Sayings</hi> of <hi>others:</hi> for as that would carry me too far, so a <hi>good Reason</hi> is so much a better thing, than a round Period, or a laboured Sentence, that the Mind finds it self satisfied with the <hi>one,</hi> whereas the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is only pleased with the <hi>other.</hi>

            <p>

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61829:6"/>All <hi>Persecution</hi> rises out of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of Spirit, which makes a man less able to bear Contradiction. There is a Tyranny in most mens nature, which makes them desire to subdue all others by the strength of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings: and such men have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable hatred to all that do not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themselves to their Reasons; and think that they are affronted when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men refuse to submit to them: so that he who would strike at <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in its root, must begin here, and endeavour to soften men, especially towards those who differ from them in matters of <hi>Religion.</hi> This Imperious temper, when it works upon Subjects of <hi>Religion,</hi> finds somewhat to raise its spleen, that was of it self Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous enough before: and that which is called <hi>Fury</hi> and <hi>Rage,</hi> when it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in other <hi>Disputes,</hi> comes to be called <hi>Zeal</hi> when it is turned towards the Theories that relate to another World.</p>
            <p>But when we consider what a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime thing <hi>Divine Truth</hi> is, and what a poor low thing the <hi>Mind of Man</hi> is, we shall see cause to blunt a little the

Man is much governed by Fancy, and Fancy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the texture of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which renders many more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of apprehending Objects that are some way proportioned to them, and more disposed to follow them; so that <hi>Temper</hi> prepares men for some Opinions and prepossesses them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst others.

Men like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise receive with their Impressions of <hi>Religion</hi> such a respect for them, as makes them look on every thought that calls them in question as crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: and when persons are bred up to disquiet themselves with Scruples, if they have so much as made a doubt of their <hi>Religion,</hi> it is not hard to see them adhere so firmly to the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of their <hi>Education,</hi> which stick so fast to the worst sort of men, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Atheists</hi> themselves after all the



<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61829:7"/>
pains they take to get rid of them, cannot shake them off so entirely, but that they will be apt to return oft upon them. Men that think much, and that Reason well, that are freed from the biass that Interest, Honour, Kindred, and Custom, do give them, and that have leisure to examine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters carefully, may indeed get above all these: yet there are so few that can do this, and there are yet so much fewer that will do it; that it is rather a wonder to see so many change their Perswasions, than to see so few do it. And indeed it is so sublime a <hi>Theory</hi> to think on God, and his Attributes and Works, or to think of another State, and of the Way that leads to it, that till God furnishes out a new Mission of <hi>Apostles</hi> with a Measure of those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts, which he poured out on the Great <hi>Pentecost,</hi> it is not easy to imagine how the Conversion of <hi>Heathen Nations</hi> should be made. For tho the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of some of these is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream gross, yet their <hi>Priests</hi> have such Symbolical significations for all these Rites, that they do much diminish the horror which is raised by the first



<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61829:8"/>
sight of them in the minds of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and since the chief grounds, upon which we prove the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> are taken from the <hi>Prophecies</hi> in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> and their Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Now,</hi> from the Evidence that was given concerning the <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> the <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> which we confirm from the Collateral Proofs of the State of that time, of the writings of the Enemies of this <hi>Religion,</hi> and of that Succession of Authors that in all the Ages that have past since, have mentioned those matters, and cited the <hi>Books</hi> which we hold to be Divine. All this is so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to those who can make the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that it is strange to find how any one can withstand it; but to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> who know nothing of it, and who have no way of Informing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves concerning it, all this can signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy nothing. So that in order to the convincing their understandings, (for I do not treat of Gods secret Methods in touching their Consciences) I do not see how we should expect that they should yield easily, unless there were a new Power of working <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>



               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61829:8"/>
conferred on those who labour in this work. And what noise soever the <hi>Missionaries</hi> may make with their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> in those remote parts, it is plain, these are all Impostures; for the most necessary of all other <hi>Miracles</hi> for the Conversion of strange Nations, being <hi>the Gift of Tongues,</hi> with which the <hi>Apostles</hi> were so wonderfully furnisht at first, and since they all are forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that this is wanting to them, we have all possible reason to conclude, that God would not change his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, or qualify men to work Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and not give them that which is both the most sensible and the most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of all others, towards that end for which he authorises them.</p>
            <p>But to return from this digression, a man is scarce the Master of his own thoughts: Habit, Constitution, and other things do so concur, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not open his eyes to new Objects, nor see them in a new Light other than that in which he has been accustomed to view them; and a Man can no more change his notions of things, because a set of new Opinions would accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date him better, than he can change



<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61829:9"/>
the relish that his senses, his ear or his tast has in their objects; a man may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate, but he still thinks as he thinks; and cannot think otherwise, because he would have himself do so: But if a man is not the master of his own mind, much less is any other man the Master of it. No man has that Superiority over any other mans reason, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that it should alwayes accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date it self to his: and the severest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Tyranny must still leave the thoughts at liberty: the forcing a man to say, or do otherwise than he thinks, by threatnings, the execution of which is above his force to endure, is only the delivering over such a person to the rack of his own Conscience here, and to all those miseries hereafter, which must be the portion of Hipocrites, and of Dissemblers with God or Man. Nor is there such an infallible distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in one mans nature from another, that the one is more like to be in the right than the other: Since therefore, among all those that differ, some must be in the wrong, those that have the power in their hands, may possibly be of the wrong side, and in that case all



<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61829:9"/>
their Severity is turned against the Truth, and those who believe it. And since God makes the Sun to shine, and the Rain to fall on the just as well as the unjust, <hi>Gideons</hi> reasoning may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to this matter <hi>if Baal is a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> God, let him plead for himself;</hi> and the force of <hi>Gamaliels</hi> Argument, that <hi>if it is of Men, it will come to nought; and if it is of God, we must not fight against him.</hi> As it silenced an <hi>Assembly</hi> of very fierce <hi>Persecutors,</hi> so it is full as strong now, as it was then: For Reason is Eternal, and changeth not. It seems also plain, that those Actions which concern humane Society, belong indeed to the Authority of the Magistrate; but that our thoughts, with relation to God, and such actions as arise out of those thoughts, and in which others have no interest, are Gods Immediate Province; and can belong to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jurisdiction. God only knows our thoughts, as he alone can change them; so that a Magistrate by encroaching upon them, breaks in upon Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and upon that essential right of humane nature, of worshipping God according to our conviction, which



<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61829:10"/>
is in us Antecedent to all humane Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and can never become sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it.</p>
            <p>But if the General <hi>Theories</hi> from the nature of man, give a very favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable view of what is now advanced, the characters of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and the many express texts that are in it should determine this matter more positively. The <hi>Religion</hi> revealed by <hi>Moses</hi> consisted in Temporal <hi>Promises,</hi> an Earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and all the blessings of this life; so that since the <hi>Iewes</hi> had all these things by vertue of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it was very reasonable that a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that <hi>Law</hi> should infer a forfeiture of all those Rights, that the <hi>Iews</hi> held by vertue of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was as just, that a <hi>Iew</hi> should have been put to death for the violation of those Laws, as it is lawful for us to put a man to death, that coins or clips Money: yet as for <hi>Opinions</hi> the case was different, even among the <hi>Iews:</hi> and therefore, tho the Doctrines of the <hi>Sadducees</hi> struck at the Foundations of all Religion, the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> when they had the upper hand, never carried the matter so far as to proceed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities



<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61829:10"/>
against them. But what Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities soever might have agreed with the <hi>Mosaical</hi> dispensation, they seem to be all out of doors under the <hi>Christian Religion;</hi> which gives us no Earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> no Temporal <hi>Blessings,</hi> nor the Rules for <hi>Civil Society:</hi> but having found the World in the possession of their Temporal Rights, it only came to superadd to those the Doctrines and Rules of a Divine Discipline, upon which the Happiness or Miseries of another State do depend. Now it seems to be an uncontested Rule in Justice, that in whatsoever Society one is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the Violation of the Laws of that Society can only inser a Forfeiture of all that one had or might have expected by vertue of it: but this cannot be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried so far, as to make one forfeit all that he holds by vertue of any other Society, to which he belongs; and therefore, since we hold our <hi>Temporal Estates</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> not by vertue of our <hi>Christianity,</hi> but as we are the Members of the <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Kingdom</hi> to which we belong, our doing any thing that is only contrary to our <hi>Religion,</hi> may well make us forfeit all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs



<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61829:11"/>
to us by vertue of our <hi>Baptismal Covenant;</hi> but this ought not to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried so far as to cut off those <hi>Rights</hi> that we have antecedent to our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> as we are <hi>Men,</hi> and the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of a <hi>Civil Government.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour confirmed all this by saying, that <hi>his Kingdom was not of this World; that he came not to destroy, but to save;</hi> and by giving this Rule of Justice, <hi>of doing to others that which we would have others do to us:</hi> which would soon let all <hi>Persecutors</hi> see how differently they act to it: but above all, our Saviour has made the Doctrines of <hi>Meekness</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> such main Ingredients in his <hi>Gospel,</hi> that he has made them the <hi>Characters</hi> by which his <hi>Disciples</hi> may be every where known; and this <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> is so diffused thro the whole Writings of the <hi>N. Testament,</hi> that how hard soever it may be to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand some of the other passages that are in them, yet there is no ambiguity at all in those that set this forth; we are not only restrained from <hi>ruining</hi> those who differ from us, but we are required to <hi>love</hi> them, to <hi>bear</hi> with them, and to deal with them in the



<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61829:11"/>
Spirit of <hi>Meekness:</hi> there are some of the <hi>Epistles</hi> that do not mention several of the Duties Incumbent on <hi>Christians,</hi> yet there is not one, how short soever, in which this of <hi>Love</hi> is not proposed, in terms that are both strong and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and while the <hi>Church of Corinth</hi> was almost rent asunder by a variety of Opinions, and by the different Parties that followed the several Teachers that had been among them; St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not enter much into the Grounds of their Disputes, but recommends <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to them, in terms that shew how much he himself was Inflamed while he writ them; and he is carried into all the raptures of a Divine Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that so transporting a Subject could inspire: <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> lived so long as to see a great deal of the first fer vour of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> slacken; but when he writ to revive that Spirit, the Argument upon which he dwells chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is to persuade all to <hi>love one another,</hi> and he does that in the softest and most melting terms that can be imagined. The Controversy concerning the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation that lay on the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for obeying the <hi>Mosaical Law,</hi> was judged



<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61829:12"/>
by the <hi>Apostles</hi> against the <hi>Iudaisers,</hi> and the Inferences that depended on that Controversy were such, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> shews, they went so far as to make void <hi>the Death of Christ;</hi> yet the same <hi>Apostle</hi> is gentle to those that without seeing the extent of these consequences, were carried away by those <hi>Iudaisers;</hi> so that he acknowledges, that in their observing them from a good motive, they were <hi>acceptable to God;</hi> and that as the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> or the Gospel, consisted not in those scrupulous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions of <hi>Meats</hi> and of <hi>Drinks,</hi> but <hi>in Righteousness, Peace, and Ioy in the Holy Ghost;</hi> so he adds, that every man was to endeavour to be fully persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his own mind, and was not to <hi>judge his Brother</hi> in such matters, but to leave him to the Judgment of God. This way of managing a Controversie, that was of such importance, and that was maintained with so stiff an Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, even to that extraordinary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that was lodged in the <hi>Apostles,</hi> ought to have been the measure upon which all the succeeding Ages of the <hi>Church,</hi> ought to have formed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and when the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that had



<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61829:12"/>
an infallible Assistance, and so might have spoken in a strain of a higher Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than any that have come after them, yet thought fit to treat of those Matters in such an humble and softning stile, those who cannot pretend to such a direction, ought not to take upon them to dictate, and to threaten and destroy those who differ from them.</p>
            <p>It is indeed an amasing thing, to see how much the <hi>Christian Church</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from that Pattern: and when one considers the first beginnings of the <hi>Christian</hi> and the <hi>Mahometan Religion,</hi> he is not a little surprised to see the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that have befallen both. The bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Author of our <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> as he was a Pattern for Humility and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, so he <hi>was made perfect thro Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings:</hi> and his <hi>Religion,</hi> as it contains precepts suteable to the Example that he gave, which are set down in the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and most persuading Expressions possible, so it gained its first Glory in the World, and obtained its chief Triumphs over it, by the <hi>Meekness</hi> and <hi>Gentleness,</hi> and the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of those who embraced it: on the



<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61829:13"/>
contrary, the <hi>Mahometan Religion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the Person of that <hi>Impostor,</hi> with all the Fierceness of rage, and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by the Sword, by which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> pretended that he was sent of God to convert the World: The <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that have received the <hi>Mahometan Religion,</hi> are by their Constitution rough and barbarous: and yet how shameful a reverse of the first beginn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>two Religions</hi> is but too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the World: the <hi>Mahometans</hi> in a course of several Ages are so much softned, that instead of that cruelty with which their <hi>Religion</hi> appeared at first, they are now so gentle, that <hi>those of a Religion,</hi> which believes theirs to be only an Imposture, live secure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and know the <hi>Price</hi> that the <hi>Liberty of their Conscience</hi> must rise to: and that being payed, they enjoy in all other respects the Protection of the Government, together with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Exercise of their <hi>Religion:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other hand, that part of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> that pretends the highest, has so far departed from the Meekness of its <hi>Author,</hi> and of his first Followers, that notwithstanding



<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61829:13"/>
all the polishings of Learning and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility that are in it, it is now the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest and the most implacable <hi>Society</hi> that has ever yet appeared in the World: if there were no other Evidences but this single one, it is enough to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, how much that Body has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from its first Institution: and if our Saviour has given us a short A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of the Character of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> in these two qualities, that <hi>he is a Lyar and a Murderer,</hi> then any Body of men, that has decreed, <hi>that faith is not to be kept to Hereticks,</hi> and that has also decreed <hi>the Murder of so many Innocent Persons,</hi> who have done nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that Civil Society to which they belong, that deserves a forfeiture of their Lives; such a Body, I say, if we may take our Saviours Character for a Rule, looks more like the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of that fallen Spirit, than the Body of which the Lamb of God is the Head. And when we consider the plain and express Words, in which the great Duties of a Holy Life are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in Scripture, but most particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and the Darkness that are in many other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages



<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61829:14"/>
of which the meaning is more disputable, it looks like an unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Perverseness to see men, who still pretend to make that Book their Rule, yet to be so visibly faulty in executing the one, and so excessively severe in imposing the other, of which I shall content my self to give one single In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the Tenth in the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that he set out, with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>Lateran Council,</hi> order'd a severe <hi>Prosecution</hi> to be made of all <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and that all the <hi>Laws</hi> against them should be put in execution: but at the same time, he order'd such slight punishment against those that should <hi>wilfully</hi> and <hi>publickly</hi> Blaspheme <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> even tho they relapsed in it over and over again, that it is plain he had no mind to deter men with too much severity from the practice of that which was so common in his own Court: a small Fine, or the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of the Profits of a Benefice, is all the punishment that he laid on the one, even when <hi>Clergy men</hi> relapsed in it. This may serve to shew, that tho naturally one is apt to think <hi>Blasphemy</hi>



               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:61829:14"/>
a much more heinous Crime than <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy,</hi> yet a <hi>Pope,</hi> together with a <hi>Council,</hi> which they pretend was <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> made a Distinction in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of them, which is very little for their Honour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Christians</hi> did, during the first Ages, declare highly against all <hi>Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> on the Account of a Difference of Persuasion in matters of <hi>Religion:</hi> and tho their Interest Naturally led them to this, yet we pass a very hard Judgment on those times, if we think that they were only of that mind, because the Power was then in the hands of their Enemies. When the <hi>Empire</hi> turned <hi>Christian,</hi> the very <hi>Heathen Worship</hi> was not only tolerated for above a whole Age together, but the <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves continued to be in the chief Imployments of the <hi>Empire:</hi> and it is pleasant to see how the <hi>Heathens,</hi> that had so long persecuted the <hi>Christians,</hi> and that had contrived the severest of all the <hi>Persecutions</hi> under <hi>Iulian,</hi> which very probably had been put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he had returned victorious from his <hi>Persian</hi> Expedition, saw the State of things no sooner altered, than



<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61829:15"/>
they began to imploy all their Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the behalf of <hi>Toleration;</hi> as if <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> had been an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Right of Mankind, from which they ought never to be cut off: and they carry'd this so far, as to pretend, that a difference in <hi>Religion</hi> tends more to the Honour of God, than a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in it could do: and so they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, that a variety in it was acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>The first severity that <hi>Christians</hi> practised upon one another, was the <hi>banishing of Arius,</hi> and a few of his Followers: it must be acknowledged, that this seems to be the utmost extent of <hi>Civil Authority</hi> in those matters: for certainly a Government may put such persons out of its protection, that are Enemies to its Peace, and so ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them upon great occasions, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them leave to sell their Estates, and to carry away with them all that belongs to them; yet this being all that any Humane Government can claim, it ought not to be applied too easily nor rashly, till it is visible, that all other Remedies are ineffectual, and that the publick Safety can be no other



<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61829:15"/>
way secured: but tho this severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Arius</hi> had no great effects, yet the <hi>Arians</hi> had no sooner the Power in their hands, than they put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cttice first all the Contrivances of Craft and Fraud, together with many less crying Violences, under <hi>Constance,</hi> and they carried this afterwards to a more open <hi>Persecution</hi> under <hi>Valens:</hi> and after that, both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi> it appeared, that a cruel Spirit was so inherent in that party, that it shewed it self as oft as ever they had it in their Power: but while <hi>Valens</hi> persecuted in his Division of the <hi>Empire,</hi> it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> his Brother thought it was enough to support the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> without persecuting the other; <hi>Gratian</hi> carried the matter fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and tolerated both almost equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And in the happy turn under <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius,</hi> at what pains was <hi>S. Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene</hi> to restrain the <hi>Orthodox</hi> from retaliating upon the <hi>Arians</hi> the ill treatment that they had suffered from them: and not only the <hi>Novatians,</hi> but even the <hi>Arians,</hi> continued to have their Churches in the Imperial Cities. The first Instance of the Imploying the



<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61829:16"/>
Secular Arm against <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that was set on by any of the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> was under the Reign of that bloody Tyrant <hi>Maximus,</hi> and it was managed by two such scandalous <hi>Bishops,</hi> that their ill Lives is no small Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst every thing that was carried on by such Instruments. This was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the best <hi>Bishops</hi> of that Age, and the ill Effects of that Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are very copiously marked by the Historian. One is unwilling, for the sake of those Ages, to reflect on the Rigour that appears in some <hi>Laws</hi> that are in the <hi>Code;</hi> yet the mild be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of <hi>Atticus, Proclus,</hi> and some other <hi>Bishops,</hi> is marked with the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that were due to it: and it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that those <hi>Laws</hi> were rather made to terrify, than that they should be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Donatists,</hi> after a Contest of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 120 years continuance, that was managed at first more gently, grew at last so fierce and intolerable, that not being contented with their own Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they broke in upon the Churches of those of the <hi>Unity:</hi> and committed many Outrages on the Persons of some



<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61829:16"/>
of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> putting out the Eyes of some, and leaving others for Dead: the <hi>Bishops</hi> upon that consulted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ought to demand not only the <hi>Emperour's</hi> Protection, but the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Laws made against <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> to the <hi>Donatists. S. Austin</hi> and some <hi>Bishops</hi> opposed this for some time; but they yielded at last: and these Laws were so severely executed, that not only the <hi>Donatists</hi> themselves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained heavily of them, but <hi>S. Austin</hi> in several Letters that he writ to the Magistrates upon this occasion, made the same complaints; he interceded very earnestly for the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and said, that <hi>it detracted much from the Glory of the</hi> Church, <hi>that had received so much Honour from the sufferings of the</hi> Martyrs, <hi>to see others suffer upon the account of the</hi> Church: and he told them plainly, that <hi>if they did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed more moderately, the</hi> Bishops <hi>would suffer all that could come upon them from the Rage of the</hi> Donatists, <hi>rather than Complain any more to those who acted so rigorously.</hi> Yet tho <hi>S.

This was not only claimed by the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> but it was made a part of their Oath at their Consecration, <hi>that they should Oppose and Persecute Hereticks to the utmost of their power:</hi> Nor were they contented to proceed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rules of Justice upon Accusations and Witnesses; but all Forms were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceded, and they by vertue of their <hi>Pastoral Authority,</hi> (as if that had been given them to Worry their Sheep, and not to Feed them) objected Articles to their <hi>Prisoners</hi> upon suspition, and required them to purge themselves of them by <hi>Oath:</hi> and because <hi>Bishops</hi> were not perhaps all so equally Zealous and Cruel, some of them being Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of great Quality, so that some remnants of a generous Education, and

of their lay pity, might still hang about them; that Bloody Man <hi>Dominick</hi> took this work to task, and his <hi>Order</hi> has ever since furnished the World with a set of <hi>Inquisitors,</hi> compared to whom all that had ever dealt in Tortures in any former times were but Bunglers.</p>
            <p>So far has this Melancholy Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Degeneracy of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> carried me: they at last came to extol a Zeal against <hi>Heresie</hi> as the highest Act of Piety towards God: and since <hi>Heresie</hi> is reckoned by <hi>S. Paul</hi> among <hi>the Works of the Flesh,</hi> it seemed as just to punish it in the severest manner, as it was to punish any of the other <hi>Works of the Flesh:</hi> and since all <hi>Hereticks,</hi> were looked on as Persons damned, all Tenderness towards them, and Pity for them, was as far exinguished as it was possible. For a <hi>false Religion</hi> will not easily have the better of good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so entirely, as to root it quite out; tho it must be acknowledged that the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> has done more towards that, than any other that has ever yet appeared in the World. All the room that was left for good Nature, was the favourable Definition that was given



<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61829:19"/>
of <hi>Heresy:</hi> by which <hi>Obstinacy</hi> was made its peculiar Character, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished it from <hi>Error,</hi> which lies in a more Innocent Mistake concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Divine Matters: and as many have explain'd this <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> it amounts to a continuing in <hi>Errour</hi> after one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it. This Notion of <hi>Heresy,</hi> which has been received by many of the greatest Men even in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, seems to agree well with that of <hi>St. Paul's</hi> ranking <hi>Heresy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Works of the Flesh;</hi> for if it is meerly a mistake in the Judgment, in which one continues, because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overcome his persuasion, nor see Reasons that are strong enough to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to change his Mind, such an adhering to <hi>Error</hi> may be called any thing rather than a <hi>Work of the Flesh.</hi> But if a Man from a Principle of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, Pride, or Discontent, either throws himself into ill Opinions, or continues in them after his Mind is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enlightned, so that he stisles and denies that inward Conviction, then the Reason is very plain, why such an ill Temper of Mind should be reckoned a <hi>Work of the Flesh,</hi> because it plainly

arises out of a depraved Nature.</p>
            <p>I will not here enter into so trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some an Enquiry as it would be, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how far an <hi>Erroneous Conscience</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits one before God; for that must be left to Him, who will judge every Man according to his Works, and who best knows how far he will accept of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Repentance of unknown Sins, and of a general Act of Faith, even of Truths that are yet unknown; but as for the Judgments of men, certainly when the other parts of ones life make it clear, not only to a Judgment of Charity, but even to that of Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he is sincere, and that he means well, it is hard to know when he is <hi>Obstinate,</hi> and when his <hi>Errors</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Heresies,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Works of the Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So far have I been led upon the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>Spirit of Persecution,</hi> that is not only warranted by Custom, and a long continued Practice; but is by the Authority not only of <hi>Popes,</hi> but even of <hi>General Councils,</hi> establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed into a Law on the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> I am carried next into a Scene of Thoughts that are more particularly



<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61829:20"/>
suted to the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Churches:</hi> and here it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that <hi>Persecution</hi> is a more ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable thing according to the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> than it is according to <hi>our Tenets;</hi> for the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> that pretends to be <hi>infallible,</hi> has a better Right to demand a blind Submission from all its Subjects, and to treat those roughly who refuse to grant it, than a <hi>Church</hi> that pretends to nothing but a Power of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> and that confesses, she may be mistaken. <hi>Our being Subject to Error,</hi> is unreasonably urged, when men would carry it so far as to make us doubt of all things: yet it ought at least to have this effect on us, as to keep us from being too ready to judge hardly of those who are of another mind, or to use them roughly for it; since it is possible, that they may be in the Right, and that we may be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; at least, they may have very probable Reasons for their Opinions, which if they do not quite justify their Mistakes, yet do very much excuse and lessen them. It is likewise visible, that all severe Proceedings upon the



<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61829:20"/>
diversity of <hi>Opinions,</hi> how effectual soever they may be on base-minded men, who will alwayes make Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of a good Conscience, when it comes in competition with the <hi>Love of this present World,</hi> yet work quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wise on men of awakned Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings and generous Souls; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of gaining on such Persons, these Inspire them with horror at a sort of men who go about to ruin compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of people, that never did them hurt. It is from this, that those Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Hatreds arise among men of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Persuasions. Every man is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to understand an Argument, or to be much disturbed at it: and tho <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> that carry their Speculations further into the Consequences of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, whether Real or Imaginary, grow hot and angry at one another upon those Heads, yet the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them little, and feel them less: but every man feels an Injury, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes her Inferences very quick upon it: and concludes, that <hi>those who use us ill, hate us:</hi> and there must be a great degree of Regeneration to keep men from hating those that hate them:



<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61829:21"/>
upon this arises all the Animosity that is among the several Parties: for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one reckoning himself a Member of that Body to which he associates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, thinks that he is obliged to resent all the Injuries that are done to his Fellow-members, as much as if they were done to himself in particular: and by the same natural Logick, he casts the Guilt of the Wrongs done his own Party, not only on those Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals of the other Party, from whom they did more Immediately arise, but upon the whole Body of them: and so here a War is kindled in mens Breasts, and when that is once formed within, it will find some unhappy occasion or other to give it self a vent. Those who are ill used, are in a State, like that of a Mass of humours in the Body, which roul about less perceived, till some unlucky Accident has weakned any part of it; and then they will all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselves on the part that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. Men that are uneasie, naturally love Changes: for these are like the shifting of postures, they give some present ease, and they slatter the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient with the hope of more to follow.

The Advice that the old <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> sent his <hi>Son,</hi> was certainly very wise; he had Intercepted the whole <hi>Roman Army</hi> in the Hills, shutting up the Passages so that they could neither go backward nor forward: the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> advised him first to dismiss them all without any Injury, since that would probably oblige the <hi>Romans;</hi> or if that were not followed, to cut them all off; for that would weaken them considerably: whereas the middle Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which the <hi>General</hi> took, of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them all go, having first put a publick Affront on them, enraged the <hi>Romans</hi> without weakning them. According to this Advice it seems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that all considerable <hi>Bodies of Men,</hi> that are in any <hi>State,</hi> are to be set at ease, or to be quite rooted out; and there is nothing wise in this severe Method, but an extream and an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting <hi>Persecution,</hi> and in this point, if the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> has forgot the <hi>Innocence of the Dove,</hi> yet it must be confessed, that she has retained the <hi>Wisdom of the Serpent.</hi>

by it, but is likewise mischievous to them, by the aversion that it inspires in them to those at whose hands they suffer, by the ill Habit of mind into which it throws them, and by those violent Projects and Convulsions which do very naturally come into the heads of those, who as they feel much, so they fear yet more.</p>
            <p>Those that do <hi>persecute,</hi> tho they seem to triumph for a while, with the Spoils of their Enemies; yet will soon feel how this sinks their Credit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly among those that were more Indifferent Spectators, while the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate was managed with the Pen or Tongue; but they will certainly take part at least in their Compassions with the Miserable; and will be disposed to think ill, not only of those men that are heavy upon their harmless Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but even of the Cause it self, that is supported by such Methods.</p>
            <p>The multitude even of the lowest Order of men has a remnant of good Nature left, which shews it self in the sad looks that all put on at the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions even of Malefactors: but if a false <hi>Religion</hi> has not quite extinguished

Humanity in its Votaries, this will make a more sensible Impression, when men that have done nothing amiss, and are only in fault because they cannot help thinking as they do, are made Sacrifices to the Rage of others, that perhaps have little more to say for themselves, but that they are in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the <hi>Law;</hi> which in the next Revolution of affairs that may fall out, will be an Argument so much the Stronger for using themselves in the same manner, because it is a just reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation on them for that which they made others to suffer.</p>
            <p>The men of <hi>Persecution</hi> do also na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally engage themselves into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of <hi>Courts,</hi> and all the Factions of Parties: they enter into Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances upon <hi>Ministers of State,</hi> who drive them on to execute all their Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and to serve all their Ends: and who have too good understandings themselves not to laugh at the officious forwardness of those who are perhaps more eager than is intended, in the doing of that for which those very persons, whose blind Instruments they



<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61829:23"/>
are at one time, will reproach them at another.</p>
            <p>In short, <hi>Persecution</hi> does extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vitiate the Morals of the Party that manages it. The worst men, so they are furious and violent, are not only connived at, but are even courted: and men otherwise of severer morals, will insensibly slacken, by reason of their Engagments with vicious men, whom they will find themselves forced to cherish and Imploy: and if those who have <hi>persecuted</hi> others, fall under a Reverse of Fortune, and come to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themselves a little of that which they made others feel, as their ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour will deprive them in a great measure, of those Compassions that would otherwise work towards them, so it will raise within them many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy Reflections upon their own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctings, which will prove but Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Companions to them in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: and these will force them to conclude, that because they shewed no Mercy, therefore they now meet with the requital of <hi>Iudgment without Mercy;</hi> which how unjust soever it



<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61829:23"/>
may be, in those by whom they suster, yet they will find it meet to look up to God, and to confess, <hi>that just and Righteous are all his Wayes:</hi> and it may be reasonably apprehended, that it may have contributed not a little to fill up the measure of the Sins of a <hi>Church,</hi> and to bring down severe strokes upon them, when the visible Danger, which was apparent from a formidable <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> could not turn their thoughts to that side, but that instead of Using Legal and just Precautions for their own Security, they let themselves loose to all the Rages of a mad <hi>Prosecution</hi> of some poor undiscreet and deluded <hi>People;</hi> and all this to gratify their own Revenges, or to Insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the Favours of <hi>those</hi> who do now justly laugh at them, when the turn that they intended is served by their means: and <hi>those</hi> who would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselves for those hard things which they have reason to expect from <hi>a Church that has alwayes delighted to bath her self in Blood,</hi> ought seriously to profess their <hi>Repentance</hi> of this Fury in Instances that may be as Visible and

edifying as their <hi>Rage</hi> has been publick and destructive.</p>
            <p>But there remains yet one point, without which I am sensible that this discourse will appear defective; I know it is extream tender in our present Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, yet that does not defer me from venturing on it; it is, <hi>How far Protestants ought to Tolerate Papists.</hi> It seems at first view the most unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing in the World, for those to pretend to it, who we are sure must destroy us, as soon as it is in their power to do it. I say, they <hi>must</hi> do it; since by those <hi>Councils,</hi> which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves hold to be <hi>General,</hi> the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and the <hi>breaking of Faith to them,</hi> has been so formally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that it is a foolish piece of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption to imagine that they can ever lay down those Principles. <hi>Infallibility</hi> is the bottom upon which their <hi>Church</hi> is built, and she must be as <hi>Infallible</hi> in the <hi>Rules</hi> that she gives of <hi>Morality,</hi> as she is in her Decisions in Points of <hi>Faith:</hi> for all the Reasons that are given for private persons depending on the <hi>Church</hi> for the <hi>Rule</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> do

            <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD has at last heard you (My dearest <hi>Donatus</hi>) in those Prayers which you offer up daily to Him, as well as our other <hi>Brethren,</hi> who by the Vertue of their <hi>Faith,</hi> and of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Consession</hi> that they have made, have acquired to themselves an eternal Crown of <hi>Glory.</hi> To these Prayers God has hearkned; and has delivered us from our Enemies: and a blessed Peace being now again re-established upon Earth, the <hi>Church of God,</hi> that was

lately laid so low, begins to flourish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and thro the Mercy of God, his House, that was laid in Ruins by his Enemies, is now rebuilt with a new Magnificence. God has raised up to us <hi>Princes,</hi> who have repealed all the wicked and bloody <hi>Edicts</hi> of the late <hi>Tyrants;</hi> and have so setled the Peace of Mankind, that instead of the Clouds and Storms of the late times, there is now an Universal Calm every where: and after all those Hurricans of Fury and Violence are now blown over, we enjoy a serene Air, and the happy quiet which we had so much long'd for. Now Gods Anger is turned away, and he hearkning to the Prayers of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, has by the Interposition of his Divine Aid, raised up their afflicted and broken Spirits: Now he has wiped away all their Tears, and has put an end to the Conspiracies of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Those who had set themselves in opposition to God, are now laid in the dust: Those who had rased the Temples of God, are now become spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles to the World; and they who had exercised so much Cruelty on the



<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61829:28"/>
Servants of God, have received at his hands a severe Return of their Rage, and have breathed out their defiled Souls after they had undergone a great many dismal strokes, that were laid on them by the Hand of God. Their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment was for some time delay'd, but at last it was signal: and in them all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages ought to observe the Justice of God in punishing such proud and impious <hi>Persecutors</hi> suteably to their Crimes. In the manner of their <hi>Death,</hi> God calls likewise on all at what distance soever, either of time or place, to observe the Greatness and Majesty of his Providence in destroying the Enemies of his Truth. And this will appear yet more evident to us, if we call to mind who have been the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors of the Church</hi> from its first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and if we observe the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Divine Justice, that has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in their punishment.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Towards the end of <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s reign, in the <hi>Consulate</hi> of the two <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the <hi>Iews</hi> on the 23. of <hi>March.</hi> He rose again on the <hi>third day,</hi> and



<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61829:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
brought together his <hi>Disciples,</hi> whom the fear of his Sufferings was beginning to disperse, and he continued with them for the space of 40 <hi>dayes</hi> on earth, opening their hearts, and expounding the Scriptures to them, which till then had appeared dark and involved. He ordained and instructed them to go and preach this new <hi>Doctrine</hi> over the World; and he left them a scheme for their conduct, and for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this new Dispensation. When he had finished his Ministry, a Cloud received him, and carried him up into Heaven: and then his <hi>eleven Disciples</hi> having assumed into their number <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> dispersed themselves over the World for the preaching of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as their Master had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them: And during the space of 25. <hi>years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> till the beginnings of <hi>Nero's</hi> reign, they continued founding many <hi>Churches</hi> in a great many different <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Provinces.</hi> During <hi>Nero's</hi> reign, <hi>S. Peter</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and made a great many Converts there, having thro the power of God, that rested on him, wrought several <hi>Miracles,</hi> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>



               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:61829:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so he formed a <hi>Church</hi> in this place of <hi>Empire.</hi> This was brought to <hi>Nero</hi>'s ears, who finding that great multitudes, not only in <hi>Rome,</hi> but in all other places, were daily falling oft from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and were turning to this new <hi>Religion,</hi> and being carried by his brutal Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to all sorts of Cruelty, he set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self first of all to destroy this <hi>Religion,</hi> and to <hi>persecute</hi> the Servants of God: So he both ordered <hi>S. Peter</hi> to be <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> to be <hi>beheaded.</hi> But he did not escape unpunished: for God had regard to the Sufferings of his People. The <hi>Tyrant,</hi> as he was dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of the <hi>Empire,</hi> so he disappeared all of the sudden, nor is there so much as the least remembrance left of the Burial Place of that Brutal <hi>Prince.</hi> But some have from hence taken up a very foolish Imagination, of his being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and of his being preserved alive in some other Region; which they found on some words of the <hi>Sybil,</hi> that mentions a Murderer of his Mother that had fled away, but that should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again: and they fancy, that as he was the <hi>first</hi> who <hi>persecuted the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>



               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:61829:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so he shall be likewise the <hi>last</hi> of their <hi>Persecutors;</hi> and that he is to appear again immediately before the coming of <hi>Antichrist:</hi> and they judge, (tho very unreasonably) that as there were two of the Antient <hi>Prophets</hi> who were translated, and who before the last Revolution of time are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as the Fore-runners of <hi>Christ,</hi> when he is to be come again, accompanied with his Saints, to begin his holv and endless Reign; so likewise that <hi>Nero</hi> shall appear as the Fore-runner of the <hi>Devil,</hi> who must make way to him, who is to bring a strange Desolation upon Earth, and a Destruction upon all Mankind.</p>
            <p n="3">III. After <hi>Nero,</hi> and the Interval of some few more years, there arose an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Tyrant, <hi>Domitian,</hi> not much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to him: who tho he acted in a most Tyrannical and Arbitrary Manner, being heavy to his People, and no less hated by them, yet he reigned in Peace and Safety for several years, till be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to set himself against God. But as soon as he was set on by the Instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil to <hi>persecute</hi> the <hi>Holy</hi>



               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61829:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Seed,</hi> then was he delivered up to the hands of his Enemies. Nor was his being Stabbed thought Punishment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for his Crimes, but care was taken that no Memory should be left of him to Posterity; for tho he had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed many Magnificent Buildings, &amp; that there were many Monuments of his <hi>Empire,</hi> both in the <hi>Capitol</hi> and in other Places, yet the <hi>Senate</hi> did express such a detestation of him, that they ordered that there should remain no <hi>Statue</hi> for him, nor so much as the Traces of any <hi>Inscription</hi> that made mention of his Name: And by a most severe Decree, which they past for this effect, they branded his Memory with eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy. Thus all the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Edicts</hi> of this <hi>Tyrant</hi> being repealed, the <hi>Church</hi> did not only recover its former quie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, but became much more Flourishing under a Succession of many worthy <hi>Princes,</hi> who as they governed the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire</hi> very happily, so the <hi>Church</hi> suffered no Hardships under them: and she being thus freed from the Rage of her Enemies, dilated herself both in the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> parts,



<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61829:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so that there was no corner of the World so remote, nor any Nation of it so wild, that was not visited by this Divine Light, and that was not tamed by its Discipline. But this long peace came at last to an end.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. For after many years the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable <hi>Decius</hi> persecuted the <hi>Church,</hi> and who but so vile a man would have set himself against so holy a Doctrine. It seems he was raised up to the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Dignity</hi> for this very end, that as soon as he began to rage against God, he might be immediately thrown down: for having marched against the <hi>Carpi,</hi> who had possessed themselves of <hi>Dacia</hi> and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>sia,</hi> he was surrounded by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and both he and a great part of his <hi>Army</hi> was cut off: nor had he so much as the Honours of a Funeral, but as well became one that had set himself against God, his Carcass was exposed as a prey to the Beasts of the Earth, and to the Fowls of the Air.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Not long after <hi>Decius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <hi>Valerian</hi> was inflamed with the like Rage, and stretched forth his



<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61829:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hands against God. In a very little while he shed a great deal of the Blood of the Saints; but God plagued him with a new and unusual sort of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and in his person there was a new remembrance lest to Posterity of Gods Severity in punishing his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies according to their Merit. He was taken <hi>Prisoner</hi> by the <hi>Persians,</hi> and so he not only lost the <hi>Empire,</hi> which he had governed so insolently, but as he had robbed many others of their Liberty, so he likewise lost his own at last, and fell under a most Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Slavery. For as oft as <hi>Sapores</hi> the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who took him, had occasion either to mount on Horseback, or to go into his Chariot, he made the <hi>Roman Emperour</hi> stoop down, that he might make his Back his Step to get up; and whereas the <hi>Romans</hi> had made some Representations of the <hi>Persians</hi> being deseated by them, <hi>Sapores</hi> used to rally <hi>Valerian,</hi> and to tell him, that the posture in which he lay, was a more real proof to shew on whose side the Victory went, than all the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures that the <hi>Romans</hi> could make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>



               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:61829:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Valerian</hi> being thus led about in Triumph, lived for some time, so that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> had in him occasion given for a great while, to treat the very name of a <hi>Roman</hi> with all possible Indignity and Scorn. And this was the heightning of his Misery, that tho he had a <hi>Son,</hi> upon whom the <hi>Empire</hi> had devolved by his Misfortune, yet no Care was taken by the <hi>Son</hi> either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue the <hi>Father,</hi> or to Revenge his ill Usage. After he had ended his Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Life, his Skin was flead off his. Body, and both it and his Guts being tinctured with a red colouring, they were hung up in one of the Temples of the <hi>Persian</hi> Gods, to be a perpetual remembrance of so remarkable a: Triumph, by which they might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways put such <hi>Roman Ambassadours</hi> as should be sent among them in mind of it, and from so unusual a sight, warn them not to presume too much upon their own strength, but to remember <hi>Valerian's</hi> fall. But how strange a thing was it to find, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such remarkable Judgments of God upon former <hi>Persecutors,</hi> there should:



<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61829:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
arise any that should dare so much as to project, much more to re-act, such crimes against the Majesty of that God that supports and governs all things.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>Aurelian,</hi> that was naturally Violent and furious, seemed to forget what had befallen <hi>Valerian,</hi> or if he remembred his Captivity, he did not seem to reflect on his Crimes, or to consider <hi>that</hi> as the Punishment of <hi>them,</hi> and so he likewise drew down the Divine Displeasure on himself by his Cruelty: but he lived not long enough to execute what he had designed, and he ended his days in the beginnings of his Rage. For before his Edict against the <hi>Christians</hi> was sent over all the <hi>Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> he himself was killed at <hi>Caenophrurium,</hi> a Town in <hi>Thrace,</hi> by some of his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks, upon some ill-grounded su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitions that they had conceived of him. It might have been expected, that the succeeding <hi>Emperours</hi> should have been restrained by so many and such signal Examples: But they were so far from being terrisied by them,



<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61829:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they acted yet with a more daring Boldness against God.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>Diocletian,</hi> that was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver of all our late Miseries, as he ruined the <hi>Empire</hi> by his ill Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, so he could not be kept in from acting likewise in Opposition to God. His Avarice and his Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise joined together, had produced great Mischiefs. He assumed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>three partners</hi> in the <hi>Empire,</hi> having divided it into <hi>four parts;</hi> and he did so encrease the number of his Troops, that every one of the four had a greater <hi>Army</hi> than the former <hi>Emperours</hi> had, who alone governed the whole <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;</hi> and the number of those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his pay, growing greater than that of those who payed him Taxes, there was such an increase of new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, that those who laboured the ground being exhausted by them, they deserted the <hi>Empire,</hi> and by this means the best cultivated Soils were turned to Deserts and Woods; and so severe was his Government, that he erected a great many new Charges and Imployments; The <hi>Provinces</hi> were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided



<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61829:33"/>
into many separated Jurisdictions: many new Presidents and Courts, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, and other Magistrates were set up both in Towns and Countrys, who took little care of the Administration of Justice, their time being all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Condemnations and Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and they laid so many Taxes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all sorts of things, that as the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens under which the <hi>People</hi> groaned were encreased every day, so in the levying of them great Violences were likewise committed. All this had been more tolerable, if the mony so raised had circulated among the Souldiers: but the <hi>Emperours</hi> Avarice was such, that he could not endure to see his Treasure any way diminished; and therefore he was always contriving new ways of raising <hi>Money,</hi> that so his <hi>Exchequer</hi> might be always full: and that tho his Expence was great, yet his income might so answer it, that he should never lessen that stock of Mony which by his Exactions he had brought together. After that the many Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which he put in practice had brought a general Dearth upon the



<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61829:34"/>
               <hi>Empire,</hi> then he set himself to regulate the Prices of all vendible things. There was also much Blood shed upon very slight and trifling accounts; and the People brought Provisions no more to Markets, since they could not get a reasonable price for them: and this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the Dearth so much, that at last, after many had died by it, the Law it self was laid aside. To all these <hi>Diocletian</hi> added an Inclination to build great Fabricks, and this brought a new Charge on several <hi>Provinces</hi> both for furnishing of Labourers, and Artisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and of Wagons for Carriage. He built <hi>Palaces</hi> for himself, for his Wife, and for his Daughters: and to these he added a <hi>Hippodrome,</hi> an <hi>Arsenal,</hi> and a <hi>Mint house:</hi> so that in a little while a great part of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> being filled with those Buildings, many of the Inhabitants were forced to leave the Town with their Wives and Children, as if it had been taken by an Enemy: And when he had finished a piece of Building at the cost of ruining some of the <hi>Provinces</hi> by it, he found some fault or other in it, and then he pulled



<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61829:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all down, and gave orders to rebuild it in another manner: nor was this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Building secured from a new ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price, upon which it might be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise perhaps levelled with the ground. So madly expenceful was he in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign that he took into his head of making <hi>Nicomedia</hi> equal to <hi>Rome</hi> it self. I pass over the Ruin of many, who were brought under severe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that so a colour in Law might be found for seising on their Estates: for this was become such a common practice, that the frequency of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it had almost authorised it. And this was certain, that wherever a man was the Master of a rich piece of Soil, or of a Noble Building, that seemed to be Crime enough; and a Pretence was quickly sound out for condemning the Owner, as if it had not been enough to seise his Estate, without taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Life likewise.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. His <hi>Colleague</hi> in the Empire, <hi>Maximian,</hi> surnamed the <hi>Herculian,</hi> was not unlike him. Nor could they have been cemented into so entire a Friendship, if they had not been both



<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61829:35"/>
of the same mind, the same Thoughts, the same Inclinations, and the same Designs. In this they differed, that <hi>Maximian</hi> had more Courage as well as more Avarice than <hi>Diocletian;</hi> who as he was fearful, so perhaps from that Principle he was less Ravenous. Yet <hi>Maximian's</hi> Courage consisted rather in a daring to commit Crimes, than in a generous Nobleness of mind. And tho his share comprehended not only <hi>Italy</hi> it self, the Seat of <hi>Empire,</hi> but likewise those rich Provinces of <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> yet he was not so careful in the management of his Treasure as was necessary: But as oft as he wanted Mony, the richest of the <hi>Senators</hi> were accused by some Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that were suborned to swear against them of some practices for the <hi>Empire,</hi> and thus every day there were new Arts set on foot to get rid of the Eminentest men of the <hi>Senate,</hi> so that the ravenous Exchequer was often full of this ill-acquired Wealth. That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed man did also let loose his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites not only in those unnatural and hateful Disorders with Boyes, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise



<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61829:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the debauching the Daughters of some that were of the first rank. For whensoever he was in any Journey, as he past he had Instruments at hand, to bring Virgins to him by force in the very sight of their Parents. It was on these things that he built his happiness; and he reckoned the chief Felicity of <hi>Empire</hi> to consist in this, that he denied himself in nothing to which either his vitious Appetite or his Lusts carried him.</p>
            <p>I say nothing of <hi>Constantius,</hi> because he was so very unlike the rest; and did indeed deserve that the whole <hi>Empire</hi> should fall into his hands.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. But the other <hi>Maximian</hi> who married <hi>Diocletians</hi> Daughter, was not only worse than the two formerly mentioned, but did exceed the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the worst <hi>Princes</hi> that ever were: There was a Barbarous Brutality in his Temper, together with a Cruelty not known to those that were of a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Extraction: And no wonder; for his <hi>Mother</hi> was born beyond the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube:</hi> and when some of those Nations crossed that River, she came along



<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61829:36"/>
with them, and had setled her self in that part of <hi>Dacia</hi> which was formed into a <hi>Province</hi> by <hi>Aurelian.</hi> His body was suteable to his mind: he was very tall, and most excessively corpulent: and there was a sierceness in his Looks, his Words, and in his whole Behaviour, that gave a very formidable Idea of him. His Father in Law, <hi>Diocletian,</hi> dreaded him extreamly upon this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing account: <hi>Narses</hi> King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> being encouraged by the success that his Grandfather <hi>Sapores</hi> had against <hi>Valerian,</hi> resolved to extend his <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> and to drive the <hi>Romans</hi> out of the East: upon which <hi>Diocletian,</hi> who was naturally very fearful, quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponded, and searing a fate like <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> he durst not undertake that War, but sent <hi>Maximian</hi> into <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and stayed behind himself, that so he might see what was like to be the issue of this War: <hi>Maximian</hi> took his measures so well, that finding the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Army</hi> exceeding numerous, and that they were much encumbred with a vast Equipage, that they drew along with them, their Wives having fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed



<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61829:36"/>
them in this Expedition ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ancient <hi>Persian</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom: he, I say, got such Advantages against them, that without any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable loss, he defeated their whole <hi>Army. Narses</hi> himself escaped, but <hi>Maximian</hi> took all their Baggage, and so returned with great Glory, which encreased his Insolence, as much as it did his <hi>Father-in-Law</hi>'s Apprehensions of him. For upon so great a Victory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he thought it below him to carry only the second rank of Honour, and to be only called <hi>Cesar;</hi> and when at any time he received Letters addressed to him, with the Inscription <hi>Cesar,</hi> he used to cry out in his brutal way, <hi>Must<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I be still Cesar?</hi> he grew at last to that pitch of Insolence, as to give it out, that <hi>Mars</hi> was his Father; so that he ought to be lookt on as another <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> not considering the prejudice he did to his Mothers honour, of which he made small account, desiring only to be lookt on as begotten by a God. But I will not now enter into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of his Life, that so I may not confound the order of things: for it



<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61829:37"/>
was after his assuming the <hi>Imperial Dignity,</hi> of which he forced his <hi>Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Law</hi> to strip himself, that he broke loose into all the excesses of Insolence and Fury; in the mean time, tho <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> by his own ill conduct, and that of the two <hi>Maximians,</hi> whom he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Co-partners into the Government, (the <hi>first</hi> as <hi>Emperor,</hi> and the <hi>second</hi> as <hi>Cesar</hi>) had brought great disorder up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole State of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and tho his private crimes were very crying, yet matters prospered in his hands in a very unusual manner, till he came to defile them with the <hi>Blood of the Saints;</hi> and this carries me to give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the occasion that led him to <hi>persecute</hi> them.</p>
            <p n="10">X. While he was in the <hi>East,</hi> he being excessively desirous to know what was to be the event of things, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered many <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and in their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> the <hi>Diviners</hi> searcht for those <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications,</hi> upon which they pretended to foretell things to come: But some of his <hi>Courtiers,</hi> that were <hi>Christians,</hi> being near him, made the sign of the Cross on their Fore-heads, at which the Devils being frighted away, they were



<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61829:37"/>

The <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners</hi> being likewise in disorder, could not find the ordinary <hi>Marks</hi> that they lookt for in the <hi>intrails</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> tho they offered up many, one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, pretending that the <hi>Divinity</hi> was not yet appeased; but all the number of their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> was to no purpose, for no signs appeared: upon which <hi>Tages</hi> that was set over the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners</hi> said, either upon some conjecture or upon knowledge, that their <hi>Rites</hi> did not succeed, because there were some <hi>prophane persons</hi> that had thrust themselves into their <hi>Assembly.</hi> Upon which <hi>Diocletian</hi> being enraged, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that not only all those who were present, but that all the rest of his <hi>Courtiers</hi> should come and <hi>sacrifice</hi> to their Gods, and ordered those to be <hi>whipped</hi> who should refuse to do it. He likewise sent orders to his <hi>Military Officers,</hi> to require all the <hi>Souldiers</hi> to sacrifice, and to dismiss such as would not. But this was all that he thought sit to do at first, nor did he suffer his Rage to carry him to farther Extremities against God or his true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>

till after some time had past, that he came to Winter in <hi>Bithinia:</hi> and there <hi>Galerius Maximian,</hi> who was likewise inflamed against the <hi>Christians,</hi> met him, &amp; engaged the vain <hi>Old Man</hi> to go on with the <hi>Persecution,</hi> which he had already begun, concerning whom I have received this account of the grounds of his Fury against our <hi>Religion.</hi>

            <p n="11">XI. His <hi>Mother</hi> was a superstitious Woman, and was particularly addicted to the devotion of the <hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>Mountains,</hi> so that she offered Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to them daily, and feasted her Officers with the meat of those Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The <hi>Christians</hi> would not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist at those entertainments, but gave themselves to Fasting and Prayer, while she and her Company were at those Feasts. Upon this she conceived a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of them, and she set on her <hi>Son,</hi> who was no less superstitious than she her self, by her spiteful Complaints to contrive their Destruction. <hi>Diocletian</hi> and his <hi>Son-in-Law</hi> had many secret Consultations during a whole Winter, to which as no body was admitted, so it was generally thought that they were

treating about matters of the greatest consequences. The <hi>Old Man</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>Maximian's</hi> Fury long, and shewed him how pernicious the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil would prove, and how great a Disturbance it would bring upon the <hi>Empire:</hi> much blood would be shed; for the <hi>Christians</hi> were observed to be very willing to dye. Therefore he proposed this expedient, that none of that <hi>Religion</hi> should be suffered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the <hi>Court,</hi> or in the <hi>Army:</hi> But all this could not divert the Rage of that Furious Man. Therefore he proposed the asking the Opinions of those in whom they consided; for he had this piece of ill nature, that when he was about to do any thing that was acceptable, he did it of himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking the Advice of others, that so the Praise of it might belong whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to himself: But when he undertook any thing that was lyable to Censure, he called for many persons to deliver their Opinion upon it, that so others might be charged with the Blame of that in which he was chiefly in fault. Some few <hi>Iudges,</hi> and some few <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary</hi>

Men were called upon, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order of their Dignity they were repuired to tell their minds; some that had a particular spleen to the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> opined that all the <hi>Christians</hi> were Enemies to <hi>God</hi> and to the established Worship, and that therefore they ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. Those that were of another mind, perceiving what was <hi>Maximian's</hi> design, and being either affraid of him, or desirous to make their Court with him, agreed to the rest in Opinion; yet all this did not prevail on <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian;</hi> so he resolved to consult the <hi>Gods</hi> themselves, and sent a <hi>Diviner</hi> to consult with <hi>Apollo,</hi> who answered as might have been expected from an Enemy of the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> Upon this <hi>Diocletian</hi> yielded; and as he would not oppose himself to that which not only his Friends and <hi>Maximian,</hi> but even <hi>Apollo</hi> had advised, yet he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to maintain this modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the design might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed without the shedding of Blood: whereas <hi>Maximian</hi> moved, that all those who refused to partake in the

            <p n="12">XII. A proper and an auspicious <hi>day</hi> for beginning this <hi>work</hi> was next sought for; and choice was made of the <hi>Festivity</hi> of the God <hi>Terminus,</hi> which was within five days of the end of <hi>February,</hi> that was the Conclusion of their year: implying by this, that an end was to be put to this <hi>Religion.</hi> This was the first day of their <hi>Executions,</hi> and the beginning of those Miseries that not only fell on them, but on the whole <hi>Empire.</hi> In the morning of that fatal day, in the seventh and eighth <hi>Consulate</hi> of the <hi>two</hi> Ancient <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> the <hi>Prefect</hi> accompanied with some Officers, and some of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, went to the <hi>Church,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forced open the Door, they searched for the <hi>Image of God:</hi>

selves from the Storm. The <hi>two Princes,</hi> who from convenient places viewed all that was done (for that <hi>Church</hi> stood upon a heighth, so that it was within the prospect of the Palace) were long in debate, whether they should order fire to be set to it: But in this <hi>Diocletians</hi> Opinion prevailed; for he was affraid lest if the <hi>Church</hi> had been set on fire, that might have spread it self into the other parts of the <hi>City:</hi> for it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed on all hands by a great many Noble Buildings; so that instead of setting fire to, it there was a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Body of the Guards, sent with Axes and Mattocks, who in a few hours time levelled that lofty Building with the ground.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. The day after this an <hi>Edict</hi> was published, by which the <hi>Christians</hi> were declared incapable of all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Imployments; and that they should be liable to Torture what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever might be their Rank and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; all Actions were to be received

against them, and they were put out of the protection of the Law, and might not sue neither upon Injuries done them, or Adulteries committed against them, nor for Thefts or Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries; and they were to loose both their Liberties and their Right of Voting. When this was affixed, one that shewed more of Courage than Discretion in it, took it down and tore it, and rallied the <hi>Emperours,</hi> who had put among their Titles, that they had triumphed over the <hi>Goths</hi> and the <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> that they acted like those whom they pretended that they had subdued; he was presently seised on, and after he had endured several sorts of Torture; he was burnt at last, but suffered all with admirable Patience.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. But <hi>Maximian</hi> was not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Severity of this <hi>Edict,</hi> so he resolved to draw on <hi>Diocletian</hi> to consent to further Rigour by this Artifice; he set on some of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to raise a fire in the <hi>Palace,</hi> that so he might engage him to an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting <hi>Persecution:</hi> some parts were burnt down, and the <hi>Christians</hi> were



<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61829:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
presently accused as the Common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; and this Fire, that consumed the <hi>Palace,</hi> raised a most Implacable Rage against them. For it was given out, that they had entred into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation with some of the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> for the Destruction of their <hi>Princes,</hi> and that <hi>two Emperours</hi> were well nigh burnt alive in their own House. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian</hi> who affected the Reputation of being a Wise and Crafty Man, could not be brought to give any credit to this: but being excessively enraged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, he ordered many of his <hi>Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks</hi> to be put to Death in a most terrible manner. So many innocent Persons were brought before him, and were burnt. All the Judges and all the Officers of his Household being autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised thereunto, put all People to Torture, and seemed to vie with one another who should be the first that should discover the bottom of this matter. But nothing could be found out; for none of <hi>Maximians</hi> Family was put to the Torture. He came and stood by <hi>Diocletian,</hi> and continued still to inflame him more and more, that



<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61829:41"/>
so his anger might no way be abated. And a fortnight after the first burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>fire</hi> was a second time set to the <hi>Palace:</hi> But this was observed in time, yet neither could the Author of it be found out. And then <hi>Maximian,</hi> tho it was in the midst of Winter, left <hi>Nicomedia</hi> on the same day in which this second Fire was raised, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing that he went away fearing lest he should be burnt alive.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. The <hi>Emperour</hi> was now set all on fire, and upon this he forced not only all that were of his Household, but all Persons whatsoever, to defile themselves with their <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with his Daughter <hi>Valeria,</hi> and his Wise <hi>Prisca.</hi> Some of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs</hi> that were in the greatest Credit, and by whose Directions the whole Affairs of the <hi>Palace</hi> had been condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted before this <hi>Edict,</hi> were now put to Death; some <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> were seised on, and without any proof against them, they were condemned and executed. Persons of all Ages, and of both Sexes were <hi>burnt,</hi> not singly one by one, but by reason of



<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61829:42"/>
their numbers, whole Companies of them were burnt all in the same Fire: and their Servants were cast into the Sea, Millstones being tied about their Necks. Nor was this <hi>Persecution</hi> less violent in all other places: for the Judges were sent to all <hi>Temples,</hi> and they forced all people to joyn in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</hi> The Prisons were every where full. Unheard of kinds of Torture were invented; and that no man might have the Benefit of the <hi>Law</hi> that was not a <hi>Heathen:</hi> they placed <hi>Altars</hi> in the very <hi>Courts of Iustice,</hi> and in the publick <hi>Offices,</hi> that so all who came to sue before them might be put to it first to offer <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> before they could be admitted to plead: so that men came before their Judges as before their Gods. Nor was this all, Letters were also sent to the other <hi>Emperour</hi> and to <hi>Constance,</hi> inviting them to concur in this matter, tho their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions had not been before asked, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the great Importance of it.

might not seem to dissent from those that were in rank above him, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed give order for the pulling down the Walls of the Houses where the <hi>Christians</hi> held their <hi>Assemblies;</hi> for these could be easily rebuilt: but he took care to preserve those true <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of God,</hi> I mean the <hi>Christians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI.

For whereas you first fell into the hands of the Prefect <hi>Flaccinus,</hi> who was not a small Murderer, you fell next into the Hands of <hi>Hierocles,</hi> who from being

a <hi>Deputy</hi> was made a <hi>President,</hi> and had been an Adviser and a Promoter of the <hi>Persecution:</hi> and in the last place, was brought before <hi>Priscillian</hi> his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, where, as well as before the other two, you gave an Evidence of your unconquered Courage: you were <hi>nine</hi> several times put to a great many Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and at every one of them you overcame the Rage of your Enemies, by a glorious Confession. In those nine encounters with the Devil you defeated him with his whole Troop of Assistants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by so many Victories you triumphed over the World with all its Terrors. How pleasant was that Triumph in the sight of God, in which instead of <hi>White Horses</hi> or <hi>Elephants</hi> about your <hi>Chariot,</hi> you triumphed over the <hi>Emperours</hi> themselves, and seem'd to drag them after your <hi>Chariot.</hi> This is true Victory, when those that have conquered the World, are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued: for they were overcome and subdued by you, who despising their Impious <hi>Edicts,</hi> made no account of all the Pomp and Terrors of their Tyrannical Authority. Their Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings

and their Pincers, their Fires and Swords, and all the several shapes of Torture had no effect upon you: No sort of Violence could make you fall from the Faith, and from the true Worship of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is to be a true Disciple and a true Souldier of Christ; whom no Enemy can overcome, no Wolf can carry out of Gods Fold, no Snare can intangle, no Sorrow can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, and no Torture can break. After all those <hi>nine</hi> Engagements, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so glorious to you, the Devil finding himself always overcome by you, durst not assault you any more: for expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience had shewed him, that you were not to be vanquished: and since he saw that the Crown of Victory was ready to be bestowed on you, he would not, by provoking you any further, give you the occasion of receiving it so soon. Tho it was not given to you then, it is safely kept for you in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, as the Recompense of your Vertue and Worth.

            <p n="17">XVII. <hi>Diocletian</hi> being now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged into this wicked design, and



<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61829:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
having succeeded so well in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it, went streight to <hi>Rome,</hi> that so he might celebrate there his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon the twentieth <hi>year</hi> of his <hi>Empire,</hi> that he was to open upon the <hi>Anniversary</hi> of his coming to it, which was the twentieth of <hi>November.</hi> But as soon as that was over, he shewed how little he could bear that Freedom that the <hi>Romans</hi> had still retained; at which he was so uneasy, that tho the first of <hi>Ianuary</hi> was very Near, in which he was to enter upon his ninth <hi>Consulate,</hi> yet he could not be prevailed on to stay to that day, and so he could not bear the staying thirteen days longer at <hi>Rome,</hi> but he began his Consulate at <hi>Ravenna.</hi> The Winter was both extream Cold and Rainy, so that the Journey did so affect his health, that it threw him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a lingring <hi>sickness,</hi> that never went off quite: and being ill all the way, he was forced to be carried for most part in a Litter. His illness lay upon him all the Summer long: about the end of it he continued his Journey, and having come round the Coast of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> he got at last to <hi>Nicomedia,</hi>



               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:61829:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Sickness being now come to a great height. But tho he was brought very low by it, yet he would needs appear in publick, and assist at the Dedication of the <hi>Hippodrome</hi> that he had built, which was done at the end of his twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of <hi>Empire.</hi> His sickness grew at last to such a degree, that Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made to all the Gods for his Life: but on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> a report was spread all about the <hi>Palace,</hi> that he was <hi>dead:</hi> the sad Looks and the Terrour that appeared in all his <hi>Courtiers,</hi> and the solemn silence that was over all the <hi>Court,</hi> made that the Report was generally believed: The City of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> believed him not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead, but buried; but the next day it was given out that he was yet alive; upon which the countenances of many that were concerned, were much chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: but others believed still that he was dead, and that it was concealed for fear of the Souldiery, lest they should have fallen into some dangerous Consultations, and that therefore his Death was to be kept up till <hi>Maximian</hi> should come to <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> This grew

to be so Universally believed, that is he had not shewed himself on the first of <hi>March,</hi> it had not been possible to have perswaded the people that he was still alive. He was strangly altered by a whole years sickness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they to whom he was very well known, could hardly believe him to be the same: He had indeed on the thirteenth of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> fallen into so deep a Swoon, that it was thought he was dead, and he never recovered this so entirely, as to be wholly what he had been formerly: for he had ever after this, some fits of Madness, which returned at some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> times upon him, tho in the Intervals of those fits he had his Understanding very perfect.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. Not many days after this, <hi>Galerius Maximian</hi> came to him, not to congratulate upon his recovery, but to force him to resign the <hi>Empire:</hi> He had made the same attempt upon the elder <hi>Maximian,</hi> and threatned him with a Civil War if he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; so now he set on <hi>Diocletian:</hi> He began at first more softly and gently with him; telling him, that he was

now become ancient and infirm, and less able to undergo the fatigue of Government, and that therefore he ought to give himself some repose af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so much Application and Toil. He set before him <hi>Nerva's</hi> Example, who resigned the Empire to <hi>Trajan: Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian</hi> answered, that as it was not honourable for him, after he had born so sublime a Character so long, to shut himself up in an obscure Corner, so it could not be safe for him to do it, since during so long a Reign, he must needs have made himself many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The case was quite different in <hi>Nerva,</hi> who had past his whole life in retirement; so that his great Age and his unacquaintendness with affairs made him less capable of bearing so great a Burden, which therefore he threw off, and returned to that privacy in which he had spent the former parts of his life.

The <hi>Old Man,</hi> that was now much broken, having heard all this, and having likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Letters from the elder <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian,</hi> that gave him an account of



<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61829:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what had been said to himself upon that subject, and had also heard that <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Maximian</hi> was encreasing his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; upon this, not without Tears; he consented to that which had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to him; so that which remained was, that the <hi>Cesars</hi> should be named by the concurring Advices of all the <hi>Four.</hi> But the other rejected this, and said, that the other <hi>two</hi> must consent to whatsoever they should resolve on: and indeed, it seemed that there was no room for choice, but that the <hi>Sons</hi> of the other two must have been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for <hi>Cesars. Maxentius</hi> was Son to the Elder <hi>Maximian,</hi> and had married the younger <hi>Maximians</hi> Daughter. He was a Man of a wicked and vicious Disposition, and was so proud and so willful, that he would not pay the wonted respect of Adoration, neither to his <hi>Father,</hi> nor to his <hi>Father-in-Law;</hi> so that he was equally hated of both. <hi>Constantine</hi> Son to <hi>Constance</hi> was a most vertuous Youth, and had all the Qualities that could recommend him to the highest Dignity: his Air and Person were graceful; his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

But <hi>Maximian</hi> had his Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to both these: as for <hi>Maxentius</hi> he thought he was not worthy of that Dignity, and he reckoned, that he who had behaved himself so Insolently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, while he was a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, would become intolerable if he were raised so high. <hi>Constantine</hi> was indeed so amiable a person, that it was thought he would be a better and a gentler <hi>Prince</hi> than his Father had been: and so he would be able to check him as he pleased: wherefore <hi>Maximian</hi> resolved to have such persons promoted, who should be always in his power, who should be affraid of him, and should do nothing but by his order, so he proposed <hi>Severus: Diocletian</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted to him, as a Mad Extravagant, and Drunken Person, who changed the Day into Night, and the Night in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Day: but the other answered, that

he had deserved that Dignity well, for he had taken great care of the Army, and had prayed them faithfully; and added, that he had sent him to <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> the elder, that he might receive the Nomination from him; so this was aggreed to: and when <hi>Diocletian</hi> asked him, who should be the other, he presented one <hi>Daia</hi> to him, a young Man, that was half a <hi>Barbarian</hi> by his Extraction, and whom he had lately ordered to be called <hi>Maximin</hi> from his own name. For <hi>Diocletian</hi> had changed his own Name to that, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish him from the other <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian,</hi> who had alwayes maintained his Fidelity to him most religiously. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian</hi> asked him, who that young Man was; the other said, he was his Ally: but he sighed, and replied, that he did not propose to him persons that were capable of conducting the <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> the other said, that he had already tried them. <hi>Diocletian</hi> insisted and said, that he who was to enter upon the <hi>Empire,</hi> ought to see to it: and that for his part, he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his share of Toil, and had studied to preserve the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> in a



<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61829:49"/>
good State during his <hi>Empire,</hi> but if after his time it should fall into Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it should not be by his fault. All things being thus concerted in secret, on the first of <hi>May</hi> this great Affair came to be declared. The eyes of all People were on <hi>Constantine,</hi> not doubting but the Nomination must fall on him: all the <hi>Military Men,</hi> as well the Souldiers as the Officers, lookt at him, wisht for him, and shewed much Joy in the hopes that they expressed of his Advancement: There was a rising ground at almost three Miles distance from the <hi>City,</hi> and it was there where <hi>Maximian</hi> himself had first received the Imperial Purple, in remembrance of which there was a <hi>Pillar</hi> erected with a <hi>Statue</hi> of <hi>Iupiters</hi> upon it. That place was markt out for this Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the <hi>Army</hi> was drawn out about it: and there the <hi>Old Man</hi> with Tears in his Eyes, told the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> that he was now become Infirm, and therefore he was resolved to give himself some rest after so much Toil, and to deliver up the <hi>Empire</hi> to those who were able to undergo the fatigue of it: and that in



<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61829:49"/>
order to that, he would now name new <hi>Cesars.</hi> Upon this all mens expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations being raised, he named <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> and <hi>Maximin;</hi> all people were amased; and since <hi>Constantine</hi> was stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by, some began to ask whether he had changed his name into <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min:</hi> but to the admiration of all the Spectators, <hi>Maximian</hi> put by <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> and drew out <hi>Daia,</hi> and shewed him to the people, having stript him of the habit that he wore as a private person: and while all men were sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised, and knew neither who he was, nor of whom he was descended, (tho this unlookt for promotion, had so disordered them, that they testified no aversion to it) <hi>Diocletian</hi> threw his Purple Robe about him, and so he himself retired to a private State a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and returned to his private name of <hi>Diocles,</hi> which upon his coming to the <hi>Empire</hi> he had changed to <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> and thus the Solemnity ended: and the <hi>old Emperour,</hi> like a Souldier that had obtained his dismission, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and drive thro <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and so went into his own Countrey. And



<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61829:50"/>
               <hi>Daia,</hi> that was raised up from following of Cattle thro Woods, and was first a common Souldier, then an Officer, after that a Brigadier, and now at last got to be <hi>Cesar,</hi> had the <hi>East</hi> assigned to him, tobe oppressed and ruined by him. And tho he neither understood Military Affairs, nor Matters of State, yet he was now set to conduct Armies instead of feeding Cattle.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. <hi>Maximian</hi> having now effected that which he had projected, in driving out the <hi>Old Men,</hi> behaved himself as if he had been the sole <hi>Emperour</hi> of the whole <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> For tho <hi>Constance</hi> had the Precedence, and so was to be always named before him, yet he was despised by him, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was naturally of a mild tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and was now much disabled thro the indisposition of his body. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that either he would soon die, or that it would be no hard thing to force him to resign his share of the <hi>Empire.</hi> There was about <hi>Maximian</hi> one <hi>Licinius,</hi> who was his ancient Friend; for they had been Comerades from their first Imployments in the



<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61829:50"/>
Army: and he had now the chief stroke in all Affairs. <hi>Maximian</hi> had not put him in the nomination of the <hi>Cesars,</hi> because he would not put him in a rank so far Inferiour to himself as to call him <hi>Son,</hi> but he reckoned that <hi>Constance</hi> would soon die, and then he was resolved to receive him to be his <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>Collegue</hi> in the <hi>Empire:</hi> and thus he projected to establish himself in his Authority, and to be able to carry all things according to his mind; and after he should come to his twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth <hi>year,</hi> and celebrate the Festivals of it, as his <hi>Predecessors</hi> had done, he intended to resign the <hi>Empire,</hi> and to put his <hi>Son</hi> in his stead, who was now only nine years old: so that he intended that <hi>Licinius</hi> and <hi>Severus</hi> should be the <hi>Emperours,</hi> and that <hi>Maximin</hi> and <hi>Candidianus</hi> should be the <hi>Cesars:</hi> and thus he being established and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured as much as was possible, should pass the rest of his days in quiet, and great safety. These were his Designs: But he having made God his Enemy, all his Projects came to nothing.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. He having attained the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream



<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61829:51"/>
Dignity, set himself to disquiet the World, that was now become subject to him. In his Expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Persians</hi> he had observed that Custom which was established among them, by which all those <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> esteemed themselves the <hi>Slaves</hi> of their <hi>Kings:</hi> so that they reigned over them with as absolute an Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as a Master of a Family does over those of his Houshold. This vile Man intended to establish the same Method of Government in the <hi>Roman Empire:</hi> and he was so impudent, that ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Victory, he used to magnify it: and tho he durst not openly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the reducing the <hi>Romans</hi> to the same State, yet he behaved himself so as if he had considered all others as his Slaves: he began with the degrading those that were in honourable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; for he subjected the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi> and the Chief <hi>Citizens</hi> of the greatest <hi>Cities,</hi> that were in the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentest Rank, to the <hi>Law of Torture:</hi> and upon the slightest accounts, and in Matters that were meerly civil, he would put them to death as the Fancy



<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61829:51"/>
took him, and for lesser transgressions he put them in Irons; he took such <hi>Women</hi> of Quality as pleased him out of their own Houses, and brought them by Violence to his <hi>Seraglio:</hi> and when any were to be whipped, he had posts struck into the ground in his Stables, to which they were tied, and so stretcht out, which was done more Infamously than was wont to be done to the Slaves themselves. What shall I say of his Diversions, and his Pleasure? He had some <hi>Bears</hi> that he had chosen out in a great many years among all others, that were the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest and the fiercest that could be found, and that were by Consequence so much the liker to himself: and when he intended to divert himself, he ordered one of these to be brought out, and a <hi>Man</hi> to be thrown to him, not to be killed by him out-right, but to be eat up in morsels: and as the Limbs of those Wretches were torn asunder, he used to burst out most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decently into Laughter; so that he seldom went to supper before he had shed some mans Blood. As for those



<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61829:52"/>
that had no Dignity, he condemned them to be burnt: and tho at first he gave the <hi>Christians</hi> leave to be gone, yet afterwards he not only condemned them to <hi>Torture,</hi> but to be <hi>burnt</hi> in flow Fires: the manner of which was this, they were first chained to a post, then there was a gentle Fire set to the Soles of their Feet, by which all the <hi>Callus</hi> of the Foot was contracted, till at last it fell all off from the Bones; then <hi>Flambeaux</hi> were lighted and put out, and while they were hot, they clapt them to all the parts of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that so they might be tortured all over: and care was taken to keep them alive as long as was possible, by throwing cold Water in their Faces, and by giving them wherewith to wash their Mouths, lest otherwise the Violence of the Misery that they suffered should have quite dried up their Throats, and so choaked them. Thus their Sufferings were lengthned out whole days, till at last their Skin being quite consumed by the Fire, it at last reacht to their Vitals, and then a great Fire was kindled, into which



<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61829:52"/>
they were thrown, and so their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were burnt to Ashes: and their Bones that were not quite burnt, were gathered, and ground to powder, and thrown into some River, or into the Sea.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. These practices of Cruelty, that were begun upon the <hi>Christians,</hi> grew in him to such a Habit, that he began to exercise them upon others: he never punished any gently: he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom banished any, nor did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn many to Imprisonment, or to work in Mines: but his daily <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which past the most easily from him, were the condemning men to be <hi>burnt,</hi> to be <hi>crucified,</hi> or to be thrown to <hi>Wild Beasts.</hi> His Domesticks, and those whom he imploied in his Affairs, were also severely disciplined by him. And as to all Capital Matters, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading</hi> was thought an extraordinary Grace, which was granted to very few; so that it was lookt on as a Reward for past Services, to have the favour of a gentle Death; yet all these were small Matters. Eloquence was exstinguished by him; the <hi>Advocates</hi>



               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:61829:53"/>
were destroyed, and all that were learned in the <hi>Law,</hi> were either ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, or put to death; all sort of Literature were reckoned among the ill Arts, and all learned men were lookt on as ill-affected to the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> and were both hated and ruined by him. The <hi>Iudges</hi> having <hi>superceded all the Lawes,</hi> had a Licence given them to do whatsoever they pleased; and <hi>Military men,</hi> who had no sort of Learning, were made <hi>Iudges</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Provinces,</hi> without having so much as <hi>Assess<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rs</hi> assigned them.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. He also took care to involve the whole <hi>Empire</hi> into a general Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, and under a common Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, by the new <hi>Tax</hi> that he laid both on the <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Provinces:</hi> which was so severely levied by the Taxmen that he sent every where, that the state of Affairs lookt as dismall as if the <hi>Empire</hi> had been over-run by some Enemy, or as if it had been brought under some heavy Bondage. All mens Fields were measured, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was taken of all their Trees and Vines, and of all Cattle; all men were



<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61829:53"/>
likewise polled, and where those lists were made, no difference was put between those that lived in Town or Countrey. And as <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>the Taxing was managed in the Towns, without any Distinction of the antient Citizens, and those that were newly come out of the Countrey, so in the Villages all people came with their Children and Slaves to be listed: and upon the slightest suspitions men were whipt or tortured; Children were hanged up in the sight of their Parents; Slaves were dealt with to accuse their Masters, and Wives to accuse their Husbands. When no sort of Evidence could be found, men were forced by Torture to accuse themselves; and when any thing was thus extorted from them, then they were proceeded against as if they had been clearly convicted of those Crimes. No regard was had either to Mens Age or Infirmity: for the Sick and Feeble were taxed as well as the whole: and in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimate that was made of mens Age, they added years to those that were not yet of Age, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted



<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61829:54"/>
some from those that were past it. All Places were full of Grief and Sorrow. And he adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to put in execution against the <hi>Romans,</hi> and those <hi>Provinces</hi> that were subjected to them, all that any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours had done to those who being subdued by them, were by the Law of War at their Mercy: as if he would have revenged the Tax that <hi>Trajan</hi> put on his Ancestors, the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> which he laid on them as a Punishment for their frequent Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions. After that all men were thus listed, then so much money was laid upon every mans head, as if he had been to pay so much for his life. Yet this matter was not trusted to the first Taxmen, but new sets of them one after another, were sent about; that new men might always find new matter to work upon; and tho they could really discover no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet they encreased the numbers in the lists that they made, that so it might not be said, that they had been sent to no purpose. By the means of those Oppressions, the Stock of the



<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61829:54"/>
Cattle was much diminished, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men died: and yet the Taxes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued still to be levied, even for those that were dead: to such Misery were men reduced, that even Death did not put an end to it. The <hi>Beggars</hi> were the only persons that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from these Oppressions; for to have nothing to pay, was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to be covered from those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions: But this Cursed Man took care to put an end to their want; for he gave Orders to gather them all together, and to put them in Vessels, and when they were at Sea, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to be all drowned. So Compassionate was he, that he was resolved that no body should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly miserable during his reign: thus he found out an effectual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to keep all men from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Poverty, as an Excuse from paying the Taxes; but he at the same time, against all the Rules of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, put a multitude of miserable Persons to Death.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. At last the Judgments of God came to seise on him: and now



<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61829:55"/>
all that Success which he had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to enjoyed came to be changed. While he was appyling himself to those things of which I have given you an account, he had taken no care to destroy or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne <hi>Constance;</hi> for he was waiting for his Death; yet he did not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that it would come so suddenly as it did. But <hi>Constance</hi> being now very sick, writ to him that he might send his Son <hi>Constantine</hi> to him, having made the same desire often before, but to no purpose: for <hi>Maximian</hi> had no mind to let him go to his <hi>Father:</hi> on the contrary, he had exposed him to many Dangers, hoping that he would have fallen under some of them; he durst not make an open Attempt upon him, fearing a <hi>Civil War,</hi> or rather a Mutiny among the <hi>Souldiers:</hi> but under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of exercising him, he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him to encounter with <hi>Wild Beasts,</hi> yet all was in vain; for as the Hand of God was visible in protecting him all along, so it appeared most signally now in the last and critical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the <hi>Emperour</hi> not knowing how he could deny it any longer,



<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61829:55"/>
granted him at last a pass, which had the Seal put to it, while it was late; but he ordered him to come to him next morning to receive his Commands; and he had resolved either to find some Colour for hindring his Journey, or to send Orders to <hi>Severus,</hi> to stop him on the Way. <hi>Constantine</hi> had some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of that which might happen, and therefore as soon as the <hi>Emperour</hi> went to sleep, after Supper he took Journey, and in the several Stages thro which he past, he carried with him all the Post Horses. The <hi>Emperour</hi> on purpose to delay him, did not open his door next day till it was noon, and then he called for him: but he heard that he had gone last Night, immediatly after Supper; upon which the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> fell into a most violent fit of rage; and ordered some to be sent after him for fetching him back; but when he understood that he carried all the Post Horses with him, so that this could not be done, the <hi>Emperour</hi> could hardly forbear weeping. <hi>Constantine</hi> made all the hast that was possible, and found his. <hi>Father</hi> just breathing out his



<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61829:56"/>
last. <hi>Constance</hi> recommended his <hi>Son</hi> to the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and delivered over the <hi>Empire</hi> to him, and so he ended his Life in all points as he wished to do. <hi>Constantine</hi> was no sooner possessed of the <hi>Empire,</hi> then he gave the <hi>Christians</hi> the free <hi>Liberty</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> so that his first <hi>Edict</hi> was the Restoring the Exercise of this <hi>holy Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="25">XXV. Within a few days after this, his <hi>Image</hi> with the Characters of the <hi>Imperial Dignity</hi> upon it, was sent to <hi>Maximian:</hi> he was long in suspence, not knowing what he should do, he once intended to throw both the <hi>Image</hi> it self, and likewise <hi>Him</hi> that brought it into the <hi>Fire:</hi> but his Friends diverted him from this; for they were sensible of the Inconveniences of irritating the <hi>Army,</hi> who were already displeased, because that no notice was taken of them in the Nomination of the <hi>Cesars:</hi> and they might probably enough have declared for <hi>Constantine,</hi> if they should have seen him coming against <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> at the head of an <hi>Army.</hi> These Advices prevailed so far upon him, that tho it was much against his Heart, yet



<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61829:56"/>
he received the <hi>Statue,</hi> and sent <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the <hi>Purple,</hi> that so it might appear that he had of his own accord received him into the Partnership of the <hi>Empire.</hi> But this broke all his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; nor could he now make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Emperour</hi> Supernumerary: yet he fell upon this Contrivance, of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Severus,</hi> who was the Antien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter person, <hi>Emperour,</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> not <hi>Emperour</hi> (as had been already done) but <hi>Cesar</hi> only, in Partnership with <hi>Maximin,</hi> that so instead of being next to himself, he might be the last of the <hi>Four.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. But while he thought that this matter was quite setled, he received a new Alarm, which was, that <hi>Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> who was his own <hi>Son-in-Law,</hi> was declared <hi>Emperour</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> The occasion of which was this: <hi>Maximian</hi> having resolved to exhaust the Wealth of the whole <hi>Empire</hi> by his <hi>Impositions,</hi> proceeded to that pitch of Madness, that he would not so much as grant the <hi>City of Rome</hi> an Exemption from <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>

               </gap> of all



<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61829:57"/>
that were in the <hi>City;</hi> he had also at the same time made an attempt upon some of the Priviledges of the <hi>Pretorian Bands;</hi> so a few of those Guards that were left at <hi>Rome,</hi> having found a fit Opportunity for it, they first killed some of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> and perceiving that the <hi>People,</hi> who were now much irritated, were not ill pleased at this, they declared <hi>Maxentius</hi> Emperour: When the newes of this was brought to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximian,</hi> he was a little disordered with the first surprise of it, yet he was not much terrified at it. He both hated the Man, and could not resolve to make three <hi>Cesars</hi> all at a time. He thought it was enough to have been for once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to do a thing to which he had not a mind, so he sent for <hi>Severus,</hi> and persuaded him to assume the <hi>Empire,</hi> and he sent him against <hi>Maxentius</hi> with the <hi>Army</hi> that had been under his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> command, and ordered him to march streight to <hi>Rome,</hi> knowing well that those <hi>Souldiers,</hi> who had tasted so often of the Pleasures of that place, would not only endeavour to preserve the <hi>City,</hi> but would desire to make it



<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61829:57"/>
their chief quarter. <hi>Maxentius</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to reflect on the Boldness of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; as on the one hand he had some reason to hope, that the <hi>Army</hi> which had so long been commanded by his <hi>Father,</hi> might be easily practised upon to declare for himself; so on the other hand he apprehended, that his <hi>Father-in-law,</hi> searing the same thing, might leave <hi>Severus</hi> in <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and might come in person with his own <hi>Army</hi> to destroy him: upon this he began to contrive the means of securing himself from this danger, which was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging over his head; so he sent the <hi>Purple</hi> to his <hi>Father,</hi> who had lived in <hi>Campania</hi> ever since his <hi>Resignation</hi> of the <hi>Empire:</hi> and he declared him now for the second time <hi>Emperour.</hi> His <hi>Father,</hi> who had resigned against his will, and was lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for a Change in the State of Affairs, accepted of it very willingly. In the mean while <hi>Severus</hi> marched with his <hi>Army,</hi> and came at last to the very Walls of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the Souldiers seeing against whom they were come, did immediately abandon him, and went over to him against whom they were



<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61829:58"/>
sent. <hi>Severus</hi> being thus forsaken, was forced to fly. But he was met on his way by <hi>Maximian</hi> the <hi>elder,</hi> who had now assumed the <hi>Empire,</hi> so that to avoid him he went to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and with a small handful of men he shut himself up in that place: and seeing that he must needs be delivered up, he resolved to prevent that, and both rendred <hi>himself,</hi> and gave back the <hi>Imperial Purple</hi> to him, from whom he had received it: but all that he could obtain by this Submission, was a Gentle <hi>Death;</hi> for order was given to cut his Veins, so that he died ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily. Thus did <hi>Maximian</hi> persecute those that were raised up by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. But <hi>Maximian</hi> the <hi>elder</hi> knew well the Madness of <hi>Maximian</hi> the <hi>younger:</hi> and did not doubt but that as soon as the news of <hi>Severus</hi> his Death should be brought him, he would upon the heat of Anger, into which that might throw him, march immediately with his <hi>Army,</hi> and would perhaps bring along with him <hi>Maximins</hi> Forces; and he knew well



<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61829:58"/>
that he was not strong enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist so great an <hi>Army,</hi> therefore he fortified <hi>Rome,</hi> and having setled mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the best method that he could, he marched into <hi>Gaule,</hi> that so he might engage <hi>Constantine</hi> into his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, by offering him his younger <hi>Daughter</hi> in Marriage. But the other <hi>Maximian</hi> having gathered together his <hi>Troops,</hi> marched into <hi>Italy,</hi> and came to <hi>Rome,</hi> resolving to extirpate the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> and in particular to destroy all the <hi>Senators:</hi> but he found all shut against him, and well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied: There was no hope of carrying it by a Surprise, and it was a very hard thing to besiege it, nor had he <hi>Men</hi> enough for the <hi>Siege:</hi> for he had never before seen <hi>Rome,</hi> nor knew how great it was; but had fancied that it was no greater than those other <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> which he had seen. Some of the <hi>Legions</hi> began to have a Horror at the unnatural <hi>War,</hi> in which the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in-Law</hi> was fighting against his <hi>Son-in-Law,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Souldiers</hi> were fighting against the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> upon which they carried their

Colours with them, and deserted, and many others were staggering, so that fearing <hi>Severus's</hi> Fate, he was so sunk with the Fright into which this threw him, that casting himself at the <hi>Souldiers</hi> feet, he begged that they would not deliver him up to his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: and what with his Submissions, and what with the great Promises that he made them, he prevailed over them to continue true to him; but he would not venture more with such Troops: so he marched away in all haste, and in such great Consternation, that if he had been pursued by ever so small a Body, it had been an easy thing to have defeated him quite, whereof being apprehensive, he sent out his <hi>Army</hi> in Parties on all hands, with Orders to Plunder and Destroy the whole <hi>Countrey,</hi> that it might not be possible for an <hi>Army</hi> that might pursue him to find whereupon to subsist; so that all that Part of <hi>Italy,</hi> thro which this destroying <hi>Army</hi> had marcht, was quite ruined; all was spoiled, Women were Forced, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins were Ravished, and all men were



<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61829:59"/>
tortured, that they might discover where their Wives, their Daughters or their Treasures were concealed; and the Flocks of Sheep and Herds of Cattle were driven before them, as they used to do the Spoils that they took from the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> and thus he, who instead of being the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> was now become the <hi>Plunderer</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> retired back into his own Division, after he had in this Hostile manner destroyed the whole <hi>Countrey.</hi> He had indeed long before this, at the time of his receiving the <hi>Empire,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himself such an Enemy to the very name of a <hi>Roman,</hi> that he once intended to have changed the very <hi>Designation</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> so that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the <hi>Roman,</hi> it should have been called the <hi>Dacian Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. After that he had left <hi>Italy</hi> in this manner, the other <hi>Maximian</hi> returned out of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> &amp; his <hi>Son</hi> were Masters of that part of the <hi>Empire,</hi> but the <hi>Son</hi> was much more considered than the <hi>Father,</hi> both because he had given the first rise to this Revolution, and that he had invited his <hi>Father</hi> to



<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61829:60"/>
his share in it. The <hi>Old Man</hi> grew uneasy when he saw that he was not in all points the <hi>Master,</hi> and by an Emulation unworthy of a Man, he envied his <hi>Son</hi> that respect which he saw was payed him. This went so far with him, that he resolved to drive away his <hi>Son,</hi> that so he might <hi>reign</hi> alone; this he thought would be easily effected, and that the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> who had abandoned <hi>Severus,</hi> would stick firmly to him. Upon which he called together an <hi>Assembly</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> and the <hi>Souldiery,</hi> as if he had some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great Consequence to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them. He harangued to them long upon the Miseries that lay on the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and at last he pointed out to his <hi>Son,</hi> and said, he was the Cause of all those Miseries, and the Chief Occasion of all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities that lay upon the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:</hi> and thereupon he tore the <hi>Imperial Purple</hi> from him. He being thus stript of that badge of Dignity, leapt down from the bench on which the <hi>Emperour</hi> sat, and was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> who expressed



<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61829:60"/>
upon this Occasion so much Anger and Fury, that the <hi>Old Man</hi> being asfrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at it, fell into great Disorder, and was driven out of <hi>Rome</hi> almost as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniously as <hi>Tarquin</hi> the <hi>proud</hi> had been.</p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. He retired first to <hi>Gaule,</hi> and after that he had staid there for some time, he went to the other <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximian,</hi> knowing him to be his <hi>Sons</hi> Inveterate Enemy: he pretended that he went to concert with him some things relating to the State of the <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> but his true Design was, that he might under this pretence of Reconciliation, seek an Occasion to Murder him, and so possess him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of his share of the <hi>Empire,</hi> since he was now thrust out of his own. <hi>Diocles</hi> was then with the other <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian,</hi> for he had been sent for by him, that so his presence might give some more Authority to his installing of <hi>Licinius</hi> in <hi>Severus's</hi> stead. So that both the <hi>Old Emperours</hi> happned to be present on that occasion: and now there were all at once <hi>six Emperours.</hi> But <hi>Maximian</hi> the <hi>elder</hi> finding that there was a Distraction in the <hi>Councils,</hi>



               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:61829:61"/>
and that he could not compass his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, fled again for the third time; and withdrew into <hi>Gaule,</hi> with new Projects no less wicked than the former had been: for tho both <hi>Constantine</hi> and his Father <hi>Constance</hi> had married two of his Daughters, yet he laid a design against his Life, and in order to his effecting it, he laid aside his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Habit.</hi> The <hi>Franks</hi> were then in Armes, so that <hi>Constantine</hi> was obliged to march against them. But his <hi>Father-in-Law</hi> perswaded him, who as yet was in no distrust of him, that it was not necessary to carry his whole <hi>Army</hi> with him: and that a small Body would be sufficient for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating those <hi>Barbarians;</hi> that as he might have the <hi>Army</hi> that was left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in his own Power, so <hi>Constantine</hi> having so few Troops with him, might be Infallibly over-whelmed by the <hi>Franks.</hi> He was easily wrought on by his <hi>Father-in-Law,</hi> whose long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience gave great Authority to his Advices. So after that some dayes were past, and that <hi>Maximian</hi> believed his <hi>Son-in-Law</hi> was now engaged among



<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61829:61"/>
the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> he again assumed the <hi>Purple,</hi> brake in upon the publick <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> and as he was wont to do, he distributed a large Donative among the <hi>Souldiers;</hi> and gave out false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports concerning <hi>Constantine:</hi> but all this was quickly turned upon him: for <hi>Constantine</hi> was soon advertised of all that had past, and came back with almost Incredible Diligence, so that <hi>Maximian</hi> had not time enough to settle himself in his new Usurpation, but was surprised, and was also abandoned by the <hi>Souldiery;</hi> upon which he fled to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> and shut himself up within it. <hi>Constantine</hi> did quickly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest that place; and having demanded a personal Conference with him from the Walls, he neither reproached nor threatned him, but only asked him, what he himself had done, and what was in <hi>Maximians</hi> mind, that had pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed him on to act so Indecently as he had done? The other answered him very scurrilously: but those about him set open the gates to <hi>Constantines</hi> Souldiers: so this rebellious <hi>Emperour</hi> and treacherous <hi>Father-in-Law,</hi> was



<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61829:62"/>
now in <hi>Constantines</hi> power; who satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himself with laying his Crimes before him, and so chiding him for them, he stript him of his <hi>Imperial Purple;</hi> but carried his resentments no further; and left him both his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="30">XXX. But <hi>Maximian</hi> having lost both the Dignity of an <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the Regard that was payed to him as a <hi>Father-in-Law,</hi> and not being able to bear this Lowness of Fortune, fell to contrive new <hi>Plots:</hi> and such ill use made he of <hi>Constantine's</hi> forgiving him, that he set on his <hi>Daughter Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta,</hi> soliciting her, what with Caresses, and what with Entreaties, to contrive her <hi>Husbands</hi> Ruine, and promised her a better <hi>Husband</hi> when that should be once done; so he besought her to leave their Bed-chamber Door some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times open, she undertook to do all that he begged of her, but revealed all to her <hi>Husband:</hi> Thus a train was laid for discovering his <hi>Treasons,</hi> in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable manner; there was an <hi>Eunuch</hi> put in <hi>Constantines</hi> place, to suffer what was projected against him. <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi>



               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:61829:62"/>
rose in the dead silence of the Night; and all things seemed favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to him: he saw some few Guards, that were at some distance from the Bed-chamber; he told them, that he was going to give his <hi>Son-in-Law</hi> an account of a strange Dream that he had dreamt. So he went in Armed, and having killed the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and fancying that he had executed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he came out boasting of what he had done. But he was not a little confounded when he saw <hi>Constantine</hi> coming towards him with some <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> about him. The dead body of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was drawn out, so that he was manifestly convicted of the <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> and he was so confounded with this Discovery of his Treachery, that he was, as it were struck dead with it, nor had he any sort of Excuse or Defence ready. The choise of the manner of his <hi>Death</hi> was left to him, and he made choice of <hi>Hanging.</hi> Thus this great <hi>Emperour,</hi> that in the long course of 20 <hi>Years Reign,</hi> had gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> with so much Glory, was now forced to this most



<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61829:63"/>
Ignominious End of his Execrable Life.</p>
            <p n="31">XXXI. The Judgments of that God, who is the Avenger of his Truth and of his People, were in the next place no less visible upon the other <hi>Maximian,</hi> that had been indeed the chief Contriver of this <hi>Persecution.</hi> He was now thinking to celebrate the Festivals of the <hi>Twentieth Year</hi> of his <hi>Reign,</hi> and tho he had promised that upon that occasion he would restore some of those severe Exactions by which he had ruined so many of the <hi>Provinces;</hi> yet now instead of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it, he made use of this Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to lay new <hi>Taxes</hi> upon them. It is not easy to set forth the Severity of these <hi>Impositions</hi> that he raised upon this occasion, chiefly of those which were laid on the <hi>Corn.</hi> There were <hi>Souldiers,</hi> or rather <hi>Hangmen,</hi> that waited on all the <hi>Taxmasters:</hi> and men did not know whither to turn them. The <hi>Officers</hi> came with their unreasonable Demands, and those who had not wherewith to satisfy them, were subjected to great Variety of



<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61829:63"/>
Tortures from which they had no way to save themselves, but by doing that which was impossible for them: Men were beset with such numbers of Souldiers, that they could hardly breath for them: there was little or no cessation in the Trouble to which they were put all the year round; the very <hi>Iudges</hi> and the <hi>Souldiers</hi> that attended upon them, fell into many Quarrels amongst themselves: there was not a Barn nor a Vineyard that was not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely visited; nor indeed was there enough left to preserve men alive. But tho this may seem a very Intolerable thing thus to snatch out of mens Mouths that Bread which they had earned by their Labour, yet all this was softned by the hopes that were given of what the <hi>Emperour</hi> was to do in his twentieth <hi>year.</hi> It was expected that men should appear in rich Clothes, and bring much Gold and Silver along with them, but it was not possible to provide this, except by the sale of the product of the Ground; and when this mad <hi>Tyrant</hi> destroyed all that, so that all men were ruined in order to



<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61829:64"/>
the raising of that Treasure, which was designed to be laid out when the twentieth <hi>year</hi> should come; yet the <hi>Emperour</hi> lived not long enough for that.</p>
            <p n="32">XXXII. When <hi>Licinius</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Emperour, <hi>Maximin</hi> resented it extreamly, and would neither be contented any longer with the Title of <hi>Cesar,</hi> nor allow <hi>Licinius</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence: Upon this <hi>Maximian</hi> sent many Messengers to him, to induce him to submit to the Order that he had setled; and to pay the Respect that was due to <hi>Licinius's</hi> Age, and to his Gray Hairs. But <hi>Maximin</hi> stood upon his terms, and very boldly said, that he to whom the <hi>Purple</hi> had been first given, ought alwayes to be considered as the <hi>Ancienter Emperour:</hi> and so he would neither yield to <hi>Maximians</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, nor to his Commands. The <hi>Tyrant</hi> was extreamly troubled at this, and in his brutal way he complained of <hi>Maximins</hi> Ingratitude, whom he had raised from so mean a state to so great a Dignity; of which the other was now so unmindful as to reject all



<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61829:64"/>
his Orders, and his most earnest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. But when he saw that nothing could prevail on him, he resolved to put an end to this second rank of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and so to extinguish the Title of <hi>Cesar;</hi> therefore as he declared <hi>himself</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> the Emperours, so he declared <hi>Maxentius</hi> and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Emperours,</hi> (by which <hi>Maximin</hi> was quite shut out.) But he not daunted with this, writ to him that upon the last occasion of a great Assembly that met in the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi> he had been saluted <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> by the <hi>Army. Maximian</hi> received this with great Regret, but yet upon it he declared all the <hi>four</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
            <p n="33">XXXIII. In the eighteenth <hi>year</hi> of his <hi>Reign,</hi> he was visited by God with an Incurable Stroke: An <hi>Ulcer</hi> bred in his <hi>Secret Parts,</hi> which daily grew and spread. The <hi>Phisitians</hi> used both <hi>Incisians,</hi> and other <hi>Medecines;</hi> but tho they brought it to a <hi>Cicatrice,</hi> and seem'd to have healed it, yet it festred, and broke out again, and the Humour did so corrode



<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61829:65"/>
the Vessels, that a <hi>Vein</hi> burst, upon which he lost so much <hi>Blood,</hi> that it had almost cost him his Life; for it was very hard to stop it. A new Cure was carried on with that success, that the Wound was again brought to a <hi>Cicatrice.</hi> But upon a little shaking of his Body, the <hi>Vein</hi> broke again, and he lost at this second time more <hi>Blood</hi> than he had done at first. He became pale, sunk, and wasted to nothing. So that the Low estate of his Body made that he lost no more Blood. But now his <hi>Wound</hi> became more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, outward Applications had no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect any more upon it: The <hi>Cancer</hi> spread it self still further, and the more it was cut, it seemed to grow so much the faster; all the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Phisitians</hi> that were every where searcht for, began to lose hopes. And while all humane means became inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, recourse was bad to their <hi>False Gods,</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> were made for his Recovery to <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Esculapius.</hi> And some relief was pretended to have come from <hi>Apollo.</hi> But he grew still worse and worse. His <hi>Death</hi> seemed



<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61829:65"/>
very near, for the <hi>Cancer</hi> had consumed all the bottom of his <hi>Belly;</hi> his <hi>Guts</hi> were laid open, and were likewise rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and his whole <hi>Breech</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with the Putrifaction; some bold, but unhappy <hi>Phisitians</hi> would not for all this give over, and tho they had no hope of success, yet they were still trying new Remedies. Those drove the Evil inwards, even thro his <hi>Bones</hi> to the very <hi>Marrow,</hi> and now <hi>Worms</hi> began to breed within him. The <hi>Smell</hi> that came from him was so noysome, that it was felt not only over all the <hi>Palace,</hi> but in the very <hi>City</hi> likewise; and the Passages of his <hi>Urin</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements</hi> were now mixed, all the <hi>Membranes</hi> being corroded that sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated them. He was eat up by <hi>Vermine,</hi> and the whole Mass of his Body turned into an universal Rottenness. With all this, he had most intolerable Pains, so that he often bellowed out, as if it had been a Bull wounded. Some living <hi>Animals,</hi> and others that were boild, were applied to the putrified parts, to try if the heat would draw out the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine:</hi> and this indeed opened as it were



<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61829:66"/>
a vast <hi>Hive</hi> of them: yet a second Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posthumation discovered yet a much greater <hi>Swarm,</hi> so that his <hi>Gutts</hi> seemed to dissolve all into <hi>Worms.</hi> A <hi>Hydropsy</hi> joyned to all his other ills, did strangely disfigure his Body: all his upper parts were exhausted quite, and dried like a meer <hi>Skeleton,</hi> covered with a Dead-like Skin: but at the same time all his <hi>Lower Parts</hi> were swelled up like Bladders, so that the Shape of his Feet was scarce to be seen any more. In all this Misery did he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish a full <hi>year.</hi> His Conscience was at last awakned, and he was forced to give praise to God: so that in the Intervals of his pains, he cried often out, that <hi>he would rebuild the Church of Nicomedia,</hi> and that <hi>he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Mischiefs that he had done:</hi> and being in his last Agonies, he published this following <hi>Edict.</hi>

            <p n="36">XXXVI. As soon as ever <hi>Maximin</hi> had heard the News of his <hi>Death,</hi> he being then in the <hi>East,</hi> made all the hast that was possible to take into his possession all those <hi>Provinces:</hi> and as <hi>Licinius</hi> lingered, he possessed himself of all to the Straits of <hi>Thrace:</hi> and when he came into <hi>Bithinia,</hi> he took care to recommend himself to the Favour of the <hi>People,</hi> by discharging them of the Tax that was laid on them. By this means the <hi>two Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> were now in ill Terms, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most engaged in a War: For they lay with their <hi>Armies</hi> on the opposite shores.

for the making up of all their Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; and they had an Enterview up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Sea,</hi> in which they were not only reconciled, but they entred into an Alliance: <hi>Maximin</hi> went back, reckoning that he was now secure, and so he governed <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> just as he had done formerly: and tho the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> were now received under the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> yet he broke all this, and he set on underhand the Procuring <hi>Addresses</hi> from the several <hi>Cities</hi> to be made to him, for hindring the <hi>Christians</hi> to build <hi>Meeting Houses</hi> within their Bounds; that he might seem to be in some sort forced to do that which he had resolved on of his own Accord.

            <p n="37">XXXVII. While he was designing



<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61829:69"/>
all these things, he received <hi>Letters</hi> from <hi>Constantine,</hi> which put him in such a fright, that he resolved to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble for some time. Yet whensoever any <hi>Christian</hi> was found out, he was drowned secretly and in the Night; nor did he discontinue his Custom of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>Sacrifices</hi> every day in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</hi> He also began another Custom, of ordering all the <hi>Meat</hi> that was to be served up to his <hi>Table,</hi> to be offered up first by the <hi>Priests</hi> at some Altar, and not to be killed by his own Cooks; so that nothing was presented to his <hi>Table,</hi> but that which had passed thro some <hi>Rites</hi> or other of their <hi>Idolatry;</hi> by which means it was that none could eat with him, without being in some manner or other polluted with those Abominations. In all other things he followed the pattern that his Master had set him: For if there was any thing left by <hi>Diocletians</hi> or <hi>Maximians</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, he took care to raise all that so exactly, as to be sure to leave nothing to any that should come after him: so that without any sort of shame, he robbed the People of all they had: He



<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61829:69"/>
shut up all mens <hi>Granaries</hi> and <hi>Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses,</hi> and forced them to pay by an Advance the Taxes of the <hi>year</hi> to come. So that there not being <hi>seed</hi> to sow the Ground, this brought on a most into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable <hi>Famine.</hi> Whole Droves of <hi>Cattle</hi> and <hi>Sheep</hi> were brought for his daily <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> with which he fed his <hi>Domesticks</hi> and his <hi>Souldiers</hi> so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously, that they came to despise the <hi>Corn,</hi> that was brought them for their Provision, so that without any Care they threw it often out of Doors. And as he had a vast <hi>Army,</hi> so he clothed his <hi>Guards</hi> very richly, and furnished them with much Gold, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monest and rawest of his <hi>Souldiers</hi> had <hi>Silver</hi> in abundance given them. He was also extream liberal to the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians.</hi> All the Praise that is due to him is, that he was like those merciful Robbers, who are contented to strip men without killing them; for if he did not put People to Death, that so he might seise on their Estates, yet upon every occasion he either took away all they had, or gave it to such as begged it of him.</p>
            <p n="38">

               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:61829:70"/>XXXVIII. But there was <hi>one</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Wickedness, that exceeded all the rest, which he carried to such a blind and brutal degree, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find Words equal to it, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation which this must give, carries ones Thoughts further than his Tongue will serve him, to set it forth as it ought to be.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> and the other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his <hi>Appetites,</hi> searcht in all Places, and wheresoever they found a beautiful <hi>Woman,</hi> she was dragged away without any regard had of her <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> or her <hi>Parents:</hi> Those whom he Imployed in this Service, <hi>stript</hi> both married Women and Maids, and so viewed them naked, and if any refused to submit to this, she was drowned as guilty of High Treason. Several mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Men, whose Wives were thus vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently taken from them, not being able to bear the Grief which this gave them, murdered themselves: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Monster, there was no other Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for Modesty, but Ugliness. At last he carried this Licentiousness to such a pitch, that no Body was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered



<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61829:70"/>
to marry without his leave, and without his taking all Liberties with the <hi>Bride,</hi> before the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was admitted. He took the <hi>Daughters</hi> of the Men of Quality, and after he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had corrupted them, he gave them to his <hi>Slaves</hi> to marry them. His <hi>Courtiers</hi> were easily induced to follow his wicked Example, and to defile the Beds of such as depended on them: for they saw that no Body durst pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it. Those who were of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rank, were ravished by every body at his Pleasure; and such as were of the Chief rank, and so could not be ravished, were begged of the <hi>Emperour</hi> as Boons, and when he signed any such grant, the <hi>Father</hi> durst not refuse it, but saw that he must either die, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of some <hi>Barbarian</hi> for his <hi>Son-in-Law.</hi> For he had scarce any other <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks</hi> or <hi>Guards,</hi> but such as had been driven out of their Countrys by the <hi>Goths</hi> in the twentieth year of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletians</hi> Reign, during that Festivity. All these came and delivered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to <hi>Maximian,</hi> and so he made use of those who had fled from being



<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61829:71"/>
enslaved by the <hi>Goths,</hi> as his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for enslaving the <hi>Romans. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximin</hi> being environed with such Guards, and depending so entirely upon them as he did, treated all the rest of the <hi>East</hi> with the utmost degree of Contempt.</p>
            <p n="39">XXXIX He made this the measure of his Appetites, <hi>to esteem every thing lawful to which his Desires carried him;</hi> And according to this Rule, tho he had acknowledged the Empress <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> that was <hi>Maximians</hi> Widdow, his adopted <hi>Mother,</hi> yet that did not secure her; she had come to live in his <hi>Court,</hi> reckoning that she would be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer there than in any other place, since he had a Wife of his own. But nothing was Sacred to him, when he was pushed on by his impure Appetites; she was yet in deep mourning, the year not being out, when he proposed <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> to her, offering to divorce his <hi>Wife,</hi> if she would accept of him. Her answer was such as could have been expected from her; that she could not treat of her Marriage, while she was yet in her Mournings, and while



<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61829:71"/>
the Ashes of her <hi>Husband,</hi> his adopted <hi>Father,</hi> were not yet quite cold. She added, that it was a strange piece of Impiety in him, to offer to put away his <hi>Wife,</hi> who had been always faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him: which let her see what she herself might look for from him; and in the last place, it seemed to her no small Crime, as it was a thing without an Example, for a Woman of her rank to think of a second Husband. All this was reported to <hi>Maximin</hi> in her name: But he was so enraged at it, that his brutal Desires were now changed into Wrath and Fury. He presently put her under a Proscription, he seised on her goods, he took her Servants from her, and tortured some of her <hi>Eunuchs</hi> to Death; and sent <hi>her</hi> and her <hi>Mother</hi> into Banishment; but not to any certain place: but ordered her to be hurried about from place to place: and he charged such Women as were dearest to her, with Adultery, and upon that forged pretence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them.</p>
            <p n="40">XL. There was an Ancient Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Quality, whom <hi>Valeria</hi> had



<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61829:72"/>
always considered as a <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>Maximin</hi> believed that the refusal that was made of him, was advised by her; so he ordered <hi>Eratineus</hi> the <hi>President</hi> to put her to an Infamous Death; with her he ordered two other <hi>Women</hi> of the same Quality to be likewise exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. The one was <hi>Mother</hi> to one of the <hi>Vestal Virgins</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the other was the <hi>Widdow</hi> of a <hi>Senator</hi> and was the <hi>Empresses</hi> Kinswoman: but both their Crime was, that as they were Beautiful, so they were no less modest. They were violently seised on, not as if they had been to be carried before a Court of Justice, but as if they had fallen into the hands of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, yet there was no Accuser to lay any thing to their Charge. But a <hi>Iew</hi> was found out, who being condemned for some other Crimes, hoped to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his pardon by becoming a false Witness against them. The Judge who condemned them upon this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, carried them out of Town to their Execution with a Guard; for he was affraid that he should have been stoned by the people, This Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy



<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61829:72"/>
was acted at <hi>Nice.</hi> The <hi>few</hi> being put to the Torture, was forced to accuse the <hi>Women</hi> as he had been instructed: and when they offered to say any thing for themselves, they were beaten by the Tormenters; so that notwithstanding their Innocence, they were condemned. There was a great Lamentation raised upon this, not only by the Husband of one of them, to whom his Wife was extream dear, but by all the Multitude, that so unusual a Spectacle had brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and so apprehensive were the Judges of the Peoples using force for rescuing those Persons out of their Hands, that there was drawn about them a Body of Archers, and others of the lightly armed <hi>Souldiers:</hi> and with this Guard were they led out to Execution. Nor was there any care taken of their Burial, for their Servants were forced to abandon them; yet some of their Friends, moved with Compassion, came secretly and buried them. The Adulterous <hi>Iew</hi> had not the Pardon that was promised him, so seeing that he was to be hanged, he



<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61829:73"/>
discovered all this Mystery, and with his last breath he declared to all that were looking on, that the <hi>Women</hi> had suffered <hi>Unjustly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="41">XLI. The <hi>Empress</hi> being now ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished to the Deserts of <hi>Syria,</hi> found a secret Way of acquainting her Father <hi>Diocletian</hi> with her Condition. He upon that sent to <hi>Maximin,</hi> and desired that his <hi>Daughter</hi> might be sent to him; but tho he repeated this over and over again, all was without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: So after all, he sent a <hi>Kinsman</hi> of his own, that was an <hi>Officer</hi> of the <hi>Army,</hi> in a high Post, and in great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, to whom he gave in charge, to put <hi>Maximin</hi> in Mind of the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that he had received from him: but this Intercession was as ineffectual as the others had formerly been.</p>
            <p n="42">XLII. At this time <hi>Constantine</hi> gave Order that the <hi>Statues</hi> of <hi>Maximian</hi> the <hi>Elder,</hi> should be every where pulled down; and that such Pictures or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of him, as had been any where set up, should be removed. Now <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletians</hi> Statues and <hi>His</hi> being alwayes coupled together, the Disgrace of the



<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61829:73"/>
one drew the others likewise after it. <hi>Diocletian</hi> seeing this Affront put on his <hi>Statues,</hi> which no <hi>Emperour</hi> before him had ever seen done in his own time, and being now over-charged with this redoubling of Grief, he resolved to put an end to his Life. He was in a perpetual Uneasiness, and could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat nor sleep. He was heard to sigh and groan continually, and was seen oft to weep; and to be tumbling some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on his Bed, and sometimes on the Ground. Thus he that had reigned over the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> for twenty years, was now so cast down and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, that he <hi>dyed</hi> partly of Hunger, and partly thro Anguish of Spirit.</p>
            <p n="43">XLIII. There was only <hi>one</hi> of the Enemies of God now left alive, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Maximin,</hi> whose Fall and Death comes to be related in the next place. He bare a great Envy to <hi>Licinius</hi> ever since he had been preferred by <hi>Maximian</hi> to himself; and tho he had lately entred into an Alliance with him, yet when he heard that <hi>Licinius</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging himself into a straiter Alliance with <hi>Constantine,</hi> and was going to marry his <hi>Sister,</hi> he concluded that this



<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61829:74"/>
Union of those <hi>two Emperours,</hi> must certainly be fatal to himself; So he sent secretly to <hi>Rome,</hi> and writ very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Maxentius,</hi> desiring his Alliance and Friendship, which <hi>Maxentius</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced very readily, as if it had been somewhat sent him from Heaven; for he had declared War against <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> upon the pretence of Revenging his <hi>Fathers</hi> Blood. From this some have imagined, that the <hi>Father</hi> had only pretended to fall out with his <hi>Son,</hi> that he might have the more Credit with the other <hi>Emperours;</hi> and by that means find an occasion of Destroying them all; that so <hi>He</hi> and <hi>his Son</hi> might have the whole <hi>Empire</hi> between them: but this is a Mistake; for it is certain, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximian</hi> the Elder had a mind to destroy his <hi>Son</hi> with the rest, and that when this was done, he intended that <hi>Diocletian &amp; he</hi> should again re-assume the <hi>Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="44">XLIV. Now the War was begun between <hi>Maxentius</hi> and <hi>Constantine,</hi> which <hi>Maxentius</hi> managed by his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,</hi> but would not stir out of <hi>Rome</hi> himself; having had a <hi>Response,</hi> that whensoever he went out of the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> he should perish. He



<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61829:74"/>
had much the better <hi>Army:</hi> for he had not only those Troops that had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned <hi>Severus,</hi> but likewise others that he had brought together out of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> The two <hi>Armies</hi> fought, and <hi>Maxentius</hi>'s had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet <hi>Constantine</hi> did not for that lose Heart, but having resolved to put all to hazard, he marched on to the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> and posted his <hi>Army</hi> at the other side of the <hi>Milvian Bridge:</hi> the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> was now near, which was the Anniversary of <hi>Maxentius's</hi> coming to the <hi>Empire:</hi> and now his fifth year was almost out. <hi>Constantine</hi> was warned in a Dream to put the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mark, the Sign of the <hi>Cross,</hi> upon the <hi>Shields</hi> of his <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and so to give Battel; he took care to execute this, and ordered the Letter X with the Letters of the Name of <hi>Christ</hi> mixed in a <hi>Monogramme,</hi> to be drawn on all their <hi>Shields;</hi> and having made this his Distinction, he drew out his <hi>Army.</hi> The Enemy's Forces came like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise out, and crossed the Bridge, but <hi>Maxentius</hi> himself came not with them; they drew up both in the same manner,



<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61829:75"/>
and both sides fought with great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, neither of them giving Ground to the other; in the mean while there was a Sedition raised in <hi>Rome,</hi> and an Out-cry was made against <hi>Maxentius,</hi> as if he had taken more care of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self than of the Publick; and while he was entertaining the <hi>People</hi> with the Spectacles of the <hi>Hippodrome,</hi> there was a Universal Cry raised, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> could not be withstood; this put him into a great Disorder, so he made the <hi>Sybilline Books</hi> to be searcht, in which it was found, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the <hi>Romans</hi> was to perish that Day. This gave him such assured hopes of <hi>Victory,</hi> that he marched out in Person to his <hi>Army:</hi> as soon as he had passed the <hi>Bridge,</hi> it was broke behind him. Upon this the <hi>Battel</hi> was renewed, and the Hand of God appeared over the <hi>Armies. Maxentius</hi> was beat, and when he thought to repass the <hi>Bridge,</hi> he found it broke, and was carried by the crowd of his men, that were flying, into the <hi>Tiber,</hi> and so was drowned there. An end being thus put to the War, <hi>Constantine</hi> was declared <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi>



               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:61829:75"/>
with great Expression of Joy, both by the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Among <hi>Maxentius</hi>'s Papers he found <hi>Maximins</hi> Letters, by which he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his treacherous Designs against himself: He also saw the <hi>Imperial Statues</hi> that he had sent to <hi>Maxentius.</hi> The <hi>Senate</hi> did <hi>Constantine</hi> the Honour to order his Name to be put first in order, before the other <hi>Emperours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> tho that was claimed by <hi>Maximin,</hi> who was as much struck with the news that was brought to him of <hi>Romes</hi> being thus freed from Tyranny, as if it had been a Defeat given himself; and as soon as he heard of the <hi>Senates</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, giving <hi>Constantine</hi> the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he treated <hi>Constantine</hi> in a most reproachful and insolent manner.</p>
            <p n="45">XLV. <hi>Constantine</hi> having setled matters at <hi>Rome,</hi> went during the Winter to <hi>Millan:</hi> and thither did <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius</hi> come to marry his Sister. <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> hearing that they were now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mused with the Solemnities of this Wedding, marcht with his <hi>Army</hi> out of <hi>Syria</hi> during the bitter Cold of the Winter; and having harassed his <hi>Army</hi>



               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:61829:76"/>
with great Marches, he got to <hi>Bithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi> for the Season was very severe, and both by Snow and Rains the Wayes were very deep; and what with Cold and what with hard Labour, he lost all his Horse, so that all along where he had marched, he might have been traced by them; which was but an ill <hi>Omen</hi> to his Men: Nor did he stop within his own Limits, but having crost the Straits of <hi>Thrace,</hi> he came with his <hi>Army</hi> to the Gates of <hi>Bysance.</hi> There was a Garrison put within that Place by <hi>Licinius</hi> for all Events; so he shudied first to corrupt the <hi>Souldiers</hi> by Presents and Promises, and then to terrify them by threatning them with a <hi>Siege;</hi> but both the one and the other proved equally ineffectual: they had eleven days assigned them, for adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from him, they being disheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the smallness of their Numbers, rendred themselves. From thence he advanced to <hi>Heraclea;</hi> and being stopt there in the same manner as at <hi>Bysance,</hi> he lost some days there likewise. But by this time <hi>Licinius</hi> having marcht as



<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61829:76"/>
quick as was possible, had got to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianople</hi> with a few men about him; in the meanwhile <hi>Maximin</hi> having like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise taken <hi>Perinthus,</hi> which gave him a new stop, he advanced 18 Miles beyond it, where he posted himself: he could go no further; for <hi>Licinius</hi> had possessed himself of the Post that lay next to that, which was likewise eighteen mile distant from it; and having drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as great a Body as he could on the sudden, he marched on towards <hi>Maximin,</hi> on design rather to hinder his Progress, than to enter into action; for as he did not intend to fight, so he had no Prospect of Victory; for he had not above 30000. men: whereas <hi>Maximin</hi> was at the Head of an <hi>Army</hi> of 70000: for <hi>Licinius's</hi> Army was scattered over a great many <hi>Provinces,</hi> and he could not bring all his Troops together in so short a time.</p>
            <p n="46">XLVI. While the two <hi>Armies</hi> were thus so near one another, that it was expected that the matter should come to a speedy Decision, <hi>Maximin</hi> made <hi>a Vow to Iupiter,</hi> That if he got the Victory, he would utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the very <hi>Name of a Christian.</hi>



               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:61829:77"/>
The next night an <hi>Angel</hi> appeared to <hi>Licinius</hi> in his sleep, and ordered him to rise immediately, and joyn with his whole <hi>Army</hi> in calling on the <hi>Great God,</hi> and promised him an assured Victory in case he should do this. <hi>Licinius</hi> dreamt, that after this he rose, and that the <hi>Angel</hi> dictated to him the very <hi>Words</hi> in which he should osser up his <hi>Prayers.</hi> And as soon as he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, he called for one of his <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</hi> and ordered him to write down the Words, which were these, <hi>We pray to thee, O Great God; we pray to thee, O Holy God; we commit the Iustice of our Cause to thee; we commit our Lives to thee; we commit this our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to thee. It is by thee that we do live; our Conquests and our Happiness come from thee: O thou great and good God, hear our Prayers; we stretch out our hands to thee: hear us therefore thou Holy and Great God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Many <hi>Copies</hi> were quickly made of this <hi>Prayer,</hi> which were sent about to all the <hi>Ossicers,</hi> and all were required to make their <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> get it by heart. This raised the Courage of the whole <hi>Army,</hi> who



<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61829:77"/>
now lookt on the Victory as assured, since it was so Divinely fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> told. <hi>Maximin</hi> resolved to give Battel on the first of <hi>May,</hi> which was the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary</hi> of his coming to the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> this being now the eighth <hi>year</hi> compleat since he was raised to that Dignity: and thus it happened, that as <hi>Maxentius</hi> was defeated at <hi>Rome</hi> on his <hi>Anniversary,</hi> so <hi>Maximin</hi> run the same Fortune on his; only <hi>Maximin</hi> would needs anticipate his own Ruin; for he would needs sight the Day before it, that so he might celebrate his <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary</hi> with the more Pomp, when he had defeated his Enemy. When <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius</hi> heard that <hi>Maximin's</hi> Army was advancing, he likewise drew out his, so that they were in view one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. There lay between them a great and barren Plain, called <hi>Serenum. Licinius</hi>'s men laid down their <hi>Shields,</hi> and took off their <hi>Head pieces,</hi> and with hands lifted up to Heaven, they said their <hi>Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> himself beginning, and the <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> following him in it; which was pronounced so loud, that the other

               <hi>Army</hi> that was to fall before them, heard the noise of it. The <hi>Prayer</hi> was three times repeated, and that being done, the <hi>Souldiers</hi> being now won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully animated, put on their <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces,</hi> and took up their <hi>Shields.</hi> The <hi>Emperours</hi> themselves parlyed a little; <hi>Maximin</hi> would hearken to no Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of Peace; for he despised <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius,</hi> and fancied that all his <hi>Souldiers</hi> would have deserted him, because he was more sparing in his Bounty to them; whereas <hi>Maximin</hi> was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prosuse; and as he had begun with <hi>Licinius,</hi> not doubting but that his <hi>Army</hi> would without giving any stroke come over to him, so when he had thus doubled his Forces, he resolved to go against <hi>Constantine.</hi>

all hands, perswading <hi>Licinius</hi>'s Men to turn over to him, what with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, what by Intereaties; but all was to no effect; and being charged in person, he was forced to retire. His <hi>Army</hi> fell before the Enemy without being able to make any Resistance; and that vast body of men was mowed down by a handful. They seemed to have forgot their Rank, their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and their former Exploits; and the hand of God was visible in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them over to have their Throats cut by their Enemies, as if they had come into the Field for an Execution, and not for a Battle. When <hi>Maximin</hi> saw that the matter went far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than he had lookt for, and that great numbers of his men were killed, he threw away his <hi>Purple,</hi> and put on the <hi>Habit</hi> of a <hi>Slave,</hi> and so crossed the Straits; for now the one half of his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> was destroyed, and the other half either fled or rendered it self. And since the <hi>Emperour</hi> had deserted his <hi>Army,</hi> the <hi>Souldiers</hi> were not at all ashamed of deserting his Interests: he made great hast; for in a Night and



<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61829:79"/>
a Day he sled to <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> and got thither the first of <hi>May</hi> in the Night, which was an hundred and theerscore Miles distance from the place where the Battel was fought: he staied not long there, but having taken along with him his <hi>Sons</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> and some few of his Domesticks, he went to the <hi>East;</hi> yet he stopt in <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> and there he took the <hi>Purple</hi> again, having gathered together some <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> partly of his own Straglers, and partly of some Troops that came to him from the <hi>East.</hi>

had a very succesful congress at <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> in which we treated of all things that related to the profit and safety of the <hi>Publick;</hi> among other matters we thought that nothing could be of greater Advantage to our People, or concern our selves more, than the setling of those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in which the <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> consisted; and therefore we judged it meet to allow to all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> and others, free Liberty to follow that <hi>Religion</hi> which they should like best: that by this means that Supream <hi>Deity,</hi> which dwells on high, might be gracious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to us, and to all our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: therefore upon due Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and weighty Reasons, we have thought sit, that no man may be denied the Liberty of <hi>Professing</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> or any <hi>other,</hi> as he shall judge it best; that so the <hi>Great God,</hi> whom we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with free minds, may in all things bless us with his gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Protection.

            <p n="49">XLIX. But while <hi>Licinius</hi> was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing after <hi>Maximin,</hi> he still sled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and possessed himself of the narrow passages of <hi>Mount Taurus,</hi> where he built <hi>Forts</hi> to stop them up, that so it might not be possible for <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius</hi> to pass them; but he took a compass to the right hand: and when <hi>Maximin</hi> saw that there was now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to stop him, he fled to <hi>Tarsus;</hi> but being like to be shut up there, both by Sea and Land, and seeing no possibility of escape, the Anguish of his Spirit and his Fear, made him fly to Death, as the only way to escape from those Evils with which <hi>God</hi> was pursuing him. He first eat and drunk to a great excess, as is ordinary for those to do who reckon that it is their last meal that



<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61829:82"/>
they eat, and then he took <hi>Poyson;</hi> but his Stomach being so over-charged, made that the <hi>Poyson</hi> had not a present operation on him; but instead of killing him out-right, it threw him into a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering Torment, not unlike the Plague; by which his Life was so far lengthned out to him, that he felt his Misery long: The <hi>Poyson</hi> began now to work violently on him, it burned his Vitals so much, that his insufferable Pains threw him into a Phrenesy; so that for four Days time he eat Earth, which he dug up with his Hands, and swallowed it up very greedily. The Rages of his Pain were so intolerable, that he run his Head against a Wall with such force, that his Eyes started out of the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes; but as he lost the Sight of his Eyes, a <hi>Vision</hi> represented himself to his Imagination, as standing to be judged by God, who seemed to have Hosts of Ministers about him all in White Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; at this sight he cried out as if he had been put to the Torture, and said, that it was others, and not he, that were to blame; yet afterwards he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed his own Guilt, being as it were



<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61829:82"/>
forced to it by the Torments that he suffered: he called upon <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and with many Tears he begged that he would have pity on him; he roared and groaned as if he had been inwardly burnt up: and thus did he breath out his defiled Soul, in the most dreadful manner that can be imagined.</p>
            <p n="50">L. Thus did God destroy all the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors</hi> of his great Name, both <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch:</hi> for <hi>Licinius</hi> being now setled in the <hi>Empire,</hi> gave order to put both <hi>Valeria</hi> and <hi>Caudidian</hi> to death. <hi>Valeria</hi> had been still preserved by <hi>Maximin,</hi> who notwithstanding all his Rage against her, and tho he saw now his own End approaching, yet had not the boldness to put her to death. <hi>Caudidian</hi> was her adopted <hi>Son,</hi> for his <hi>Mother</hi> was a Concubine of <hi>Maximians;</hi> but <hi>Valeria</hi> being barren, had adopted him. She had no sooner got the news of <hi>Maximins</hi> Death, then she came to his <hi>Court</hi> in disguise, that she might see what would become of <hi>Caudidian;</hi> but he appearing publickly in <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and fancying that Respect would be shewed him because of his Birth, and



<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61829:83"/>
apprehending nothing less than what befel him, was put to Death: upon which <hi>Valeria</hi> fled away immediately. <hi>Licinius</hi> ordered likewise <hi>Severian</hi> to be put to death. He was <hi>Severus's</hi> Son, and was now grown up to a mans Age, and had accompanied <hi>Maximin</hi> in his slight; but it was pretended, that he was aspiring to the <hi>Empire,</hi> and for that he was condemned. All these had great Apprehensions of <hi>Licinius,</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him as an ill man; only <hi>Valeria,</hi> who had refused to resign her preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to <hi>Maximin,</hi> had resolved to do it in his savour. <hi>Licinius</hi> ordered like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Maximins</hi> eldest <hi>Son,</hi> who was then eight years old, and his <hi>Daughter</hi> that was only seven, and had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to <hi>Caudidian,</hi> to be put to Death. And before that was executed, their Mother was drowned in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Orontes,</hi> where she had made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chast Women to be drowned for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. And thus thro the just and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgment of God, all those wicked persons came to suffer the same things that they had done to others.</p>
            <p n="51">LI. <hi>Valeria</hi> her self wandred about

in the Habit of a <hi>Peasant,</hi> during the space of eighteen <hi>Moneths;</hi> but was at last discovered at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> where both <hi>she</hi> and her <hi>Mother</hi> suffered. The two <hi>Empresses</hi> were led to the place of Execution thro a vast multitude of Spectators, who were struck with the Compassion that was raised by so lamentable a sight: their Heads were cut off, and their Bodies were cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, so fatal did their Dignity and <hi>Valeria's</hi> chastity prove to them.</p>
            <p n="52">LII. I have given you this recital upon the credit of persons that were well informed of those matters: and I have thought sit to write them just as they were transacted, that so the true account of those great <hi>Revolutions</hi> might not be lost; and that it might not be in the power of any, who inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to write the <hi>History</hi> of that <hi>time,</hi> to corrupt the Truth, or to suppress either their Sins against God, or Gods Judgments upon them.</p>
            <p>It is to his Insinite Mercy that we owe our Thanksgivings; who has at last visited the World, and has gathered together and recovered his Flock, that

was partly scattered abroad, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly torn by ravenous Wolves; and who has destroyed those Beasts of Prey, that had wasted the Pastures of his Flock, and had broken their Folds. Where are now those once Glorious and renowned Names of <hi>Iovins</hi> and <hi>Herculins,</hi> that were assumed with so much Insolence by <hi>Diocletian</hi> and <hi>Maximian,</hi> and that were afterwards derived by them to their Successors!

            <p>Let us then Celebrate <hi>Gods</hi> Triumph over his Enemies with all the Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Joy: Let us sing of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and praise him for them; and let us beg of him by our most earnest <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> repeated Day and Night, that he will forever establish that Peace which he has given to his People after ten <hi>years</hi> of War.</p>
