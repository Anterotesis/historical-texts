         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Received yours of the fourth of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
and thank you for your relation
of the proceedings of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which are welcome to all
Loyall and true-hearted Snbjects;
There is daily here ſpred amongſt us many lying
and ſcandalous reports againſt that high and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Court, to make it odious; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that cauſe muſt needs be bad, which makes uſe
of lyes to ſupport it. I ſhall give you the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
I can of the ſtrength of his Majeſties
Army: It is related amongſt us, that it doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
daily, and as I am an eye-witneſſe my ſelf,
and have it likewiſe from others; It doth conſiſt
of ſix thouſand Foote, three thouſand Horſe, and
fifteene hundred Dragooneers, which, if ſupplies
come not ſpeedily in, muſt in few dayes muteny:
The Countrey hath been in particular dealt with
for lending monies, and Commiſſioners appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for receiving thereof, and every man of any
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124229:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 6 -->
ability hath payed ſomewhat, who ſo refuſed, or
gave not ſo much as was expected, was threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be plundered: This money is all ſpent, and
what elſe his Majeſties Plate could coyne, which
I can aſſure you was not much: Now the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Uſurers are againe ſent to, to know what
they will lend the King upon ſecurity, and great
ſummes are demanded, but whether upon the
former conditions we know not; They have a
ſaying amongſt the Souldiers, that all rich men
are Round-heads, and therefore they may bee
bold with them, and certainly they make good
their words, by their practiſe, for they have plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
many Gentlemens houſes in theſe parts,
and thoſe too which were not ſo well affected to
the Parliament, whereby men ſee now what is to
be expected from them: We feare when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
goes, which they ſay he will upon Munday
or Tueſday next, we ſhall be ill dealt with by the
common Souldiers, both in Town and Country;
We have had Warrants to ſend in Horſes and
Carts for his removall, which are come towards
<hi>Salop,</hi> but whither his Majeſty intends, is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
knowne, it is given out he intends for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
I pray God bleſſe him, and ſend him well
thither in peace, but it is conceived by others, that
he will march towards <hi>Yorke,</hi> and take <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
in the way, where the new Earle of <hi>Darby</hi>
hath had but ill ſucceſſe, he hath loſt above two
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124229:3"/>
hundred men. Laſt Tueſday he was faine to
leave it, and it is given out for the reparation of
his Honour, that his Mejeſty ſent twice for him.
Had there not been ſome faint-heartedneſſe in
ſome of the prime Gentry in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> who would
ſtand as Neutrals, there had been as great an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
there, as in any other County, and thoſe
Gentlemen have found but little favour, for they
ſtand committed at Court, and their Houſes have
been plundered, the County is diſarmed, and
likewiſe at <hi>Wrexam</hi> his Majeſty ſent for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Denbighſhire,</hi> and <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> and hath
diſarmed them: Moſt of our Gentry hereabouts
are made Captaines, and reſolve to goe with the
Army, ſome that you know very well, that came
to <hi>Salop</hi> this laſt night for that purpoſe, and in
hope of plunder, for his Majeſty we heare is in
great want of money, and he is fallen into a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
part of the Kingdome for that, or any other
proviſion fit for an Army, ſo that if the Mint at
<hi>Salop</hi> do want ſupply, we feare it will goe hard
with us, a Garriſon of 2000. are ſent to <hi>Bridge-North</hi>
to relieve and keep that from the Earle of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> his Forces, the like, or more, with ſome
pieces of Ordnance are to be left at <hi>Salop</hi> for the
ſame purpoſe: there are all ſorts of Nations (I
thinke) about the Court, and I admire the Papiſts
doe ſo reſort thither, ſince his Majeſties Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to the contrary: many of his Majeſties

               <!-- PDF PAGE 7 -->
Officers and meniall ſervants pray for peace, and
it is verily beleeved his Majeſty is graciouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to it, but the Cavaliers will not endure to
heare of it, but rather will adventure upon moſt
deſperate things. I conceive it great pitty his
Majeſty ſhould be brought into any ſtreights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
God reward them that have been the occaſion of
it; but this I am ſure of, he is much abuſed by his
plundering Cavaliers, who daily plunder and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe
men, and ſay they have Commiſſion for it:
They have plundered Maſter <hi>Nichols</hi> Houſe, who
is Sheriffe of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and burned his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
ſpoiled his houſe, ſold his furnace, and the
Iron of his Carts, it is much doubted theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and other the like, will withdraw the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of his Majeſties Subjects from him, this is
the ſubſtance of all: Prince <hi>Robert</hi> and the Duke
are yet in <hi>Salop,</hi> they lie at Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> houſe
the Lawyer, it is reported here the Terme is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed,
I pray let us heare if it be ſo. They tell
us likewiſe that the Parliament Forces have had
a great overthrow at <hi>Hereford,</hi> and that they are
weake and dare not fight, but are returned backe
towards <hi>London,</hi> and that one halfe thereof are
againſt them utterly. I beleeve his Majeſties Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
Horſe and Foote, is above ten thouſand, but
its feared the Voluntiers, not one of ten can give
fire, many young boyes come in daily, to what
number they may increaſe we know not; the

Horſe of our County are gone to <hi>Bridge-North</hi> in
his Majeſties ſervice, the Armes of ſeverall
Welch Counties are brought to <hi>Salop:</hi> Your laſt
