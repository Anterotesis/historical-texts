            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If therefore thou expect'st
such Elegancy as takes the
times, affect some subject as
will beare it. Had I laboured
with over-abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of fictions, or flourishes,
perhaps they had exposed mee, censurable,
and disprized this sacred subject: Therefore
I rest more sparing in that kinde.</p>
                  <p>Two things I would treate of: First, the
<hi>matter,</hi> secondly, the <hi>manner</hi> of this History.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>matter,</hi> (so farre as I have dealt)
it is Canonicall, and indited by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, not lyable to errour, and needs no
blanching.</p>
                  <p>In it, Theologie sits as Queene, attended
by her handmaid Philosophy; both concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to make the understanding Reader a
good Divine, and a wise Moralist.</p>
                  <p>As for the Divinitie; it discovers the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
in his two great Attributes; in his
Mercy, delivering his Church; in his Iustice,
confounding her enemies.</p>
                  <p>As for the Morality; it offers to us the

was, or why the name of God (as in few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the Bible) is unmentioned in
this, it is immateriall and doubtfull. For the
first, it is enough for anuncurious questioner
to know, it was indited by the Spirit of God:
for the second, let it suffice, that that Spirit
will'd not here to reveale his name.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Manner</hi> of this history (consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Periphrase, the adjournment of the
Story, and interposition of Meditations) I
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:26429:52"/>
I hope it hath not injured the Matter: For in
this I was not the least carefull, to use the
light of the best Expositors, not daring to goe
un-led, for feare of stumbling. Some say,
Divinity in Verse is incongruous and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:
such I referre to the <hi>Psalmes of David,</hi>
or the Song of his sonne <hi>Salomon,</hi> to bee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
But in these lewd times, the salt, and
soule of a Verse, is obscene scurrility, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it seemes dull, and livelesse: And
though the sacred History needs not (as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
doe) Poetry, to perpetuate the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
(being by Gods owne mouth blest
with Eternity) yet Verse (working so neare
upon the soule, and spirit) will oft times draw
those to have a history in familiarity, who
(perchance) before, scarce knew there was
such a Booke.</p>
                  <p>Reader, bee more than my hasty pen stiles
thee: Reade mee with advice, and thereafter
judge me, and in that judgement censure me.

thou conceivest may not stand

Attire; her immodest Gesture; her
bold Countenance; her flattering
Tongue; her lascivious Embraces;
her unchast Kisses; her impudent

question but the validitie of my
Warrant will give a reasonable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction:
He that lifts not his
feet high enough, may easily stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
But on the contrary, if any be,
whose worse then sacrilegious

off their shoos, for <hi>this is holy
Ground:</hi> Foule hands will muddle
the clearest waters: &amp; base minds
will corrupt the purest Text: If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
offence be taken, it is by way
of stealth, for there is none wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

not to <hi>Spiders:</hi> They will sucke
pleasing honey from such flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:

Thus, and then, was this Citie of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and for seventie yeeres, remained the lewes
in this Captivitie: And this, in Briefe, is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
occasion why, and the time when these La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
were compased. Reader, I tender to
thy consideration two things: First, the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
Secondly, the Art and Method of this
<hi>Threnodia</hi> As for the first, It was penned by
<hi>Ieremie</hi> the Prophet, the sonne of <hi>Hilkiah,</hi> a
Priest: and undoubt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dly endighted by the Spirit
of God; some thinke it was written, when the
Prophet was in prison: others, when he was with
<hi>Godoliah</hi> at <hi>Maspath:</hi> but whether at the one
place or at the other, it is not much materiall to
discourse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as touching the Art and Method,
it is short and concise, as being most naturall to so
lamentable a subject. <hi>Cicero</hi> sayes, <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationes
debent esse concisae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="435" facs="tcp:26429:228"/>
aut lectores, in illo affectu summae com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserationis,
diu tenere.</hi> The Method is truly
elegious, not bound to any ordinary set forme, but
wildly depending upon the sudden subject, that
new griefes present, and indeed the deepest sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
cannot be, but distracted from all rules of
method, the neglect of which, is veniall in such
ejulations as these, as which, in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
there is none so copious, none so ardent; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> confesses,
<hi>Threnos Ieremiae nunquam à se siccis oculis
lectos esse.</hi> Yet some thinke there is a Method
kept, but too fine and intricate, for our grosse ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions:
touching this point, Saint Ambrose
<hi>lib. 8. Epist. adjust.</hi> sayes, <hi>Demus, eas secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
artem non scripsisse, at certè secundum
gratiam scripsisse fatendum est, quae omnem
artem longè superat,</hi> and with this, I rest.</p>
                  <p>You shall observe, that the foure first Chapters
of these Lamentations carry a strict order, in the
Originall, for every Verse throughout every
Chapter begins with a severall letter of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Alphabet, except the third Chapter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the first and every third Verse onely is tyed to
a Letter, and continues the Alphabet through;
which for me the Prophet used, partly for Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
partly for Memory sake; meaning either
literally thus, that it ought to be perfect as the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:26429:229"/>
Alphabet, in memory; or Hieroglyphically thus,
that as the Alphabet is the Radix of all words, so
the miseries of the Iewes, were the combination of
all miseries.</p>
                  <p>For the same Causes, I likewise here in my Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphrase,
have observed the same forme, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the Alphabet in English, as the Prophet
did in the Hebrew, desirous to be his shadow, as
much as I can.</p>
                  <p>It appeares by the strictnesse of the Order, that
these Lamentations were Originally writ in verse
and as some thinke in Sapphicks, but many of our
learned Neotericks deny, that any writings of the
Iewes cary, now, any direct or certaine Lawes of
Poesie, though (they confesse) some ruinous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
here and there discovered, makes them ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
they writ some things in verse; but now, it
seemes that God, in dispersing them, hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
dissolved, and strucke dumbe their musicke.</p>
