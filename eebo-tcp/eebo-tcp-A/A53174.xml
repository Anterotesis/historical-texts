            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS Upon a Paper intituled, Reaſons humbly offered to this Honourable Houſe why a Bill pretended to give further Powers to the Corporation for ſetting the Poor of the City of <hi>London</hi> and Liberties thereof to work, ſhould not paſs into a Law.</head>
            <p>TO <hi>the firſt Paragraph.</hi> 'Tis preſumed no further Powers are deſired by the Preſident, Governours and Aſſiſtants of the City of <hi>London,</hi> than what are granted in ſeveral late Acts to other Corporations, in order to the clearing of the Streets from Beggars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the 2d.</hi> By the Bill no ſingle perſon of the Corporation hath power to determine any Allowance between any Complainant and the Churchwardens and Overſeers of the Poor, but ſuch only as live within the reſpective Ward where ſuch poor perſon is legally ſettled; which Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour may reaſonably be ſuppoſed as well to underſtand the condition of the Complainant as of any the ſaid Churchwardens or Overſeers of the Poor, and more likely to do Juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the 3d.</hi> There are few or no Churchwardens either in City or Country, are deſirous to have their Accounts publickly examin'd, while their own Veſtrys chuſe the Auditors of the ſaid Accounts, without ever conſulting the Juſtices therein. But the Bill propoſes no leſs than 7 of the Corporation to examin their Accounts: And if the ſaid Accounts are juſt, they need not fear who inſpects them; nor will any honeſt man be diſcourag'd thereby from being Churchwarden, and others are not fit to be intruſted. Beſides all which, any Determinations of the ſaid Corporation are ſubject to an Appeal to the Juſtices at the next open Seſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the 4th.</hi> The Collections deſir'd were propos'd to be made as well at all other places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Religious Worſhip as at Church-doors, and only intended to eaſe the ſeveral Pariſhes in raiſing Mony to the Corporation by appointment of the Common Council, purſuant to 13 and 14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the 5th.</hi> That tho the Corporation have power, according to the foreſaid Act of Parliament, to apply to the Common Council to raiſe a Year's Tax 'as often as they have occaſion, yet have they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to raiſe only one half Year's Tax in two years laſt paſt; and hope they may not have any further occaſion in ſome conſiderable time. And the ſaid Corporation have not power to maintain the Impotent, but only to ſet thoſe to work that are able. And what Mony the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration have rais'd and disburs'd, they have given an account of to the Juſtices of the Peace at the open Seſſions, and are obliged yearly ſo to do by the foreſaid Act. And one 3<hi>d</hi> part of thoſe Perſons the ſaid Paper ſtiles [<hi>theſe men</hi>] are the Lord Mayor and Aldermen; and beſides, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others of the Gentlemen of the Corporation have ſerved or fined for the Office of Sheriffs of the ſaid City, and none are choſe but by the Common Council. And whereas the Corporation are charg'd with requiring twelve pence <hi>per</hi> week, they propos'd it only for Children, and not for other perſons; which Children are fed, clothed, lodged, and taught to get their own livings; and when able to maintain themſelves, the Churchwardens are at liberty to take them away, and the Corporation will be willing to take more, and teach them in like manner. And the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration having now about 200 Children in their Workhouſe, ſo maintain'd as aforeſaid, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pariſhes of the City of <hi>London</hi> which ſend them, do by that particular only ſave 800 <hi>l.</hi> per <hi>ann.</hi> And the ſaid Children are taught to read, and do go to Great St. <hi>Hellens</hi> Church twice every Sunday, and are there catechiſed. And the Corporation do imploy a great part of their time in ſerving the Publick, without one penny benefit to themſelves; but on the contrary, they ſpend their own Mony, and did advance a conſiderable Sum for carrying on that Work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Mony could be rais'd by the Common Council for that end. Whereas in one or two of the Pariſhes in <hi>Farringdon</hi> without, it has been cuſtomary to ſpend twenty pounds at a Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger's, and three or four and twenty pounds at a Perambulation dinner; which Mony is generally rais'd by overrating the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the Honorary Governors,</hi> the Writer of the ſaid Paper arraigns the Wiſdom of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who have given the like Powers to other Corporations for the encouraging their Charity, without having any reſpect to their Perſuaſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Concluſion.</hi> Tho the ſaid Writer Will not allow the Reaſonableneſs of the Bill now deſired by the Corporation, yet he deſires to have a like Bill for <hi>Farringdon</hi> without, who yet have an equal number of their Ward that are of the ſaid Corporation already.</p>
