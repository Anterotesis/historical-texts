            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THat Report which I heard in the Land of my Nativity, from all that I conversed withal that had travelled these Parts, of that worthy person, whom your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath lately honoured with the Title and Power of your Lieutenant General of this Continent of <hi>Guinah,</hi> was the great Motive, next the Glory of God, and the good of Souls, of my first intended Voyage unto this Place: And now being experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally sensible of Fames truth in this particular, I cannot but wi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h thankfulness of heart humbly acknowledge it to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and must in the faithfulness of my soul, say as once it was said after the like long voyage (in an other case, yet little differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) by that Queen of <hi>Shebah,</hi> concerning the Wisdom &amp; Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. that the half was not told me: for I have been not only made partaker of the Benefits that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons under his charge do injoy (the which are no mean ones) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the due administration of Justice without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but also of many signal Favours, by your Lordships recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, procured; the which I must also hereby thankfully acknowledge.</p>
            <p>And as for the freedom of our Liberties in the service of our God, according to what was promised by your Lordship, and also by the Act of the Council of this Colony, manifested, we do freely enjoy: the which, for mine own part (God assisting) shall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65432:3"/>
not in the least be abused; but as in the Land of my Nativity, so hear I shall fervently pray for, and earnestly endeavour the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral preservation and eternal well-being both of the King, and all that are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well; and shall not in the least endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour either by word or action, directly or indirectly, to alienate the hearts of any of his subjects, either from him, or any that are set up or sent by him, though both he and they should persecute or dispitefully use us; but shall (God assisting) both pray for them, and according to the rule of holy Scripture, preach up all dutiful obedience, both to Government and Governours, in all civil things: and if at any time either he, or you, shall force us to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the way, that either he, or you, do, or shall worship in, shall (by the assistance of the Almighty) resolve to suffer under you, and not in the least resist you my self, nor endeavour it by others, but shall press to a peaceable life and a holy conversation, the which in all probability may be hoped (by the blessing of God) to conduce much to the reforming of many of Country-men here, who call themselves Christians, yet by their debauched Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Actions, evidence themselves more brutish by far, than the very Heathens themselves, to the shame and stink of Christianity amongst them; the which, by the civil party here residing, is greatly hoped will, by your Lordships wisdom and care, now sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly be remedied, although the constitution of the Colony, could not hitherto well brook a Reformation.</p>
            <p>And now, My Lord, speaking of a Reformation, I must in the faithfulness of my soul, discharge my conscience to you, in letting you know that there is a prize now put into your hands; the which if it be not used to the advancement of his Glory that hath advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced you to this higher step of honour; it will at the last prove that, which will but the more aggravate your greater misery, when you must appear before the great Tribunal, there to give an account to that <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> that righteous Judge, who will give to every man according to his works: And that then you may give up your account with joy, and not with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, let me beg you in Gods fear, so to set upon the work of a thorow Reformation, not only here, but also in all places where you have to do, that men may tremble to blaspheme that holy Name
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65432:3"/>
of him, who so loved the world, that he gave his only Son to dye for them.</p>
            <p>My Lord, in the next place, I must beg you not to take these lines from me at the worst hand, as that I think your Lordship either short of your duty, or backward to so good and Christian a work, or that I should presume to moddle a frame of Government; the which the searcher of all hearts knows is the least of my thoughts: but seeing in these parts, by the rude rabble, drunkenness and so much debauchery; and hearing, to the great trouble of my soul, so many bitter Oaths, horrid Execrations, and lascivious Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, I cannot but bear my faithful testimony against them, and also earnestly desire and endeavour a suppression of them; not that I fear the violence of the persons so acting, although I have, since I came hither, had a sufficient share of them; for I have, through mercy, tasted so much of the providence of the Almighty in the Land of my Nativity, in the midst of my sufferings, that I know that not a hair from my head shall perish without his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>Neither did I acquaint your faithful Lieutenant therewith, that I either feared their force, or in the least desired their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he himself can bear me witness, for it is contrary to our principles so to act; but being invited hither by an Act of the Council of the Colony, and having obtained (by the good hand of God upon me) a free pass from the King and his Council, not only for my self and mine, but also for six families more, to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our selves into this Place; and only my self, and mine, and one of the said families more, venturing over, the rest with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, do earnestly desire a faithful Account from me, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the place, but also of our entertainment here, as to our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and having a verbal assurance thereof from your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies Deputy, and another person of Quality and Eminency here. Yet notwithstanding, meeting with some gross incivilities, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by two debauched persons-in the heighth of their drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness; I thought good to acquaint the said persons therewith, and the rather, because it was told us by several in <hi>England,</hi> that the said Invitations, and also your Lordships Promises, and the Kings Indulgence for tender Consciences in these parts granted, were but as so many Decoyes to inveagle us, and to make us a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65432:4"/>
prey; but your Lieutenants readiness, and his eager severity in examining, and also in intending to punish the said abuses, hath given me so ample a satisfaction of the verity thereof, as that I am confirmed in my Judgement of the reality of them, and can now with a better confidence give a better testimony of the verity thereof to those that have desired it; and as for the said Offenders, as I had given information of their abuses, so I was fain to beg off their punishments.</p>
            <p>And now my Lord, after this long discourse, so soon as I have given your Lordship to understand, that I and mine like well the Country and Climate, and that notwithstanding we have not plenty of that which formerly we have enjoyed, of English food of all sorts, yet I bless God, for meat and drink, we fare as well with the Countreys provisions now in our old age, as ever we did in our youthful dayes, and do not in the least lust after them, nor much desire them. And as for our young ones, my Son and Daughter, they are fully as well satisfied as we in every particular.</p>
            <p>And now without multiplying more lines, I shall in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of my heart, humbly take my leave, praying for your safe and speedy passage to us; and in the mean time, for a safe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of your faithful Lieutenant amongst us again; till which, his temporal joy will in a great measure be eclipsed, who must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe himself,</p>

            <p>I Am very glad to find by your Letter, that you like the Land so well, and approve of the place; I hope that in time God will work upon the hearts of the People to be of a more civil life and conversation. All new Colonies you know of what sort of People generally they are made up of; so that, what we in probability can expect from them, must be from length of time, and the good example of those who have been more civilly bred, and God hath wrought upon, and better principled, which I do with great expectation hope in time may produce good effects in that poor and sad Colony of <hi>Syrranam:</hi> I do pray to God to strengthen you in those your resolutions for the good of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that poor place: I know your descretion will tell you that Reformation is not usually wrought of a suddain in such people, but that endeavours are to be used by degrees to draw them to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter carriages. I could be glad to hear more of your sober friends that you mention were coming to you; and am very glad to find you are so well satisfied in my Lieutenant General: and do assure you, and hope you are fully satisfied therein, that nothing that may lye within the power of him or my self, for the effecting of the good Ends I know you aim at, shall be wanting, as well for the confirmation of what hath been promised, as to the free liberty and enjoyment of your Consciences in the Worship of God, and likewise for the encouragement of your civil peace and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble living; of which I pray God to increase afterwards, and to let your friends know as much from him, who is and will be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to you all; and rest,</p>
