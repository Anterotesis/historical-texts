            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeeres paſt, the free uſe and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſall of all the Iournalls of the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe of Parliament, from the firſt yeare of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, being the moſt ancient that they have) untill that time. And being unwilling to
<pb facs="tcp:55081:3"/>
loſe the advantage of that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, I read them all through, and whatſoever I conceived to tend to the rule of the houſe, (wherein I was the better inabled to udge, in reſpect I had ſerved in divers Parliaments, or Sessions of Parliament before that time) I reduced under apt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Titles: Amongſt the reſt in this Chapter of passing of <hi>Bills,</hi> I was the more ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, becauſe it is indeed the daily and moſt proper worke of that houſe, wherein I have beene carefull, not to propoſe
<pb facs="tcp:55081:3"/>
any thing for a rule, for which I have not vouched the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Iournall. Thoſe my collections, I imparted many yeeres ſince to ſome of my friends (which being by the length of time multiplied into very many copies) one of them (and I thinke the falſeſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of all the reſt) was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my knowledge lately prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and by the negligence of the Printer, the errors of the copie were much increaſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that it pleaſed the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> (becauſe it concerned their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders)
<pb facs="tcp:55081:4"/>
to take notice thereof, and take ſome order therein; by which I was induced to make this publication, being otherwiſe very unwilling to have appeared in print, and to have ſubjected my ſelfe to publique cenſure.</p>
            <p>It were (in my poore opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to be wiſht, that the ſame courſe were taken by the houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> as was by the Lords in 18. <hi>Iacobi Regis,</hi> who appointed a <hi>Committee</hi> for the collecting of the rules and orders of that houſe; which being collected, they cauſed to
<pb facs="tcp:55081:4"/>
be fairly ingroſſed in a roll of parchment, which by order is alwaies read in the beginning of every <hi>Parliament,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the cuſtody of the Clarke of that houſe, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reſorted unto upon all occaſions, where by much of their pretious time is ſaved, which other wiſe perhaps would have beene ſpent in the deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Rules and Orders of their houſe.</p>
            <p>Another excellent Order was made by their Lordſhips, that once every weeke, a <hi>Committee</hi> appointed for
<pb facs="tcp:55081:5"/>
that purpoſe, that ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe and perfect the Clarkes notes, and that at the end of every Session, all the orders of that Session ſhould bee ingroſſed in vellam, and fairely bound up, which courſe firſt began in the time, when my worthy friend Maſter <hi>Henry Elſynge</hi> that moſt induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and able Gentleman, was Clarke of that houſe, and hath continued ever ſince; whereas before that time all their Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls (of which the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent are from the begining of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight) are in paper,
<pb facs="tcp:55081:5"/>
as are thoſe of the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe, but more fairely written.</p>
            <p>If to this care of perfecting of the Iournalls of the houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> there were ſome proviſion made by that houſe, for the ſafe preſerving of them, anſwerable to that which the Lords have, whoſe Clarke hath a houſe belonging to him, and his ſucceſſors, where all their Records are kept to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, the Iournalls and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe, would not (as now they may) come to the hands of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors
<pb facs="tcp:55081:6"/>
or Adminiſtrators, and bee removed to and fro in hazard of being loſt, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and defaced, as is well knowne that ſome of them have beene, and that in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the greateſt moment, whereby the Common wealth may receive great prejudice if it be not prevented, which my humble propoſitions, I do (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with this Treatiſe) in all humility ſubmit to the great wiſdome of that honourable Aſſembly, by whoſe favor this is publiſhed:</p>

                  <p>PUblique <hi>Bills</hi> are in due courſe to be preferred in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and paſſing before private: and of publique, ſuch as concerne the ſervice of God and good of the Church. Secondly, ſuch as concerne the Common-wealth, in which are included ſuch as touch the perſon, revenue, or houſhold of the King, Queene or Prince, and they ought ſpecially to be preferred in paſſing. Laſtly, private Bills ſhould bee offered to be read and paſſed in ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as they were preferred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55081:13"/>
There have beene oftentimes orders in the houſe, that after nine of the clocke, when uſually the houſe groweth to bee full, they ſhould not bee troubled with the reading of any private Bill: And towards the end of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when there remaineth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bills in the houſe undiſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, there hath beene a ſpeciall <hi>Committee</hi> appointed to take a ſurvey of them, and to Marſhall them by their titles in ſuch order as they ſhould thinke fit; they ſhould bee preferred to their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, having reſpect to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the matter which they concerne.</p>
                  <p>It hath at ſometimes beene or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that every one that prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a private Bill ſhould pay five pound to the poore, which was
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55081:14"/>
                     <hi>done</hi> 43. <hi>Eliz. towards the end of the Parliament when they were troubled with much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> but it holdeth not in other Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Treatiſe de modo tenend. Parliamet.</hi> which I have ſeene exemplified under the great Seal of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the ſixt of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, teſtifying the ſame to have beene ſent into <hi>Ireland</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, for a forme of holding Parliaments in that Kingdome, of which I have a copy there is (touching the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of preferring of <hi>Bills</hi>) this clauſe found.</p>
                  <p>Petitiones ſuntaffilate ſicut delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur, &amp; ſic per or dinem leguntur &amp; reſpondiantur, ſed prime deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minentur quae ad guerram perti

                  <p>But the Speaker is not preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to any of theſe rules for the prefering of Bills to bee read or paſſed, but is left to his owne good diſcretion (except he ſhall bee eſpecially directed by the houſe to the contrary) and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee bee earneſtly preſſed by the houſe for the reading of ſome one <hi>Bill</hi>; yet if he have not had convenient time to read the ſame over, and to make a breviat
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55081:15"/>
thereof for his memory; the Speaker doth claime a priviledge to deferre the reading thereof to ſome other time.</p>
                  <p>And thus much touching the order of preferring of <hi>Bills,</hi> to be read or paſſed. Now followeth touching the reading or paſſing of them.</p>

                     <hi>Tertia Seſſione</hi> 1. <hi>Parliament. Iac Reg.</hi> It was ordered that the

                     <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees</hi> which amended the <hi>Bill,</hi> ſhould likewiſe amend the Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at in the principall matters for the caſe and direction of the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</p>
                  <p>When hee hath thus opened the effect of the <hi>Bill</hi> he declareth to the houſe that it <hi>is the firſt reading of the Bill,</hi> and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth the ſame againe to the Clarke.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bill</hi> containing the Kings generall pardon hath but one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Lords houſe, and one below: The reaſon is, becauſe the ſubject muſt take it as the King will give it, without any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration: and yet many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are taken at the reading thereof, for that it is not ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable as in former times.</p>
                  <p>The like of the <hi>Bill</hi> of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55081:16"/>
granted by the Clergie.</p>
                  <p>That day that the Speaker be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing approved by the King, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth downe into the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe to take his place, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is to read for that time on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one <hi>Bills,</hi> left unpaſt the laſt seſſions, &amp; no more, to give him ſeiſin as it were of his place, 39. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 27. <hi>Octo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The uſuall courſe is to ſpend the morning before the houſe grow full in the firſt readings, and to defer the ſecond or third reading till the houſe grow full.</p>
                  <p>At the firſt reading of the <hi>Bill</hi> it is not the courſe for any man to ſpeak to it, but rather to conſider of it, &amp; to take time til the ſecond reading; yet it is not altogether without preſident that a <hi>Bill</hi> hath beene ſpoken for, and againſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55081:17"/>
the firſt reading, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldome, and onely in caſes where the matter of the <hi>Bill</hi> is apparently inconvenient and hurtfull to the Common-weale, and ſo not fitting to trouble the houſe any longer; but at the firſt reading no man in ordinary courſe ſhould ſpeake to any one part of the <hi>Bill,</hi> or for any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for thereby it is implied that the body of the <hi>Bill</hi> is good, which till the ſecond reading doth not regularly come to the triall.</p>
                  <p>If any <hi>Bill</hi> originally begunne in the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe upon the firſt reading happen to bee deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to and fro, and that upon the debate the houſe do call for the queſtion, it ought to be not <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bill ſhall be ſecondly read,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:55081:17"/>
for ſo it ought to bee of ordinary courſe, but <hi>whether it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected</hi> in this ſort <hi>As many as are of opinion that this Bill ſhall be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> (ſay yea) <hi>As many as are of the contrary mind</hi> (ſay no) and the greateſt number of voices ſhall carry it, 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 17. <hi>November. The Bill againſt unlawfull hunting.</hi> 5. <hi>Seſſ. Iac. Reg.</hi> 25. <hi>October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a Bill comming from the Lords bee ſpoken againſt, and preſſed to be put to the queſtion upon the firſt reading, the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in favour and reſpect thereto, ſhould not make the queſtion for the rejection, as in Bills originally begunne in the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe upon the firſt reading, but ſhould firſt make the queſtion for the ſecond reading: And if that bee denied, then for rejection. <hi>This
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55081:18"/>
courſe was uſually held by Sergeant</hi> Phillips <hi>when he was Speaker.</hi> But uſually when any ſuch debate is upon the firſt reading of a <hi>Bill,</hi> the Speaker doth forbeare to make any queſtion at all thereupon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be much preſſed thereto, for that it were fit better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it before it be put to ſuch a hazard.</p>
                  <p>If the queſtion for the rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bee made, and the greater voice be to have it rejected, the Clarke ought to note it rejected in his journall, and ſo to indorſe it upon the backe of the Bill, and it ſhall bee no more read; if the voice be to have the Bill retained it ſhall have his ſecond reading in courſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is againſt the ordinary courſe that the ſame Bill ſhould be read
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55081:18"/>
more then once in one day, yet for ſpeciall reaſons it hath beene ſuffered, that private Bill have beene in one day read twice</hi>; As in the aforeſaid caſe of Sir <hi>Thomas Perrot</hi> though it were a private Bill; ſo was it likewiſe done in the Bill for the aſſurance of lands given by Maſter <hi>Sutton</hi> for charitable uſes, becauſe he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken then extreame ſick, and that it was doubtfull whether hee might live while the Bill might have his paſſage in ordinary courſe.</p>
                  <p>And it is likewiſe done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when the houſe lacketh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buſineſſes wherein to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves, eſpecially if the <hi>Bill</hi> be of no great importance, howſoever it is never but upon motion and ſpeciall order.</p>
                  <p>When ſpeciall <hi>Committees</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55081:19"/>
appointed for the drawing of ſome one ſpeciall Bill, preſent the ſame ready drawne unto the houſe: it hath beene often ſeen that the ſame Bill hath beene not onely twice read, but ordered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to bee ingroſſed the ſame day <hi>as it was in the</hi> Bill <hi>againſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ſeales,</hi> 23. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 16. <hi>Feb. And in the Bill againſt diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Queene</hi> 4. <hi>Martii of the ſame Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is it without preſident that a Bill hath beene thrice read and paſſed in the ſame day; <hi>as was the Bill of recognition of his Majeſties title which came from the Lords,</hi> 1. <hi>Iac. Reg. Seſſ.</hi> 1. but this is a preſident that ſtandeth alone, and in that caſe it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that the Bill might not be returned to the Lords without a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55081:19"/>
copy, firſt taken thereof by the Clarke to bee reſerved in the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe.</p>

                  <p>A <hi>Bill</hi> may bee preferred to be ſecondly read the next day after the firſt reading, but the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall courſe is to forbeare for two or 3. daies, that men might have more time to conſider upon it, except the nature of the buſineſſe be ſuch that it requireth haſte.</p>
                  <p>After the Bill is ſecondly read, the Clarke as before in humble manner delivereth the ſame to the Speaker, who againe readeth the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55081:20"/>
Title and his Breviat as hee did upon the firſt reading, which done, hee declareth that it was now the ſecond reading of the <hi>Bill,</hi> and then hee ought to pauſe a while, expecting whether any of the houſe will ſpeake to it, for before the Speaker hath ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the ſtate of the <hi>Bill,</hi> no man ſhould offer to ſpeake to it; and then and not before is the time when to ſpeake.</p>
                  <p>If after a pritty diſtance of time no man ſpeake againſt the Bill for matrer or forme, he may make the queſtion for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſing thereof, if it be a Bill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally exhibited into the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe if divers ſpeak for the Bill without taking excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the forme thereof, hee
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55081:20"/>
may make the ſame queſtion for the ingroſing. The like queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the ingroſing ought to bee made, if the greater voice bee that the <hi>Bill</hi> ſhall not be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for it were to no end further to delay the proceeding of the <hi>Bill</hi> if there bee no exception ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the matter or forme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but upon the ſecond reading, and after the Speaker hath dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the ſtate thereof, the houſe doth uſually call for the comit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Bill,</hi> and then if any man will ſpeake againſt it either for matter or forme, he ought to be heard.</p>
                  <p>After the firſt man hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Speaker ought to reſt a while expecting whether any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man will ſpeake thereto, ſo ought he likewiſe to doe after e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55081:21"/>
ſpeech ended, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth that the debate is at an end, hee ought then to make the queſtion for the committing thereof in this ſort.</p>
                  <p>As many as are of opinion that this Bill ſhall bee committed ſay (<hi>yea.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>And after the affirmative voice given, <hi>as many as are of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion ſay</hi> (no.)</p>
                  <p>And hee ought by his eare to judge which of the voices is greateſt, if that be doubtfull, the houſe ought to bee divided tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the manner, whereof there ſhall bee more ſaid in another place.</p>
                  <p>If upon diviſion of the houſe it appeares that the numbers are equall, the Speaker hath the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting voice upon all queſtions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:55081:21"/>
If it appeare that the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voice bee the greater, then ought hee to put the houſe in minde touching the naming of <hi>Committees,</hi> which is done in this ſort.</p>
                  <p>Every one of the houſe that liſt may call upon the name of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of the houſe to be a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,</hi> and the Clarke ought in his journall to write under the title of the Bill the name of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſo called upon, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of ſuch whoſe names (in that confuſion) he can diſtinctly heare, and this hee ought to doe without partiality either to thoſe that name, or to the party named. But touching the naming of <hi>Committees,</hi> and their duties, more ſhall bee ſaid in another Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:55081:22"/>
But hee that ſpeaketh directly againſt the body of the Bill, may not be named a <hi>Committee,</hi> for he that would totally deſtroy will not amend.</p>
                  <p>When a convenient number of <hi>Committees</hi> are named, then ought the Speaker to put the houſe in minde to name time and place, when and where the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees</hi> may meete, which the Clarke ought likewiſe to enter into his journall booke, and when the houſe is in ſilence, he ought with a loud voice to read (out of his booke) the <hi>Committees</hi> names, and the time and place of the commitment, that the <hi>Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees</hi> may take notice thereof.</p>
                  <p>After a <hi>Bill</hi> which is ſent from the Lords hath beene twice read, the queſtion ought to bee for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55081:22"/>
the Commitment, if it be denied to be committed, it ought then to be read the third time, and then the next queſtion ought to be for the paſſage and not for the ingro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as it is where the <hi>Bill</hi> origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally beginneth in the lower houſe, <hi>for Bills which come from the Lords come alwaies ingroſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This queſtion for the paſſage ſhould in ordinary courſe be then made when the <hi>Bill</hi> is denied to be committed, but not till the Bill have beene read the third time.</p>
                  <p>If that queſtion for paſſage be deferred till another day, it hath beene much doubted whether it may then bee then offered to the paſſage; but upon debate of this point after many arguments to and fro, <hi>Anno 27. Eliz. 18. Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55081:23"/>
by the opinion of Sir Francie Walſingham, then one of the houſe, and by order of the whole houſe it was agreed it might be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Bill <hi>then in queſtion was the</hi> Bill <hi>againſt fraudulent conveian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Fol. 85. &amp; 86. in the Clarkes booke for that yeare, ſo it was done 1. Seſſ. 1. Parliament. Iac. Regis for the</hi> Bill <hi>of hunting.</hi> But this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident is not ſo ſafe, for the houſe conſidering that oftentimes the <hi>Bill</hi> is denied to bee committed upon utter diſlike thereof, after it hath beene long debated; and yet if that rule ſhould hold, there may be a time picked out of great diſadvantage to the houſe to put it to queſtion for the paſſage.</p>
                  <p>In the debating of <hi>Bills</hi> in the houſe no man may ſpeake twice in one day, except the Bill bee
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55081:23"/>
oftner read then once, and then a man may ſpeake as often as the Bill is read, otherwiſe it is at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, or when in the houſe the debate ariſeth upon ſome motion concerning the order of the houſe; but touching the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking, and what orders ſhall be obſerved therein, more ſhall be ſaid elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Committes</hi> have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved touching the <hi>Bill,</hi> and the amendments thereof; one of them by the conſent of al the reſt ought to make report thereof to the houſe, opening the ſubſtance of the things amended, and the reaſons thereof; which done, hee ought to bring the <hi>Bill</hi> ſo amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Clarke, and to ſtand by the Clarke all the while that the Clarke is reading of thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55081:24"/>
and ought to helpe the Clarke in reading of the ſame in caſe it be difficult to bee read, which falleth out very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by reaſon of interlineing or ill writing.</p>
                  <p>The Clarke ought to read e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very amendment and interline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice, that ſo it may have as many readings as the reſt of the <hi>Bill</hi> hath had, and very many times it will fall out that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineing and amendments ſo read by the Clarke, will of it ſelfe (without reading of the clauſe going before or following) bee no ſenſe, yet notwithſtanding the Clark ought only to read the new amendments without med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with any of the reſt of the Bill, for it is intended that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter hath declared to the houſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55081:24"/>
the reaſon of the amendment, and the connexion thereof to the reſt of the Bill to make it ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>And it hath ſometimes beene permitted (when the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have beene many, and ill written) that the whole Bill hath beene firſt read, and <hi>then the alterations by</hi> themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bill</hi> of hoſtile Lawes. 3. Seſſ. 5. Parliamen. Iac. Reg. 4. Iunii 1607.</p>
                  <p>After the amendments thus read, the Clarke ought to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Bill unto the Speaker, who (<hi>holding the ſame in his hand</hi>) ought againe to read the Title thereof, and to put the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether or no it bee the pleaſure of the houſe that the Bill thus amended ſhall be put to the queſtion for ingroſſing, and then
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55081:25"/>
ought to pauſe a while, expecting whether any man will ſpeake to it or no; for it is as free for any man to ſpeake againſt the Bill at this time, though it hath paſſed the approbation of the <hi>Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees,</hi> as it was at the ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before the ſame was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                  <p>And after the debate is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Speaker ought to put the queſtion for ingroſſing.</p>
                  <p>If the greater number of voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be that the Bill ought not to be ingroſſed, the Clarke ought to make an entry in his journall, that the ſame was <hi>daſhed,</hi> and ſo ought hee likewiſe to note upon the backe of the Bill, and the day when. If the voice be to have it ingroſed, it is the office of the Clarke to do it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55081:25"/>
It is alwaies to bee obſerved that when the Bill is ingroſed, the Clarke ought to indorſe the title thereof upon the backe of the Bill and not within the Bill in any caſe.</p>
                  <p>So ought likewiſe ſuch Bills as come from the Lords to have Titles ingroſſed upon the backe of the Bill, and not within: In defect whereof, divers Bills com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from them, have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to bee amended, <hi>As may appear by the journalls</hi> 27. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 19. <hi>Decem.</hi> 13. <hi>E.</hi> 27. <hi>May,</hi> 39. <hi>E.</hi> 24. <hi>Octob.</hi> 4. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Parliament. lac. Reg.</hi> 5. <hi>Maii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Bill as it is Amended by the <hi>Committees</hi> ought to remaine with the Clarke for his warrant, and it is not an ordinary courſe to cauſe the Bill ſo amended to bee
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55081:26"/>
fairely written for the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſing thereof; yet hath it been ſeene that a Bill ill written in the amendments hath beene retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the <hi>Committees</hi> to bee fairely written, and by them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the houſe; and upon the reading thereof ingroſed, 27. <hi>Eliz. fo.</hi> 91. <hi>in the journall.</hi> At ſometimes it hath beene ordered that a Bill ſo written ſhould bee proceeded in as a new Bill, 23. <hi>Eliz</hi> 28. <hi>Feb.</hi> 27. <hi>Eliz. fo.</hi> 91. <hi>in the clarkes booke</hi> or journal.</p>
                  <p>After a Bill hath beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and is reported, it ought not in an ordinary courſe to bee committed, but either to bee daſhed or ingroſed; and yet When the matter is of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it is ſometimes for ſpeciall reaſons ſuffered: But then uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55081:26"/>
the recommitment is to the ſame <hi>Committees. The</hi> Bill <hi>againſt the Marſhall ſea,</hi> 3. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Iac.

                  <p>For the moſt part, the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker putteth not any one Bill to the paſſage by it ſelfe alone, but ſtaieth till there bee divers Bills ready ingroſed for the third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and when he hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient number (which may bee five or ſix, rather leſſe then more) then hee giveth notice to the houſe that he purpoſeth the next day to offer ſome Bills to the paſſage, and deſireth the houſe to give ſpeciall attendance for that purpoſe, and then the day following he doth accordingly put them to the third reading.

                  <p>When the Bill is read the third time, the Clarke delivereth it to the Speaker, who readeth the Title thereof, and openeth the effect of the <hi>Bill,</hi> and telleth them that the <hi>Bill</hi> hath now beene thrice read, and that (with their favours) hee will put it to the queſtion for the paſſing, but pauſeth a while, that men have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeake thereto, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the third reading the matter

                  <p>It hath beene much doubted, whether when a <hi>Bill</hi> is in debate for the paſſage, it ought not to receive the reſolution of the houſe the ſame day wherein it is firſt offered to the paſſage, but there have of late been ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, where the caſe being of ſome importance, and the debate growing long, the argument hath beene put over till the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,

in which caſe hee that hath already ſpoken to the <hi>Bill</hi> the fiſt day, may not againe ſpeake the ſecond, no more then he may ſpeake twice in one day where the argument is not defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to another day.</p>

                  <p>It hath beene ſeene that two Bills being apt to bee joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, have by order of the houſe, after they have beene twice read, ordered to be ingroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as one Bill, and ſo paſſed, which is ſomewhat ſtrange, for that both being made into one Bill, it is thereby become a new Bill; nevertheleſſe it was ſo done <hi>in two</hi> Bills <hi>concerning Treaſon,</hi> 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 26. <hi>Apr.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>A Noble Lord, whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was attainted of murther, (and thereby his bloud corrupted) made ſuite to the Queene to bee reſtored in bloud by Parliament, which ſhee inclined unto, and in declaration
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55081:50"/>
of her good liking thereof, ſigned his <hi>Bill</hi> ingroſed, which paſſed the Lords houſe, and was ſent downe to the <hi>Commons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Bill</hi> upon the ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by ſome was impugned, through miſtake of the perſon, and by ſome others, for that there wanted a Proviſo for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſors from his Father and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>To the firſt, it was anſwered, that ſeeing her Majeſty had ſigned the <hi>Bill,</hi> no doubt ſhe was ſatisfied touching the perſon, and hee being a yong Noble man there was great hope of him.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, that if the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (which was already in the <hi>Bill</hi>) were not ſufficient, there might be other proviſion.</p>
               <p>The Bill was committed, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55081:51"/>
the <hi>Committees</hi> thought to adde a Proviſo to barre the Lord, that he ſhould not take advantage of any errors in any fine or other conveiance by his Father or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, but ſhould bee in that caſe as though his bloud were not reſtored, in which ſtate hee can bring no writ of error: The occaſion of which Proviſo grew chiefely, for that the Lords had within few daies before in this Seſſion daſhed a Bill that paſſed in the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe for the helping of ſuch errors; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they thought it dangerous to give that ſcope to any man that ſhould be reſtored in bloud; and therefore they added ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo both in this Bill and other Bills of the like kind.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Lord endeavoured
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55081:51"/>
by his councell to ſatisfie the <hi>Committee,</hi> that the ſaving in the Bill was ſufficient without a new Proviſo; but they being not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied therewith, he procured a meſſage from the Lords to the <hi>Commons,</hi> that the Bill might paſſe in ſuch ſort as was ſigned by the Queene without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which they thought could not bee made without the conſent of her Majeſty, which meſſage was ſent after the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees</hi> had agreed upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo, and reported the ſame to the houſe. The <hi>Commons</hi> tooke this manner of dealing to be very ſtrange, not having heretofore received any ſuch meſſage from the Lords tending to preſcribe them what they ſhould do in the actions of that Councell, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55081:52"/>
notwithſtanding that meſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to proceed as they had begun.</p>
               <p>The next day the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured another meſſage from the Lords, deſiring a meeting and conference with the <hi>Commons</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, which meſſage the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> conceiving it to be ſtrange to be in this manner preſſed, they gave the Bill a third reading, and the new Proviſo as the courſe is, &amp; ſo ſent up the Bill to the Lords with the Proviſo annexed, with one other Bill.</p>
               <p>Herewith the Lords were greatly moved, and the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone ſent a meſſage to the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe by Mr. Juſtice <hi>Munſon,</hi> and Sergeant <hi>Barham,</hi> that ſome of them ſhould come to ſpeake with certaine of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55081:52"/>
Lords in ſuch matters as they had to ſay to them, &amp; to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> houſe; according to which meſſage certaine of the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe were appointed, and did give attendance on the morrow morning between 8. and nine of the clocke in the painted cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſending in word by the Uſher of their being there.</p>
               <p>The Lords, after a great pauſe, at laſt came fotrh into the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted chamber; the number of them were many, and the perſons of the principall Noblemen of that houſe, after they had taken their places at a long table, and uſed ſome conference amongſt themſelves, they called for thoſe of the Commons houſe, to whom the Lord Treaſurer in the name of all the reſt preſent and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55081:53"/>
abſent, ſaid in effect;</p>
               <p>That the Lords of the upper houſe could not but greatly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the dealing of the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe in their paſſage of that <hi>Bill,</hi> eſpecially for that they had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Bill with a Proviſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, notwithſtanding their ſundry meſſages ſent to them in his favour; and laſtly, one meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to have conference with them for reſolution of ſuch doubts as were moved; wherein they tooke themſelves greatly touched in honour, and thought that the Commons houſe did not uſe that reverence towards them as they ought to doe: The cauſe beſides, (hee ſaid) was ſuch as they ſaw no reaſon why the Commons houſe ſhould proceed in that order, for the Bill being
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55081:53"/>
ſigned by her Majeſty (hee ſaid) none might preſume to alter or adde any thing to it without the aſſent of her Majeſty, which they for their parts durſt not to doe; for proofe whereof he ſhewed the Committees <hi>ſundry proviſoes in King</hi> H. 8 <hi>time annexed to the like</hi> Bill <hi>ſigned by the King,</hi> infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereby that none might paſſe otherwiſe; moreover he ſaid that by the opinion of the Judges which were in the upper houſe; the ſaving which was in the <hi>Bill</hi> was ſo ſufficient as there needed no addition of ſuch Proviſo as the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe have annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore required them to know what reaſons did lead them to proceed in this order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This and ſome other large ſpeeches being uttered to this

end the</hi> Committees <hi>anſwered,</hi> that their commiſſion was onely to heare whit their Lordſhippes would ſay, they would returne and make report to the Houſe, and ſo attend upon them againe with anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When this was reported to the</hi> Commons <hi>houſe, it moved them all greatly, and gave occaſion of many arguments and ſpeeches, all' generally miſliking that kind of dealing with them, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> their liberty much trenched on in three points: One that they might not alter or adde to any <hi>Bill</hi> ſigned by the Queene; Another that any conference ſhould be looked for, the <hi>Bill</hi> remaining with them, except themſelves ſaw cauſe to deſire it: And the third, to yeeld a reaſon why they paffed the <hi>Bill</hi> in that ſort.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:55081:54"/>
After all theſe things were ſufficiently debated, an anſwer was agreed upon to bee returned to the Lords by the ſame <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,</hi> and they gave their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon the ſame Lords in the ſame place, to whom was ſaid in effect, by one of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,</hi> and by the conſent of the reſt,</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they were very ſory, that their Lordſhips had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuch an opinion of the houſe as though they had forgotten their duty to them, praying their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to thinke that the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe did not want conſideration of the Superiority of their honorable eſtate, in reſpect of their honorable calling, which they did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with all humbleneſſe, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting that they would yeeld unto their Lordſhips all dutifull reſpects, ſo far as the ſame was not prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to the liberties of their houſe, which it behooveth them to leave to their poſterities in the ſame free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome they have received them.</p>
               <p>And touching the particular caſe, the manner of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings (as they thinke) hath not bin any waits undutifull or unſeemly.</p>

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:55081:55"/>
For the <hi>Bill</hi> being ſent from their Lordſhips to the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe received there (within little ſpace) two readings, and becauſe upon the ſecond reading, ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections were made to let the courſe of the <hi>Bill,</hi> the houſe thought fit to commit it, which doth ſhew that they had no diſpoſition to overthrow the <hi>Bill,</hi> but to further it, both in reſpect of her Majeſties ſignature and that it came paſſed from their Lordſhips; and whether the Lord whom it concerned had cauſe or not to thinke himſelfe favourably uſed in being heard by the <hi>Comittees,</hi> with his learned council they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to their Lordſhips judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. That after the <hi>Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees</hi> report of their doings the houſe gave the <hi>Bill</hi> a third reading, and ſo paſſed the ſame in ſuch ſort as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55081:56"/>
now their Lordſhips heare it not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their ſundry meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the contrary. And laſtly, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their meſſage of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, They ſaid they could not otherwiſe have done without breach of their liberties, for they tooke the order of Parliament to bee that when a <hi>Bill</hi> is paſſed in either <q>houſe, that houſe wherein the <hi>Bill</hi> remaineth may deſire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the houſe that paſſed the <hi>Bill,</hi> if they thinke good, but not otherwis;e;</q> and this <hi>Bill</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the Lords to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> houſe, they might deſire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but not their Lordſhips, the <hi>Bill</hi> passing from themſelves.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the manner of their proceedings touching the matter wherein they have procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>in that they annexed a</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55081:56"/>
                  <q>to this <hi>Bill,</hi> the ſame being ſigned with her Majeſties hand, they thought they might lawfully do it without offence to her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, taking her ſignature to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a recommendation of the cauſe to both the houſes, without which they could not treate of any <hi>Bill</hi> of that nature, the houſe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby concluded, but that they might alter or adde any thing that ſhould be thought meet either for her Majeſty or the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</q>: which proviſo they have delivered upon good conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not haſtily and inconſiderately, but upon great and ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons moving them, praying their Lordſhip ſo to conceive it: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe to declare the reaſons in <q>particular to their Lordſhips as they were required on that part,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55081:57"/>
the houſe deſired their Lordſhips to beare with them, for that were to yeeld an account of their doings of things paſſed in their houſe, which they could not in any wiſe agree unto, being ſo prejudiciall to their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſpeech finiſhed, the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees</hi> were willed by the Lords to returne unto the nether end of the Chamber, and after ſome pauſe and conſultation amongſt the Lords, they called againe the <hi>Committees,</hi> and to them was ſaid by the Lord Treaſurer, that the Lords had conſidered the anſwer that the <hi>Committees</hi> had brought to them from the <hi>Commons</hi> houſe, and touching the firſt part thereof, he ſaid that although through ſuch information as was
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55081:57"/>
given them, they might have cauſe to conceive amiſſe of the houſe in the manner of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, yet becauſe themſelves were the trueſt reporters of their own actions, and the beſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of their owne meanings, the Lords did therefore accept thereof and reſted ſatisfied with the ſame.</p>

three points before remembred which are indeed if they be well conſidered of great weight and importance.</p>
