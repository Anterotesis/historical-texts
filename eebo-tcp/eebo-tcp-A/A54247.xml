            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Certain Perſon in your Parts hath lately troubled himſelf and the World with a Book entituled <hi>An Account of Familiſm as it is revived and propagated by the Quakers</hi>; and this dedicated to <hi>Sr. J. Covert, Knight and Barronet,</hi> &amp;c. How ill he ſpent his time in Writing it, and how unadviſed he was in Publiſhing it, an impartial Peruſal of this ſmall <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> will briefly yet abundantly manifeſt.</p>
            <p>I come not to you for Protection (<hi>a thing he and his Cauſe wanted</hi>) but for Impartality and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; <hi>Truth</hi> is ſufficient to patronize and defend her own Cauſe from the Laſh of <hi>Envy,</hi> without the weak <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> of Humane Force; She gives <hi>Sanctuary</hi> to all that take to her for Refuge, but is all-ſufficient to her own Relief from the deepeſt Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and moſt inveterate Proſecutions of her impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemies. And though the Evil Diſpoſition of

               </gap>vours of Her <hi>Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> to traduce Her; yet her own Pureſt Innocency &amp; Unwearied Patience hath ever in the End broke forth to that clear Conviction of its Oppoſers, as hath prov'd at once both their Confutation and their Shame.</p>
            <p>And let it ſeem no Riddle to you, that I write ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of Truth on our ſide, There is no Objection our <hi>Adverſary</hi> has made to the contrary, we ſhall not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remove. Our <hi>Meaneſs in Quality, Breading, Literature and Fortunes in the World</hi> (badges of Reproach with him) will r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed at the Croſs of Chriſt, and the Simplicity of the Goſpel,</hi> through the Power that Greatneſs and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure have with them, they exclude themſelves.</p>
            <p>But ſince Great and Rich Men have Souls to be ſaved as well as Poor, it is equally their Concern to inform themſelves of that Way which moſt aſſuredly leads to the Reſt that is Eternal. I confeſs the Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Sects</hi> in the World to be a great Diſcouragement, eſpecially when we conſider with what Confidence each Party pleads the Truth and Divine Original of his own Perſwaſion; But Men are not to be ſatisfied
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41057:3"/>
with <hi>Pretence</hi> but <hi>Evidence: Education</hi> is too ſhort, nor will <hi>Tradition</hi> reach far enough to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any Man of the Verity of his Perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>Could the two firſt have done, there had been no need of Relinquiſhing the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> who was neither wanting in <hi>Pretences,</hi> nor an <hi>Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> prejudic'd enough againſt all <hi>Reformation</hi>; And if <hi>Tradition</hi> had been all-ſufficient, the Direction of God's Unerring Grace, and the neceſſary Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Mens Reaſons, might have been ſpared.</p>
            <p>For if Men are to believe what is recommended for true, becauſe Recommended, <hi>and not becauſe True,</hi> we are to believe we know not what, and ſhall be to ſeek ſo far for a Reaſon for the Hope that is in us, that in Reality we can have no other Anſwer to give, <hi>then that ſuch or ſuch told us ſo, and therefore we believe it</hi>: But if the Ground of our <hi>Faith</hi> ought to be more ſure and better founded, it will ſtand us greatly upon to examine, What is the Reaſon we have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to render for our Faith &amp; Hope in God, and that Belief we have of Holy Scripture? If we erre here, our Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is inſecure; and the Danger is, that we ſhall not only one day looſe our Faith, but, which is worſe, <hi>our Souls too.</hi> This neceſſarily brings Man to a more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Search and Teſtimony, ſome <hi>Divine Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in Man, planted by God himſelf, which gives to believe <hi>that God is, and that he is a Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them that fear him.</hi>

            <p>

This is that which has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him the certain Sound and true Reliſh of what God has ever required at his hand, as ſaid the <hi>Prophet Micah, God hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is Good, and what he requires from thee; to do Juſtice, love Mercy, and walk humbly with thy God,</hi> Mic. <hi>6, 8.</hi> In the Pſalms thus, <hi>Thou giveſt thy Mouth to Evil, and thy Tongue frameth Deceit;</hi>

rebel againſt, not loving the Wayes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</hi> The like doth Chriſt in <hi>John,</hi> when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, <hi>that Men would not bring their Deeds to be examined by it.</hi> In all Ages hath the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty more or leſs pleaded his own Cauſe in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all People by this <hi>Divine Principle</hi> of Light, however variouſly denominated; And what ever <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Hope</hi> Man has, not grounded upon the Diſcoveries, Convictions and Directions of <hi>This,</hi> it is <hi>a by-rote Faith, Hope, and Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I beſeech you to whom this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> is more particularly dedicated, to conſider of us, not by <hi>Tradition, Education, Religions eſtabliſht by Human Laws, or Imperial Decrees,</hi> but by that Underſtanding this <hi>Immortal Law and Everlaſting Foundation of Virtue</hi> (as Heathen <hi>Plutarch</hi> calls it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will afford you to judge us by.</p>
            <p>It has been Man's Venturing to wade into the Holy Scriptures without this Divine Principle, that has cauſed ſo many fearful Miſcarriages about Religion. Something in Man prompts him to Religion, but Man being not wholy guided by that which ſo inſpires him with Religious Deſires, haſtily ſpoils all with the Intermixture of his own Fancies and Conceits; and becauſe He is aſſured that What firſt inclined him was Right, he ſticks not to ſtile his own Inventions <hi>Orthodox;</hi> and then Impatient of Contradiction, with a Fury, as great as his Ignorance, endeavours
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41057:5"/>
the Overthrow of what ever ſtands in his Way, and refuſes to receive his Mark in his Forehead, or in his Right Hand. This has occaſioned ſo much Trumpery in Religion; <hi>Ceremonies, Shew, and meer Formality have ſwallowed up the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of It:</hi> Now were Men brought to God's Heavenly <hi>Gift in themſelves, it would reclaim and leaven the Mind, chain the Affections, and bring Religion into Holy and Sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This the firſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> made to be their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Revolt from <hi>Rome</hi>: For though 'tis true, that they charged the <hi>Papiſts</hi> with making God's <hi>Tradition</hi> (the holy Scriptures) <hi>void by their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous dark Traditions</hi>; yet That which begot that holy Loathing of <hi>Rom's</hi> Superſtitions, Idolatries and Will-Worſhip, was God's <hi>Grace</hi> in their Hearts; &amp; their beſt Argument againſt <hi>Rom's</hi> Aſſault was this, <hi>The Scripture which I believe from the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit of God in me, &amp; which I can only underſtand from the Illumination thereof, owns no ſuch thing, and therefore I reject it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such as converſe with <hi>Luther</hi> and his Followers, <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and his Followers, will find this to have

            </p>
            <p>I omit to mention a whole Cloud of Witneſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I intend not to dwell here; only this I would be at, and I intreat you all to weigh it, If any thing can give to underſtand aright, and enable to practiſe thoſe things of God, which it is neceſſary for Man both to know and do, then God's <hi>Light, Grace or Word in the Heart?</hi> What elſe can give us to reliſh the Divine Authority of the Scriptures themſelves, or to believe the Things therein treated of to be undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Truths? Indeed, the Want of This has been a great Occaſion of <hi>Atheiſm</hi>; for Man making, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing and enacting That for Religion, of which People has had no Aſſurance in themſelves: But if they ſhould ſpeak their Hearts, 'tis more probable, They do not believe it, but inſtead thereof deride it, and ſo under a Shew of Religion, live as Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the World.</p>
            <p>To prevent which, and to bring Men to the true Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of what God expects from them, in order to that great Account they are to give unto Him at the Revelation of his Righteous Judgments (when he will judge the Secrets of all Men by Jeſus Chriſt) we do exhort all to Chriſt's <hi>Pure, Unerring Light in the Conſcience,</hi>

            <p>I know, and ſhall alwayes acknowledge, that in the time of Ignorance the Almighty winked, and that in every Age he has expreſſed his Regard to thoſe under the various Forms of Religion ever in the World, who have been Sincere-hearted and of Sober and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Converſation; But I muſt alſo tell you, that by how much the more, <hi>needleſs and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Cuſtoms, Will-Worſhip and Human Religion built upon the dark and uncertain Conjectures of Men, are receeded from,</hi> and the Minds of People engaged in a diligent attendance upon that <hi>Divine Principle which only can clear up their Underſtandings, and give them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Knowledge of the True God, and that Way of Worſhip and Service which may

be moſt acceptable with him,</hi> by ſo much more certain will they be of the Truth of their Religion, in as much as they have over and above all external Record, the Aſſurance of <hi>Unqueſtionable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions</hi> in their own <hi>Conſciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus God, that made Heaven and Earth, knows, we came to receive that Knowledge of him, Which we now expoſe our ſelves to all Hardſhips, to mantain.</p>
            <p>We profeſt God; but like our Neighbours, in Works we denyed him. We worſhipt him after Men's Conceivings, inſomuch that I may ſay, we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipt the Unknown God in a Falſe Way. No doubt but we were ſtockt with the Common Talk of Religion, <hi>but the Croſs of Chriſt we were Strangers to.</hi> His Blood we extolled, <hi>whilſt by Wicked Works we trod it under Foot</hi>; And believ'd our ſelves Saved by it, <hi>Who were Uncleanſed from Sin.</hi> The whole End of His Coming we eſteemed the top of all Love; <hi>but never knew enough of It, truly kindled in our Hearts, whereby to work ſuch Faith and Reſignation, as could give us Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the World.</hi> Thus were we, <hi>Jews</hi>-like Children of God <hi>whilſt we crucifyed the Son of God</hi>; and of the Seed of <hi>Abraham, whilſt the Serpents Seed reign'd</hi>; Heirs of the Kingdom, <hi>yet not born again</hi>; Free, <hi>yet the Bondſlaves of Vanity.</hi> Oh! at this time of day it was that God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Judgments for Sin, <hi>and laid Judgment to the Line, &amp; Righteouſneſs to the Plummet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, the Book of Conſcience was Opened, and great Fear ſurpriſed us, and Deep Sorrow fell upon us,</hi> which brought that ſudden and Strange Change, that made us both the Deriſion of Prophane, and Wonderment of Sober Men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> of the Account of <hi>Familiſm,</hi> for want of more Skill, and Seriouſneſs, calls it the <hi>Hypochondria,</hi> as if it only had been a <hi>Flux of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy</hi> overpowring the Strength of Reaſon, and carrying the Underſtanding captive at the Impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of its Fancies. But having been thus made ſenſible of the Terrors of the Lord for Sin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought into a True Underſtanding of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Worſhip which moſt pleaſe God, ſome of us were conſtrained, and in Conſcience bound, to go forth into the World, and publiſh theſe <hi>Tidings of Judgment for Sin, and Converſion through Righteouſneſs wrought by the mighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God in the Conſcience,</hi> that all might be awakened to try their <hi>Works, Faiths, Worſhips</hi> and <hi>whole Religions, whether they were of God or Men; or they had been doing their own Wills, or the Will of God; that ſo they might be brought to experience God to be a God nigh at hand, reconciled in Chriſt, blotting out Sin, and renewing a Right Spirit within, by which

their Religion might not longer ſtand in the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Men, nor only Education of Parents, but upon the Convictions and Operations of God's Grace in the Conſcience.</hi> And thus is all that Chriſt did without, brought nigh and home to the very Soul. The Seed of the Woman is known to Bruiſe the Head of the Serpent; Chriſt, the Light, and Lamb that taketh away the Sins of the World, not only to take away Sins paſt through Remiſſion, but Cleanſe from the Nature, Root and Ground of Sin, by His Holy Blood, <hi>which ſprinkles all Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that wait and walk in the Light</hi> (the Juſt Man's Path) <hi>from Dead Works, to ſerve the Living Lord God in Uprightneſs for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this Cauſe are We brought out into the World; &amp; behold the <hi>Veſſel</hi> we are embark'd in, our <hi>Lading</hi> and the <hi>Country</hi> we make for! The Veſſel, <hi>Truth</hi>; the Lading, <hi>Faith and Good Works</hi>; Our Souls, the <hi>Paſſengers</hi>; and the Country, <hi>the Land of Everlaſting Reſt.</hi>

            <p>This I could not but preſent you with, that no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of our Enemies may be able to lodge a Falſe <hi>Character</hi> of us and our Principles with you; Though I muſt faithfully tell you, that I ſhould wrong my own Reaſon, as well as your Judgment, and ſpeak againſt my Conſcience too, if I ſhould let in one Thought of this Man's Ability to do us any great Miſchief with you: for, out of no Inſult, but in Real Truth, I take

                  <hi>George Fox</hi> denyes the Words, they were never ſo ſpoken by him, much leſs were they ever intended in that Way our <hi>Adverſary</hi> takes and improves them; For though there be not an <hi>Equality,</hi> yet there is an <hi>Unity,</hi> as teſtifyeth the Scripture; <hi>Let the ſame Mind be in you,</hi>

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:41057:32"/>2<hi>ly.</hi> It may not be improper for us to obſerve, That if one Verſe hath ſuch Variety of <hi>Copies, Readings, Tranſpoſitions</hi> &amp; <hi>Senſes,</hi> as hath been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, beſide what we could yet produce, that they are at a miſerable paſs for an Univerſal, Living, Conſtant and Unerring Rule, who eſteem the preſent Scriptures ſuch, excluſive of the Spirit, which <hi>Time, Variety of Tranſcribers, Tranſlators, Interpreters &amp; Expoſitors have rendred ſo Uncertain.</hi> But if we had been unprovided of all this to our Defence, what has our <hi>Adverſary</hi> to do to charge us with a Diſcontinuance of Water Baptiſm, till he had firſt clear'd his own Opinion from Popiſh Innovation and Invention?

So that admitting of a Command, it muſt be thus read, <hi>Do this till I come, who am the Heavenly Bread, &amp; Fleſh and Blood, that give Eternal Life to them that feed thereon</hi>; which Bread the Apoſtle very well underſtood, when in the foregoing Chapter to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> he thus delivered himſelf, <hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe Men, Judge ye what I ſay, The Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt?

if that was not made good, on the Day of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt,</hi> when ſcoffingly, yet truly (like <hi>Caiaphas</hi> in another caſe) ſeveral Spectators ſaid of the Diſciples,<note rend="inter">

                  <p>In ſhort, The Father's <hi>Kingdom</hi> is <hi>within, Luk.</hi> 17.20. What was that Fruit then that was to be drunk anew in that Kingdom? Certainly it came from himſelf, the true Vine, and muſt be of a Spiritual and Inward Nature, like to the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, If Bread and Wine be but a Sign; And if things ſignified ought to reſemble their Signs; And if Spiritual Bread and Wine moſtly anſwer thoſe Viſible Signs; And if they are to be had in the Kingdom of God; And if the Kingdom of God be within; And that who eat not that Bread, and drink not that Wine, have no Life in them; Then becauſe the Apoſtles had Life Eternal in them, and we a meaſure of the ſame in us, Chriſt, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Bread and Fleſh, and Wine &amp; Blood,</hi> was then and is now come, and conſequently, the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of thoſe good things (as to any Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) were and are at an End: And as there is

                  </p>
                  <p>But here, as in the caſe of Water-Baptiſm, it will be objected, why were they then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards uſed?</p>

They will never ſtand our Enquiry about their Call, which they know, we have great Cauſe to ſcruple, indeed to deny; For all muſt or ſhould know that it was either <hi>Immediate,</hi> or <hi>Mediate</hi> and <hi>Succeſſive.</hi> If <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,</hi> then they muſt neceſſarily confeſs to a Commiſſion upon Inſpiration, &amp; then <hi>Quakers.</hi> If <hi>Mediate</hi> and <hi>Succeſſive,</hi> then either <hi>beſide</hi> the

that Church or People have thereby forfeited all Right thereunto: And as the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion has long enricht the <hi>Popes Coffers,</hi> ſo the Unwary Conceſſions of ſome certain <hi>Proteſtants</hi> thereto, have too evidently given away a great ſhare of that good old Cauſe.</p>

the <hi>Quakers</hi>; For 'tis well known, that in what Country ſoever they live, they follow the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Apoſtles, in Aſſembling together on the firſt Day of the Week: They do it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and reverently. Who moſt prophane that Day, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or the <hi>Sons and Daughters of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>Their Feaſts, Drunkenneſs, Wantonneſs, Gaming,</hi> and other Recreations, as they call them, are ſo many Demonſtrations, to help every common Underſtanding to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in the Point.

'Tis true, the Apoſtles met u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Firſt Day, and not on the Seventh; but as that releaſed us from any pretended Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Seventh,</hi> ſo neither did it confer any Morality upon the <hi>Firſt</hi>; yea, ſo far were they from it, that not one ſpeaks any ſuch thing; but <hi>Paul</hi> much the contrary: <hi>Let no Man judge you in Meats or in Drinks,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I grant, the Apoſtles met on that Day; But muſt it therefore be Moral? Certainly, the Scriptures Silence in this particular muſt either conclude a great Neglect againſt thoſe Holy Men, in not recommending &amp; enjoyning more expreſly <hi>both Water, Bread, Wine and Holy-Dayes in their ſeveral Epiſtles to the Churches</hi>; or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us in our Belief concerning the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarineſs of thoſe things. Let not our <hi>Adverſary</hi> reproach us for not believeing that to be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which was weaning off and vaniſhing in thoſe dayes; but ſoberly conſider, that the Practice of the beſt Men, eſpecially in ſuch caſes, is no Inſtitution, though ſometimes it may be an Example.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I perceive the Prieſt allows <hi>Inſpiration for Tythes,</hi> Though we are <hi>Familiſts, Quakers</hi> and <hi>Phanaticks</hi> for abetting the Doctrine of Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Worſhip of God. O Mercinary, O Hireling and Irreverent Saying! that God ſhould be more concerned for Carnal then Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Things, and inſpire Men about Tythes, and not about Divine Worſhip.

                  <p>I grant that when <hi>Auſtin</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> he deſired Tythes of <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> as I take it, King of <hi>Kent</hi>; But the King's Care of his People, &amp; the Averſeneſs of their humor to all Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, diſappointed the Monk.

And as Murder and Whoredom introduced them, ſo the Cunning and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Clergy have continued them; <hi>For when the Heptarchy became a Monarchy, the Prieſts evermore would thruſt in for a Share with the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi>; and this Wrong Way came Tythes to be the Prieſts Right, as he calls it.</p>
                  <p>But let this pretended Proteſtant anſwer me, if he dare. <hi>Was the Church then degenerated or no? Was it not a Time of Popery? Did not the firſt Martyrs except againſt her? Was it Lawful for Princes to give away other Mens Goods upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count &amp; for the pretended Expiation of their Sins?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Could the giving of them attone? Is it not an acknowlegding of the</hi> Pope's <hi>Power to abſolve? Is it not a buying or bribing off the Guilt of Sin againſt Almighty God, by Gifts to a Mortal Man, and thoſe extorted from poor People too?</hi> Is this proteſtant Doctrine? But above all, <hi>is this inſtituting Tythes upon Inſpiration?</hi> Hell her own ſelf was the Foundereſs of theſe things.

                  <p>'Tis not my Buſineſs to write a Hiſtory; but I recommend to the Inquiſitive Reader, <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff's Remonſtrance, The Plow-Man's Complaint, Chaucer's Plow-Man's Tale, walter Brute,</hi> and <hi>W.

                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall only ſay 1ſt, That they were the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wholly. 2ly, It is now the Peoples Labour, more then the Prieſts Land, that brings the Encreaſe: And Men ought not to be conſtrained to pay thoſe, they never hired; nor to labour for thoſe that profit them not. 3ly, They were given to <hi>expiate Murder and Adultery, and uphold an Idolatrous Clergy,</hi> upon Proteſtant Principles,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41057:43"/>
and therefore to be removed, as were the high Places and Groves, Idololatrouſly dedicated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews.</hi> 4ly, Becauſe it is moſt reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for a Man to believe according to his own Conſcience, &amp; not according to another Man's Conſcience; <hi>It is Unrighteous to perſecute a Man for not maintaining that Religion, which in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience he believes to be falſe,</hi> as wel as that it is the badge of a Falſe Religion to perſecute for Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. 5ly, Though they may be confirmed by ſome Princes, yet conſidering the End to which they were given, to wit, for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a certain ſort of Religious Order, now exploded, whoſe Succeſſors theſe are not (&amp; ſo the ancient Conſtitution broken) we can't ſee any Reaſon why they ſhould remain, unleſs any thing commanded is to be obeyed, becauſe Commanded, and not becauſe in it ſelf Lawful.</p>
                  <p>Two things I cannot but obſerve. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he affirms, <hi>The Clergy of</hi> England <hi>have not a Tenth, much complaining that every one ſnips from them, cujus contrarium verum</hi>; For they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſnip, but ſlice from every Body elſe. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to his Peruſal a <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> entituled, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia comeſta a Belo,</hi> where he will find a very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account of the Revenues of <hi>Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Arch-Deacons, Deans, Canons, Prebends, Rarſons, Vicars, petti-Canons, Singing Men, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſters,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41057:44"/>
Organiſts, Goſpellers, Epiſtlers, Virgers, Chancellers and their Attendents, Delegates, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters and their Clarks. Gentlemen- Apparators, Inferior Apparators, Proctors, &amp;c.</hi> I doubt not but FIFTEEN HUNDRED THOU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAND Pounds a Year, will be the modeſteſt Accompt that Computation will admit of, <hi>which is but double the Revenue that former Monarchs have had for the Maintenance of their Family, Crown and Dignity, their Civil Juſtice, Armies, Navies and coſtly Embaſſyes.</hi> If all this be to reſemble Chriſt Jeſus and his Apoſtles, the Scripture has given us a very wrong Account of him and them.</p>
                  <p>The 2<hi>d.</hi> thing I would obſerve is this, That he has the Ignorance and Confidence to argue from the Super-excellency of Chriſt's Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that of <hi>Moſes; That the Maintenance of the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould proportionably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Maintenance of the Prieſts under the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But certainly he is one of the firſt Men, that made this wilde Interpretation of the Glory of the latter Houſe excelling the Glory of the former, as if Chriſt's Houſe were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or his Glory either. Would he have one outward Temple figure out another? as if Chriſt ſhould bring in another <hi>Levitical</hi> Law to excell that of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Certainly <hi>the New</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>after this Man's rate of Diſputing, muſt be an
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41057:44"/>
outward Structure of material Saphyres, Emraulds, Jaſpers, &amp;c.</hi> But there is a <hi>Pope</hi> and a <hi>Mahomet</hi> in his Belly, whether he knows it or no; For theſe Fleſhly Conceits firſt ſet them to work upon their Pompous Worſhip, neglecting the Holy, Pure, Self-denying &amp; Spiritual Religion of Chriſt Jeſus and his Apoſtles, who neither practiſed nor ſet up any Shadowy and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Worſhip, not ſettling themſelves in Splendid Livings, to lead Eaſy, Quiet and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous Lives. Freely they received, freely they gave; not as our <hi>Adverſary</hi> ridiculouſly underſtands it, <hi>that they gave their Miracles, but ſold their Preaching</hi>: Indeed the Spirit of a Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Anti-Chriſt, who pleads for <hi>State,</hi> under a Self-denying Goſpel. Chriſt's Kingdom is not of this World, and yet he pleads for the Grandeur of a Worldly Worſhip, Miniſtry and Maintenance; we may allow him therefore and his Tribe to be Worldly Chriſtians, <hi>but not true Followers of that Jeſus, who ſaid, when he was in the World, I am not of the World</hi>; which leads me to the next Section concerning the <hi>Miniſtry.</hi>

Bargaining, Stealing their Neighbours Words, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Experiences, not their own, not knowing experimentally whereof they affirm, nor turning Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Righteouſneſs, but perſecuting them that love it, and daubing Sinners with untempered Morter,</hi> are altogether inconſiſtent with it.</p>
                  <p>For their Outward Call, it is too notorious to anſwer. By what <hi>Flatteries, Bribes, and Shifts</hi> ſome of them are ſaid to get their Places.

                  <p>For the <hi>Laying on of Hands,</hi> it is well known to be a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremony; And we read that <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> preached before the Apoſtles laid Hands upon them.

                  <p>To conclude; becauſe our <hi>Adverſary</hi> tells us, that the Church, from the Dayes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles has had a ſucceſſive Apoſtleſhip and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery to confer; whether he will or no, he muſt imply, <hi>that there has been a true Apoſtolical Church ever ſince,</hi>

               <p>That <hi>the Light of the World is God's Love to the World,</hi> I find in <hi>James Nailer's</hi> Book; But that <hi>the Light is not given to any till they come out of the World,</hi> is a direct <hi>Ly to our Principle,</hi> and a putting an abſolute <hi>Forgery upon his Book</hi>; For he ſayes, That God has given his Light to the World, that therein is his Love manifeſted, that ſuch as follow it in its Leadings out of the World, have the Nature of Sons: But Sonſhip is that which cannot be had whilſt in the World's Nature; therefore they are to come out of the World's Wayes, to follow the Light, which viſits Man in the World's Wayes, in order to bring him out of them, and here the true Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is received; ſo that the Son-ſhip and not the Light, is that which cannot be had in the World.
