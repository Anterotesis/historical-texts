            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They are meek and humble, that feel their need of divine answers to their cries, and of divine Help. All men indeed are poor in spiritual regards, but it is the man that does duly <hi>sense</hi> his spiritual poverty, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands himself to <hi>be</hi> and bears himself as a poor man, that is here meant. <hi>Qui nihil altum de se sapit.</hi> His heart is not haughty, nor his eye lofty, and he feels and believes that there is no cause they should.</p>

1. An Aw of the Word of God: that it <hi>commands</hi> &amp; <hi>stills</hi> the hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, that there is a fear of the threatnings, a fear of incurring the penalty of unbelief <hi>of</hi> and disobedience <hi>to</hi> the Word; A fear of neglecting the Commands and losing the Reward proposed in the Word. <hi>Amos 3. 6, 8. Shall a trumpet</hi> (to which the voice of the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet convincing of sin by the word is compared <hi>Isai.</hi> 58. 1. Lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression.) <hi>be blown in the City and the people not be afraid? The Lion hath roared</hi> (i. e. the Invincible irresistable GOD hath threatned judgment by His word) <hi>who will not fear?</hi> It is expected such Reproofs and Threatnings by the word should work an Aw.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A careful solicitude to attend the Direction and Prescript of the Word of God. To give it due entertainment, to have it flourish and prosper. In this sence the word is used, 2. <hi>King. 4. 13. Behold thou hast been</hi> careful <hi>for us with all this care.</hi> It is such a trembling, not as makes men fly from God, but as makes them most careful to subject to the will of God revea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p n="3">3. A making hast to attend the commands of Gods Word. Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing speed without delay to obey the word of God as that which we are afraid to put off or neglect at all. So the word sometimes signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to <hi>run in haste,</hi> or <hi>to run in fear</hi> or <hi>with trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus God here gives the character of those whom He will in favour and mercy look to or upon. And this is to be understood as exclusive of all others, <hi>scil.</hi> that they are these only that God is engaged thus to look upon. He has something else to say to those of a contrary spirit and frame. <hi>Psal. 138. 6. Though the Lord be high, yet hath He respect to the lowly, but the proud he knoweth afarr off.</hi> And this the <hi>Seventy</hi> do directly point to in their rendring this latter clause thus, <hi>Ki epi tina epiblepso all' e epi ton tapeinon &amp;c. And upon whom should I look but upon [or unto] him that is poor &amp;c.</hi> And I have seen an old <hi>English</hi> Translation that renders the words in like manner. <hi>q. d.</hi> Whom else can it be thought I should regard with Favour and set My heart upon, but such as are here characterized? But these I will.

            <p>DOCT. <hi>That whatever may have been the great Works of God in the World, or his signal Dispensations toward any people, yet the standing Tryal of a person's, and so a peoples Acceptation with God, is their being of a poor and contrite spirit, and trembling at His Word.</hi>

            <p>Concl. I. <hi>All the great Things done in the world, they are the work of God.</hi> His hand has made and framed the whole Fabrick of Heaven &amp; Earth. He hath hung out the Globe of this World; hung the Earth upon nothing; drawn over the Canopy of the Heavens; laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the earth in its place; Created that Fountain and Center of Light, Heat, &amp; Influence in this lower World, the <hi>Sun;</hi> together with all the lesser light Bodies, which are for Times, for Signs &amp; for Seasons, the <hi>Moon</hi> &amp; <hi>Stars;</hi> and He hath set &amp; settled the Ordinances for them all. <hi>Psal. 102. 25. Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth, &amp; the Heavens are the work of thy hands.</hi> Jer. 31. 35. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the Sun for a light by day, and the Ordinances of the moon &amp; of the stars for a light by night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which divideth the Sea, when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of Hosts is his Name.</hi> The Seas, the vast Mountains also, and the Wind so undiscernable in its motions, and other strange Meteors, they are His Work. <hi>Amos 4. 13. For lo, He that formeth the mountains and createth the wind, and declareth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treads upon the high places of the earth: the Lord, the God of Hosts is His Name.</hi> Job 37. with 38. Chap. The continued Creation of those Beings that are ever coming <hi>up,</hi> and going <hi>off</hi> the Stage of this world, by a perpetual, orderly Succession and propagation, they are also His Work. <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. The whole Administration of Providence in the Upholding and Government of all created Beings, in a way of highest Wisdom and exact Order, it is <hi>all</hi> His work. All great Revolutions, signal and remarkable Dispensations, Things beyond the ordinary Course and power of Nature, or such as do shew forth the highest strains of Wisdom, Power, Grace or Justice, He doeth them all. <hi>Psal. 74. 12,—17.

Thus signally did God dispence to <hi>Seth,</hi> in whose Family and Race the Worship of God and the visible Adoption and Covenant was continued, <hi>Genes. 4. 26. And to Seth, to him also there was born a son—then began men to call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> Or to be distinguished by calling <hi>upon,</hi> or being called <hi>by</hi> the Name of the Lord: Religious Worship being especially attended in <hi>Seth</hi>'s Family, when lost by others, hence those of his posterity (though they afterward Degenerated) are called the Sons of God, and so distinguished from the Daughters of men, <hi>Genes. 6. 2.

And I took your father</hi> Abraham <hi>from the other side of the floud, and led him throughout all the Land of Canaan and multiplied his seed and gave him Isaac.</hi> Most signal were the Dispensations of God to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> whom God chose out of all People to be a peculiar people to Himself, to bear His Name in the world, to dwell in His presence, to be betrusted with all the Ordinances of His <hi>House</hi> and visible Kingdom, to have God nigh to them in all that which they called upon him for, to work wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and gloriously for them in all their necessities and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. <hi>Exod. 19. 3,—6.

               </gap> for it is a truth that God doth respect such, but they do in <hi>Reason;</hi> for it's admirable that the <hi>Highest</hi> and the <hi>lowest</hi> should thus meet. <hi>Psal. 8. 3, 4. When I consider thy Heavens, the work of thy fingers, the Moon and Stars which thou hast ordained: What is man that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man that thou visitest him?</hi> The reasons and grounds hereof are</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because <hi>It is the Lords's Free will and good pleasure.</hi> This is the bottom cause He is pleas'd thus to doe wonderfully. <hi>Mat. 11. 25, 26.—and hast revealed them unto babes: even so

The poor have their eyes <hi>unto</hi> and <hi>upon</hi> the Lord, and therefore the Lord will have <hi>His</hi> eyes upon <hi>them.</hi> In them there is the most free and open passage for the Lord to come into their souls with all His Power, Authority, Sovereignty, Glory and Grace. True Contrition, Humiliation and Poverty of spirit opens the heart to God to let Him in, to come and do all for the soul as belongs to a God to doe. but on the Contrary, Height of Spirit and Unbrokenness of heart with-holds that due re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

With the merciful thou wilt shew thy self merciful, with an upright man thou wilt shew thy self upright, with the pure thou wilt show thy self pure, and with the froward thou wilt shew thy self froward For thou wilt save the afflicted people, but wilt bring down the high looks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Because <hi>Those do most gladly look</hi> to, <hi>and depend</hi> upon <hi>the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, in whom God is well pleased.</hi> Whence they thus improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and honouring Him, God hath a gracious respect to them for His sake.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>How God doth look upon and accept the humble and lowly.</hi> It is with special and peculiar Grace: He looks Favourably on them.

in searching and trying Times <hi>Psal. 9. 12. When He makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition for bloud, He remembers them: He forgets not the cry of the</hi> humble.

This would be a meanes to keep wrath off the Land, even that which has been threatned.</p>
            <p>Here Consider, 1. What we have <hi>done.</hi> 2. What we have <hi>suffered</hi> for want of this humble spirit: Both which should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and abase us.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>What we have</hi> done <hi>for want of this spirit.</hi> The want of this has been the cause of all our errors, of all provoking errors in Doctrine, Worship, in Administration both Civil and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical, and in Conversation.

him. 2. <hi>Chron. 32. 24. 25. In those dayes Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed to the Lord: and He spake unto him and He gave him a signe: But Hezekiah rendred not again according to the benefit done unto him: for his heart was lifted up.</hi> If there be any such with us who have their spirits upon any account whatsoever thus raised too high, I wish they may know themselves, and have more of the Spirit of Christ; as in other particulars, so in that of the Meekness and Lowliness of His mind. Finally, let it not be offensive if I mention it as a thing worthy of Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, Whether this Government or the Persons managing it, have not in some instances born themselves too high, assumed more than God hath given them full ground for: and if it should be so, no doubt but that may have been a provocation, and no wonder if God threaten to bring you low.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hence <hi>We have not been subject to Order and Government, civil, ecclesiastical or domestical.</hi> We have been a Corporation that have lived too much in the violation of our own Laws: Of some good Laws we have been too high to bear the Execution of them at the hand of our Neighbours, whether such as were called to see them observed, or such as would secure themselves by them: There has been to much of a lawless, ungovern'd spirit. And for the true Order and Government of Christ in His Church, <hi>that</hi> hath been in some places little practised, in some much withstood, and in others quite overthrown, whilst power and Government hath been fixed in those that should be ruled, and only a liberty to lift up their hands left to the Rulers, and together therewith other Ordinances of Christ have been undervalued and abused. And as for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Government and Order, <hi>that</hi> is in a great Measure lost in <hi>New-England,</hi> as those who undestand what it is, do too too sensibly complain.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Hence <hi>We have set other things in the place of GOD.</hi> We have left God and our <hi>first love</hi> to Him. Through want of true poverty of spirit, we have not maintained that constant feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sense of our need of Him, and so have suffered our selves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and go away from Him, away from that strict and close dependance and communion which was sometimes in Christians. We have not been so earnestly careful to ly alwaies in the arms

of a Gracious Saviour under the full expressions of His Love, but have been slothful and slumbering in carnal rest and ease, hard and loth to be awakned and stirred up to open to Christ and let Him fully in to our souls, as the Spouse. <hi>Cant. 5. 2, 3.—the voice of my Beloved that knocketh, saying, open to me—I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them.</hi> And our hearts have gone after some other thing, some <hi>new</hi> love, some vanity or other, which we have entertained, embraced and set in God's place: and these we have Idolized, set our hearts upon them, and given more than their due to them. Thus we have done to the World, we have fallen down to that, and that hath lifted us up in our minds, wherein we have violated that solemn caution God left with His People to be minded by them when in a rise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition in the World. <hi>Deut. 8. 12. 13, 14.

Nevertheless</hi> (notwithstanding all that was commendable among them, in purity of Doctrin &amp; Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and travel in God's work and service) <hi>I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love.</hi> These inward soul-declensions and decayes, and goings off of the heart from God, were very offensive to him: as <hi>Ezek. 6. 9.

much rather they should take notice of it themselves than hear it from mee. Whatever it be that men have their eyes upon, whether any thing they suppose in themselves, or any thing that hath been done for them, or any priviledge bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, these cannot give them rest and security in God's Favour, and it will be an error to have recourse <hi>to,</hi> or depend <hi>upon</hi> them for divine Protection, while we neglect true humility poverty of spirit and trembling at God's Word.

and like words, be come upon us, is yet a question: but much we have suffered, which we may justly reckon to this account: God has brought many of our fears upon us, because we have been too high to answer His Calls, and we know not what He may doe more therein. <hi>Isai. 66. 4.—and will bring their fears upon them, because when I called none did answer, when I spake they did not hear, but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.</hi> God hath drawn out His sword against us, and hath given it a charge to devour round about our Coasts, and many have fallen down slain by it. God hath blown upon the Labour of our hands, by Blastings, Flouds, Droughts, and losses by Ship-wrecks and otherwayes; and of what hath remained he hath found out continual waies for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursment, to make and keep us empty. God hath sent sore Sicknesses and Pestilential diseases upon us which have sorely wasted us. God hath again and again contended by terrible Fires, which have eat up a great part of our pleasant Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He has also frustrated our expectations and hopes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes: as it is <hi>Ier. 8. 15.

II. <hi>USE. Exhort.</hi> Let this people and every person of us, <hi>get and keep in this frame of spirit</hi> mention'd in the Text and Doctrine, to be <hi>poor and contrite in spirit, and tremble at GOD's Word.</hi> That which you are now exhorted to is, to be true and through Christians, and to keep alwayes in a Christian frame of spirit, or to be eminent in the exercise of Christianity. For this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al poverty and contrition of spirit and trembling at God's Word is to be found no where else, but where true grace is, and where the spirit of Christ dwels and Rules. You are herein exhorted to be Christs true Scholars and followers. <hi>Mat. 11. 29. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi> Phil. 2. 5. <hi>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Iesus.</hi> To <hi>be</hi> and <hi>carry</hi> like Christians indeed.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Motive. <hi>Consider the disadvantage of being without this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> In several respects,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Word you hear will doe you no good.</hi> Pride is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to profiting. <q>It is observed that the ground whereon the <hi>Peacock</hi> that proud bird sits, is barren: the heart where Pride sits is barren.</q> The Word must be received <note place="margin">Watson.</note> in meekness, that it may be savingly efficacious. <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. 21. While men remain in the pride and unhumbledness of their hearts, whatever their professions be, and whatever they may <hi>doe,</hi> the best counsels &amp; cautions will not work kindly upon them. A People will never be brought to do their business throughly with God, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with His Word, till they be brought to such a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling frame. <hi>Ezra. 10. 3. Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God, to put away—according to the counsel of my Lord, and of those that</hi> tremble <hi>at the Commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the Law.</hi> There must be an awful, sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reverential, fiducial fear in all our Transactions with God, otherwise they will be but formal, Hypocritical, vain and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrous; there will be no good effect of the Word of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. The Lord's Words will indeed do good and come to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in those that walk uprightly. <hi>Mich.</hi> 2. 7. But it is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, that his soul which is lifted up, is not upright in him. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. Therefore such will doe nothing to purpose with God, in attending to His Word, let it be spoken never so
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45049:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
plainly, closely, solemnly and frequently. Neither will the Word spoken go down with an unhumbled people, unless it be such as suits them, they not so much desiring that their <hi>wills</hi> should be brought to the <hi>Word,</hi> as that the <hi>Word</hi> should be brought to their <hi>wills.</hi> A sad Instance we have of this <hi>Ier. 43. 1. 2. And it came to pass, that when</hi> Jeremiah <hi>had made an end of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto all the people all the words of the Lord their God, for which the Lord their God had sent him to them even all these Words; Then spake</hi> Azariah <hi>the son of</hi> Hoshaiah, <hi>and</hi> Johanan <hi>the son of</hi> Kareah, <hi>and all the</hi> proud <hi>men, saying unto</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>thou speakest falsly; the Lord our God hath not sent thee to say, goe not &amp;c.</hi> Notwithstanding their solemn profession. <hi>Chapt.</hi> 42. 5, 6. Then they said to Jeremiah, The Lord be a true and faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness between us, if we doe not even according to all things for the which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us, whether it be good or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God to whom we send thee, that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the Lord our God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This will make men that <hi>they will not be afraid when God is displeased with themselves or others:</hi> When sin is committed or Judgement threatned. <hi>Ier. 36. 23. 24. And it came to pass, that when Iehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth, yet they were not</hi> afraid, <hi>nor rent their garments, neither the King nor any of his servants that heard all these Words.</hi> This is from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward stoutness and unsubduedness of heart. Hence many a professor, can be loose in his walk; formal and flighty in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties; careless of the Sabbath; indulge his corruptions; comply far with some sins of the times; neglect the trust and charge committed to him: and yet his heart not smite him, the thoughts hereof do not trouble him, nor make him afraid. And this is a dangerous thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This will <hi>expose us to Misery and Destruction.</hi> If we should have no other Molestation come upon us any way, yet if we be without this spirit of awful fear and trembling before God, we shall be like enough quickly to sink in our own ruines, under the weight of our pride and other corruptions. <hi>Ier.</hi> 44. 10, 11.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45049:17"/>
               <hi>They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my Law, nor in my Statutes that I set before you and before your Fathers. Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Iudah.</hi> For in setting up our selves, we reject and forsake God. And this People have been told that if they forsake God, God will cast them off for ever. 1. <hi>Chron</hi> 28. 9. <hi>Uzziah</hi>'s self-exaltation emboldned him to venturre upon such things as were the occasion of his destruction. 2. <hi>Chron. 26. 16. But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction, for he transgressed against the Lord, and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn Incense.</hi> A heart not duly subdued will expose men to venture upon such things as will tend to wound their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences dishonour Religion, and procure their calamity. <hi>All the world can never keep that man</hi> up, <hi>that never seeks to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> his own spirit</hi> low. GOD has not been wont to prosper any People long, however good they were, or however good their cause were, if their spirits have been high, and so shown more of themselves, than of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ, as it is too often with God's people. So true is it which the Holy Ghost saith, <hi>Prov. 29. 23. A mans pride shall bring him low.</hi> and <hi>Chapt. 16. 18. Pride goeth before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and an haughty spirit before a fall.</hi> If <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s heart be lifted up, there is a Dispensation of wrath near. 2. <hi>Chron. 32. 25.—for his heart was lifted up, therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Iudah and Ierusalem.</hi> The loftiness of man shall be made low, God will have it so. <hi>Isai. 2. 11. 17. The lofty looks of man shall be</hi> humbled, <hi>and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed</hi> down, <hi>and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day of the LORD of Hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he shall be brought low, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Mot. Consider <hi>the Advantage of being of this poor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and trembling spirit.</hi> It will be exceeding beneficial many wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This will dispose you <hi>to acknowledge and sanctifie the Name of God under all Dispensations:</hi> under all visitations: To see and own how God is fulfilling His Word; making good His threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threatnings;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45049:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and executing His Judgements He hath foretold, and so to give Him the glory of His work. <hi>Zech. 11. 9, 10, 11. Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dyeth let it dye: and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off, and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with this people. And it was broken in that day: and so</hi> the poor of the flock <hi>that waited upon me</hi> knew <hi>that it was the Word of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This will dispose you <hi>to that Mourning and weeping which we have now need to attend upon God with.</hi> We have reason to make this day, yea these dayes wherein God is afflicting us; and these years wherein we are seeing evil, to be times of Mourning and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The Lord God calls to weeping; that we look over our sins, look unto Christ, whom we have peirced by our sins; and look and goe after God in attendance to His word, weeping and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This will spirit and dispose you <hi>to embrace and practise all those counsels have been given you in the Lord's Name, and from his Word.</hi> To attend all those Duties the Lord requires of you. If the Question be ask't, What does God now look for from us? The Answer is in <hi>Deut. 10. 12. And now; Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all His wayes, and to love Him, and to serve the LORD thy GOD with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</hi> You need not look for any thing in particular from me now. Much hath been plainly spoken from God to this people again and again: God hath told us his mind fully, what He would have us doe, and where our life lies Deut. 32. 46, 47. <hi>Set your hearts unto all the words which I testifie among you this day,—for it is not a vain thing for you: because it is your life.</hi> And if we had but this spirit that I am now pleading for, we should then be ready to rise up to doe the words of the Lord, which we have heard from Him and thereupon to engage in a saving and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work of Reformation. It would raise us to an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temper in Christianity; to be <hi>high</hi> in worth, but <hi>low</hi> in spirit; to doe much for God, and think little of our selves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This will give us <hi>access</hi> to, <hi>and acceptance</hi> with <hi>God in prayer.</hi> Psal. 10. 12. <hi>Arise, O Lord, O God, lift up thine hand, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forget</hi>

And how often hath God refused to hear <hi>our</hi> prayers! But here is a way to have certain Audience at the Throne of Grace. <hi>Psal. 102. 16, 17. When the Lord shall build<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> up Zion: He shall appear in His glory. He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

A People or person become speechless in this respect is near to death. <hi>Pray</hi> therefore we must and ought, and if we would be heard and accepted, we must get our hearts and spirits thus meekly and humbly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. God could not over-look them when thus humbly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Ier. 31. 18, 19, 20. I have surely heard Ephraim bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself thus, Thou hast chastised me and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustom'd to the yoke: Turn thou mee, and I shall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for thou art the Lord my God.

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. This will dispose us to <hi>Patience and enduring under all Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> The heart that is not truly broken and meek'ned, finds it harder to comport with, and bear quietly that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him without flinching one way or other; either on the one hand by succu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
