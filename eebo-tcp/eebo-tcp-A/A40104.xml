            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THERE is nothing new under the Sun, ſaith the wiſeſt of Kings. This, as it is in it ſelfe a certaine truth, ſo it is not more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in any thing then in the Stupendious alterations which Hiſtory in generall doth manifeſt to have happened in Kingdomes and Common-wealths, even from the Flood; the recapitulation whereof would not onely outſwell this bulke, but likewiſe tire the Reader, whoſe curioſity therein may be elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where abundantly ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Many in <hi>England</hi> may perhaps thinke, that the Changes we have ſeen of late years among our ſelves admit of no Preſident. The Pages enſuing will ſhew o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; and that what hath been done of late times in this Nation, hath been in great part formerly preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon Forraigne Stages; yea, within the memory

of Men yet living, if diligent Scruteny were made into the Actings in other Regions, and wherein they have come ſhort of Ours, it may ſeem, by their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed expreſſions, that they regretted the overſlipping of oppertunity.

                        <hi>Wolfgangus Lazius</hi> relates, that out of thoſe <hi>Septentrionall Iſlands</hi> many and great Bands went frequently toward their people, the <hi>Viſi-gothes</hi> who had planted themſelves in <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Oſtrogothes</hi> ſeated in <hi>Illyrico</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> yea, that before the diſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> ſundry of the <hi>Gothes</hi> being as then in <hi>Thracia,</hi> ſeverall <hi>Colonies</hi> removed toward them; Nor were thoſe expeditions undertaken conſtrainedly; but they, allured with the ſucceſſe of their <hi>Compatriots</hi> in forraigne parts, and w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the fame of their exploits, did emulouſly flock unto them; which being obſerved by the then Kings of <hi>Suethes</hi> and <hi>Gothes,</hi> Lawes (for preventing the utter deſertion of the Originall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109514:9"/>
were there enacted, that no perſons abandoning their native ſoile ſhould retaine any inheritance therein; and that (in regard of the uncertainty of the death abroad of ſuch as ſo removed, and for avoiding the intricacy of contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their neareſt of bloud) he, who ſo departed, ſhould be reputed as dead from that very hower, and his neareſt kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man poſſeſſed of the inheritance: And therfore it ſeemes not conſentaneous to reaſon that the Originall Seats ſhould be ſubject to the extraneous <hi>Gothes,</hi> for if the Kings of that people who warred abroad, had retained a power over them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Ancient and Paternall Soil; they would not, probably, have permitted that they who marched under their Standarts, and with them underwent the dangers and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties of forraign Warfare, ſhould have been diſpoſſeſſed of <note place="margin">

                     <p>But leaving theſe things, it is evident from their Authors, that the <hi>Suethes</hi> have anciently been an elective Kingdom, and free to chooſe either a Native or Stranger to poſſeſs the Regal Chair; with this Obligation enjoyned, that the King (who ere he were) ſhould defend the Multitude committed unto him from injury and violence, and ſhould endeavour the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement and obſervation of their Laws, ancient Cuſtoms, rightfull Conſtitutions and Priviledges, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived cuſtom in all well regulated Nations: Notwithſtanding which freedom of Election, they alwaies made choice of the Son to ſucceed the Father, where they found the Rayes of Vertue correſponding to the Royall Dignity, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Laws of <hi>Suethen,</hi> and the continued Annals of that Regions Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>The truth hereof may appear by the Royall Progeny of <hi>Ericus Sanctus,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Canutus</hi> obtained the Regall Wreath; of King <hi>Suercherus</hi> alſo, to whom his Sons <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſucceeded; after them <hi>Ericus Balbus,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Ericus Sanctus,</hi> by election aſcended the Royall Chair, next whom <hi>Valdemarus</hi> Nephew to <hi>Ericke</hi> (laſt named) by his Siſter and <hi>Birgerus</hi> that Illuſtrious Prince of the <hi>Oſtro-gothes,</hi> obtained the Scepter, which was afterwards ſwayed by his Brother <hi>Magnus</hi> (ſur-named) <hi>Ladulas: Birgerus</hi> the Son of <hi>Magnus</hi> was next elected; and he (ejected for Cruelty and Fratricide) was ſucceeded by <hi>Magnus Erickson</hi> (his Nephew) ſurnamed <hi>Smeek.</hi>

                     <p>Contrary to this Oath, King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> is (by them) <note place="margin">Contrary actings</note> charged to have erected a Popiſh Church in the Regall City, to which end, he purchaſed a Stately Structure of Stone from a ſtranger there inhabiting: He is likewiſe taxed for placing Count <hi>Ericke</hi> of <hi>Viſingsborg</hi> (a moſt zealous Adherer to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Sect) Governour of <hi>Stocholme</hi> Caſtle, in which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Ornaments, with the Records of their <hi>Cancellariae,</hi> are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally depoſited; as alſo the Armes, Ammunition, and the great Ordinance of the Kingdom: And in the Port wherof the main body of their Navy was reſerved, contrary to his fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Letters of Aſſecuration.</p>
                     <p>To a certain Jeſuite, <hi>Adam Steinhall</hi> by name, he committed the <hi>Arcenſian</hi> Temple, placing alſo his <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts in the Queens Iſland, and in the <hi>Vaſtenan</hi> Monaſtery, contrary to what he had given under his hand and Seal, to this effect: <hi>That neither in the Eccleſiaſticall or Politicall Affairs of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he would uſe the help of any perſon who did not profeſs the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion then generally received in</hi> Suethen.</p>
                     <p>They further argue, that he no ſooner returned from his <note place="margin">Further Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> Coronation to <hi>Stocholme,</hi> but that he gave the Raynes unto his <hi>Poliſh</hi> and other <hi>Romiſh</hi> affected followers, to enter their Churches, and diſturb their Service and Devotions, by tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perambulations in all parts of their Temples, with loud voices and ſcandalous Geſtures (during their Sermons and other Religious Exerciſes) to the great oppreſſion and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of minds; yea, to the hazard of mens lives, branding and reviling them with the name of Hereticks, and other infamous and ſcurrilous Appellations, inſomuch as they were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet Guards about their Miniſters aſcending their Pulpits;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109514:19"/>
and complaint being made unto the King of theſe abuſes, the Plaintiffs were diſmiſt with reproaches and contumelious words, no redreſs at all afforded.</p>
                     <p>It is moreover objected, that beſides extraneous Forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced <note place="margin">Continued.</note> at his Arrival, he ordered others to be brought from <hi>Dantzig</hi> by <hi>Erneſt Wejerus,</hi> and other Commanders, furniſhed as to a declared War; wherby Flouds of blood might have over-flowed, if by other weighty Affairs he had not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called and induced to return into <hi>Poland:</hi> but what he could not then (ſay they) effect, he afterwards endeavoured at the <hi>Papall Legatorian</hi> inſtance, when with a numerous Army he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entred <hi>Suethen</hi> in the year 1598.</p>
                     <p>In this manner do they charge King <hi>Sigiſmundus,</hi> that he no <note place="margin">Hit ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Suethland.</hi>
                        </note> way obſerved his Regall Oath and Aſſecuration in point of Religion: after which he departed the Kingdom (as at firſt he had done) without the conſent and approbation of the States therof; leaving behind a <hi>Romiſh</hi> affected Governour in his chief Fort and City, beſides ſeverall Churches with the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenan</hi> Moneſtary filled with Jeſuites and others of that Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Sect, wherby much diſſention a roſe within the Land ſoon after his departure.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon certain Senators of the Kingdom thought it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to write unto the Duke, ſignifying the Kings departure, and that they had endeavoured to their utmoſt, that the weighty Affairs of the Realm might have been ſettled before his <hi>Exit,</hi> ſeverall wherof remained yet unperfected: That <note place="margin">Duke <hi>Charles</hi> ſought unto by ſeme Senators.</note> therfore they beſought his Highneſs to afford a helping hand with his wonted Patriotall affection, for the diſpatch of things as neceſſity required. That touching the form of Government, which his Highneſs had (by Copy communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them, to be) deſired of his Majeſty, no proceed had been made, as he might happily have underſtood by <hi>Ericke Guſtavus</hi> one of their number: That the Regall Enſigns were depoſited in the <hi>Stocholmian</hi> Caſtle, wherof Count <hi>Ericke</hi> was appointed Governour, againſt whom they had proteſted in his own preſence, and had entreated his Majeſty to ponder the ſame more maturely: Other things alſo were in the ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained, as their moſt earneſt deſire for his Highneſs ſpeedy repair to <hi>Stocholme:</hi> Theſe were dated the fifteenth of <hi>July</hi> 1594. and their requeſts reiterated by a ſecond invitation of the twentieth <hi>ejuſdem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Duke returned anſwer to their firſt the eighteenth of the ſame, therin expreſſing, that albeit moſt willing (as by duty obliged) to procure his dear Countries good, yet the ſame ſeemed a work of no ſmall difficulty, the King having preſcribed no direct form of Government, eſpecially in thoſe diſturbed times, wherin the publike Treaſure was much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109514:19"/>
the Kingdom obvious to the inconveniencies of a <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> War, and uncertain of obtaining a wiſhed Peace; the Crown Revenues ſo diminiſhed (during his Majeſties being there) as they appeared not a little deficient: That neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he would not be wanting to afford his utmoſt of counſell and aſſiſtance for the redreſs of things amiſs, wherunto his Propinquity of blood and maturity of years invited him; conditionally, that they would joyn with him for the Weal of his Majeſty and the Kingdom, wherof he deſired their ſpeedy reſolution and compliance to thoſe things that for the ſaid ends ſhould be decreed; and that they would not ſeparate untill concluſions were taken concerning the frame of future Government, to which effect he would (upon their intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) ſpeedily repair to <hi>Stocholme.</hi> Theſe were dated from <hi>Nicopia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In purſuance hereof they again inſtance unto him, that his <note place="margin">Again deſired to aſſume the Government.</note> preſence was both their hope and expectation, renewing their requeſts that he would aſſume the Government. Promiſing that they would not be wanting to their power in Counſell, Aſſiſtance, ſecurity, and Obedience for the good of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the glory of God, and the Emolument of the Natives. This was dated the ninth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1594. and ſigned by <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus Gyldenſtierne, Guſtavus Baner, Turo Bielke, Hogenſchildus Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elke, Claudins Bielke,</hi> and <hi>Guſtavus Gabrielis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Duke <hi>Charles</hi> thus invited, repaired to <hi>Stocholme,</hi> where, no <note place="margin">The Duke comes to <hi>Stocholme.</hi>
                        </note> ſooner arrived, but he cleared the <hi>Arconſian</hi> Temple, the City, and the Queens Iſland, of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, and likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived their great Patron, Count <hi>Ericke,</hi> of his Command of the Regall Caſtle; for he being a ſtrong Promover of the Papall Creed, was formidable to thoſe of the contrary Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by reaſon of his power and great Alliances within the Kingdom; His Siſter being Wife to <hi>Ericke Sparre</hi> the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: his Aunt married to <hi>Claudtus Flemingius</hi> Governour of <hi>Finland,</hi> and his Uncles, <hi>Ericke Guſtavus, Aruidus Guſtavus,</hi> and <hi>Carolus Guſtavus,</hi> were Rulers and Governours of the <hi>Weſtro-gothes,</hi> the <hi>Ostro-gothes,</hi> and <hi>Smaland,</hi> with others of no mean power.</p>
                     <p>To the former Criminations againſt their King, they add, <note place="margin">Further crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations againſt <hi>Sigiſmundus.</hi>
                        </note> that contrary to his Regall Oath, and promiſe under his hand and Seal, to protect from injury the Poor, as well as the Rich, he permitted (without puniſhment or inquiſition made) the Nightly Watches to be abuſed and beaten: The <hi>Polanders</hi> (of his Train) to be day and night in Armes; by whom (with others of the Natives who delighted in ſuch miſchiefs) ſundry of the ſaid Night-watches being frequently murthered, were ſo found lying in the Streets, others miſerably wounded; yea, even their houſes were unſecure from violence: and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109514:20"/>
complaints were many times preferred, yet no redreſs was granted, nor Juſtice executed upon the Murtherers.</p>
                     <p>Sundry other things to the ſame purpoſe, they repeat; as the Conceſſion (formerly mentioned) of <hi>Leiſland</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Poland;</hi> as alſo, the diminiſhing of the Navy and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denance, to the great damage of the Common-wealth: And that, unwitting to the Duke or States of the Kingdom; in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice alſo of the <hi>Guſtavian</hi> Teſtament, and the Conſtitutions of <hi>Calmar, An.</hi> 1587. he had tranſacted with the Neighbour Princes, touching certain moſt weighty Affairs of <hi>Suethland;</hi> the peculiar Badge or Cogniſance wherof he had alienated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring by <hi>Ericke Sparre,</hi> his Ambaſſadour, a dilation or prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the compromiſſoriall tranſaction about the ſaid Badge; <hi>viz.</hi> The three Crowns, which in the year 1591. at the Treaty with the Dane by the River <hi>Flakeſiobecke,</hi> had been at their earneſt and moſt inſtant requeſt ſuſpended untill <hi>An.</hi> 1597: And that <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> (by that Embaſſie ſought to attain by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty from the <hi>Dane</hi> that which he had formerly (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty and ſuit) obtained from the States of <hi>Sueth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> therby alienating the right of the <hi>Suethes</hi> to thoſe three Crowns, the proper and peculiar Badge, and one of the chief Regalities of the Kingdom, which he ought not to have done.</p>
                     <p>And this he did (ſay they) by the perſwaſions of his ſaid Counſellour <hi>Ericke Sparre,</hi> the better to compaſs his hoſtile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions towards his Uncle the Duke, to the notorious breach of the foreſaid Teſtament; the expreſs words wherof are, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>They further objurgate his cauſing of Arreſt to be made at <hi>Lubecke</hi> (and other Maratine Cities) of their Ships and Goods, and ſpoyling them of their ſaid Goods and Merchandizes: And that, ſome years paſt <hi>(Suethland</hi> being afflicted with a great dearth of Corn, wherby many thouſands periſhed, and the reſidue much exhauſted, in their Subſtance) he, by the counſell of <hi>Steno Baner, Olaus Suercherus</hi> and <hi>Lindormias Bond,</hi> ſeverely prohibited thoſe of <hi>Dantzig</hi> and other Sea Ports of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Dominion, from adminiſtring relief to thoſe of <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;</hi> and at the ſame time enjoyed thoſe of <hi>Rivell</hi> (albeit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into <hi>Swethland)</hi> not to furniſh them with any proviſion, and ſollicited the like with other <hi>Marine</hi> Places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Empire.</p>

By all theſe things, they ſhew, that his ſecond departure produced no better fruite then his firſt (both being without the privity of the States) and that, as his firſt diſceſſion, to receive an Extraneous Crowne, accaſioned a conceding of <hi>Leifeland</hi> to the <hi>Polander;</hi> So, his ſecond left them in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedneſſe, without any prefect forme of Government, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his promiſe; which Comedie (ſay they) was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced by thoſe Counſellours who were unwilling to be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ruled by the <hi>Guſtavian</hi> Line, but that themſelves might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent each other in the domination of the parts, whereby would have enſued the ruine of the whole.</p>

                     <p>That the late Parliament at <hi>Warſaw</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what things (there purpoſely publiſhed) had been ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at the <hi>Sadercopian</hi> Parliament in <hi>Suethland:</hi> the Senators of <hi>Poland,</hi> with the <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Orders, had appointed this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie principally for the neerer conjoyning of thoſe Potent Kingdoms in peace and unity, and as therunto conducing to enquire into the whole matter, as not being of particular concernment to <hi>Suethland</hi> only, but had like reference to the (not to be violated) Regall Dignity of his Majeſty, who was of both thoſe Realms the ſole Lord and King, from whom they had obtained permiſſion to treat with his Highneſs and the Senators of <hi>Suethen,</hi> in a way of Brotherly Charity and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, which is not wont to act raſhly.</p>
                     <p>That the Senators and Orders, of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania</hi> doubted not but that the Orders of <hi>Suethen</hi> would continue faithfull toward their King, to whom they were aſtricted by Nature, by Oath, and hereditary Right, even as they had profeſſed in that <hi>Sudercopian</hi> Enaction: but that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they could not but apprehend the intervention of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things at that Parliament, which (unleſs corrected by Mature Counſell) might breed diſturbance in the Kingdom; ſuch Initiations uſually ſpringing up, when ſlighting the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lord, publike Counſels were convened by another Call, Laws were enacted, the form of Government changed, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters placed by the King, removed from their Charge, things peculiar to the Royall Majeſty, transferred upon others: All which may eaſily appear to be full of, and obnoxious to many dangers.</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Lithuania</hi> Orders did conceive the <hi>Suethes</hi> could not be ignorant of his Majeſties affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Paternall Realm, or that he deſired to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardfull eye unto the good of his Subjects, nor would have refuſed, but rather granted them a Parliament (if he had ſeen

it neceſſarily requiſite) that Method and Order conſentane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Lawes of the Kingdome might have been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: It being undeniable that a Convention in a Kingdome cannot be rightly called without the conſent, authority, and preſence of the King, but that as then no ſuch thing had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared wanting either in reference to the Kingdome, or its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient accuſtomed Lawes and Conſtitutions, his Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving concluded a peace between them and the <hi>Ruſsian,</hi> and ſo diſpoſed of all things within the Kingdome, as that no detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or diſturbance could rationally be feared.</p>
                     <p>That the ſaid Convention was not only made without publike neceſſity impelling, contrary to his Majeſties and the <hi>Pediſh</hi> Senatoriall expectations, and wanted the conſent and authority of their lawfull Crowned King, but even contrary to his Edicts prohibiting the ſame: yea, that many things had been therein enacted diametrically oppoſite to the Regall Rights and Superiority. As the Call it ſelf in manner as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: The remove of perſons intruſted by the King with Forts, and theſe committed to others; Exauthorization of the Royall Mandates, coyning of money in other (then the Regall) name: Appeals to his Majeſty, and therein the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Dignity it ſelf many waies circumſcribed.</p>
                     <p>That theſe things having been weighed in an equall Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, the Senators and Princes of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> with the reſpective Orders of the depending Provinces, Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and Cities, did by them their Ambaſſadors earneſtly deſire his Highneſs to preſerve entire his Majeſties Rights and Dignity, wherein the Kingdomes welfare was involved, as their propinquity of blood required; and did alſo in Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly manner admoniſh and entreat the Senators of <hi>Suethland,</hi> as ſuch to whoſe vigilancy, prudency, and Fidelity, that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes care was by him committed and intruſted, to return a diligent demonſtration of their duty and fidelity toward their hereditary and crowned King; and by a vigorous reſiſtance of any who affecting Innovations (as in large Empires many times happens) would for private diſturb the publike Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, manifeſt to the world how freely they had implyed the Talent intruſted unto them from Heaven and his Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>That all Innovations in Kingdoms were perilous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, but eſpecially ſuch as tended to violate the Rights of a lawfull, hereditary crowned King, as might be evidenced by <hi>France,</hi> which by a thirty ſix, and the Opulent <hi>Belgian</hi> Provinces by a twenty ſeven years Warr were almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to an utter extermination: And that thoſe Rights neither could nor ought to be impaired, but by that Majeſty by whom Kings Raigne and Princes decree Juſtice. That wicked men did never proceed at firſt to open height of evil,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109514:25"/>
but by peicemeals plucked up the Fences, untill that from faithfull Subjects they had wreſted the Power; whereby (having overturned the Kingdome) to augment their owne Wealth and Greatneſſe, Which evills it beſeemed his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and their Lordſhips to obviate timely, and to aboliſh any Laws, Conſtitutions: or Confederations, contrary to his Crowne, his Dignity, and Regall Rights, and by their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and authority, to divert the courſe of ill undertaken Councells, leaſt the head thereby weakned, the Kingdomes body might faint and fall into decadence.</p>
                     <p>That the Duke and Senators of <hi>Suethland</hi> might aſſure themſelves, that his Majeſty (albeit at preſent detained by greater cares for Chriſtendomes univerſall good) would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intermit his due regard of his native Countrey, no more then ſuffer the Rights of Royalty to be disjoynted: But that whatſoever faithfull Subjects ſhould crave in a juſt and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way, (his Dignity preſerved) hee would undoubtedly grant. That therefore his Highneſs and their Lordſhips ought to proſecute his Majeſty with due returne of Love, obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, obedience, and faithfull endeavours: The rather, for that his Majeſty did no way oppreſs or burthen them, but like to an indulgent Father, with a minde truely Royall, more prone to mercy then to cruelty, was willing to paſſe by offences, the more grievous becauſe proceeding from his owne, by whom he ought not to have been injured: Notwithſtanding which, he Promiſed no leſſe for the future, then that amidſt the Community of Chriſtendomes concernments, whereof <hi>Suethland</hi> did partake, he would endeavour their good; and as a returne of his Highneſſe and their Lordſhips conſtant and faithfull affections towards his Majeſty, was no way doubted of by the reſpective Orders of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> ſo the continuance therein was their earneſt deſire.</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>Polanders,</hi> as they had abundantly teſtified by a voluntary conferring their Crowne upon his Majeſty, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Nations cuſtome, had vowed unto him their Fortunes, Liberties, life it ſelfe, ſo they were now ready to beſtow all thoſe, and what elſe could be dearer unto them, for the vindication of his Regall Rights and Dignity, and would to that end unanimouſly joyne with his Highneſs, their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and that Kingdomes Orders, and did promiſe (as the preſent Oration might teſtifie) that they would never be wanting to endeavour the repair of the leaſt injury done to his Majeſty, or Kingly name, wherunto they expected and did promiſe to themſelves a mutuall, aſſured, and an untergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing concurrence from his Highneſs &amp; the Orders of <hi>Sueth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> from whom, for concluſion, they earneſtly deſired they might receive an authentique written anſwer to the ſeverall

                           <p>That whereas he is taxed of many things not couched in that Plenipotentiary, it follows, either that he is unjuſtly argued of having acted contrary thereunto, or that the ſame muſt be imperfect, as not containing all things which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty required in a well regulated Empire.</p>

2. The mention of his Highneſs Title and Authority in point of Government, during his Majeſties abſence, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Article of that Decree, doth rather confirm then retract form his Majeſties Dignitie and Rights: for the preſidency of one, exceeding the reſt in power and authority, is of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous concernment to the Common-wealth, as by the prejudices of <hi>Policratia,</hi> or <hi>Democratie</hi> in this and other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and by this Nations Annals may be demonſtrated: Hence Civill Wars take riſe, and Kingdomes become ſubject to extraneous Yoaks to their own detriment and deſtruction: for men are naturally prone to diſſention. Where ſeverall beare rule with equall power, it followes moſtly, that each hath regard to his private not the publike good. Moreover, each truſting to other neglects his own part of duty, according to that ſaying, <hi>Affaires committed unto many have ſlow expedition,</hi> There is a certaine naturall Vice, that Poſſeſſions in common are for the moſt part neglected.</p>

The Lawes of <hi>Suethland</hi> do thus expreſſe, that the ſame ſhall be rotally ſubject unto One, not unto many Kings; Whence it is apparent, that the Well-fare and Dignity of the Kingdome cannot firmly conſiſt but under one Governour. Hereunto externall Lawes and the Judgments of Forraigners do accord, as the following Texts do witneſſe; <hi>Kingdomes and Empires may be better governed by One then by many.</hi> Item, <hi>Hardly can a Plurality effect ought of good:</hi> Item, <hi>It is Hereticall to place two Vicars in a Land.</hi>

                           <p>As from the precedent (and other not here inſerted) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons it may be concluded, that the King abſent, more then One cannot be conſtituted over the whole, nor any but his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109514:33"/>
It followes without controverſie, that nothing hath been herein acted in derogation of his Majeſties Dignity: but ſuch only decreed as the Lawes commanded and the publike good required: For his Highneſſe did not this to exclude his Majeſty, but to be ſerviceable to the Country in his Majeſties abſence; neither did he obtrude himſelf, but lent his hand to the Helme, at the earneſt requeſt of the Orders of <hi>Suethland:</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Title it ſelf doth no way diminiſh the Regall Praeemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency: For,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. It is the Title of a King, but of him who executes the Office and repreſents the Power.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Both in this and other Kingdomes the Rulers have been called by ſuch Titles, as is evident in our Hiſtories, where <hi>Torchilus</hi> the Son of <hi>Canutus, Suanto</hi> the Son of <hi>Nicolaus, Steno Sture</hi> the younger, and many others, have been entitled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Adminiſtrators of the Kingdome.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. This Title cannot derogate from the Regall Dignity, for his Majeſty had (by Writ) honoured <hi>Claudius Flemingius,</hi> with the like; which he was uncapable of, as not being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the States of the Kingdome, neither had they both equall right to the Government: For his Highneſſe ſprung from the Regall Family, is a Prince hereditary of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but <hi>Flemingius</hi> a Subject of his Majeſty and of his Highneſſe.</p>
                           <p>The third head of the ſaid Decree containes likewiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is conſentaneous to the Lawes of <hi>Suethland:</hi> For by thoſe written Lawes, each cauſe is to be tried in the Province where the Delict was committed; and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made exemplary where the Crime was ſo; beſides, many confuſions and prejudices would accrue to the Country, if the cognition of all Cauſes ſhould be made in <hi>Poland.</hi> As,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. There could not be ſo ample information as were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, in regard the true ſtate of Crimes may be more certainly known upon the place.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. A juſt Cauſe might happen to be loſt for want of ability to attend perſonally and proſecute the definition; to produce Witneſſes, and exhibit other inſtruments conducible to its le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall cognition</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Natives Eſtates would be utterly exhauſted by thoſe long Journeys, whence their unavoidable ruine muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity follow.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The ancient Juriſdiction, Lawes, and Priviledges of <hi>Suethland</hi> would be violated, which may not be tollerated: All Nations have unanimouſly and obſtinately maintained their own, and have pronounced that the Infringers of the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of others were to be puniſhed as Peace-breakers. <hi>Item,</hi> that who ſo ſhould bring an Action before a Court incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was to be fined.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="53" facs="tcp:109514:33"/>
Whereas therefore his Majeſty had bound himſelfe by Oath not to impaire the Juriſdiction of <hi>Suethland,</hi> he ſhould treſpaſſe againſt the ſame by conſtituting either in <hi>Poland,</hi> or elſewhere, any extraneous Judicatory to be competent for the <hi>Suethes.</hi> Our Annals do likewiſe ſhew that, for the like, great troubles did ariſe to <hi>Ericke</hi> the thirteenth, and other Kings.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Hereunto is added, that his Majeſty whileſt in <hi>Poland,</hi> cannot determine the cauſes of <hi>Suethland,</hi> as not having thoſe perſons there with him, by whoſe counſell he is ſworn to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter this Kingdomes Affaires.</p>
                           <p>The fourth Article of that Decree is grounded upon the Lawes of <hi>Suethen,</hi> as treating of diſtributing of Offices: And if his Majeſty will preſerve the Lawes intire as he hath ſworne, he may not, whileſt abſent, confer Offices at the requeſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one who ſhall ſue unto him: According to the Lawes of <hi>Suethen,</hi> the King (abſent) is expreſly prohibited from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting a Provinciall Judge, but ſuch conſtitution belongs to him who (in his abſence) ſupplies his place: How much leſſe then may he diſpoſe of the more weighty charges? And it hath been alwaies uſuall here that the great Sewer or Vice-roy of the Kingdome, ſhould collate Offices in the Regall abſence, as appeares by the Union whereby he is endowed with that Power.</p>
                           <p>In regard therefore of what before alledged, it is uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertably apparent that the foreſaid Decree doth not violate his Majeſties Rights nor Dignity, but doth rather enlarge and illuſtrate them: and that, if regard were had to the Lawes, his Highneſſe might expect and receive thanks for having, in his Majeſties abſence, undergone a Government ſo repleniſhed with cares and toyles: However, it was not decent to vitiate this pious Office with ſuch contumelies and ignominious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as the Letters delivered unto him are farced with.</p>
                           <p>But if his Majeſty ſhall ſay, that he doth not ſo much argue and proteſt againſt the Decree it felf (in regard thoſe Articles ſeem not ſo averſe unto the Regall Dignity and Rights) as againſt the power and authority aſſumed by his Highneſſe of indicting a Parliament, that being a Prerogative Royall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the King ſolely.</p>
                           <p>His Highneſſe anſwereth, that by the Lawes, it is not eaſily proved, that the right of calling Parliaments is peculiarly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall; for thoſe Royalties which by ſpeciall conceſſion are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon any perſon, go not beyond the ſame, but that it is otherwiſe obſerved in Parliamentary Rights, examples do ſhew; for even in <hi>Poland</hi> the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Gneſnen</hi> hath power to call Parliaments and to enact Lawes in the Kings abſence: And albeit that a Law to the contrary might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, yet ought it not to be of any validity in this caſe, for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109514:34"/>
as much as the <hi>Suethes,</hi> by a long preſcription of time, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired this right in the ſame manner that all Regall Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are, as may appear by many Parliaments celebrated in this Kingdome, in the Raignes of <hi>Ericke</hi> XIII. and <hi>John</hi> II. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Countries well-fare and neceſſities required the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hereof: And neceſſity is above all Law, neither admits of any.</p>
                           <p>Foraſmuch then as by the precedent reaſons it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Sudercopian</hi> Decree containes nothing but what is conducing to the preſerving and promoving of Unity in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to the maintaining and confirming the Lawes and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, his Majeſty cannot, by the moſt Subtilized Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, render the ſame Invalid, without revoking his Oath. But for the better cementing of things, his Highneſſe will briefly reſolve and refute the Arguments uſed by his Majeſty for the illuding of that <hi>Sudercopian</hi> Tranſaction.</p>
                           <div n="1" type="argument">
                              <p>HIs Majeſty argues that in all lawful Conventions two things are chiefly requiſite: Firſt, the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours <note place="margin">Argument 1.</note> approbation and conſent: Secondly, That the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and motives for calling a Parliament be mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignified unto him: But whereas the <hi>Sudercopian</hi> Covention was held without the Regall aſſent, and timely ſignification of the Cauſe impelling thereunto, his Majeſty pronounceth the ſame needleſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
                              <p>And that his Majeſties affirmation may appeare grounded upon Reaſon and the Authority of the Law, he confirmes and fortifies the ſame out of the ſecond Chapter of the Title of Regalls, by a Text, wherein is expreſſed, that Subjects are bound to obey their King; but his Majeſty, by Edict, prohibited that Convention, as appeares by the Writ. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>

                                 <p>This Propoſition is not rationally laid down: For thus <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> many evil Conventions would be approved, and laudable ones, tending to the good of Empires and Kingdomes, would be rendred of no valididity, becauſe held without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or conſent of the Supreme Magiſtrate, which were dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ſay. The Syllogiſme ought therefore to be thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: It is a lawfull Convention wherein nothing is treated, but what is conſentaneous to the Laws, and appertains to the

                                    </gap>n the <hi>Sudercopian</hi> Convention, nothing was determined that is not agreeable to the Laws of <hi>Suethen</hi> and other Nations: Who therefore will call ſuch a Convention unlawfull? And if that be to be called a lawful Aſſembly, of the cauſes and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity whereof his Majeſty had been advertiſed, this cannot be termed an unlawfull one; timely Advertiſements of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons inducing his Highneſſe and the Councellours of the Kingdome to call that Parliament, having been ſent to his Majeſty, as by their Letters of the 28. of <hi>July</hi> may appear.</p>
                                 <p>Neither was it unknown to his Majeſty in what Confuſion and Perturbation he left the Kingdome at his departure; nor yet, if the cauſes had not been ſignified, ought this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have been judged unlawfull, for as much as in our Municipal Laws there is not one which commands the ſame, and that ought to be called unlawfull, which is contrary to the Law: And if any Law prohibiting the celebrating of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, were extant, it ought deſervedly to be reſtrained or altogether aboliſhed, where danger may be apprehended by delay, in which caſe the common rules of Law may be receded from, and undoubtedly this exception may take place here, for daily Experience ſhewes what delayes are contracted by expectation of anſwers out of <hi>Poland.</hi> The deferring thereof for the Regal approbation would have been of ſmall conducement, ſeeing the whole Matter appears diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relliſhing to his Majeſty, who alſo by an abſolute prohibition might have procured detriment to the Kingdome, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Royall Dignity. And albeit his Majeſty had deigned an acceptable anſwer, yet it had been repugnant to the Cuſtome (time out of mind) of this Kingdome; both becauſe it had ever been permitted here to call Parliaments, Neceſſity urging, and the King being in forreign parts, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that it would have been a reproach and ignominie to the Kingdome, to have ſought a form and frame of adminiſtring the ſame from abroad. How neceſſary that Convention was, the enſuing Reaſons will demonſtrate.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. It will be granted by all men, and his Majeſty muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, (unleſſe he will affirm that his Kingdome may want him without prejudice) that no Kingdome can continue without a King or head, and a certain form of Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The King was departed out of his hereditary Kingdome, and had left no Governour nor ſettled form of Government, nor hopes of his return; having, as aforeſaid, promiſed the <hi>Polanders</hi> to ſpend his remaining life with them, ſo ſoon as he ſhould have received the Crown, and had ſettled his affairs in <hi>Suethland:</hi> and therefore deliberation for governing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth in his abſence, was neceſſary for the avoiding of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109514:35"/>
prejudice by confuſion, which began to ſprout forth: But the Subjects conſent being requiſite for ſuch a Settlement, it was needfull, that the Orders of the Kingdome ſhould be convened to make an Election by common sufferage.</p>
                                 <p>Further, without a Governour, to whom ſhould the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have addreſſed their Complaints? for each one would have ruled as he liſted, which is hardly now abſtained from (and the rather becauſe his Majeſty renders the <hi>Sudercopian</hi> Decree ſubject to Suſpition and Contempt) by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Subjects finding themſelves deſerted by their lawfull Crowned King, might have taken occaſion of ſwerving from their duty; neither would reaſon nor the examples of Anceſtors have been wanting. Here may be added, that the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> War, which had lain upon us twenty ſix years was not then ended, and winter approached, affording to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my notable opportunities of infeſting the Kingdome; the Borders were denuded of military Guards, and as it were expoſed to incurſions; to obviate theſe evils, mutuall conſent, Counſel and aſſiſtance was requiſite, which could be no way better effected then by the <hi>Sudercopian</hi> Parliament.</p>
                                 <p>But whereas his Majeſty endeavours to prove the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull by the forecited Text of the ſecond Chapter in the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Reals, it may be worthy of obſervation, how this deduction can be made from thence: His Majeſties words ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a double conſtruction: Firſt, that Subjects are bound to obey the Kings command, when they are fortified with and conformable to law, unto which ſenſe his Highneſs doth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and it is onely inquired, whether ſuch a Convention be forbidden by the Law? but if no ſuch Law can be produced, he collects from thence, that the ſame is legally permitted: For what is not prohibited, is conceived to be allowed: and where the Law is ſilent, we ought to be ſo likewiſe: Which Laws are the more pertinent to our purpoſe, becauſe that here the Privation of a Right is concerned, whereof no man can be (juſtly) deprived but by expreſs proviſion of the Laws. But if the words ſignifie that, according to Law, the Subjects are bound to obey whatſoever the King ſhall command: many inconveniences would redound thence; for thereby all his injunctions, juſt or unjuſt, muſt have the force of a Law, which would ſavour more of a Tyrant then of a Chriſtian Prince.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Caeſar,</hi> albeit a Monarch, in the Cabinet of whoſe breaſt all Lawes are contained, and who can preſcribe and ordaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Law Poſitive, hath not thought it below him to ſay, that he is ſubject to the Lawes; contrary to the common voice of Tyrants is, <hi>Sicvolo, ſic jubeo, ſit pro ratione voluntas.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p n="2">2. That Law cannot be ſo generally underſtood as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109514:35"/>
would have it, becauſe his Soveraignty is circumſcribed and limited by his Oath, by his Aſſecuration, and by the Laws themſelves, neither can it extend further then they permit: And here that clauſe of his Majeſties Letter, <hi>That he granted not unto his Highneſſe an abſolute but a limited Rule,</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; for his Majeſty not having (as is here ſhewed) an abſolute Rule, how could he transfer to another what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had not.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. Wheras it is expreſly contained in the Regall Oath and in our Municipall Law, that the King ought to command his Subjects nothing but what is right and juſt before God and man; how can the King command what ever he will? or how are the Subjects bound to obey his command in all things, if he ſhall enjoyn ought contrary to the Lawes and Statutes of the Land.</p>
                                 <p>Seeing therefore that this Law is to be underſtood with an exception, and extends not further then the Regall Oath and the Kingdomes Lawes permit, it may be demanded whether the King could rightly hinder or diſturb the <hi>Sudercopian</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament? For firſt, he promiſed by Oath to impoſe no new Law upon his Subjects without their conſent: but whereas in all the body of our Law there is not one which forbids the celebrating of a Parliament, the King remaining in forraign parts, and that his Majeſty endeavours to introduce ſuch a Law, let the Subjects approbation be firſt required; which certainly they will never afford as having unanimouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred in and confirmed the <hi>Sudercopian</hi> Convention: and therefore his Majeſty can not make ſuch a Law, nor diſanull thoſe Decrees, unleſſe he will act againſt his Oath and Faith, and againſt the Lawes of the Land, beſides the hazard of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing his Hereditary Kingdome into extream danger.</p>
                                 <p>Secondly, his Majeſty made Oath to preſerve all the Rights and Priviledges of the Kingdome: But that of calling Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Regall abſence is moſt ancient, as is manifeſt in former Ages; eſpecially in the Raigns of <hi>Ericke</hi> the thirteenth, and <hi>John</hi> the ſecond, in which the Orders of the Kingdome convened to admoniſh the King (by writing) of his duty, and to exhort him not to leave the Kingdome in the diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it then was. And albeit his Highneſſe is not ignorant that Judgment is not to be given by example, but by Law, he holds it (yet) worthy of conſideration that examples are of a two-fold kind; the one diametrically repugnant, the other conſentaneous to the Lawes; the former of no authority, the latter of equall force with the Law: But thoſe before cited are not contrary thereunto, and therfore cannot be legally rejected by his Majeſty: Moreover, not ſo much the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109514:36"/>
as the frequency of ſuch actings, and the time requiſite for ſuch preſcriptions are to be regarded; which cuſtome is not only of equall force with the Lawes, but doth ſometimes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe their Authority.</p>
                                 <p>Thirdly, Whereas his Majeſty did religiouſly promiſe that he would intermit nothing which might conduce to the well-fare and flouriſhing eſtate of the Kingdome, he cannot nullifie the <hi>Sudercopian</hi> Decree which wholly tended to the Patriall good &amp; ſafety: And albeit a Law were extant, forbidding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments to be held in the Royal abſence, yet it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained when the Kingdome by reaſon of that abſence were in danger. For, <hi>Salus Populi Suprema Lex Eſto.</hi> And a Prince ought to prefer the publike good before his own particular.</p>
                                 <p>As therefore his Highneſſe and the Kingdomes Inhabitants are not further bound unto his Majeſty, nor obliged to obey his commands then his Oath, his Caution given, and the Lawes of the Land do permit, and that theſe would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted if his Majeſty ſhould obſtruct the Parliamentary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree made and ratified by common conſent; It followes of right that the Subjects are not bound to the obedience of his Edict, eſpecially in regard the Kings and Kingdomes wel-being was endeavoured by that Convention.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109514:39"/>
That which preſerves tranquility of Religion generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a kingdome, which executes the Laws, aboliſheth civill diſſention, eſtabliſheth the regall Oath and the heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Covenants, doth more confirme then weaken the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Rights: No man therefore will doubt, but that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty vvill have it unviolably obſerved, and will thinke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can more conduce to the illuſtration and amplification of his Dignity: It was called for his good, not for ſedition or diſobedience; neither was it unwitting to him, for hee had been certified of the motives by <hi>Artizouskie</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding; he proteſted indeed, but the thing was done. The power of calling Parliaments is knowne to be in the Supreme Prince when within the Kingdome; but if otherwiſe, it hath never been obſerved that Treaſon was imputed, if they to whom the Government was committed did call a Parliament in the Regall abſence ſo long as nothing was acted contrary to their Faith and Oath given. This Kingdome hath ſome Preſidents, as in the times of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the firſt, and <hi>John</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, when the effects of the Regall Oath began to languiſh, which may eaſily happen in the Kingly abſence: Forraign ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are not wanting, nor argumentative proofs of the beſt learned in Politicks many years paſt, as well of the <hi>Roman</hi> as of our Religion, that the King being abſent, Parliaments may be kept without derogating from Majeſty: According to <hi>Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> they ſwarve from the Law of Nations, and the cuſtome of their Anceſtors who plot to root out the moſt laudable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of celebrating common Counſels, the greateſt ſtrength and eſtabliſhment of a Kingdome: Under <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond of <hi>England, Charles</hi> the eighth, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh of <hi>France,</hi> and theſe alſo are Hereditary Kingdomes, Parliaments have been called the King preſent: In <hi>Germany</hi> it is no new thing for the States to convene againſt the Emperors mind, and it is yet freſh in memory that the like hath been done in <hi>Poland,</hi> the King, even this <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the third, not only unwilling but alſo prohibiting and proteſting againſt it, which is not here mentioned to accuſe others, for all men have judged Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be lawfull, when publikely called for weighty cauſes and not contrary to the good of King and Kingdome, albeit againſt his mind being abſent. Confederacies oppoſite to the Regall Dignity, Praeeminencie, and Rights, have not been undertaken as is unjuſtly objected: Such ſavour of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which never entred into the thoughts of the <hi>Suethes.</hi> Conſpiracy is cloſe, treacherous, diſtructitive to King and Country; but Parliaments are lawfull and do fortifie both: It is therefore Illegall to taxe the <hi>Suethes</hi> of treaſon, for ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, when as the ſame appeares not to be forbidden them by any Law; but unto Kings is not permitted to Enact Lawes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:109514:39"/>
without the Peoples conſent, no more then to governe the people contrary to the Law and without the aſſent of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators.</p>
                              <p>The more weighty inducements to that Parliaments indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were, the publike Debts; the unpaid ſtipends of the Soldery, whoſe Military Vertue is not unknown to any; the ſetling of Dowries whereunto extraordinary collection was neceſſary; which by the Lawes of <hi>Suethland,</hi> the King himſelf (when preſent) cannot compell without a Parliament: His Majeſty was abſent whoſe part it was to cleere the debts of his Father and the Kingdome, which cannot ſtand ſafe without ſalving the publike Faith. Another motive was that in the Form of Government preſcribed, ſeverall things ſeemed wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in conformity to the Lawes and Regall Oath, whereunto the Orders of the Kingdome conceived they ought to adhaere the more conſtantly by reaſon of diſcords about Religion, which were not when the right of Hereditation was conferred upon the Regall Family. To the ſaid Form the Senatoriall Votes were alſo requiſite, without which the King is by our Laws forbidden to ſettle ought of the Kingdoms more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Affaires. Theſe reaſons may ſuffice for the calling of that Parliament, albeit more might be given: Let us now diſcuſſe the heads of what was therein concluded.</p>
                              <p>It is reputed treaſon that ſome are removed from Office; that the Regall Letters receive not due regard; that appeales to the King are prohibited with ſundry others: To all which articulate anſwers ſhall be made, that ſo the innocency of the <hi>Suethes</hi> may appeare to equall minds.</p>
                              <p>That ſome are reduced is not denied; and if, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors were acquainted with the reaſons, not unjuſtly; for ſome could not be admitted to beare rule without infringing the Regall Oath: Others, refractory to the publike peace had like members loſt from the body, not only ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the <hi>Sudercopian</hi> Decree, but from others alſo of greater antiquity which had been by Regall Oath confirmed: not without ſuſpition of innovation, which is moſtly ſtudied by ſuch as eſteem nothing more then to be pleaſing to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Majeſtrate without diſcerning what is juſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for the Common Weale, and ſo to grow upon the ruines of others: yet theſe are permitted to enjoy the benefit of the Lawes and ordinary Priviledges. It is moreover to be conſidered that the more honourable Offices of this Kingdome cannot be immediatly rightly conferred by the King, howbeit fixed within the Kingdome, unleſſe that firſt, if One be to be admitted into the Senatoriall Counſell; if into any other great Office, the Provinciall Votes have conceded to One of Three. Neither can Judges (the King even preſent) be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe

appointed: But he remaining out of the Kingdome, by his Vice-gerent, which Office the Kingdomes Sewer (as they here term it) did anciently, by vertue of a certain Law diſcharge in the Regall abſence: This is teſtified by the Laws themſelves, by the priviledges of ſundry Kings and famous Conſtitutions of the Kingdome for above five hundred years, as alſo by the union of theſe three Kingdomes in the Raignes of Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> and of the Kings, <hi>Ericke, Chriſtopher, John</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Chriſtierne</hi> the firſt and ſecond.</p>
                              <p>Come we now to the point of appealing. It is not unknown to any, that the moſt High God hath Inſtituted the Supream Magiſtrate for a Sanctuary and refuge to the oppreſſed: So that appeales to the King and to thoſe that beare rule, and ſuch as the King hath appointed as chief in his abſence, are lawfull even by the greateſt Offenders: And this is a cuſtome practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the <hi>Romane</hi> Provinces, and obſerved by other Kings whoſe Extents are large, but if it were free for guilty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted perſons to make continuall appeales to the King, what end would there be of Suites. When ſhould Crimes be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Appeales to the King ought to be of the more weighty cauſes only, and the maine matters of the Common-wealth: nothing is done herein contrary to the manner of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Portugall</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> are governed by Vice-royes; the <hi>Belgian</hi> Provinces by Governours, yet no appeales from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are made unto the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court, albeit each of thoſe Countries have Senatoriall perſons there reſiding, who ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Affaires of the Nation, according to their Lawes and Priviledges. But who remaine in <hi>Poland</hi> negotiating for <hi>Sueth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the Ambaſſadors can tell: Or will they judge that thoſe being in another Kingdome, can duely provide for the Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of <hi>Suethen?</hi> yet admit that ſundry of our Senatoriall Patriots were there, were it lawfull for them to draw the controverſies of the <hi>Suethes</hi> thither? Neither is this a Right peculiar to us, but equally obſerved amongſt all Nations; for what King hath deſided the cauſes of one Kingdome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unleſſe the one were ſubject to the other: The decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a competent Court within a kingdome loſes the cauſe. Appeales to the King are not abſcinded but reſerved in the Tribunall proper for the Majeſtie of the Kings of <hi>Suethland</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Kings returne: Neither can he alone, even within the Kingdome, give ſentence without able and unbyaſſed Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, no more then without a juſt hearing of the Plaintiff and Defendant: Nor is any appeale admitted by Law from the chief Tribunall unto the King, even in the moſt weighty Affaires, when he is within the kingdome, the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice being adminiſtred according to cuſtome and our written Law; how much leſſe lawfull then is it, the King remaining
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:109514:40"/>
out of the kingdome? And if permitted, would it not be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and prejudiciall to Regal Majeſty, and to an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered kingdome, when the chief Court of Juſtice ſhould ſeem to wander, like an exile in a ſtrange Land, without fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of place? many other inconveniencies might be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Appeals into <hi>Poland,</hi> as tediouſneſſe of way, vaſtneſs of expence, and at length the undoubted extinction of the moſt ancient Right of a kingdome, which is ſacred and unvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable to all Nations.</p>
                              <p>Next, it is complained, That the Royall Letters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents are ſlighted; whereunto is anſwered, that thoſe Letters which are the Kings, are had in reverence; but others, that is, ſuch as are contrary to the mind, dignity, and good of the King and Kingdome are received, as if the <hi>Suethes</hi> were aſſured, that his Majeſty deſires nothing that is not conformable to the Laws confirmed by the Regall Oath; and conducing to the preſervation and emolument of their mutuall, moſt ancient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnities: Such are indeed ſuſpended, that due honor may be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to the Royal hand and Seal, and that his Majeſty may deliberate more maturely. But ſome may ſay, thus, more wiſdom and power is attributed to the Subject, then to the Soveraign: in no wiſe. No queſtion is made of the Regal Power, which nevertheleſs, <hi>Alphonſus</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> did moſt rightly define, when he ſaid: unto Kings, whatſoever is honeſt is permitted; and that they may do what they may legally do. It was a Royall Speech of the Emperour <hi>Honorius,</hi> when he profeſſed, that he, a Prince, was bound by the Lawes: by thoſe the Kings of <hi>Suethland</hi> are confined. Things unequall, howbeit ſmall at firſt, prove in the end obnoxious to Cities and Kingdomes. In <hi>France</hi> (an hereditary Monarchy) exceſſive bounty is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reſtrained without derogating from Majeſty, even in <hi>Suethen,</hi> the meaneſt may, by protection of Law, defend himſelf and his againſt the King, by whom if ought upon falſe information be ordered at the inſtance either of Plaintiffe or Defendant, the ſame without conſulting (or derogating from) Majeſty is ejected and abrogated. Kings have ſometimes entertained Advocates for poore men, who not onely have boldly refuſed to obey the Regal permiſſions or inhibitions, but have openly, unblamed, oppoſed them. If this be tollerable in private perſons, how can that be obtruded in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Kingdome, the King abſent, which by the Law may be overthrown and may prove prejudiciall even to Majeſty it ſelf.</p>
                              <p>The Prince and Senators, are charged moreover with Treaſon, becauſe they had decreed not to have regard to ſuch Letters, as many times are by bad men, unverſed in the <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſh</hi> Affairs, extorted from a gracious Prince, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:109514:41"/>
of himſelf and the Kingdome: ſometimes by private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who neither have nor deſerve any power to enjoyn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. What is this, but putting the feet to do the work of the hands? whence that muſt neceſſarily follow, which the Lords Ambaſſadours, moſt prudently did alledge, <hi>viz</hi> The Office of the Members would be confuſed; all would languiſh; their Order would be diſturbed, and the diſſolution of the whole body muſt neceſſarily enſue. If his Maieſty will have ought of moment acted within the Kingdome, may not his pleaſure be better ſignified, to thoſe that are over the ſame, as is uſuall in all Nations? The Provinciall Rulers have ever had ſuch reſpect from kings, that the Royal Mandates are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to them for execution according to right, or advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if Noxious or unjuſt: How much more unſeemly is it to over-paſſe them to whom the care of the whole Kingdome is committed? yet ſo it is moſtly that the firſt underſtanding muſt be from others, and that Letters are heaped to divers perſons from whom moſt favour may be expected, not for what is expedient for the King and Kingdome but themſelves. A certaine perſon is ſaid to have brought Letters out of <hi>Poland</hi> not long ſince ſurreptitiouſly obtained from the King, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent payment of a certaine ſumm of Dollars as a due debt which ſumm had been ſatisfied ſome yeares before: Do not ſuch Letters deſerve regard? Some are brought into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome manifeſtly taxing the Prince and others of Infidelity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Majeſty, the names concealed, tending to incite, the Popularity eſpecially, to inſurrection, by which like inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, probably the Governour of <hi>Finland</hi> hath dared to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the whole Kingdome of <hi>Suethland:</hi> The King conſented; yet doubtleſſe not of his owne accord, but by the counſels of wicked men, and to his owne and the kingdomes detriment. For, then diſcord, nothing is more pernicious in kingdomes, (eſpecially) if it proceed ſo far that by one faction he thinks to oppreſſe that which (but undeſervedly) he conceives to be another. But thus in deſtroying one by another, he ruines the kingdome, even his Country.</p>
                              <p>The examples of <hi>France</hi> and the Netherlands alledged by the Lords Ambaſſadors, ſerve here very fitly: For the <hi>French</hi> fell not into ſo many Calamities by any Nationall diſobedience towards their King, but by the quotidian, violent ſubtle ſnares ſet for expulſion of the Proteſtant Religion; whence that kingdome was ſo many years afflicted with mutuall Slaughters, Rapines, Rapes, Incendiariſmes, Sacriledges, and mens minds ſo exaſperated, that a Civill War ſeemed to be rendred perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: And whileſt one Party endeavoured a Propagation, the other a defence of Religion, no roome for Religion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be left by either; the blood of their Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109514:41"/>
partly extirpated: And they thus tearing out each others bowells, a third invades, pretending indeed Religion, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more gaping after the <hi>Gallican</hi> Dominion, as being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to have kingdomes fall to his ſhare for reimburſement of Coſts:</p>
                              <p>But return we to <hi>Flemingius</hi> who in time of peace, enrolls, aſſembles, entertaines Forces; to what end? meerly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume what the Enemies have left, to deſtroy thoſe Subjects whom the Wars had ſpared: Infinites of them complaining that their marrow, blood, and bones are ſuckt. Let his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty be moved with the miſeries of <hi>Finland,</hi> which bordering on the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> was made the Seat of War moſtly by our owne, and likewiſe expoſed to the Enemies incurſions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations, but now more calamitouſly exhauſted by waging and entertaing a not neceſſary Souldiery: The King is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Oath to protect and vindicate the Innocent and the Needy from all Injuries whatſoever, and to preſerve the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like peace.</p>
                              <p>How much more prudently may his Majeſty aboliſh, not nouriſh diſcord by the miſery of the Subject, wherewith doubtleſſe God is offended? Let his Majeſty command a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Armes, and that all Controverſies may be judicially deſided: To reſtrain Compatriotall hands from mutuall Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres is the part of a moſt Excellent, Pious, and Chriſtian King: Let his Majeſty write and command things honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for himſelfe and the kingdome, Obedience ſhall follow: for ſuch as are other let a ſuſpenſion be permitted: And as <hi>Mahetas</hi> appealed from the ſentence of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> to the ſame King better informed; even ſo the <hi>Suethes:</hi> His Highneſſe and the Senators do moreover beſeech that during his Majeſties Raigne and his Highneſſe Vice-gerency aſſiſted with the Senatoriall Counſells, the kingdomes Lawes may not ſuffer ſubvertion.</p>
                              <p>When <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, after Royall Entertainment in <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Francis</hi> then there Raigning, had at the requeſt of the ſaid King created ſome Knights and Barons, their Honours were afterwards diſputed and concluded invalid, becauſe confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in anothers Dominion, wherein he had not Right of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, the Dignity of each Realme ſalved. For thoſe Rights are no where preſerved but in the kingdome where they are legitimate; tranſported abroad they are eaſily obſcured. <hi>Suethland</hi> hath written Lawes and famous Conſtitutions from the times of Queen <hi>Margaret Ericke</hi> the 13th. <hi>Albert</hi> and other Kings, not aboliſhed nor antiquated, wherein is expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that the Kingdomes Affaires ſhall in the Regall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, be adminiſtred by the Native Counſellours, Peers, and great Officers of the ſame: Neither are the Royall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109514:42"/>
when given without the Kingdome, to be obeyed further then they ſhall by the Counſell be approved, and this is ratified by evident Lawes, Regall Oathes, and Hereditary Covenants. Writings are extant between King <hi>Guſtavus</hi> and <hi>Ericke</hi> the 14th. his Son, whereby (upon his intended Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age for <hi>England,</hi> to have matched with <hi>Elizabeth</hi> that Nations Queen) he was expreſly bound to refer all the Affaires of <hi>Suethland</hi> unto the King his Father, or he being dead, to the Vice-gerent and the Senators: And when afterwards he ſhould the ſecond time have undertaken the like, to commit them to <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Finland,</hi> Governour (afterwards King) of <hi>Suethland,</hi> together with the Senators.</p>
                              <p>Let it be moreover conſidered, how fully and ſufficiently either Realm was provided for at the marriage of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> with Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that the Pre-eminency and Dignity of each might be preſerved entire, and not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with the Kings Perſon into a ſtrange Kingdome: Yet both are hereditary; but the Argument expreſſed in our Laws, is much more forcible; for the King is obliged, even here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, to govern <hi>Suethland</hi> by the counſel of the native Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, not ſtrangers; how much more therefore when remote and neceſſitated to uſe the Eyes and Ears of others? the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators alſo of this Kingdome are tyed by Oath to admoniſh the king ſeriouſly and frequently to preſerve the kingdomes Laws and Royalty unviolate, which albeit it be no eaſie task: yea, for the moſt part undeſervedly dangerous, yet they have willingly undergone it, and diſcharged their parts at his Majeſties being here; ſo as the Ambaſſadors preſent trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble might have been ſpared, if time had been then improved; for the kingdomes affaires were begun to be treated with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and due diligence; but hardly could the Inauguration be proceeded unto without great difficulty and longer conteſt then was meet about things not ambiguous, formerly ſworne unto and confirmed. The forme of Government, by diverſe counſells and alterations was protracted even to the time of departure, no conſent of the Senate concurring; and it was manifeſtly purpoſely ſo done by advice of perſons not well affected to this Kingdome, or ignorant of affaires, or fit to be ejected from the Reſults of <hi>Suethland:</hi> or laſtly, ſuch as had ſecretly concluded, the Kingdome ſhould be Governed by the rule of Succeſſion, but the <hi>Suethes</hi> by that of Servitude: This they deteſt, the other they ſubmit unto, and will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine unviolably, as the bond of their Liberties preſervation and increaſe, not of obtruſion of ſlavery, which the heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Covenants do clearly demonſtrate.</p>
                              <p>No Taxe or Tribute was commanded in that Parliament, but a voluntary ſupply tendred according to the Legall form
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109514:42"/>
for cauſes in the Law expreſſed; <hi>Viz.</hi> Repairing the charges of War.</p>
                              <p>The matter of money, as of no great concernment, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgotten; for the priviledge of coining hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded to ſeverall Princes and Cities without violation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie: At <hi>Vaſtena</hi> money is coined with the conjoined names of his Majeſty and the Prince his brother, with which impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the King his Father had coined, in ſigne of Concord, at the beginning of his Raigne, and ſoone after voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the ſaid priviledge upon the Duke his brother during life.</p>
                              <p>This is the anſwer thought meet to be given to the Lords Ambaſſadors, and it is moſt earneſtly deſired that the ſame may be accepted without offence to his Majeſty, whom the State and Orders of the Kingdome do honour and reverence with all integrity and fidelity, and albeit the ſame be at length, yet is it not that the <hi>Suethes</hi> are obliged to render ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to any but his Majeſtie, and (he) within the Kingdome, but that their cleerneſs from the treaſon tacitely implied may appeare to all the World. Sundry other Stigma's are caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>Sudercopian</hi> Tranſaction, which by this Kingdomes Lawes and Statutes will be eaſily evinced: Albeit they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the States and Orders of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania</hi> for fellow Subjects under the moſt juſt Empire of one and the ſame King, yet not for Judges: The ſaid Orders may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that his Highneſſe and thoſe of <hi>Suethen</hi> diſſent not from them in any thing; but leaſt in the love of concord, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of diſſention; nor can ought be more acceptable to them then a compoſure of all differences by an equall and mutuall moderation. It may be effected if the Councell of whom it behoves may be admitted, waving threats from the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned who feare them not. Otherwiſe if the controverſie (which God forbid) muſt be decided by Armes, not onely the King and Prince themſelves, but the neighbour Princes and Territories alſo may be diſturbed, perhaps with great prejudice to the Regall Family, for what ſide ſoever ſhould win, it would be to him detrimentall, as many times in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Warr both Parties, being weakned, do eaſily become a prey to any third.</p>
                              <p>The Orders therefore of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania</hi> are in loving and brotherly manner deſired by his Highneſſe and the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of <hi>Suethland,</hi> as a thing worthy of their prudence, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and mutuall ſociety, becoming fellows and friends, the Ambaſſadors likewiſe intervening to endeavour the eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this ſuſpition from the mind of his Majeſty who is King and Lord of both the Peoples: And that themſelves alſo will eject it, and will intreat, admoniſh, and conjure his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:109514:43"/>
Majeſty not to be induced by the Counſell of wicked perſons to the meditating of any hurt to this kingdome, nor ſuffer his Royall mind to be alienated from his Paternall Soil; And that they will conſider not in what way of Religion the <hi>Suethes</hi> worſhip God, but with what fidelity and ſincerity they reverence their King.</p>
                              <p>The Ambaſſadors deſire an abrogation of things contrary to the Lawes, and the ſame is inſtantly ſought by his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and the Senators. Let the heads of the <hi>Suethiſh</hi> Law, whereby the King and Subjects are mutually bound by Oath, be ſcrutinized, ſo as the leaſt deviation may eaſily be found, and the generall Concluſion followes in theſe words: <hi>We</hi> (viz.) <hi>The Subjects are obliged to our Soveraigne in true obedience;</hi> That is, to obey his command in all things feaſible, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and man he ought to command, and we to obey, ſaving his Rights and our owne. At <hi>Sudercopia</hi> nothing was concluded repugnant to the Lawes and Statutes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome confirmed by Oath. If any think otherwiſe let thoſe be Judges and Arbitrators; they are not obſcure, ambiguous, nor abrogated, but ſometimes Sacramentally Corroborated. No Article is annulled by Hereditary Succeſſion, onely the Election altered into a right of Devolution. To this Scale thoſe Tranſactions are ſubmitted: The Duke and Senate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not to render an account to a moſt mild and gracious King. Let the <hi>Suethes</hi> adhaere to and without blame enjoy the Lawes and Priviledges acquired by their owne and their Anceſtors great Merits, which his Majeſty hath ſworne to preſerve; and let him then (as we deſire and hope he will) with the ſame patience that a <hi>Macedonian</hi> King reviewed a private cauſe, examine that of his moſt ancient and now He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary kingdome within the Paternall Soil: And ſo lend an eare to Accuſers as not to refuſe another to them unpoſſeſſed of Calumny: And they do hope that the Orders of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania</hi> are ſo equall toward all men, as themſelves will not onely forbeare ſuſpition in the future, but evidence the innocency of the <hi>Suethes</hi> to others alſo. If otherewiſe, and that for private profit and favour they will have no regard unto their innocency, it may produce danger; one mans damage being ſometimes hurtfull to his Neighbour. <hi>Poland</hi> is a flouriſhing kingdome, and may it ever flouriſh: Neither doth this want Monuments of having flouriſhed: If now it appeare waſted by a continued War, what wonder? What Kingdome or Common-Weale hath waged War full thirty ſix years with its owne Forces and charge and is not waſted, ſo as it may ſeem fit for any obtruſion? Nevertheleſſe the ſaid Orders are perſwaded that as a rapid overflowing River, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring ſome of the largeſt Trees, felled in the neighbour
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:109514:43"/>
grounds, hurries them into the ſame precipice: So the fall or leaſt mutation of the ancient State or Government of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent kingdomes, draws others with it into ruine.</p>
                              <p>The Prince and Senate do therefore heartily deſire the States and Orders of <hi>Poland,</hi> to interpoſe their power with his Majeſty, that regard may be had to this defence, and that they will employ their Wealth and Fortunes and what elſe is dear unto them, for the preſervation, not the ſubverſion of Lawes and Priviledges, then which there cannot be a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger confirmation of the Royall Scepter; or way more dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for retention and encreaſe of the Royall Dignity of a two-fold Crowne, nor ought more worthy of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nation, for the Vindicators of liberty and the maintainers of priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, have ever been in laudable eſtimation: And therefore it is not feared that they will go about to obtrude upon others, what they would account to be unjuſt if done unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The <hi>Suethes</hi> have alwaies much eſteemed the <hi>Polanders,</hi> and will with them, if need ſhall be, defend his Royal Majeſty with the hazards of their lives and fortunes, and fixed upon the Regall Oath, will, with the <hi>Polanders</hi> remaine conſtantly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and obedient toward their King, and willingly on their part preſerve the ancient Concord between the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, ſaving to each their right: And do returne offers of readineſſe and propenſity to all Offices of love unto the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and Orders of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the great Dukedome of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania,</hi> to whom they deſire to be in moſt reſpective manner remembred, and do entreat that this anſwer may be received in good part, according to the time, as being wholly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for their own defence, no way intended for reproaching or inveighing. To conclude, a quiet Navigation with proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous winds and happy returne unto their Principalls and Friends is wiſhed to the Lords Ambaſſadors, by his Highneſſe and the Senate.</p>
                              <p>This was the ſubſtance of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ambaſſadoriall Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of the replyes made thereunto by Duke <hi>Charles</hi> and the Senators of <hi>Suethland;</hi> Who nevertheleſſe do ſay, that this Legation was inſtituted to no other end then the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Sudercopian</hi> Concluſions, thoſe Ambaſſadors di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging that the ſayd Aſſembly was much derogatory to the Royall Majeſty and Authority, and by their perverſe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion procured the ſudden breaking forth of formerly buryed diſſentions, which brought many to their laſt end with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable miſchiefs upon <hi>Suethland, Finland,</hi> and <hi>Leiſland:</hi> When the Duke therefore ſaw that, for his labour and love toward his Countrey and Nephew, hee was requited with ſuch ingratitude, and that the Embaſſie fore-mentioned, was accompanied with ſo many prejudices to the Nation, not

                              <p>That the Army of Aliens, whereof his Dilection complained ſo much, ſhould be diſcharged in time convenient: eſpecially when his Dominion, Subjects, Forts, Army, Navy, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and other things rightly belonging unto him were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. But it was evident that his Dilection, with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous power, raiſed in his owne Dukedomes, was come againſt him, exhauſting his Subjects with exactions and payments, ſo as, in his owne Kingdome he could not enjoy his peculiar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues: And that all things might be wanting to him and his Regall Traine in his Progreſſe; his owne Souldiers were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, ſeduced, and entertained by the adverſe party, by all which things it was evident by whoſe default the Countries ſubſtance was conſumed.</p>
                              <p>That concerning his Dilections deſire of ſecurity from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Injuſtice, and the leaving of all diſcords to the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of ſincere Neutrall Arbitrators, he had formerly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that, having attained the yeares of diſcretion, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what the Municipall Law adviſed in that caſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he reſolved to adhere, and accordingly to protect his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection

himſelfe within the Caſtle, leaſt that, if any tumult ſhould happen between the two Armies, or his Majeſtie chance into the Navy approaching, ſome danger, contrary to his deſire, might befall him; and that if ought thereof did accrue to his Majeſties perſon, Army, or Fleet, himſelfe was blameleſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and the World, as having given timely warning whereby to prevent any ſuch misfortune, if credite had been attributed to his Counſell rather then to the pernicious inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and ſeducements of wicked men; herewith he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Majeſty to the Divine protection.

Herewith he proteſted that unleſſe the ſame were granted within the ſpace of two houres, and that any tumult ſhould break forth between the two Armies to the detriment of his Majeſty and his followers, his Kingdome or people, he was innocent thereof before God and the world; theſe, as aforeſaid were dated from his Campe the eighth of <hi>September,</hi> 1598.</p>
                              <p>About foure daies after, King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> ſent Letters of <note place="margin">King <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund.</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer aſsecutori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> Aſſecuration, containing that whereas the moſt Illuſtrious Duke <hi>Charles</hi> had divulged rumours of his arrivall into the Land with an extraneous Army to the ſpoyling of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the offering of violence to his Highneſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,

and by thoſe rumours had drawn unto his party many of his Servants and Subjects, who daily flocked unto him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe minds the Duke had injected and ſpread a great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of his approach, albeit he had declared by many former Letters that he was returned into his Native Kingdome and Country, not to wage War, but as a rightfull King, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſerved nor apprehended any Rebellion, in peaceable manner, according to their joynt deſires and requeſts, as might be teſtified by ſeverall Letters, which intention of his might have given them ſufficient ſatisfaction: Nevertheleſſe to the end his candour and ſincerity might appeare, and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe to inteſtine diſcord by a Civill War: If the Duke would forth with reſigne up and reſtore unto him his Servants, Souldiers, Kingdome, Houſes, Territories, Navy, and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, with all other things belonging to him and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as alſo the Captives and Servants of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, would in like manner disband his Troops, retire and remaine quiet in his Dukedomes, appeare readily (when ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) in Judgment, with ſuch of his followers as were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to blame, and thereof give preſent aſſecuration: He alſo would (as by theſe his Letters Patents he now did) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and enſure the diſmiſſion of his alien forces, and would not attempt any violence againſt his Highneſſe, his people, or Servants, but permit every one to enjoy the benefit of the Lawes of <hi>Suethland</hi> conforme to reaſon and Juſtice, and that all perſons adhering to himſelfe, againſt whom his Highneſſe might have any cauſe of complaint ſhould reciprocally appear in Judgment.

That the diſpute was not about Pears or Apples, but that the well-fare of his Majeſty and himſelfe, of the Realme and people were therein concerned.

                              <p>He therefore admoniſhed his Highneſſe to ſur-ceaſe theſe courſes, and to permit unto him the free enjoyment of his owne: that otherwiſe he ſhould have cauſe to proteſt if ſo manifeſt unjuſtice produced any misfortune; That he deſired never theleſſe to underſtand what his Highneſſe intended by his proteſting, and whereat the ſame aimed, that ſo he might accommodate his Intereſt thereunto.

That he thought not the hurt of any perſon, but was willing to give clear teſtimony to all men of his Kingly clemency and favour. He therefore deſired his Highneſſe to weigh the whole matter ſeriouſly, and not to make intollerable and diſhonourable overtures, which would not conduce to peace and concord, but afford more ample cauſe of ſtrife, which he prayed God to divert, and profeſſed he for his part would decline.</p>

                              <p>Laſtly, that nothing on his part might be wanting, as if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable conditions for Peace and Concord were by him reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, he willingly conſented to the meeting of ſo many honeſt men, of the Equeſtriall and Military Order, as his Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, with thoſe that his Majeſty ſhould aſſigne, for a full deciſion of all matters; and that he wiſhed for nothing more, then to be admitted to a perſonal conference with his Majeſty, whereby he hoped to cleer himſelfe to his Majeſties ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                     <p>Duke <hi>Charles</hi> and the <hi>Suethes</hi> (as themſelves aſſert) had <note place="margin">Further aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> then both cauſe and advantage ſufficient to have utterly ruined their Advarſaries, yet they ſuffered themſelves to be entreated, to ſhew more mercy and mildneſſe then they had deſerved, by abſtaining from that revenge was then in their power to have taken, upon King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> with his whole <note place="margin">Vide Exegis Hiſtoriaca Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae, page 233, 234.</note> Army, to the great detriment and misfortune (I uſe their owne words) of themſelves and the Kingdome of <hi>Suethland,</hi> as hoping for better things in the future from King <hi>Sigiſmun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> from whom they found worſe by an enſuing cruell War with the <hi>Polanders</hi> and <hi>Lithuanians,</hi> touching a finall end, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no certaine conjecture could be made: But that, if they had (as then they affirme they might) deſtroyed him and his Forces, thoſe tumults had happily ſooner ceaſed, and many gallant men, who afterwards periſhed in thoſe Wars, had ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Nor had his Highneſſe and themſelves been defamed by ſo many unjuſt aſperſory Libells as were ſpread in all parts, which nevertheleſſe they hoped to confute: All which things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſuffering King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> then (ſay they) to eſcape, to the further proſecution of his Country, contrary to the practiſe of all Magnanimous Potentates, who expoſe their lives to defend theirs from Spoile and Rapine.</p>
                     <p>The cruell fight being over, King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> entred into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with the Duke for the reſtoring and confirming of mutuall friendſhip, brotherly confidence, with adminiſtration of right and juſtice between his Majeſty and his Highneſſe, whereof I give here the heads onely, referring (as in all Nara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Acts) the more curious to the Inſtrument it ſelf, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Lincopia</hi> the twenty eighth of <hi>September,</hi> 1598.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:109514:57"/>
with hatred or inclemency, nor any of the Ducall Miniſters for obeying his Commands; nor that he would animadvert into the Anthors of what had paſt, or puniſh any perſon for the ſame, but would beare and extend unto the Duke and thoſe aforeſaid, all Royall benignity and favour, and would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by force or fraud, by himſelfe or others, openly or ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, within or without the Kingdome, act, move, or give way to any deceitfull practiſes which might procure hurt or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, either in bodies or Eſtates unto the ſaid Prince, his Wife, Children, Miniſters, Subjects, or pertakers, nor to any of the Regall Subjects who had ſided with his Highneſſe, of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dignity, degree, or condition they were.</p>
                     <p>He likewiſe profeſſed and promiſed to governe (the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) according to the Lawes of <hi>Suethland;</hi> his Regall Oath, and Manuall ſecurity given at his Inauguration, and to remit the deciding and compoſing of all differences untill the enſuing Parliament, the ſame to be celebrated within foure moneths, before neutrall Arbitrators, ſuch as Imperiall, Regall, Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and Ducall Ambaſſadors, who were to be invited by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Thoſe differences eſpecially to be then determined, as could not otherwiſe be wel ended between the Native <hi>Suethes:</hi> But that no deciſion Legall or other ſhould be inſtituted, nor was needfull, between himſelfe and the Duke, all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies between them being buried by a perpetuall <hi>Amnestia.</hi> That whatſoever had been generally concluded, tranſacted, and agreed upon, ſhould not be ſeparately anſwered for by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular perſon, but the generality be admitted to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a reaſon thereof. That whatſoever in future Parliaments ſhould be eſtabliſhed, was to be allowed and accepted of, and each one permitted to uſe and enjoy the ſame without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or moleſtation.</p>
                     <p>That all Priſoners and others of either party, ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to appeare and anſwer in Parliament when called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: Forraigne Forces whether in Feild or Fort, ſhould be forth with diſmiſſed, the Regall Court and perſonall Guard excepted, which ſhould not exceed the number formerly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Kingdome: All the Natives, Horſe and Foot, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the King, ſhould be paid and disbanded, each to return home; the Duke to do the like to thoſe of his ſide.

                     <p>He further gratiouſly promiſed, that publication of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,

and declarations for the clearing of his Uncle from all Crimes whereof he had been aſperſed, with ſerious Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for all men to lay downe their Armes and to embrace Peace and Concord, ſhould be made in all Provinces and parts of the Kingdome: It was alſo granted that the Dukes Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Subjects might ſecurely paſſe and repaſſe through all the parts thereof, about their Maſters or their owne lawfull Affaires, they behaving themſelves peaceably, not raiſing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; the like liberty and ſecurity was to be enjoyed by the Regall Subjects and Miniſters within the Ducall Territories. That all things pre-mentioned being thus effected, his Uncle did in like manner confirme to reſtore unto him, upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to <hi>Stocholme</hi> (whither he ſpeedily intended) and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit into his poſſeſſion his Forts, Navy, Ordinance, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things belonging unto him and the Crowne of <hi>Suethland,</hi> which had been committed unto his Dilection, and were until then in his poſſeſſion, the ſame to be no way abuſed to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of his Dilection or the Country. All which the Premiſſes he confirmed under his hand and Seal, concluding that, if ought contrary thereunto ſhould be acted, or any receſſe therefrom made, either by himſelfe or his Uncle, the Orders of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome had thereby power and right to oppoſe and reſiſt the party violating. Given as aforeſaid at <hi>Lincopia</hi> the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>September,</hi> 1598.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Covenants thus ratified, Duke <hi>Charles</hi> gave order to <note place="margin">Shipping reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> the Admirall and Commanders of the Fleet, to deliver up the Ships and Ordinance to the King (no man doubting of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable obſervation of this Treaty) that ſo he might be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from <hi>Stegeburg,</hi> according to the Regall Honour and Dignity.

                        </note> of <hi>Suethland</hi> expected that the King had been upon his courſe towards <hi>Stocholme,</hi> to adminiſter Juſtice to every one, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to this <hi>Lincopian</hi> Tranſaction, and there to ſummon the Parliament; they underſtood that he had ſteered firſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Calmar,</hi> and thence into <hi>Poland</hi> with the Ships and Guns, and contrary to his Oath had furniſhed <hi>Calmar</hi> with a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Aliens: this being his third diceſſion from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> (ſay they) having thus tranſgreſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Lincopian</hi> Treaty, as he had alſo broken all his former Oathes and promiſes, the Orders of <hi>Suethland</hi> did thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves to be abſolved from their Oath of Fidelity, as being bound by the ſaid Treaty to proſecute the Violater of that agreement; and the rather becauſe the Strangers gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoned in <hi>Calmar</hi> demeaned themſelves in hoſtile manner: as alſo for that King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> deſigned thoſe Ships and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon a Naval expedition from <hi>Dantzig</hi> toward <hi>Elſenburg,</hi>

for the ſubduction of that place from the Crowne of <hi>Suethland,</hi> and the more commodious annoyance thereof from thence with cruell War (if his intention had ſucceeded) thereby to obtrude his perverſe Religion upon them, and to remit that Fort into the hands of ſtrangers, as he had done by <hi>Calmar;</hi> and that the <hi>Finlanders</hi> then quiet, were againe by him ſtirred up, ſo as the <hi>Suethes</hi> were neceſſitated to reſume their Armes, whereby floods of blood enſued, in which many of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives periſhed: And albeit King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> had many times promiſed thoſe <hi>Finlanders,</hi> aide from <hi>Poland,</hi> yet he onely decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and brought them to ruine: But ere we proceed, let us returne to ſee what entercourſes did paſſe between King <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi> and Duke <hi>Charles</hi> after the fore-ſpecified <hi>Lincopian</hi> Treaty.</p>

                        </note> ſame was by his Highneſſe, with approbation of the Orders of the Kingdome, convened at <hi>Jenecopia</hi> in <hi>February,</hi> 1599. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was treated of the concernments of the Nation; The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars leſſe neceſſary to be here inſerted, I ſhall omit and only touch ſome heads more pertinent to the preſent matter, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the further curious to the Act it ſelfe.</p>

                     <p>In the ſeventh, they expreſſe, that whereas in the late <hi>Linco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Treaty it was promiſed that Imperiall, Regall, Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and Ducall Ambaſſadors ſhould be of both ſides invited, to examine and decide all differences, which was not yet done; that therefore, unleſſe his Majeſty ſhould make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe within foure moneths, they did conſent and conclude to meete at <hi>Stocholme,</hi> the 24th of <hi>May</hi> enſuing, in full Parliament, and conforme to the <hi>Guſtauian</hi> Teſtament, and the written Lawes of <hi>Suethland,</hi> the other Orders of the Kingdome being thither called and appearing, would examine the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in reference to thoſe perverſe &amp; turbulent perſons who had been Authors of the Nations troubles, whereby the guilty might receive condign puniſhment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things with proteſtations of fidelity to his Highneſſe as their governour, and the reſiſting and diverting (with their lives and fortunes) all prejudice that might be intended againſt his perſon, his Conſort and Children, were concluded at <hi>Jenecopia</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109514:60"/>
they contained, and retorted back with a recapitulation of things paſt, taxing likewiſe his departure, which, he affirmed, his Majeſty had not been forced unto by tempeſt, as had been pretended; And that, in the Port of <hi>Bareſund,</hi> Order was given to all thoſe that attended his Majeſty to ſteere toward <hi>Calmar</hi> and not to <hi>Stocholme:</hi> He deſired to be certified (the time prefixed at <hi>Lincopia</hi> for the celebrating of the promiſed Parliament being almoſt elapſed) whether his Majeſty were ſtill of the ſame mind, and that a certain time and place might be appointed: He taxed the King of ſtirring up tumults in <hi>Finland;</hi> Of proteſting by his Miniſters in <hi>Denmark</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that he was not obliged to ſtand to the agreement made between them; Of deſignes againſt himſelfe and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Suethland,</hi> as was evident by the Letters of <hi>Sparre,</hi> and <hi>Bechus</hi> ſent to his Majeſty, but intercepted and brought to him; And by the ſecret Plottings of the Princeſſe <hi>Anna</hi> with Count <hi>Axell,</hi> by her Servant <hi>Ericke George,</hi> ſhewing that his Majeſty no way intended that theſe unfaithfull Counſellours ſhould be brought to tryall, but to procure their ſafety ſome other way: That in the meane time thoſe Counſellours, with others of their faction, ſhould be kept in convenient cuſtody, but that if his Majeſty did uſe further protraction he ſhould be compelled to proceed againſt them according to the Lawes of <hi>Suethland.</hi> Theſe were dated from <hi>Jenecopia</hi> the firſt of <hi>February:</hi> 1599.</p>
                     <p>THis letter was accompanied by one of the ſame date <note place="margin">Letter to King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Suethland.</hi>
                        </note> from the Orders of the Kingdome of <hi>Suethland,</hi> wherein, after a rememoration of all things that had paſt ſince the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they deſired his Majeſty to ſuppreſſe his tumults ſprung up in <hi>Finland</hi> and <hi>Leifland;</hi> to commit the Offices of the Kingdome to Natives not to Strangers; to bring the Authors of thoſe troubles to puniſhment; To governe the Kingdome according to his Regall Oath, the Lawes of <hi>Sueth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>Sudercopian</hi> decrees, and other laudable tranſactions, and that (in all caſes) the written Lawes might be obſerved; To ſecure them that neither for the preſent nor the future he would attempt any Mutation of Religion, as had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done contrary to their opinion of his Majeſty: That he would returne to them as beſeemed a meeke and gratious Prince, not attended by forraigne Forces: That his aboad amongſt them would be an aſſured argument of his yeelding to theſe their juſt requeſts; And that the ſpeedy effecting thereof was their moſt earneſt deſire: But that, if his Majeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies condition were ſuch as he could not be reſident with them, and that frequent returnes into the Kingdome would be more troubleſome then the State thereof could beare, they humbly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109514:61"/>
beſought him that in regard his moſt deare Son was (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">The Prince his Son invited to be there educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Crown.</note> to the hereditary union, from which they were reſolved not to vary) the next Heire to the Crown, he would be pleaſed to ſend the ſaid Prince his Son to receive his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation within that Kingdome, in the true Chriſtian Religion and other Princely vertues, under the tuition of his neereſt of bloud, and other faithfull perſons, whereby he might in time become capable of the government and ſo manage the ſame as might tend chiefly to the honour of God and the good and welfare of their moſt deare Countrey: Promiſing that if he would ſo do they would continue, even to the death, his Majeſties moſt faithfull and obedient Subjects; And (as their dutie did in like manner oblige) to the young Prince, as to their hereditary King: And that as they hoped his Majeſty would grant this their juſt and ſincere Petition, ſo they with equall humility and obſervancie entreated that his Majeſty would releaſe and ſend back certain innocent perſons, <hi>viz. George Claudius, Olaus Hard, Andreas Sweno</hi> and others, who, contrary to his Regall Oath, right, and Juſtice, had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned and conveighed out of the Countrey.

Thus farr (omitting the Criminations at the beginning) out of the letter it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Hereunto King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> returned no anſwer, but more <note place="margin">No anſwer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</note> then ever (ſay they) by open force and ſecret practices ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up diſcord and diſſention within the Kingdome; For <note place="margin">Parliament at <hi>Stocholme.</hi>

Land, partly becauſe ſtranger Princes had been preferred to the Crowne of <hi>Suethland,</hi> who exerciſed much violence and tyranny toward the <hi>Suethes;</hi> partly alſo becauſe concord could ſeldome flouriſh among the Kingdomes native Colonies, whilſt the choice and election of Kings reſted in the <hi>Swethiſh</hi> Patriall Families, according to the cuſtomary Lawes of the Kingdom, and that the Royall Diadem did not diſcend to any certaine race; wherefore it had been thought neceſſary to pitch upon the linage of ſome certaine Family, whereon the Regall Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity might be ſetled for ever, ſo long as it ſhould pleaſe God that any one of the Male iſſue thereof ſhould remaine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the entrance into ſuch diſſenſions (in <hi>Suethland)</hi> might be for ever cloſed; and that they had not found any more worthy of that Regall eminency, nor who had better deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Diadem, both for himſelf and his Succeſſors, then their then preſent King <hi>Guſtavus (Erikson)</hi> as who through Divine aſſiſtance, had with exceeding diligence, toyle, and care, and many hazards of his Perſon, freed their Countrey from the ſervitude, it groaned under, of forraine Kings, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored all the Orders of the Kingdome, from the higheſt to the loweſt, to their ancient condition and liberty; and not that alone, but had likewiſe delivered the ſame from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable yoak of Romiſh Superſtition, and in ſtead of that falſe worſhip, had reſtored the true Evangelicall Doctrine, conforme to the Divine Word, whereunto he had alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Succeſſors to adhere, as they would avoyd the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall loſſe of their Soules: The preſent Parliament did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelves obliged to obſerve the ſame, as they had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done by the Crowning of <hi>Ericke</hi> his eldeſt Son after his deceaſe, and he, for moſt cruell tyranny and unworthy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, being with his Succeſſors worthily deprived of the Scepter, the ſame had been conferred upon Duke <hi>John</hi> the ſecond Son of King <hi>Guſtavus</hi> with his Male iſſue, and he deceaſing, upon the preſent King <hi>Sigiſmundus,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the juſt objections they had for his imbracing the Romiſh Superſtition (contrary to the Godly admonitions left by his Grand-father) as alſo for his accepting a forraine Crowne without the knowledge and conſent of the Orders of <hi>Sueth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with conditions ſo prejudicall to his native Conntrey as the ſame would never have admitted, and his departure ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from without their privity.</p>
                     <p>But not to inſiſt here upon all their criminations, conſiſting <note place="margin">Rejection of King <hi>Sigiſm.</hi>
                        </note> moſtly of things formerly mentioned, that Parliament fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declared that, for the ſayd reaſons, and for that King <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmundus</hi> had not daigned to returne any anſwer to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſignified unto him from <hi>Jenecopia</hi> the preceding Winter, they had unanimouſly and with one conſent concluded not to

acknowledge him any longer for their King, or to be thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward obedient or ſubject to his government, but renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, and reſumed and diſſolved their Oath of fidelity and obedience wherein they had been hitherto bound by Law and the Acts of Hereditary union. That albeit they had juſt cauſe to remove in like manner his Heirs Males from the Crown, yet would not they impute the faults of the Father to the Son, but had and did thereby decree to accept and receive Prince <hi>

                     <p>But that if his Majeſty ſhould not do what before expreſſed within the prefixed times, they would then alſo reject him, ſo as neither he nor his Heirs ſhould ever be admitted to ſway the Scepter of <hi>Suethland,</hi> but as the Father, ſo the Son to be forever deprived thereof, themſelves being the cauſers of their preſcription from the Royall Throne, and their own diſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of all Authority and Dignity in <hi>Suethland,</hi> wherof the ſaid Orders were innocent before God and the World, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving adminiſtred the leaſt occaſion therunto.

                     <p>Thus much out of the Act it ſelfe concluded the twenty fourth of <hi>July,</hi> 1599. whereunto the further curious are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I ſhall onely adding as a preparatory to the next enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parliament, that in this it was degreed that when his Highneſſe the Duke ſhould return from <hi>Finland,</hi> whether the troubles there did call him, they would again convene in place convenient for the triall of thoſe Counſellours and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers then Priſoners, and on the guilty inflict deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and that the Duke and they had reſolved (for the

cleering of themſelves before all Chriſtian Monarchs and the whole World, that they proceeded not otherwiſe in that Affaire then right and juſtice required) to entreat certain Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> to ſend ſome men of probity and integrity into <hi>Suethland,</hi> not as Judges of controverſies but as Auditors onely: But if thoſe Ambaſſadors did defer their coming that themſelves would then proceed.</p>
                     <p>This Parliament ended, they (without delay) by Letters <note place="margin">Parliamentary Letters to King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> not anſwered.</note> of the thirtieth of the ſaid month advertiſed King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> of what had been therein concluded, and humbly deſired his Majeſty to declare himſelfe within the time limited: But to theſe Letters (ſay they) he returned no anſwer; Whereupon <note place="margin">Parliament at <hi>Lincopia.</hi>

                     <p>In this Convention the whole Orders of <hi>Suethland</hi> (as in the former they had done) did expreſly and abſolutely renounce King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> and his Government, as alſo his Son for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and Poſterity in caſe of his not being ſent into <hi>Suethland,</hi> within the time ſpecified in the former; They thereupon do likewiſe cleer his Highneſſe from affecting the Soveraignty or its Title, notwithſtanding the tender thereof unto him, and confirmed him for their Governour during the abſence, as alſo the minority of the Prince, if he ſhould come within the time, five months whereof were yet unexpired: And albeit (as they in the nineth Section or Pauſe of that Act, do acknowledge) Duke <hi>John</hi> the Brother of King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> was the next in <note place="margin">Dnke <hi>John</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.</note> right unto the Crowne according to the ſeverall (times fore-mentioned) hereditary Unions yet did they decline him, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt when he had attained the Regall Chaire, he might, moved thereunto by naturall affection to his Brother or his Heirs enter into ſuch Covenants and make ſuch tranſactions, as might be deſtructive to themſelves and to the Country, by joyning with them to revenge, upon Duke <hi>Charles</hi> or his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, thoſe things which in thoſe turbulent times had been acted in reference to King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> and his Family, and ſo the latter evill might be worſe then the former: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Dukedome of <hi>Oſtrogothes</hi> conferred on Duke <hi>John.</hi>

                     <p>And as in the eight Section or Pauſe of the ſaid Act they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Motives of their defection from King <hi>Sigiſmundus,</hi> as

                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover they have moſt wickedly ſlandered his Highneſſe unto his Majeſty, wherby many Calumnies have been divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Print and otherwiſe; themſelves having in their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſpread very many things, much tending to blemiſh the Honour, good Name, and Princely repute of his Highneſſe, which neither themſelves nor any other can prove.

therby bringing deſolation and devaſtation to the Country: Therfore we cannot judge otherwiſe but that they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the puniſhment, which the eighth Chapter in the Title of the moſt high Capitall Crimes, according to the Laws of <hi>Suethen,</hi> ordains to be inflicted on them in this form of words. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall raiſe an Army against the King or the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Kingdome, to ſurprize them at unawares, or to ſlay them, or ſhall attempt any violence or unjuſtice by Letters, Writings, Counſell, Endeavours, or Aſſiſtance, if taken in the Fact, ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the loſſe of life and goods:</hi> Wherunto is added in the ſame place, a Chapter of the Tenor enſuing. <hi>If any one ſhall bring a forraigne Army into his Native Soile, and wage unlawfull War againſt his lawfull Lord, by devaſting the Country, unleſſe in company of him who is legally promoted to the Government of the Kingdome, he with all his partakers are to be deprived of life, and their Estates to be for ever conſiſcated.</hi> But wheras they and others of the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will happily imagine that the ſaid recited Chapter of the <hi>Suethiſh</hi> Law, may be a help and excuſe unto them, becauſe it ſaith, unleſs they ſhall accompany the King lawfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Throne of the Kingdom: It is therfore to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered on the otherſide, that themſelves were the cauſers of all the troubles and effuſions of blood, (which to our grief) hath for ſome time overflowed the Country, &amp; it is to be feared that the ſame wound of diſſention may again feſter, unleſs by the divine goodneſs it be in mercy ſalved.

                     <p>It is hereby manifeſt that the pre-alledged Chapter of the Lawes of <hi>Suethen,</hi> doth no way cover or defend their Crime; but that we by vigour of the ſame text have legally pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to be deprived of their lives, their lands, their goods, and good names.</p>
                     <p>And we accordingly profeſs, that we all, jointly and ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, willingly and legally, by vertue of thoſe obligatorial letters which the moſt illuſtrious Duke <hi>Charles</hi> and we have given to each other interchangably, without hatred, envy, feare, or reſpect of any perſon, nor offering further then deſerved violence, have pronounced this Judgement and capitall Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and that we will conſtantly adhere thereunto both for the preſent and the future, and will acknowledge and maintaine the ſame before God and the Chriſtian World.

I will not, at preſent, ſpeak of the Paternall care exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted toward me by your Dilection in my Inſtruction and Education in all Chriſtian and Ducall Vertues: But deſire chiefly to be mindfull of the care exerciſed by your Dilection, leaſt I ſhould have fallen into the hands of Jeſuites, and have been ſeduced unto their moſt pernicious Religion. Wherfore ſeeing I can never be ſufficiently able to merit or requite that Fatherly care, diligence, and trouble; I will firſt and above all things, with all earneſtneſſe, crave of the moſt high God that he will pleaſe abundantly to returne the ſame upon your Dilection, your moſt loved Conſort, and your Illuſtrious Children, both in this life and that which is to come: In the mean time, I will diligently

endeavour by all manner of obedience and humility, to the utmoſt of my power, to make (at leaſt) ſome meaſure of requitall of that faithfulneſſe which your Dilection frequently hath and daily doth declare unto me. But whereas your Dilection did ſome daies paſt, propound unto my deliberation certain Articles, and hath gratiouſly required me to declare my reſolution upon them, as the Orders of the Kingdome have ſince done in like manner; I have therefore thought good to anſwer your deſires, humbly entreating your Dilection favourably to accept of, and interpret this my ſerious Reſolve, wherunto I have decreed to adhere conſtantly.</p>
                     <p>The Univerſal Orders of the Kingdome, moſt mighty Prince, beloved Lord and Uncle, in divers Parliamentary Conventions, as alſo in this preſent Aſſembly, have Unanimouſly and Concordially ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and received your Dilection for their Lord and Governour, unto whom henceforward, as to their natural and moſt beloved King, they have promiſed all obedience, due fidelity, ſecurity, and utmoſt aſsiſtance: In regard your Dilection, ſolely under God, hath been their Protector, who to the extream hazard of your life, trouble, and charge, have diligently endeavoured to free them from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall darkneſſe, and that external Yoake and Servitude which was impending over our heads; And that you have neither ſpared your Poſſeſſions nor life it ſelfe in watching for the Wel-fare and Emolument of us all, as well in ſpiritual as in temporal Affairs: And that you have preſerved and protected all and ſingular Clergy and Laiety, high and low, each according to his ſtate and condition in the Chriſtian Religion; And have governed them wholly according to the Lawes of <hi>Suethland</hi> and each ones rightly acquired Priviledges: The Orders therefore of this Kingdome have (I ſay) for theſe and other weighty conſiderations, as alſo by the Authority and Juriſdiction devolving unto

them from their Anceſtors, deſigned and made choice of your Dilection for our King: Which Election cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly I neither by my ſelfe nor others, openly or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, either now, or when I ſhall have attained the full age of twenty foure yeares, nor at any time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, will never endeavour to annihilate or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, but will alwaies reſt contented with thoſe things which have been at once and by all the Orders of the Kingdome unanimouſly conſtituted and decreed, and do willingly conſent that the Renovation of the Hereditary Union have that ſucceſſe which your Dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hath required from theſe Orders: In reference whereunto, if your Dilection ſhall change his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life (which God be pleaſed to prolong for many yeares) I will endeavour with all my might that no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury be done in any ſort unto your moſt beloved Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, or to your moſt Illuſtrious Children; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to my power wil procure that the moſt Illuſtrious Prince <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> my moſt beloved Brother may enjoy the Crown of <hi>Suethland:</hi> And if he ſhall deceaſe without legitimate Heires Males, I will in like manner endeavour that my moſt deare Brother the Prince <hi>Charolus Philippus</hi> be preferred to the vacant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Kingdome; towards each of whom I will ſo demean my ſelfe as becometh a moſt loving Brother. Wherefore I moſt humbly beſeeeh your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection to conſent at length to the deſires of the Orders of the Kingdome, and compaſsionating the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Country, ſpeedily accept of the Crown of <hi>Suethland;</hi> by meanes whereof your Dilection may eaſily free the Suethiſh Common-wealth from Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, Diſcords, and inteſtine Diſſentions, which otherwiſe may encreaſe unleſſe our Requeſts be ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably granted: Your Dilection may likewiſe attend the Government more ſecurely, and henceforward as heretofore procure the Kingdomes good.

                     <p>His Lordſhip underſtanding that the Commiſſioners for the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> had their reſidence at a little Town called <hi>Morung</hi> (in <hi>Pruſſia)</hi> forthwith diſpatched Letters to the Lord Chancellour <hi>Zadzicke</hi> (chief in the Commiſſion) to certifie his arrivall (as he alſo did to the Commiſſioners for <hi>Suethen</hi> at <hi>Elbing)</hi> and to crave their opinion whether it would be more <note place="margin">Writes to the Commiſſioners of the Crownes intereſſed.</note> neceſſary firſt to go and ſalute the King of <hi>Poland</hi> (then) at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> or to haſten towards the place nominated for the Treaty, being a Town in that Province named <hi>Holland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Chancellours anſwer was congratulatory, as well in <note place="margin">Anſwer of the Polanders.</note> regard of his wiſhed ſafe arrivall, as in conſideration that his Maſter the King of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> out of his ſincere affection to their King and State, had delegated him to this Treaty, (which he wiſhed might prove auſpicious) for the diverſion of the Tempeſt then likely to fall between them and the Crown of <hi>Suethland.</hi> He likewiſe wiſhed that his Lordſhip had arrived during the King of <hi>Polands</hi> late being at <hi>Dantzig,</hi> where he might, without further trouble to his perſon, have acquitted himſelf of what his Maſter had committed unto him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly have received a Princely anſwer; but that, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the trouble and diſtance of the waies had hindred his ſooner coming into thoſe parts, he believed there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:109514:80"/>
of undergoing the like moleſtation by a new journey to his Majeſty; to whom it would be moſt gratefull if his Lordſhip ſhould firſt repaire to the place appointed for the Treaty, there (by his Maſters authority and his own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours) to effect thoſe things that might be conducing to the matter in hand, and to their Princes dignity.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, He wiſhed that his Lordſhip having refreſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſome time, might come in ſafety to the place of meeting; concluding with offers of Service and Curteſies in ſuch caſes accuſtomed. By way of Poſtcript, he added, that at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of ſigning thoſe Letters, he was certified by their Subde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates, that the adverſe party had altered ſome things former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed upon, complaining that almoſt daily, from the 12th. of that preſent month, whereon they began to handle the <note place="margin">The Suethes complained of.</note> Preparatories, the other ſide had done nothing but protracted time by propounding new conditions, which courſe if they ſhould longer perſiſt in, themſelves ſhould be conſtrained (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt ſolemnly proteſted before the Mediators) to depart thence, and commit their King and Countries cauſe to the Divine Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>I have given this Letter at length to ſhew in what ſtate the buſineſſe was, and how far advanced, when his Lordſhip ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in thoſe parts, but ſhall not (in the courſe of this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) inſiſt ſo particularly on each of the ſeverall Letters that paſſed between his Lordſhip and the reſpective parties: <note place="margin">The Suethes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</note> My intention being to uſe as much brevity as the neceſſary circumſtances of the Treatie will permit.

                        <hi>Poland;</hi> and of the other, Earle <hi>Brake</hi> replyed, equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying and conjoyning wiſhes with wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Civill Courtſhips thus performed, the Electorall Ambaſſadors, to loſe no time, and to ſhew their authority and ſincerity, Exhibited their Credentialls to the Commiſſioners of both ſides: preallubly deſiring the like ſight of theirs, which the <hi>Poles</hi> would have declined, as not neceſſary, alleadging it was not to be imagined that Perſons of their quality would preſent themſelves in ſo publicke a cauſe without ſufficient power and authority from their Principalls.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sueths,</hi> on the contrary, inſiſted mainely that the <note place="margin">Interchangably exhibite their reſpective Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries, and agree upon a ſecond meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Procuratorialls might be produced, to which end they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theirs, affirming that untill the clearing of thoſe, they could proceed no further, which being at laſt agreed unto, the Parties interchangably delivered up their Commiſſions to each other; but, the dayes being then ſhort, they could not, in that inch of time take ſo particular view of them as they deſired, wherefore they conſented that each Party, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with them the others Plenipotentiary, ſhould within two or three dayes returne the ſame back, and a ſecond meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was appointed the 26 th. following.</p>
                     <p>But foraſmuch as many and great difficulties began to appear, even at this firſt entrance into the Treaty: The Ambaſſadors of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> (who during the ſpace of ten dayes he had ſtayed to refreſh himſelfe in <hi>Dantzig,</hi> had delivered the King his Maſters Letters, and his verball injunctions to the Senate of that City) was deſirous to be preſent for the more eaſie compoſure of differences at their very beginning: He, with Mr. <hi>Francis Gordon</hi> (the Kings Agent there) came to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">His Lordſhip came to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                        </note> the one and twentieth of <hi>January,</hi> where having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and returned viſits to the Electorall Ambaſſadors, and learned of them in what termes the matter ſtood, he expected the time appointed for the meeting, which, together with the Commiſſioned Parties, being come, and the uſuall ceremoniall ſalutes received and rendred; his Lordſhip taking with him the Electorall Miniſters, endeavoured to temper and molifie the gauled minds of the Parties, by conciliating and extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the difficulties like to increaſe by debating the Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoriall Letters.</p>
                     <p>The Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland</hi> appeared not as then ſo ſtiffe nor ſcrupulous in thoſe things of leſſer moment; for when his Lordſhip propounded the ſequeſtring of the Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries into the hands of the Mediators during the Treaty, they forthwith aſſented: Whereas the <hi>Suethes</hi> vehemently repugned; but becauſe the preſent altercation proceeded from defects, which each party pretended to finde in the others Letters of procuration, it will not be amiſſe to ſay ſomething of them.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. That they detract from his Majeſty of <hi>Poland</hi> the title of Hereditary King of <hi>Suethen,</hi> and deferre the ſame to the Daughter of King <hi>Guſtavus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That they intermix the Provinces belonging to the Crowne of <hi>Poland</hi> with the titles in their Commiſſion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That albeit the Princeſſe <hi>Chriſtina</hi> were deſigned Queen, as is alleadged; it may yet be queſtioned whence ſhe derives to her ſelf the power of determining of the Common-wealth, and of alliances, which is not permitted to other deſigned Princes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. By what right the Tutors ſtraine to vindicate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a power (chiefly Regall) over their deſigned Queen, as themſelves call her?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Whether the deſigned Queen is bound to ſtand to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions made by her Tutors, foraſmuch as a Tutor cannot prejudice his Pupill in ought, and chiefly a Subject his Prince, eſpecially in a Kingdome Hereditary.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. What aſſurance is there, that the Orders of the Crown of <hi>Suethen</hi> will allow of that which by the ſayd Tutors (or in their name) is tranſacted, ſeeing that in the Procuratorialls no mention is made of thoſe Orders?</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Foraſmuch as the Chancellour of <hi>Suethen Axelius Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiern,</hi> is now the chiefeſt in repute in that Kingdome, and that a Law lately there enacted, remits to him the whole matter of the Treaty with <hi>Poland,</hi> whether he may not nullifie all the Acts that ſhall be done, in as much as himſelfe hath not ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſaid Commiſſion?

                     <p n="2">2.

3. In either of the Procuratorialls, as well that of the King as of the Common-wealth, the Commiſſioners of her Majeſty are not obſcurely (albeit by way of <hi>Amphibologie</hi> or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully) called the Commiſſioners of the King of <hi>Poland;</hi> as in the peculiar Commiſſion of the King it is ſayd, <hi>Wee do alſo promiſe that whatſoever by Ours and the Commiſſioners of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, &amp;c.</hi> As alſo in the Procuratoriall of the Common-wealth it is expreſſed thus, <hi>Promiſing, that whatſoever by the Commiſſioners of both Parties ſhall be concluded, We and the Common-wealth ſhall most willingly approve and ratifie the ſame:</hi> Which notwithſtanding they may by the adverſe party be ſmoothed over in a contrary ſenſe, are yet ſo clear as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no palliation.</p>

                     <p>It would be overmuch to particularize the arguments uſed to that effect, ſeeing they could not be prevalent, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners proteſting, as they had formerly, that, bound by the ſtrictneſſe of their Inſtructions, they could not admit of thoſe mediate wayes propounded by his Lordſhip; and (at laſt) onely condeſcended to ſend to their Principalls for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions <note place="margin">Condeſcention of the Suethes, conditionall.</note> more complying then thoſe they then had, and thought that, at leaſt, ſix weeks would overpaſſe before they could receive an anſwer, by reaſon of the Winter ſeaſon, croſſe Winds, and the paſſage, in many places, ſtopt with Ice: And this they agreed unto conditionally that the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners would in the meane time procure other Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories from their King, and therein not onely abſtaine, at leaſt during the Treaty, from all title to the Kingdom of <hi>Sueth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but alſo (in the ſame) give their Queen her full and due titles, it being otherwiſe in vaine to hope for any further meeting.</p>

Theſe things being by his Lordſhips Letters ſignified to the Poliſh Commiſſioners, they would not liſten to any mutation of their Procuratorials, affirming that they dared not ſo much as once motion the ſame to their King, much leſſe offer to perſwade him thereunto: for which cauſe neceſſity ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and rather then a work ſo profitable for the State of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome,</hi> ſhould remain unperfected for the meer ſcrupuloſity of Titles; his Lordſhip hoping by his Solicitations, in the name and Authority of his Maſter, to diſpoſe the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to ſome milder ſtrain, offered himſelf to undertake a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with them to <hi>Warſovia,</hi> and to that end commended to them his Letters for his Majeſty of <hi>Poland,</hi> in which (with due reſpect) he acquainted the King with his arrivall and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his Court.</p>

                     <p>The Declaration, often urged by the Subdelegates, for the renuing of the Treaty, they ſuſpend untill their Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention be knowne; yet ſo, that they are content to remit the ſame to the authority and intervention of Great <hi>Brittains</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, conditionally that the contrary Party, leaving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide differences of ſmaller moment, will returne to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, obſerve the former Articles of the Truce, and abſtaine from unjuſt Marine exactions: All which, they ſignified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Lordſhip, and that they expected an anſwer from their King, and ſo to proceed toward <hi>Warſaw.</hi>

                     <p>His Lordſhip was certified, within few dayes, that his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were moſt acceptable to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

of the aſſurance he thereby had of his ſafe arrivall, as of <note place="margin">His Lordſhips receives invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come to <hi>Warſaw.</hi>
                        </note> the King his Maſters ſincere affection teſtified in lending his helping hand to this Pacification, which reall friendſhip, as he had ever promiſed to himſelfe ſo, he could not but take his Lordſhips endeavours in good part: Wiſhing withall that they might be ſo effectuall as to breake the contumacious perverſneſſe (as he tearmed it) of the adverſe Party, and to vindicate his injuries now manifeſt to all the World; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that, as the notice of his Lordſhips arrivall was moſt welcome, ſo to ſee him at <hi>Warſaw</hi> would be no leſſe gratefull. To this effect were the Kings Letters, dated the eleventh of <hi>February,</hi> 1635.</p>
                     <p>His Lordſhip began his journey, and the twentieth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> was received ſome miles without the City of <hi>Warſaw</hi> by the moſt illuſtrious Prince <hi>Janus</hi> of <hi>Radzivill,</hi> with many of the Nobility, and brought, in the Kings Coach, to his lodging, which was faire and richly furniſhed of all things (Beds excepted) with other entertainment anſwerable.

                     <p>The King, at length, ſeemed not averſe, yet would give no immediate nor abſolute conſent, but onely hopes thereof, after deliberation to be taken. His Lordſhip, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there three weeks, took his leave of the King and of the Commiſſioners, who were to follow with the Regall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and began his journey toward <hi>Dantzig,</hi> where hee <note place="margin">He contracts ſickneſs.</note> arrived the twenty eighth of <hi>March,</hi> ſick of a violent burning Feaver which ſeized on him in his returne, and left but ſmall hopes of his recovery to his Friends and Servants for the ſpace of three weeks: Yet upon the intermiſſion of its violence he was, no leſſe then in perfect health, ſolicitous of the buſineſſe committed to his truſt, and accordingly tooke care for ſetling a time and place of meeting, <hi>Holland</hi> (the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) being incommodious: The Commiſſioners of <hi>Suethland</hi> thereupon named an Iſland in the River <hi>Viſtula,</hi> commonly called <hi>Sperlings Campe</hi> for the place of congreſſion; for the Mediators reſidence a Village named <hi>Piſterfeldt,</hi> for the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Commiſsioners, a Towne called <hi>Dirſhaw,</hi> and for themſelves the Village <hi>Luſſon:</hi> The day they prefixed to be the firſt of <hi>May</hi> following.</p>

Here upon his Lordſhip ſent Letters to the Poliſh Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners (as yet) at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> and ſoon after received an excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory anſwer from the Chancellour, ſhewing that being ready to take journey, he had been ſuddenly ſeiſed by grievous pangs of the Collick and Stone, which had confined him to his bed, and ſo hindred his journey, wherat he grieved, fearing leaſt this delay might prove prejudiciall to the publike affaire: he hoped nevertheleſſe that his Lordſhip and thoſe who wiſhed his appearance, would make the beſt conſtruction of his Stay, ſickneſſe being in it ſelf a lawfull excuſe: promiſing that ſo ſoon as a mitigation of his pains would permit, he would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to communicate with his Lordſhip of things neceſſary and pertinent to the matter in hand. That as touching the place of meeting and the Manſions deſigned by the Adverſe party, he had referred them to the King, who diſapproved thereof, as himſelf alſo did, the ſame being too far diſtant from his Majeſty, to whom frequent recourſe would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for obtaining his Declaration in points that would fall out in the courſe of the Treaty.</p>
                     <p>He thought it alſo unfit to commit their Meetings and <note place="margin">Difficulties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the place of treaty.</note> Conſultations, in ſo weighty a buſineſſe, to Winds which move that River to impetuoſity, ſeeing they were all alike concerned in the gaining of time, and that the leaſt ſtirring of the <hi>Viſtula</hi> would be no ſmall hinderance to all parties.

                        <hi>Poland,</hi> nor could they admit of the propounded <hi>Medium</hi> of Sequeſtration: That ſundry defects and errours impeded the firſt, the ſame being derogatory from the honour and right of their Queen, as they had formerly affirmed: Neither was that Proteſtation (ſaving our Royall Right) ſatisfactory, ſeeing <note place="margin">Objections.</note> that, what the King gave therby with the one hand, he took away with the other. As to the Sequeſtration, in regard that interpoſing <hi>Medium</hi> did not remove the defects, and that the Procuratories would by that meanes be eſteemed but as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate papers, it could not be admitted.</p>
                     <p>That nevertheleſſe, if the Titles entire were conceded to their Queen, as the foundation wheron the Treaty might be built, and without which it would come to nothing; that then at the meeting, the Sequeſter might be taken into delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; which thus moderated, he believed they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe. For the reſt, that his Principalls would think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much gratified if the time of convention were ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appointed at either of the places <hi>Gorgendorff</hi> or <hi>Peterſmaldt</hi> above named, whereunto (as he ſuppoſed) they were, even then, ready.</p>

                     <p>Their Traine was according to the dignity of the Parties, and as hath been ſet downe at their entry into <hi>Holland.</hi> The accuſtomed viſits and civilities, performed between the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and the Parties, took up the time untill four in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. At length, all the Mediators met in the quarter of the Marquis of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> as the more ſpacious and the more equall, ſo to make way into the maine buſineſſe, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed already ſo much time in the Preparatories onely: and night haſtning on, leſt the day and this firſt meeting ſhould be without fruit, the Mediators agreed to propound the preſent Sequeſtration of the Procuratories, which had been hetherto delayd, that ſo they might enter upon the things of more moment: And that there might be a timely <note place="margin">Meane uſed for avoyding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions.</note> obviatingof competitions that might ariſe between the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as alſo between the Electorall Miniſters and thoſe of the States Generall: it was thought good that his Lordſhip with the Electoralls, and the French Ambaſſador with the others (the Marquis <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> remaining ſtill in the Mediatoriall Tent, which for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and conſultation of the Mediators was placed in the midſt of the Village) ſhould repaire by courſe, as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the Parties Commiſſioners of each ſide. <note place="margin">Propoſition.</note>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:109514:87"/>
conforme to agreement, the Sequeſtration was propounded to both. The <hi>Polanders</hi> made no exception: the <hi>Suethes</hi> affirmed that in regard the promiſed Procuratories were <note place="margin">Not conſented unto.</note> not yet come, they could not conſent therunto: But yet, that time might not be unprofitably trifled, they were contented to lay aſide the point of the Procuratories for that day, and were deſirous to make entrance into the Principall Treatie, whereunto that a way might be opened; it behoved them <note place="margin">Demand made by the <hi>Suethes.</hi>
                        </note> (ſaid they) firſt to know whether or not the King of <hi>Poland</hi> would abſolutely renounce the right he pretended unto <hi>Suethen,</hi> which they beleeved to be the cheife and onely mean to perfect the Treatie of Pacification.</p>
                     <p>This was by the Mediators related to the Commiſſioners <note place="margin">Anſwer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Polanders.</hi>
                        </note> of <hi>Poland,</hi> who without further deliberation replyed, that it was expedient for them alſo to underſtand, whether (a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation ſuppoſed, but not granted) the others would reſtore the Kingdome of <hi>Suethland,</hi> with all other things wherof the King had been deprived; ſeeing that, where the ſame right is, it may be by the ſame reaſons diſputed.</p>
                     <p>The Mediators perceiving the difficulties, wherin by theſe extreams, the parties did involve themſelves at this firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from which they could not be freed, unleſſe ſome medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate waies were found out, and it being their part and office to propound ſuch waies unto the parties diſagreeing, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded (the better to ſtop theſe beginnings, which in things of weight and moment are wont to encreaſe) to demand from <note place="margin">Reſult of the Mediators.</note> the parties three daies reſpite, within which time they might happily conceive ſome waies and reaſons for bringing the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe neerer to a compoſition.</p>
                     <p>This was agreed unto, howbeit unwillingly by the Suethes, <note place="margin">Accepted by all.</note> becauſe the Poles hereby deferred the producing of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Procuratorie; and the Mediators for that firſt daies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, thought meet that as a good Omen to the happy iſſue of the Treaty in agitation, the parties ſhould meet and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute each other, wherby their minds as yet alienated, might by degrees and mutuall civilities be prepared to Peace and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and that (to the end the ſame might be without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice or preheminence to either ſide) they ſhould iſſue forth of their reſpective Tents at one and the ſame inſtant, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the Mediators, meet in the mid-way of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, without any mention of the buſineſſe in queſtion, which might ſound harſhly to either ſide. This was gratefull to both parties, they profeſſing themſelves moſt willingly ready <note place="margin">That dayes concluſion.</note> to any act of courteſie and humanity: Wherupon they met in moſt friendly manner, and having ſo greeted and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated each other, each party returned to their reſidence; thoſe of <hi>Poland</hi> to <hi>Marienwerder,</hi> the Mediators to <hi>Marienburg,</hi> the Suethes to <hi>Jonas Dorff.</hi>

The next day the Mediators convene in the Caſtle of <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enburg,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Mediators meete.</note> to conſult and to return prepared with ſome mediate means of reconciling the differences touching the reſignation or reſtitution of the Kingdome of <hi>Suethen.</hi> But that there might ariſe no diſpute competitionary between the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> a Table was ſo equally placed as the Seſſion could give no precedency to either.

                     <p>That he ſaw no better way for reconciling the extreams of <note place="margin">His Lordſhips propoſition in Order to the whole matter.</note> reſignation and reſtitution, then by having an equall regard to the Honour and Dignity of his Majeſty of <hi>Poland,</hi> and to the ſecurity of the State of <hi>Suethen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In reference to the King, it would be neceſſary that the Lawes made in <hi>Suethland,</hi> wherby King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> and his Poſterity had been deprived of the Inheritance and Succeſſion to that Crown, ſhould be repealed and nullified, and as violent Edicts, to be razed out of the publike Records.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the State and Kingdome of <hi>Suethland,</hi> it would be ſufficiently ſecured if his Majeſty of <hi>Poland</hi> in regard of the neerneſſe of conſanguinity, between him and the Princeſſe <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> did remit to her during her life the right he had to that Crown, conditionally that the lawfull Heirs of his body might enjoy their right of Succeſſion in the future, or thoſe failing Heirs; And in caſe ſuch Iſſue ſhould faile on both ſides, that then the right of Election ſhould return to the States of the Kingdome. Hereunto it would alſo be requiſite, that in the point of the Queens future Marriage, the King of <hi>Polands</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhould be in friendly manner required, and in caſe of doubts or ſcruples ariſing, the approbation of his Electorall Highneſſe of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> might be deſired: That it would be conducing hereunto, if King <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the reſtitution of the other Lands and Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces taken in War, which thoſe of <hi>Poland</hi> demanded, the main queſtion of the Kingdome being decided, that would follow of it ſelf, <hi>Quoniam ſublata cauſa tollitur effectus:</hi> thoſe pretences having been the cauſe of that War: Neither could the Suethes in lieu of the ſaid reſtitution, demand any re-imburſment of charges, for then the Polanders, and his Electorall Highneſſe of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and others, might with far more reaſon require
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:109514:88"/>
reparation of their loſſes, and reſtitution of the Tolls extorted beyond meaſure, even contrary to the Articles, in the late ſix years Truce: that it was now time to ceaſe and abrogate thoſe unjuſt oppreſſions and exactions upon forraign Trade, and to reduce commerce to its former freedome. That in like manner it was conſentaneous to reaſon, that the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> having ſuſtained damages ſo great as not equall compenſation could be hoped for, ſhould now (at leaſt) have a full reſtitution of all his Ports, Fortreſſes, Towns, Lands, and Poſſeſſions.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, that regard was to be had alſo of the Duke of <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who having, by means of the War, received infinite pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, ought in reaſon to ſhare in the benefit of the Peace.</p>

                     <p>The Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland,</hi> underſtanding that the <hi>Suethes</hi> had delivered up their procuratoriall Letters, ſent theirs to the French Ambaſſador, then in the Mediatoriall Tent, but committed their proteſtation to the Ambaſſador of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and intimated their expectancie of an atteſtation with the firſt opportunity.

                     <p>This offer of his was excepted againſt by thoſe of <hi>Suethland,</hi> who alledged that the Chancellor had no power or authority to change or correct ought, after the King had once ſigned the ſame; as alſo that the Procuratory would be therby imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and blemiſhed, in regard nothing could be added without interlining. At laſt, through the entreaties of the French and States Ambaſſadors, and the perſwaſions of his Lordſhip, they yeilded thus far, that they would accept of the foreſaid corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that defect, conditionally that, foraſmuch as new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatories from the States of <hi>Poland</hi> could not be obtained
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:109514:89"/>
without a Parliament firſt called, others were procured from the King within ten dayes ſpace; that otherwiſe, and ſave onely to gratifie the Mediators, they would not have ſo eaſily accepted the ſame.</p>
                     <p>This ſharpe anſwer exceedingly irritated the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Poland,</hi> who ſpared not to ſay that they had made peace with ſundry Nations, even Barbarous and Infidels, and had not found ſo much difficultie with them as with the <hi>Suethes:</hi> affirming withall that they were not leſſe ready for a War (in caſe of rupture) then the adverſe party; with which conſtancy of theirs, or rather by the endeavours of the Mediators, the <hi>Suethes,</hi> ſomewhat mollified, accepted of the interlyning before offered; the Mediatoriall atteſtations <note place="margin">Reconciled.</note> being deferred untill their return to <hi>Marienburg.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The diſputes and differences about the Procuratories being thus determined, it will not be amiſſe to ſhew (briefly) in what forme they with the Acts relating to them were couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the ſcope of the ſayd Letters Procuratoriall being (to either party) That whatſoever they or the greater part of <note place="margin">Scope of the Procuratories.</note> them, the abſence of one or more notwithſtanding ſhall each with other agree or conclude upon, either touching perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall peace or longer Truce, the ſame ſhould be fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of and ratified with all due and requiſite formes. The full Titles of either of the Princes intereſſed were abreviated with an <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> as no way derogatory.</p>
                     <p>The Proteſtation of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Commiſſioners was to this effect; That the King of <hi>Poland, &amp;c.</hi> albeit his Hereditary <note place="margin">Poliſh Proteſt.</note> right to the Crown of <hi>Suethland,</hi> for the maintaining whereof there had been ſo long and bloody Wars, was no leſſe cleare then the Sun, and could not be impaired by any arguments to the contrary; had notwithſtanding, at the inſtant requeſts of the mediating Miniſters of ſo many and potent Princes, and to manifeſt his a verſion to the effuſion of Chriſtian blood condeſcended ſo far, as in his Procuratoriall Letters to his Commiſſioners to permit that, to the moſt illuſtrious <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> the Title of Deſigned Queen of <hi>Suethes, Goths,</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls,</hi> Great Princeſſe of <hi>Finland. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> ſhould be inſerted, and the ſayd Title, in the adverſe Procuratorialls, to be by his Commiſſioners accepted of, yet without prejudice to his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary right: and therefore they (the ſayd Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland)</hi> did, in his Majeſties name, make this ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in the moſt ample and uſuall form in ſuch caſes accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and required, in preſence of the Ambaſſadors of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces mediating, for the indemnity of his ſayd Majeſties Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary right of ſucceſſion to the Crown of <hi>Suethland;</hi> in evidence and teſtimony wherof, as well for the preſent as future they deſired atteſtation from the ſayd mediating Miniſters under their hands and ſeals.</p>

The Proteſt of the Suethiſh Commiſſioners imported; <note place="margin">The Suethes Proteſt.</note> That they having obſerved that the King and Re-publike of <hi>Poland</hi> in their ſeverall Procuratoriall Letters, had omitted certain Titles due to their Queen, as <hi>Esthonia, Carelia,</hi> and <hi>Ingria,</hi> which hither to they could not be induced to give, no more then to raze out of their own the Title of <hi>Suethland</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> for the effecting wherof they had long and earneſtly endeavoured, yet now at length, and at the earneſt requeſts and intervention of the mediating Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, to ſhew their propenſity to Peace, as alſo that the adverſe party might be more equitably complying in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they had aſſented to the acceptation therof; With this ſolemn Proteſt interpoſed. and conſigned into the hands of the Mediators, and by them fully accepted, as appeared by their atteſtation therupon: That the ſame ſhould not either in preſent or future time, any way prejudice or diminiſh the Right and Dignity of their Queen and of the Kingdome of <hi>Suethen:</hi> much leſſe that any Title or Right was therby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded or given to his Majeſty of <hi>Poland,</hi> either directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, expreſſed or implied. <hi>And thus ended the ſecond meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at</hi> Stumbſdorff.</p>
                     <p>The Mediators and the Parties being aſſembled now the third time, in the foreſaid place, the former according to promiſe, delivered their reſpective atteſtations; that of his Lordſhip and the Electorals containing: That foraſmuch as it had pleaſed the parties to commit their Plenipotentiaries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Mediators, untill the Negotiation being brought to a happy Peace (if it ſhould ſo pleaſe God) the ſame might be framed to the ſatisfaction of both parties, and accordingly re-delivered: They had received the Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary of the Lords Commiſſioners of <hi>Suethland,</hi> with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and this Caution therin inſerted; That in caſe the Treaty ſhould not have the wiſhed end, the ſaid Plenipotentiary ſhould be reſtored and the Mediators receive back their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent atteſtation: That they had alſo accepted of the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, the ſame to be referred to the publike Acts.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:109514:90"/>
affirming, that as to the Succeſſion and Hereditary Right pretended by King <hi>

This was all that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip could obtain by way of anſwer, notwithſtanding many arguments uſed to have gained further, which he with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectorals referred to the judgment of the Mediators in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: And from the Poliſh Commiſſioners, by the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> was delivered an anſwer, in almoſt the ſame termes by way of converſion; to wit, that the meer <note place="margin">The like given by the Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> motion of a renunciation was no leſſe odious to them, and that they were as far from conſenting therto, unleſſe a reſtitution were firſt conceded.</p>
                     <p>The Mediators, pondring theſe extreams, feared leaſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of them might further exaſperate the parties, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared already more prone to War then Peace, and therfore reſolved to return and deſire of them, that foraſmuch as they had hitherto anſwered far from the matter, they would come neerer and declare themſelves more cleerly. The Suethes did ſtill inſiſt upon an abſolute reſignation, in reference wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they declare for their Cathegoricall reſolution; that the ſame being granted by the Polanders, they, to ſhew their <note place="margin">Offer made by the Suethes.</note> good inclination toward Peace, would reſtore the rich Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> conditionally that they might be re-imburſed of their Charges: which offer of theirs, not being in any ſort ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to his Lordſhip and the <hi>Brandenburgers,</hi> they inſiſted (by way of anticipation) upon the reſtoring of <hi>Leifland</hi> alſo, but finding the Suethes utterly averſe therunto, they without obtaining further, returned to the Mediatoriall Colledge.</p>

the conditions propounded, and the grant therof by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, they were exceedingly incenſed with that delatory anſwer, in regard that they having ſincerely diſcovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as far as they could, in a manner; the Polanders had not daigned to make any equall return; for which cauſe they ſaw no reaſon (ſaid they) to condeſcend to another meeting, before they had ſome reſolution in the point of reſignation: His Lordſhip endeavoured to moderate their violence tending to a Rupture, but in vain, inſomuch as he left them diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. He was but newly entred into the Tent of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Commiſſioners, but that Secretary <hi>Lording</hi> followed, to tell him that his Lords the Suethes had conſented to the next daies meeting.</p>
                     <p>All parties hereupon convening the fourth time; the firſt point was to learn how thoſe of <hi>Poland</hi> would declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the former conditions; to them the French and <note place="margin">The former of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer waved by the <hi>Poles</hi> as inſufficient.</note> States Ambaſſadors repaired, and received this anſwer; That they did not reject the foreſaid conditions, but that they found them not to be ſufficient, wherby the King might be induced to make a reſignation: They therfore requeſted the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to conſider of ſome other more equall termes. Theſe words (when related) ſeemed very ſtrange to the other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, and not fit to be communicated to thoſe of <hi>Suethen,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they were accompanied with other circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>After a ſerious debate amongſt themſelves, they pitch upon five other Articles.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the harſh Lawes enacted againſt King <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. That ſatisfaction ſhould be made to the King and his Brethren out of the Territory of <hi>Leifland,</hi> as the King and the States ſhould agree.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That there ſhould be firm friendſhip between the two Kingdomes, and the Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> to be married into a Fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, not Enemy to the King and State of <hi>Poland:</hi> King <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus</hi> alſo to match in like manner.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. To be mutually aſſiſting againſt the Enemies of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>With theſe, his Lordſhip and the Electorall Miniſters went <note place="margin">Taken by the <hi>Poles</hi> into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.</note> to thoſe of <hi>Poland:</hi> The French and Hollanders at the ſame time acquainting the Suethes with the ſaid Articles: the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> required that they might tranſcribe and have time until the Munday enſuing to deliberate; that then they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their finall reſolution: But in the mean time, the Suethes
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:109514:91"/>
abſolutely rejected theſe new Conditions as being worſe then <note place="margin">Rejected by the Suethes.</note> the former, and derogatory from the Dignity of their Queen and the Kingdome of <hi>Suethen,</hi> and again inſiſted upon an entire renunciation, without which no Peace to be hoped for. The anſwer of either party being rehearſed in the Mediatoriall Colledge, it was thought good that the Poles informed of the perſeverance of the Suethes in the point of reſignation, ſhould be preſſed to open their minds more freely, and that the Sueths ſhould be perſwaded to meet upon the Munday following, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which time the <hi>Polanders</hi> were to deliberate upon the five Conditions newly propounded by the Mediators.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> returne to thoſe of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Reply of the <hi>Poles</hi> in point of reſignation.</note> who no ſooner heard that odious word of Reſignation againe repeated, but they became exceedingly enraged, chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly Duke <hi>Radzivill,</hi> who replyed, Let not your Lordſhips ſuffer your ſelves to be thus mocked by the <hi>Suethes,</hi> neither will we any longer; if they deſire yet any further declaration upon that point, this is our reſolution, we will rather dye then Reſigne.</p>
                     <p>During this, the Agent, Maſter <hi>Gordon</hi> had, in his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips name, endeavoured to move the <hi>Suethes</hi> to meet againe <note place="margin">The <hi>Suethes</hi> refuſe to meete.</note> the Munday following; to whom, before he could end his ſpeech, they anſwered peremptorily, That they would not meet any more: That they were deluded, the time protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and nothing hitherto effected, except the meetings, worthy of the Mediators paines: That at <hi>Jonas Dorff</hi> they would expect the reſolution of the <hi>Polanders</hi> touching the point in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>The Mediators, very ſolicitous how to wade out of thoſe difficulties, at laſt, prevailed ſo far with the <hi>Polanders,</hi> as to meet whenſoever they ſhould by Letters appoint the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The day following, his Lordſhip, with Maſter <hi>Gordon</hi> and <note place="margin">His Lordſhip goes to the <hi>Suethes.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>From this purpoſe, his Lordſhip and the Hollanders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to that of the Tolls, remonſtrating to the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Suethen,</hi> that ſundry unjuſt and intollerable exactions
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:109514:91"/>
had been practiſed in their Tolls and Cuſtomes. Yea ſo farr as it was affirmed that, upon due computation, proofe would be made that one Shipp, paſſing and repaſſing, had payd ſixty Rexdollars upon the Laſt, notwithſtanding that in the late Treaty ſix years paſt, a far leſſe ſum, even the third part had been allowed. They affirmed alſo, that over and above the ſame, ſundry other extraordinary exactions, as Anchor-gelt, Maſt-gelt, Paſſeport, Seale-gelt, Clerks Fees, and others of the like kinde had been extorted: all which things, introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt the wonted cuſtome, were now grown common. The Ambaſſadors therefore, by vertue of their Commiſſions and Inſtructions, required, of the ſayd Commiſſioners, that with all conveniency, thoſe exceſſes might be abſtained from; the things being in themſelves unjuſt, and derogating from their Maſters Dignities to be practiſed, they preſent, and not able to relieve the injured Plaintiff:</p>
                     <p>Count <hi>Brahe,</hi> in the name of the reſt, made auſwer, that <note place="margin">Their anſwer.</note> indeed ſundry complaints had been made unto him about the Tolls; but, ſo far as he knew, none had ever proved that any new exaction or burthen had been introduced contrary to the agreement: that moreover they had no Commiſſion to treat of this matter untill the buſineſſe of the Pacification were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which done, they would conforme themſelves ſtrictly unto their Inſtructions in that point: That in the mean time, they would ſend <hi>Peter Speiring</hi> (their Toll-Maſter) to inform their Lordſhips of all things, and that they would enjoyne him to ceaſe all extraordinary burthens, if any had crept in: Thus ended that conference. The ſame night his Lordſhip certified the Poliſh Commiſſioners of the meeting to be as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly appointed.</p>
                     <p>The time being come, their firſt work was to ſee what the <note place="margin">The <hi>Polanders</hi> perſiſt as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> 
                        <hi>Polanders</hi> would declare upon the Mediatoriall conditions laſt propounded, who, to his Lordſhip and the Electoralls, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the ſame anſwer as to the former: <hi>Viz.</hi> That they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them not, but found them not ſuch as might move their King to renounce a Kingdome, which was no ſmall matter; and therefore deſired the Mediators either to ſupply the defects of thoſe or to propound others.</p>
                     <p>This anſwer being repeated in the Mediatoriall Colledge, <note place="margin">The Parties willed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</note> what before ſeemed ſtrange was now judged wholly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, none knowing what to propound of new that might be acceptable to both Parties, whom therefore they reſolved not to ſmooth any longer; but that, if themſelves had ought to propound, they might do it. Hereupon they part, his Lordſhip to the <hi>Suethes,</hi> the French to the <hi>Polanders,</hi> each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied as before; but when the <hi>Suethes</hi> found themſelves

                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Suethes</hi> enter into paſſion.</note> they began, not without paſſion, to rehearſe how much they had already granted to the adverſe party: Whereas we (ſayd they) deſire nothing from the King of <hi>Poland</hi> but an empty Title, we are content to ſurrender the moſt noble and rich Province of <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> which compared together, was but as a Feather to a Wedge of Gold.

                     <p>The Mediators conferring hereupon, and finding the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <note place="margin">Things tending to a breach the Mediators de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire reſpite.</note> of both ſides tending to a breach, they conclude to tell the <hi>Suethes</hi> that thoſe of <hi>Poland</hi> ſeemed to give ſome hopes of a renunciation, ſeeing they had not hitherto abſolutely deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame: That in order therunto they had added ſome ſupplies to the Conditions laſt propounded, about which the Mediators being willing to conſult ſeriouſly, deſired the next

generall meeting might be deferred for foure daies; wherunto the <hi>Sueshes</hi> (yet not without reluctancy) conſenting, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did ſo likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſaid day (being the 29/8 <hi>May, / June.)</hi> they congregated the ſixth time, and the Mediators pains were the greater, by how much the parties, diſſenting in extreams, ſeemed to breath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but preſent War. No new Counſell remained, no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate means could be more found out; neither was it doubted by the Mediators, but that the ſupplements added by the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> (as aforeſaid) would cauſe a certain breach. Yet that they might not be wanting to their Mediatoriall Office, they agreed, ſetting the Poliſh conditions aſide, to demand of each party (as for the laſt time) their finall Declarations, and how far their Commiſſions extended. From the Suethes, whether by their Inſtructions they had not power to treat of <note place="margin">Finall declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions demanded by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors from the Parties.</note> an entire reſtitution of all things taken away; that if they had ought in reſerve, they ſhould produce it, if otherwiſe, that they would do well to have recourſe to their Principals the States of <hi>Suethland</hi> by Letters, wherby they might happily be moved to ſend them inſtructions more complying.</p>
                     <p>Unto the Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland</hi> it was remonſtrated, that albeit the Mediators had duely conſidered the Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments delivered unto them, they could not conceive that any good would be effected by them, and therfore if they had ought remaining touching the reſignation, that they would entruſt them with it, for otherwiſe there would never be an end of going to and from, which being tedious in it ſelf, they alſo began to grow weary therof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Suethes</hi> to whom the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador had repaired, replyed that ſeeing nothing had been, hitherto, offered unto them from the contrary party, they had already enlarged themſelves too far by a tender of the reſtitution of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> wherunto they could add nothing: That they wondred much <note place="margin">The <hi>Suethes</hi> decline to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clare further.</note> that theſe and the like things were almoſt daily required of them, wheras they could not heare of ought from the other ſide tending toward a Peace: That they ſufficiently knew the States of <hi>Suethen</hi> would not be induced to grant any other Commiſſion or Inſtructions then what they had already: That Parliament could not be called in leſſe then foure months, and that ſome time would be waſted in making a journey into <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;</hi> but that it might ſo happen, as that their Generall <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Commiſſiones of <hi>Poland</hi> complained, that the Mediators had relinquiſhed the conditions they had tendred; affirming that their King would never be perſwaded to a reſignation for the reſtitution of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and <hi>Leifland</hi> meerly, neither had they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:109514:93"/>
ought in their Commiſſion more then what they had already <note place="margin">The <hi>Polanders</hi> likewiſe, and give their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> declared. To confirm this, they inſtanced recent examples drawn from the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Ruſſians.</hi> For, ſaid they, albeit their King had in the late Treaty of Peace with the <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his right of former Election to that Empire, which nevertheleſſe was much weaker then the Hereditary Right he had to <hi>Suethen,</hi> yet he did it not but upon very advantageous conditions, they giving him for the ſame three great and large Provinces extending to above five hundred miles. That in his late Wars alſo againſt the <hi>Turke,</hi> he had ſhewed himſelf ſo reſolute as not to yeild to the leaſt diſadvantage: that when, beſide the Peace, they deſired of him ſome ſmall Gift, not by way of Superiority or Tribute, but in token of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip onely, he would not condeſcend therto, but choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wage moſt cruell Battell; Wherin, to his eternall Fame, being twice Victor, he made Peace with them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own deſire.</p>
                     <p>That they might eaſily therfore conclude, the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would never be induced to renounce his Hereditary right to the Crown and Kingdome of <hi>Suethland,</hi> for <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and <hi>Leif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> only, by the reſtitution wherof no Emolument or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation was derived to the King and his Family, but only ſome ſatisfaction to the Common-wealth of <hi>Poland.</hi> At laſt, overcome with the earneſt perſwaſions of his Lordſhip and the Miniſters of the States Generall, they did promiſe to write once more to the King about the reſignation; ſaying, that they expected him to be ſuddenly at <hi>Thorne,</hi> from whence they might (within three daies) obtain a Cathegorick anſwer.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things, with the reſolution of the other party being throughly ſcanned by the Mediators, concluſion was taken, that the Commiſſioners of <hi>Suethland,</hi> ſhould be perſwaded to meet on the Wedneſday next following, againſt which time the <hi>Polanders</hi> expected a finall anſwer from the King in point of reſignation, no other means appearing to hinder a preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Treaty, and yet it was feared the event would not anſwer their deſires. Nevertheleſſe, his Lordſhip and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> undertake the Work, relating to the <hi>Suethes</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <note place="margin">The <hi>Suethes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine incenſed.</note> of the contrary party as ſparingly and mincingly as they could: As they had preſaged ſo it fell out, for ſo ſoon as theſe underſtood that they were again delayed, they interpreted all to be but meer deluſions; calling God to witneſſe with what candour and ſincerity they had hitherto treated. Whereas quite contrary, the adverſe party (ſaid they) had uſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Subterfuges, not once daigning them an anſwer which might be ſo termed.</p>
                     <p>They complained of perverſneſſe and arrogancy in their Adverſaries, which they affirmed, ſhould not paſſe unreven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:109514:93"/>
ſaying, that of a certain, they ſhould never obtain that Province of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> which they had over officiouſly offered; and concluded that they could not be (in reaſon) required or deſired to meet any more at theſe Conferences, before the King had declared concerning the point in queſtion: To this their tartneſſe, his Lordſhip and the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Holland</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">At end the finall reſolution at their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> replyed as became Mediators, by whoſe dexterous arguments and perſwaſions the <hi>Suethes</hi> became ſo tractable, as that they promiſed (without diſſolving the Treaty) to attend the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reſolution, touching the reſignation, at <hi>Jonas Dorff</hi> their place of reſidence.</p>
                     <p>The Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland,</hi> underſtanding the impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>Suethes,</hi> were moved with indignation, rememorating their humanity and moderation uſed towards them, by wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a far longer time for their Procuratorials, and entreated the Mediators to afford them a meeting and conference on the 6/16 of that month, at a Village called <hi>Newendorff.</hi> Hereunto <note place="margin">A meeting with the Mediators deſired by the <hi>Poles.</hi>
                        </note> the Mediators conſented, as having ever ſhewed themſelves ready to contribute their utmoſt endeavours to advance the publike Intereſt, which by the ſix generall meetings paſt may evidently appear.</p>
                     <p>The Mediators (almoſt tired with daily journeys) enjoyed now ſome daies of reſt, in which time his Lordſhip and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> ſpent part therof in giving ſeverall audiences to <hi>Speiring</hi> (fore-named) about the Tolls, much alteration and diſpute being had about the ſame, albeit to ſmall effect.</p>
                     <p>The day prefixed being come, all the Mediators (the <hi>Fench</hi> excepted) went to <hi>Newenaorff,</hi> each being deſirous of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties happy progreſſe wherby the ſo much deſired Pacification might be attained. Being met, they began their conference at the point of the renunciation, that ſo they might have wherof to certifie the <hi>Suethes</hi> Commiſſioners, who impatiently expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the ſame: therto they added, that the preſent Truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neer expired, and but little of the Treaty as yet concluded, <note place="margin">Prolongation of the Truce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</note> they thought good to advice a prolongation therof untill the enſuing firſt of <hi>Auguſt, September, November,</hi> and for the more aſſurance, a new Inſtrument to be made; all hoſtility to be (during the ſame) forborne on both ſides, whereby the Treaty might have a longer courſe, and (if God ſo pleaſed) be brought to a wiſhed Period.</p>
                     <p>The Lords of <hi>Poland</hi> made anſwer that they had (at length) prevailed ſo far with their King, in the point of reſignation, as he would be content to do it upon certain honourable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <note place="margin">Reſult of the Polanders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall.</note> whereof the firſt and chief was, that the <hi>Suethes</hi> ſhould entirely reſtore all things formerly taken away: that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might be more eaſily agreed upon, and that they would refer them to the arbitration of the Mediators: concerning
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:109514:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the prorogation of the Truce they left it to them alſo: this declaration was ſo much the more gratefull as it gave hopes of a ſucceſſefull renovation of the Treatie.</p>
                     <p>The French Ambaſſador with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> repaired to <hi>Jonas dorff</hi> the day following, acquainting the <hi>Suethes</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners with the declaration made by the <hi>Polanders,</hi> and remonſtrated the neceſſity, of prorogating the Truce; yet albeit nothing could have come more welcome unto them they would not give any anſwer as then, but promiſed to ſend their Subdelegate unto <hi>Marienburg</hi> the next day. And (though not materiall to the preſent purpoſe) I ſhall heare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that Mr. <hi>Gordon</hi> the Agent forenamed, took leave of his Lorſhip and repaired for <hi>England</hi> upon great and weighty occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Secretarie <hi>Lording,</hi> Subdelegate to the <hi>Suethes,</hi> being ſent to the Mediators, according to promiſe, told them in the name of his Principalls, that they having heard what the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> had declared, in reference to the point in queſtion, to the end the Treatie, the greater part whereof was yet unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect might not be ſcanted by time, the Truce being neere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, had conſented to the prorogation thereof untill the time motioned, provided that the Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prorogation of the Truce aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto.</note> would treate more really in the future. Herewith the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> charged themſelves to acquaint thoſe of <hi>Poland,</hi> and in the name of all the Mediators to require their conſent: Their anſwer imported, that notwithſtanding the prorogation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired would be to their prejudice, yet to ſhew their deſire of a happie end of the matter in agitation and to gratify the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, whoſe care for the publike appeared in this as in all other paſſages, they would not refuſe the ſame, but there expect him that ſhould be ſent to perfect the inſtrument ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon two Copies were accordingly, to the Mediators, drawn up, in Subſtance as followeth.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109514:94"/>
and induſtrie of the Mediators, the preſent Treatie for an entire and perfect Peace might by Gods aſſiſtance be happily finiſhed. And it was alſo hereby enacted that, during the ſaid Prorogation, no acts of hoſtility ſhould by either of the Parties be uſed, or permitted to be uſed, toward the other: for the greater aſſurance and better obſervation whereof, the Commiſſioners deputed from either of the Parties, together with the Mediating Ambaſſadors, had ſigned and ſealed the ſame the eighteenth day of <hi>June,</hi> 1635. The Ambaſſadors, of the States Generall undertooke the care of ſending this inſtrument to the <hi>Suethes</hi> (by their Secritary) for Signature; they being ſtill at <hi>Jonas dorff,</hi> who promiſed to returne it the next day by their Subdelegate in perfect mannner.</p>
                     <p>Here (by the way) we may touch, that the end of the Sequeſtrations approaching, certain places of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> as <hi>Marienburg, Stume, Lochſtadt, &amp;c.</hi> which had been (during the ſix yeares Truce) entruſted by way of Sequeſtration into the hands of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> were to be reſtored unto the <hi>Suethes</hi> the 12/23 <hi>June</hi> as alſo the <hi>Memeln</hi> and <hi>Brunsberge,</hi> by them, to his Electorall Highneſſe, within three dayes after: the Marqueſſe <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> with the other Electorall Miniſters, as alſo the reſt of the Mediators began to conſider of ſome new reſidence. <hi>Riſenberg</hi> a little Towne in <hi>Pruſſia</hi> (the Ducall) was pitch't upon; whereupon the Marqueſſe <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> taking leave, went thether the ſame day.

                        </note> inſiſted earneſtly againſt the exchange of Sequeſtrations, affirming the ſame to be <hi>(Ipſo facto)</hi> a breach of the Treaty, and (as it were) a Summons to the War, if made before the Treaty were finiſhed; and in their favour the Mediators, chiefly his Lordſhip endeavoured what they could, yet could not perſwade the <hi>Suethes</hi> to hearken therunto.

                     <p>The day following, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, ſolicitous of his Maſters particular affaires, and how to divert a greater Warr from themſelves, viſited the <hi>Suethes</hi> with whom he laboured from noon untill night by arguments, exhortations, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, to yeild either to a Sequeſtration of places, or to the giving and accepting of Pledges, but in vaine, and in ſtead of a ſimple deniall received an anſwer of a harſher ſtrain, <hi>Viz.</hi> That they retaining <hi>Elbing</hi> and the <hi>Pillaw,</hi> with the Fort on the <note place="margin">The <hi>Suethes</hi> perſiſt.</note> River <hi>Viſtula,</hi> untill the ratification ſhould be gotten, would reſtore <hi>Marienburg</hi> and <hi>Stume</hi> to the <hi>Polander,</hi> conditionally that ſomething equivalent alluding to the <hi>Memeln,</hi> were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto them.</p>

                        </note> advertiſed hereof would not (after long conſultation) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto the meeting, unleſs they were ſecured that two large Boats taken from them, contrary to the ceſſation of armes cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, by the adverſe Party who kept the Fort in the <hi>Wiſtle,</hi> ſhould be reſtored unto them; and the other Mediators ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill at <hi>Stumbſdorff,</hi> his Lordſhip and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> taking that buſineſſe upon them, returned to <hi>Marienburg,</hi> where they urged the matter, and as relative thereunto, moved in behalfe of thoſe that were ſick in the Ship detained in the Road of <hi>Dantzig,</hi> and laſt, propounded the next dayes meeting: to <note place="margin">The <hi>Suethes</hi> reply, and</note> theſe particulars, the <hi>Suethes</hi> made anſwer, That touching the Boats then mentioned, they had purpoſely intercepted them, to hinder the laying of a Bridge before their eyes to their exceeding prejudice; Naturall reaſon allowing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay acts of hoſtility with the like: that nevertheleſſe to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Mediators they would return them as alſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the Officers in their Navy, the free egreſſe of them that were ſick in the ſaid Ship, that ſo the Treaty, for things of ſo ſmall moment, might not by them be hindred; and that <note place="margin">Compliance.</note> albeit they had not received hitherto from the Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland</hi> any certain reſolution, and therfore could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect much good by the next daies meeting, they would never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe be preſent therat. This his Lordſhip ſignified in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland,</hi> and requeſted from the Palatine of <hi>Belzes,</hi> a larger Tent, wherin the parties and the Mediators might aſſemble together.</p>
                     <p>His Lordſhip with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> prepared for the fourth meeting, ſo much the more early, to take order for placing the Mediatoriall Tent in equall diſtance from thoſe of the ſeverall parties, and for the bringing of theirs neerer to eaſe the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators of part of their trouble. Theſe things ſet in order, the Mediators concluded that to either party ſhould be reiterated the Arbitration of the aforeſaid differences by the Mediators. Thoſe of <hi>Poland,</hi> to whom his Lordſhip and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had <note place="margin">Both parties ſtiff.</note> applied themſelves, abſolutely refuſed the ſame, and the <hi>Suethes</hi> appeared to the <hi>French,</hi> and the Electorals leſſe incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therto then before, and thus the Treaty ſeemed to hang
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:109514:102"/>
by a ſmall twiſt: which cauſed the Mediators to labour ſo much the more earneſtly with the ſeverall parties. The <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> profeſſed themſelves willing to hearken to equall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions if they were propounded; neither was there any means left for compounding the difference of the Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ratification, ſave onely an equall diviſion of the places that were to be reſtored or kept: and at laſt not without the unceſſant trouble of the Mediators in goings between, they condeſcended unto theſe Conditions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Truce ſhould be for twenty ſix years; the <hi>Suethes</hi> requiring that one year ſhould be added by way of compenſation for their conſent to the reſtoring of one halfe of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> without the ſtrickt neceſſary form of Parliamentary ratification, whereof the <hi>Polanders</hi> gave no poſitive aſſurance, but promiſed their endeavours for its procurement, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador offering alſo to repaire to the King about the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That upon the Regall and Senatoriall Commiſſioners ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification <note place="margin">Mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions.</note> onely (untill that of the Republike might be had) the <hi>Suethes</hi> ſhould forth with reſtore <hi>Marienburg, Stume, Braunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge</hi> and <hi>Tolkemyth,</hi> with the greater Iſland and the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to each of them belonging; and that <hi>Elbing,</hi> the <hi>Pillaw,</hi> with the leſſer Iſland and their Territories ſhould ſtill be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the Fort made in the <hi>Wiſtle</hi> by the <hi>Suethes,</hi> and the Fortifications made on the bord therof by thoſe of <hi>Dantzig</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ceſſation for foure daies.</note> ſhould be demoliſhed; hereupon the ceſſation was prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for four daies.</p>
                     <p>Thus at laſt the averſneſſe of the parties admitted of ſhews of reconcilement, and by how much the Treaty had ſeemed neer to vaniſh into nothing, by ſo much the hopes of its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py iſſue began to beam forth more bright; wherunto the Mediators thought it might be conducible that the parties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by them as at the firſt, ſhould re-ſalute each other in the midſt of the Village; that ſo by a publike conteſt for Peace and Concord by mutuall interviews, the wiſhed end might be the more eaſily attained: neither was the motion unpleaſing to either of the parties, who now ſeemed equally deſirous of Peace: This Ceremony being performed, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators <note place="margin">Second inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of the Parties.</note> and the parties take leave of each other; and the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar not containing their contentment, publiſhed the Peace as if already concluded.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador obtained of the King the grant of the year demanded, whileſt his Lordſhip and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> at <hi>Marienburg</hi> employ themſelves with the <hi>Sueths</hi> about thoſe things which might further the Pacification: <note place="margin">Exhibition of Articles by the <hi>Suethes.</hi>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:109514:103"/>
Articles of the whole Treaty wheron the agreement might be perfected.</p>
                     <p>The time appointed for the fifth meeting, and all the parties being come, the Mediators thought good that the Conditions (then exhibited by the <hi>Suethes</hi> as fore-promiſed) ſhould be communicated to the Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland:</hi> touching the Subſtance, they were all one with the former, ſome only alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſome added for their own availe, all the Mediators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, they were accurately diſcuſſed by the <hi>Polanders,</hi> not a word or title which might be wreſted to their prejudice left unexamined or corrected? The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (in the Mergent) the ſeverall exceptions made by them. Therwith they alſo tendred to the Mediators ſuch things as they would have to be inſerted: importing, that foraſmuch as the preſent Truce was chiefly ordained and concluded, to <note place="margin">Additions by the <hi>Polanders.</hi>

And if the ſayd Peace ſhould not be then effected, the ſame to be reſumed within the next two years; and if not then, the like within the two years enſuing, and ſo conſequently, the Truce ſtill continuing firme, untill the expiration of the twenty ſix years. Alſo that no Taxes or Cuſtomes ſhould be exacted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">The Truce to be for 26. years.</note> the River <hi>Dyna</hi> from the Inhabitants of the great Dutchy of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> or the Dukedome of <hi>Curland.</hi> That likewiſe, the Rights and Poſſeſſions of the Duke of <hi>Curland</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the ſame ſtate they were before the Warr. That in like manner it ſhould be lawfull for thoſe that had been exiled out of <hi>Suethland</hi> or <hi>Leifland</hi> to return into their Countrey, and to recover their goods and Inheritance; and that; if they ſhould not like to abide there, it ſhould be free for them to ſell or otherway diſpoſe of their ſayd Goods. That Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, or Meſſengers, of either ſide, ſhould have free egreſſe and regreſſe. That the Fugitives of the great Dutchy of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuania,</hi> the Dukedome of <hi>Curland,</hi> and the <hi>Pilten</hi> Territory, or ſo many of them as ſhould be found in <hi>Leifland,</hi> ſhould be reſtored, and ſo reciprocally.

That there ſhould be alſo freedome of Navigation from the Dutchy of <hi>Curland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Conditions were ſhewed to the Commiſſioners of <hi>Suethland</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, and the <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> followed (ſoon after) by his Lordſhip and the <hi>Hollanders;</hi>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:109514:103"/>
the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Emendations and additions (night now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) are curſorily by them run over; and thoſe appearing to be things but of ſmall moment, are referred untill the next day, ſo as all things ſeemed to go forward according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <note place="margin">Hopes of amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble concluſion.</note> deſire. One thing only bred ſome heſitation; the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador reaſoning (by way of diſcourſe) about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Romane Religion in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> urged by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as from the Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland,</hi> the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <note place="margin">A rub caſt in.</note> thereof in behalfe of thoſe of that Religion remaining in <hi>Leifland:</hi> but that alſo was remitted to be handled the day following; neither was it then conceived that ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would have enſued as that particular did afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. The Mediators and the Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained that night in <hi>Stumbſdorff,</hi> the <hi>Suethes</hi> retyred to <hi>Stume,</hi> the ſame being neer adjoyning, that ſo they might begin the more early the next morning.</p>
                     <p>To this ſixth meeting (if not rather a continuance of the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Religion in Leifland.</note> fifth) all Parties aſſembled, and the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, the ſole of all the Mediators addicted to the Romiſh profeſſion, took upon him the patronizing thereof in <hi>Leifland,</hi> and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing zealous therein, earneſtly pleaded that cauſe with the Commiſsioners of <hi>Suethland;</hi> who, obſerving with what fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency he preſſed it, anſwered poſitively in the Negative, and gave theſe reaſons: Firſt, that in their Inſtructions they had not one word touching the ſame, neither, as they conceived, had their Principalls ſo much as once thought of it. Next, that they knew not that there were any of the Romiſh Creed <note place="margin">Poſitively refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Suethes.</hi> and why.</note> in that Province, and therfore it was but a needleſſe trouble to faigne things that were not in being.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, that albeit ſome of that profeſſion might be found there, yet they could not for their conſideration grant a free exerciſe of that Religion, the Statutes and fundamentall Lawes of their Kingdome being expreſly againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe paſſages were by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador related to the Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland,</hi> all of whom (but chiefly the Chancellor) took the matter hainouſly, affirming, that <note place="margin">The <hi>Poles</hi> inſiſt</note> unleſſe proviſion were made for the free exerciſe of Religion to thoſe poor Soules, whoſe Salvation (ſaid they) they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more then the loſſe of all <hi>Leifland,</hi> all the Treaty and the labour that had been employed therin would turn to nothing. His Lordſhip and the other Mediators would not (at firſt) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle in that buſineſſe, as not appertaining unto them; but finding the ſame to grow ſo difficult as not to be eaſily compoſed, but rather likely to overthrow whatſoever had been done before, they alſo thought good to interpoſe their Authority, and the whole day being almoſt ſpent in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and hot diſpute about the ſame, they propounded unto
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:109514:104"/>
the <hi>Polanders</hi> a draught for the reconcilement therof; if ſo be <note place="margin">The other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi>
                        </note> that accepted by them, the <hi>Suethes</hi> could be drawn to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent therunto.</p>
                     <p>But here, becauſe in the whole Treaty no one point was conteſted with more ſharpneſſe on both ſides, as alſo that none was more likely to have cauſed an abſolute diſſolution therof, and that the greateſt difference in the ſeverall means propounded for reconcilement, conſiſted for the moſt part in the diſtinction of words and phraſes.</p>
                     <p>I have thought good to couch the ſeverall formes, placing in the Mergent the Latine wherin they were word for word then conceived, wherby the Reader may with more ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to himſelf ſettle his judgment therupon.</p>
                     <p>The firſt therfore adminiſtred by the Mediators was in theſe words.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Suethes</hi> ſhall permit unto the <hi>(Roman)</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Sueci, hominibus Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis in Livonia toto inducia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum tempore, cultum &amp; ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in privato permiſſuri, nullamque in eos inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem ut hactenus facturi, neminique qui Religionem Catholicam profeſſus fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, id ipſi noxae futurum.</note> Catholike in <hi>Leifland</hi> their Worſhip and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in private during the whole time of the Truce, and no enquiry ſhall be made upon them as formerly, had been, neither ſhall the profeſſing of (that) Catholike Religion be a Crime or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to any perſon there for the future.</p>
                     <p>This form written in a Scroll, was by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators delivered to the Commiſſioners of <hi>Suethland,</hi> each of them adding perſwaſions thereunto, yet all proved in vain, for the Draught was rejected, and night drawing on, an end was made for that time.</p>
                     <p>The next day being the ſeventh, all parties aſſembling, the <note place="margin">Arguments u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador.</hi>
                        </note> former diſpute about the point of Religion in <hi>Leifland</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, wherin the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador employed his whole endeavours, ſharply checking the <hi>Suethes</hi> for this their cruell, and (as he termed it) unheard of way of proceeding; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before them how that the King his Maſter, at their late Kings conſideration, had granted to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> even in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> the free exerciſe of their Religion; which if they ſhould obſtinately perſevere, and that the matter ſo required, he doubted not but he might (by Letters) eaſily diſturb: but the <hi>Suethes,</hi> nothing moved with theſe threats, yea, rather the <note place="margin">Rejected by the <hi>Suethes.</hi>
                        </note> more exaſperated, replied that they were not bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves unto, or to be judged by the examples or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of others, but by their own fundamentall Lawes and Statutes, which (without indangering their heads) they might not ſwarve from, as they ſhould do mainly by condeſcending to the form propounded, which included not only private but publike exerciſe alſo, by thoſe captious words, Worſhip
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:109514:104"/>
and Ceremonie; yet they profeſſed that they would not be <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cultus &amp; Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> Exemption from enquiry granted by the <hi>Suethes.</hi>
                        </note> ſo ſevere as to make inquiſition upon, or trouble the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes; but as heretofore would permit them to enjoy their private liberty of Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>The Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland</hi> were no way contented with this Declaration, as well in regard (ſaid they) that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without Worſhip, Rights, and Ceremonies, due at Divine Service, was but (in a manner) a dead Image; as alſo, that the liberty of Conſcience enjoyed untill then, by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes there, was indeed none at all, but a meer bondage, feare and trembling; during which, neither could thoſe who were forced to conceal themſelves, celebrate, or partake of the Maſſe, nor would their Children who ſhould be afterwards borne, become initiated into their Church by Baptiſme. That <note place="margin">Referred by the <hi>Poles</hi> to their King.</note> yet, not to break off the Treaty, they thought good to refer this ſomething, which they eſteemed as nothing unto their King, in a ſmuch as untill this point were ſettled, they could not proceed unto the other Articles; onely at the inſtance of the Mediators, by mutuall conſent of parties, the ceſſation was prorogued for three daies.</p>
                     <p>During the time of reſpite, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured <note place="margin">
                           <hi>French</hi> Amb.

                     <p>The day prefixed for the eighth meeting being come, the Parties and the Mediators aſſembled at the wonted Village, where the Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland,</hi> authorized by their King, <note place="margin">The former forme inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by the <hi>Poles.</hi>
                        </note> inſiſt more mainely then before, upon the foreſayd forme of Covenant, in the point of the Romiſh Religion; and for the more aſſurance, deſired that the ſame might be ratified under the Hands and Seales of the Mediators, and affirmed that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were granted, there remained nothing but Warr, which (they ſayd) they eſteemed to be ſo much the more juſt, by how much it was more glorious to conteſt to the laſt gaſpe, yea even to imbrace an honourable death, for the liberty of conſcience and Religion.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things, with other like, being by them delivered; the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, earneſtly pleaded their cauſe with the Commiſſioners of <hi>Suethland,</hi> and as he was endowed with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Eloquence, ſo he endeavoured to move them, by the ſtrongeſt and moſt dexterous arguments he could, to admit of the foreſaid form of Stipulation: Yet the <hi>Suethes</hi> (inflexible in <note place="margin">Again by the <hi>Suethes</hi> reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> their reſolve) reject the ſame as captious and including under a ſpecious forme of words, a free exerciſe of the Romiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:109514:105"/>
which they might not aſſent unto; and added, that they alſo ſhould have thereby a moſt juſt cauſe of Warr in maintaining by force and armes the liberty of Religion, which by the Divine goodneſſe they had obtained, and in conſerving the Lawes of their Kingdome without violation, which it would be more diſhonourable for them to forego then if they had never had the ſame.</p>
                     <p>With this repulſe the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador at firſt aſtoniſhed, afterward chafed, began to expoſtulate and to blame their hard heartedneſſe, as he tearmed it, but being unable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any further, he (though ſeeming thereto unwilling) takes a hopeleſſe farewell, departing from them to the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> whom his Lordſhip and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had, in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, aſſayed to perſwade: Whilſt he related the laſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely negative reply of the <hi>Suethes,</hi> ſome of them, being moved with indignation, ſpoke aloud the words of <hi>(War</hi>

                     <p>The tumult being heard, Generall <hi>Wrangle,</hi> who had untill then contained himſelf, ſeeing the diſorder like to encreaſe, from whence danger might enſue, came forth of their Tent with a Partizan in his hand, and began to act his part of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Commander, as well as of a Politick Commiſſioner, and having placed the Horſ-men in order, but with a charge not to advance, yet if preſſed, to repay blood with blood, he went immediately to draw up the foot, ſo to be ready if the contrary party ſhould aſſail them.

                     <p>For theſe and other conſiderations it may be (and was) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that he might not unwillingly caſt in that Bone, the rather for that the buſineſſe being almoſt ended, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by how much neerer to peace in their hopes, by ſo much the more affected unto it, ſo as they would not break off upon ſlight occaſions, not doubting, but that either by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or the Mediators, a meane would be found out to make all even againe: and if he were not the firſt mover of that point, then which he could never have pickt out one more ſpecious, or that could carry more luſtre, nor render him more gracious with the <hi>Polanders,</hi> eſpecially with their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy who bear a great ſway in that Kingdome, yet it may be ſuppoſed that by his forwardneſſe therein, he animated the <hi>Polanders</hi> to a greater pertinacy, and obſtinate perſeverance in that conteſt, which was longer and more hotly continued then any other, neither was any one more likely to have cauſed a finall rupture. As to his pretended conſcientious zeale, albeit there can be nothing better then to retain a good conſcience in all things, yet the conſcience of one man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obligatory to that of another, much leſſe to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and eſpecially to their prejudice; the ſame conſiſting of a mans inward diſpoſition towards God and Man wrought in him by that ſpirit wherewith he is acted; and therefore a mans private conſcience ought not to be inſtanced as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to a State, in matters of Religion, and eſpecially of a different Creed.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe deſignes, there wanted but little that the King having gotten ſuch an advantage, had not, made uſe thereof to thwart all their hopes of a reconcilement and to advance his owne ends; for the Warlike Prince, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in all his former undertakings againſt his Enemies, and breathing new Conqueſts; had (as was conceived) no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the Truce, but rather deſired to have vindicated his pretenſions to the Crowne and Kingdome of <hi>Suethland,</hi> by the Sword, ſeeing very well that he ſhould not obtaine the ſame by Treaty.

                     <p>The <hi>Poland</hi> Commiſſioners anſwered his Lordſhips pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, by an acknowledgment that the <hi>Dantzig</hi> ſtample upon cloath, granted by King <hi>Sigiſmundus,</hi> was unjuſt, and ſeverall wayes prejudiciall; and promiſed to employ their endeavours at the next Parliament for the abrogation therof, <note place="margin">Plauſible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</note> conforme to their Kings promiſe to his Lordſhip: but they affirmed, that for the preſent, they neither had power nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that any out of Parliament, could be given them againſt an Act therof, ſuch as the grant of the ſtample was: that as all Nations were bounded by their proper lawes, ſo it likewiſe behoved them to govern themſelves by their Statutes; his Lordſhip was not contented with this plauſible anſwer, and indeed it was no more, but replied that the like words had

The next day being the eleventh Congreſſe, the Regall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution was expected untill ten of the forenoon; and not to <note place="margin">And other points diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> loſe time, the foreſaid difficulties being ſet apart, the other Conditions were taken into diſcuſſion by either of the parties, by reaſon that the King being gone to <hi>Dantzig,</hi> it was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his reſolution would hardly be brought in three daies: The Articles for the free return of the exiled <hi>Suethes</hi> living in <hi>Poland,</hi> into their native Country, as alſo the reſtitution of their Goods movable and immovable were that day tranſacted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the Curious are referred to the Articles of the Treaty.</p>
                     <p>Upon the day following which made the twelfth meeting, the Mediators proceeded with the parties to the examination of the Conditions remaining, which cauſed a new ſcruple with the <hi>Suethes,</hi> by reaſon of an uncertain rumour that Duke <hi>Radzivill,</hi> great Generall of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> had lately upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration <note place="margin">New Scruple of the <hi>Suethes.</hi>
                        </note> of the firſt Truce made entrance into <hi>Leifland,</hi> and taken certain places and Townes: The <hi>Suethes,</hi> who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Article about the retaining of <hi>Leifland</hi> according to the form of the former Treaty; That each party ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the ſame during the Truce in the ſame manner he then poſſeſſed it, deſired of the Mediators that in regard the form aforeſaid was in generall and obſcure termes, wherby they <note place="margin">Demand thereon.</note> might ſuſtain prejudice, a clauſe might be added, that if any places in <hi>Leiſland</hi> had been taken of either ſide during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Treaty, they ſhould be reſtored.</p>
                     <p>This reſtriction ſeemed ſtrange unto the <hi>Poles,</hi> yet affected them rather with laughter then anger, they ſolemnly affirming <note place="margin">Anſwered by the <hi>Poles.</hi>
                        </note> that they were ignorant of what was done in <hi>Leifland,</hi> and that they did not beleive the Duke to hav emade a progreſſe ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous as was vulgarly reported: but alledged withall, that the Conventions ware wholly repugnant to that clauſe, and that what had once been concluded by agreement ought not to be altered; that for them, in caſe they had been ſo fortunate to reſtore thoſe things they had obtained by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable chance of War, would expoſe them to the ſcorne of all men. The Mediators (that they might make a timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move of this rub) remonſtrated, that foraſmuch as the firſt prorogation of the Truce had beeen continued from the month of <hi>July</hi> to that preſent of <hi>Auguſt</hi> from time to time, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of parties, it was no leſſe to be underſtood for a ceſſation of hoſtility in <hi>Leifland</hi> then in <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> and that they had ever beleived, according as it had been reported unto them, that Couriers had been from time to time diſpatched into <hi>Leifland</hi> to that effect. That if nothing but the truth were affirmed, the requeſt of the <hi>Suethes</hi> ſeemed unto them wholly conſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous to reaſon and to the publike faith given, ſo oftentimes <note place="margin">Judgement of the Mediators.</note>

reiterated; and that they therfore earneſtly intreated them not to go upon captious advantages, ſhewing that they had been already enough and over-much troubled about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent differences.</p>
                     <p>The Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland</hi> being moved with theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, yet having no power of themſelves to diſpoſe of <note place="margin">Referred to the King.</note> the matter, they referred it alſo to the King, whoſe pleaſure therin they deſired to receive: The other Articles were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from noon to night, throughly diſcuſſed; and therein amongſt other things, the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lords earneſtly urged, that the firſt condition of their ſide concerning a Treaty for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Peace, during the preſent Truce, to be appointed at a certain time and place (as hath been before expreſſed) might be included in the Acts of this Treaty, with ſundry other things formerly by them exhibited. Laſtly a Prorogation of the ceſſation was agreed unto for foure daies.</p>
                     <p>The meeting was reſumed the day following, being the 13th. and therein the Commiſſioners of <hi>Suethland</hi> vigorouſly oppoſed the inſerting of the foreſaid Article into thoſe of the preſent Treaty for Truce; chiefly for this reaſon, that the Treaty for a perpetuall Peace having been already deſerted, and in lieu therof this Negotiation of Truce undertaken, they could not as then ſay ought therto; and therfore ſeeing that their Commiſſion of treating about the ſame was expired, they could not admit of any particular mention therof in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the preſent Treaty, nor prefix any place or time; but added that foraſmuch as they certainly knew their Queen would never be averſe to ſuch a Treaty, they conſented to a generall mention therof, ſuch as had been in the former Truce for the ſix years now expired.</p>
                     <p>This diſtinction being intimated to the <hi>Polanders,</hi> they were <note place="margin">Other difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties compoſed.</note> ſomewhat chafed, but his Lordſhip propounding that either the Duke of <hi>Courland,</hi> or of <hi>Pomerania</hi> might be entreated to take the matter on them as Sollicitors or Intermediators; their intervention was not unacceptable to thoſe of <hi>Poland,</hi> nor the addition made by the <hi>Suethes,</hi> that in caſe the Treaty of perpetuall Peace ſhould not ſucceed according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall wiſhes, either at the firſt, or ſo often as it ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, the preſent Truce ſhould (notwithſtanding) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main firme and unviolable untill the end of the terme prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe Articles.</p>
                     <p>The Kings anſwer concerning the three foreſpecified points; to wit, the <hi>Pruſſian</hi> Land-ſeal, the way of Deduction for the Army of <hi>Suethes,</hi> and the reſtitution of places (if any) taken in <hi>Leifland</hi> during the preſent Treaty, was not yet come, ſo as the Mediators being inforced to patience, betook themſelves to their ſeverall Retreats.</p>

                        <pb n="205" facs="tcp:109514:111"/>
The fourteenth meeting was now come, but not the Kings anſwer, in the meane time the Mediators endeavoured to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that point of the deduction of the Army, but could not. The <hi>Polanders</hi> refuſed the ſame for theſe two reaſons cheifly; Firſt, that by granting it they ſhould ſeeme willing to give way to the prejudice of thoſe whoſe Lands they ſhould paſſe through, perhaps even to their ruine, through the inſolencie of Souldiers in their March, notwithſtanding any Order or command to the contrary: the promiſe of ſtrickt obſervation of Military diſcipline by Commisſioners deputed thereunto, they conceived to be a fair colour but not a ſafeguard ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prevent loſſe or injury; much leſſe any aſſurance thereby of competent ſatisfaction: Secondly, that by this meanes they might offend other Princes, but moſtly the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, to whoſe prejudice it would turne. The <hi>Suethes</hi> on the other ſide, ſhewed, that they had not halfe the Shipps that would be needfull to tranſport by Sea ſo great an Army as theirs, which they computed to conſiſt of (with their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons) two and twenty thouſand <hi>Effectivè:</hi> but that if they were ſupplyed of Shipping, either by the <hi>Dantzigers</hi> or others, they would willingly take that way.</p>
                     <p>After this diſpute, whereby nothing was gained of either ſide; the <hi>Polanders,</hi> at the Mediators requeſt, ſent other Meſſengers to haſten the Kings declaration, which yet they could not expect that day, and therefore the ceſſation now <note place="margin">Ceſſation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued one day onely.</note> neere expiring, it was thought good to continue the ſame one day longer onely; ſo ſparing of time were thoſe of <hi>Poland,</hi> by reaſon of the great charge they ſuſtained in retaining the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whereupon each Party retired, and the meeting was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred untill the ſecond day following.</p>
                     <p>The fifteenth Congreſſe was now come, and with it the <note place="margin">The Kings reſolution.</note> Kings reſolution, which was delivered to the Mediators by the Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland</hi> in this manner. Touching the <hi>Pruſſian</hi> Land-ſeale, there ſhould be inſerted in the ſeventh Article which made mention of conſerving the rights, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and Cuſtomes of <hi>Elbing,</hi> that he would maintaine the ſame as in former times it had been, both as to the Seale and Seſſion (but with this clauſe) after they had tendred the due Oath of Fidelity to his Majeſty.</p>

                     <p>Upon the ſixteenth reſort all the morning was imployed in reviewing and tranſcribing the Articles, which being done, the Commiſſioners on both ſides being accompanied by the Mediating Miniſters, were brought into the Mediatoriall <note place="margin">Generall meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and parties in the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Tent.</note> Tent, and there (with the Mediators) took their Stations without prer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe of <hi>Poland</hi> urged the inſerting of that ceremonial Article, that the Emperor, the Duke of <hi>Bavaria, &amp;c.</hi> might be included in the Treaty, as had been done in the laſt ſix years Truce, the <hi>Suethes</hi> affirmed the ſame to be altogether needleſſe, yet (at laſt) conſented to inſert, That if any Chriſtian Potentate, or Prince, of either part, ſhould deſire to be comprehended within the preſent Treaty, they might have admittance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they did declare themſelves within five months, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting from the ſigning of thoſe preſents.</p>
                     <p>His Lordſhip objected againſt the 14.

of the publike concernment of other Nations, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe had no ſmall intereſt therein, and inſiſted that (in the Latine) the ſame might be corrected by interpoſing the conjunction <hi>(Et)</hi> which alſo had been promiſed by the <hi>Sueths,</hi> but his Lordſhip finding their Copy likewiſe defective in that particular, did not ſpare, even in that publike convention, to tel one of their Commiſſioners, that he had deceived his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and truſt.

                        </note> of <hi>Poland</hi> replied, that the preſent Treaty was between them and the <hi>Suethes</hi> only, and not with other Nations, who (if they had ought to negotiate) might elſewhere diſcuſſe the ſame, and that it was not to be confuſedly intermixt with thoſe Treaties. His Lordſhip made return, that the point in queſtion was not a confuſed intermixion in the Treaty, but a main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent therupon, in regard that the diſturbance of Traffick with other Nations had proceeded from the diſſention between thoſe two Crownes, and ought therfore (of right) to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to its ancient freedome by this League of Peace: yet this or what elſe he could alledge availed not; For the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were now bent to agree, and the Conditions in a manner concluded; neither would they by inſiſting upon things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous to themſelves, run into the hazard of a breach: and the rather, becauſe the <hi>Dantzigers,</hi> who were Potent on the <note place="margin">Deſerted by the <hi>Suethes.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Poliſh</hi> ſide, and ſaw how much this concerned their Stample, did mainly oppoſe it. On the other ſide the <hi>Suethes</hi> deſerted the ſame, albeit that (formerly) in their care of the Towne of <hi>Elbing,</hi> they had recommended it to be inſiſted on by the Mediators, as an Article <hi>(Sine qua, Non:)</hi> Neither had the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador any intereſt in this Article, or the <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers</hi> likewiſe, nor the <hi>Hollanders</hi> not much in compariſon of us: So that his Lordſhip, not able to carry it alone, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to deſiſt.</p>
                     <p>It is here obſervable, that his Lordſhip diſcourſing with <note place="margin">Precedency of nomination challenged by his Lordſhip.</note> the <hi>Polanders</hi> in their own Tent, concerning the precedencie of nomination to be inſerted in the preface of the Articles, which, according to right of intervening he challenged as due to the King his Maſter, by whom his firſt repaire had been directed toward their King; they declined the ſame on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <note place="margin">Declined by the <hi>Poles.</hi>
                        </note> of its being contrary to the cuſtome of their <hi>Cancellarie,</hi> which (ſaid they) alwayes gave the precedence to the King of <hi>France,</hi> where from it was not lawfull for them to ſwarve. His Lordſhip taking this ſome what harſhly, told them (and breifly) that as to the couching of the preface he muſt leave the care of it to them, yet he deſired they would be cautious of diſcontenting a Prince their freind, who had given proof thereof in ſundry occaſions, and particularly in that before them.</p>

Hereupon the parties according in all things, aſſembled in a confident and friendly manner in the Mediatoriall Tent, to confer (even without them) of ſome things more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: after which there remained nothing but that the two Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals <hi>Conigſpolskie,</hi> and <hi>Jacobus de la Garde,</hi> ſhould meet and treat touching the time of the reſtitution of places, as <hi>Marien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, Stume,</hi> and <hi>Braunsburg,</hi> as alſo about the deduction of the Army; wherupon the Treaty, when ſigned, would at laſt be finally concluded: both which points were deferred unto the day following, and concerning the attendants of the fore-named Generalls, it was agreed of either ſide, that each ſhould not exceed the number of fifty followers.</p>
                     <p>The ſeventeenth meeting enſued, or rather a continuation <note place="margin">Conteſt for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</note> of the former, in which ſome conteſt hapned between the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> about the Subſcription, and the like campetition alſo between the Electorals and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> each party being willing to vindicate the preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the right of his Prince or Principals, ſo as the former Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators did now ſeem to ſtand in need of the like. The diſpute <note place="margin">Meeting of the Generals of each ſide.</note> about the ſame was not ſmal, but whilſt it was in hotteſt agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Generals of each ſide attended with the foreſpecified number, in great Magnificence arrived at the place of treaty, and each accompanied with the Mediators, did (ſoon after) ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute each other in the open Village neer unto the Mediatoriall Tent; wherinto they entred with the Commiſſioners of the ſeverall Crowns, by ſeverall waies, and therin conſulted about the reſtitution of places, and the deduction of the Army.</p>
                     <p>Between them it was agreed, that the <hi>Suethes,</hi> receiving the <note place="margin">And accord.</note> Regall ratification of the Treaty forthwith, as alſo ſecurity from the Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland</hi> authorized by Parliament, the ſame ſhould be ratified by the States at their next conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould reſtore <hi>Marienburg</hi> with the greater Iſland, <hi>Stume, Braunsberge,</hi> and <hi>Tolkemyth,</hi> with the Territories belonging to them, into the hands of the Commiſſioners of the King and Kingdome of <hi>Poland,</hi> the Garriſons being firſt removed: and that the <hi>Heught</hi> and <hi>Junkertreill</hi> ſhould be razed in the preſence of certaine Deputies of each ſide, leaving the ground and goods to whom they belonged. That the Armies of either ſide ſhould be ſent away within fourteen daies, or therabouts: But that <hi>Elbing</hi> with its ancient bounds; the leſſer Iſland with the Fortifications raiſed therin, as alſo the <hi>Pillaw</hi> and that part of the <hi>Nering</hi> therto appertaining, ſhould remain in the poſſeſſion of the Queen and Crowne of <hi>Suethen,</hi> untill they ſhould receive the ratification of the States of <hi>Poland,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to render up the foreſaid places within fourteen daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the receit therof; and that the Garriſons ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without any damage to the Inhabitants; with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

alſo, that all the Fortifications made at <hi>Elbing</hi> ſhould remain in the ſame ſtate they then were, and in the ſame cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody as before the War.</p>
                     <p>The Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland</hi> having deſired an atteſtation from the Mediators, touching the form of conceſſion, by the <hi>Sueths</hi> for the private permiſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion in <hi>Leif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador being unwilling to ſigne the ſame in reference to the competition between him and the Ambaſſador of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lords were contented to accept of a teſtification from his Lordſhip and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> onely, which they granted, the ſame importing; That they <note place="margin">Atteſtation granted to the <hi>Polanders</hi> by his Lordſhip and the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</hi>
                        </note> did therby teſtifie and make known to all whom it might any way concern, that the Lords Commiſſioners for the Queene and Kingdome of <hi>Suethland</hi> had really covenanted and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the <hi>Romane</hi> Catholicks in <hi>Leifland,</hi> ſhould, during the whole time of the Truce, enjoy liberty of Conſcience, the Roman Catholick Religion, and Devotion in private, nor any inquiſition to be made, or puniſhment to be therfore inflicted: and that the preſent atteſtation was given with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and expreſſe conſent of the fore-mentioned Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in confirmation wherof they had therunto affixed their hands and ſeales But in the <hi>interim,</hi> no <hi>Medium</hi> being found wherby to compound the competitions of the Mediators, that matter was referred untill the day following.</p>
                     <p>The eighteenth meeting for the finall concluſion being now come, the Lords Ambaſſadors of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> and <hi>France</hi> renewed their diſpute about precedency; which encreaſing in difficulty and intricacy ſeemed to hinder the parties (who <note place="margin">Competitions renewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators.</note> were now reconciled and friends) from concluding and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the Treaty; for the avoiding wherof his Lordſhip was pleaſed to declare himſelf in two waies to the Commiſſioners of either ſide; firſt, that the difference might be ballanced by two Copies of the Conditions of the Treaty to each party, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally ſigned by the Mediators. Or ſecondly, that there ſhould be no Subſcription or Signature by any of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as had been done in the former Treaty now ſix years paſt. That as to the Preface he committed the ſame to them, but in diſcharge of his Legatoriall duty, he again admoniſhed them to beware of giving any offence unto the King his Maſter. By <note place="margin">Mediatoriall ſubſcription concluded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſsary.</note> the Commiſſioners of either ſide it was concluded that the Mediatoriall Subſcription was not neceſſary, and that the Signature of the parties would be ſufficient in this as well as in the former Treaty, but that the Mediators might if they would ſo be pleaſed, give an Inſtrument in writing apart, for the more ample verification therof.</p>
                     <p>As to the preface, the <hi>Suethes</hi> declared in favour of the <hi>French,</hi> that it had ever been the Cuſtome of their Crowne to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:109514:114"/>
give the precedency in nomination to the Regall Ambaſſador who firſt addreſſed himſelfe to them. With this anſwere his Lordſhip: oppoſed the ſtile (pretended) of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellarie; but was by their Commiſſioners, anſwered rather with ſilence than by arguments.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador did mainely inſiſt that he might <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> inſiſts on ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</note> ſubſcribe the Articles alone; but, that he might not (by conteſt) ſeeme to be the ſole obſtacle of the Treaties confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, he repaired to his Lordſhips quarter, with whom, when no perſwaſions to that end would prevaile, after a long diſcourſe of the dignity and precedencie of Kings, he conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the waving of all Mediatoriall ſubſcription. <note place="margin">Afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines it.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Lordſhip nevertheleſſe, to be ſecured of all ſides, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſited each of the Parties, and in friendly manner deſired them that as themſelves had declared, and as he had newly concluded with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, no Subſcription of <note place="margin">No ſubſcription of Mediators promiſed.</note> the Mediators unleſſe in the way by him propounded, might be admitted, whereunto they all accorded and gave their word.</p>
                     <p>This difference about the ſubſcription being removed, <note place="margin">The parties meet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude.</note> the Commiſſioners of each ſide convened in the Mediatoriall Tent to the performance of the laſt act <hi>viz.</hi> the Signing of the Articles; whom the Mediators followed to be preſent at the reviewing of the ſame; leaſt ought might be tranſacted wherein their Principalls might be concerned.</p>
                     <p>In the reading, the preface was ommitted whereby no <note place="margin">The Articles ſigned.</note> offence might be taken, and that worke being ended, the Mediators were in moſt reſpective manner deſired to retire and leave them to ſigne alone: which they did; and upon their comming forth were by the Mediators congratulated, for that happy concluſion.</p>
                     <p>Thus, at length, by the bleſſing of God upon the infatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble toile and induſtrie of the Mediators, this great and difficult worke, after ſo many deſperate-ſeeming ruptures, was <note place="margin">Publike rejoyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> brought to a happy iſſue in twenty and foure ſeverall meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (accounting <hi>ab initio)</hi> and couched in ſo many ſeverall Articles, which having been for the moſt part already touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are forborne to be here inſerted, and the curious referred to the printed Acts.</p>
                     <p>The whole was read, allowed, ſigned, and confirmed by the reſpective Commisſioners of the intereſſed Parties the 2/12 of <hi>September, An.</hi> 1635. and the joy thereof was conceived to be ſo great that publike acclamations were every where heard. At <hi>Marienburg</hi> the whole Ordnance (about the Town and Caſtle) was diſcharged upon the returne of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors with the Commisſioners of <hi>Suethland.</hi> Onely the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador remained in <hi>Stumbſdorff</hi> to (refreſh himſelfe as

pretended, but indeed to) ſend an account by expreſſe unto the King his Maſter.</p>
                     <p>The remainder of that day was by his Lordſhip and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> employed in giving to the Commiſſioners of <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>

                     <p>That wheras there had been long and great diſpvte concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in <hi>Leifland,</hi> at length, the Queen and Crown of <hi>Suethland,</hi> at the inſtant urgencies of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of <hi>Poland</hi> had condeſcended ſo far as to permit to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in <hi>Leifland,</hi> liberty of Conſcience, Religion, and Devotion in private; but leaſt that from thoſe words ought might be inferred, contrary to their intention in that point, over and above the meer liberty of conſcience by them granted, or leaſt that there might be pretended any Prieſtly exerciſe either publike or private, they the ſaid Commiſſioners had many times in their preſence excepted (by proteſtation) againſt all the formes including any word of exerciſe, either ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely or expreſſed, and that the Lord Ambaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> (who had moſt earneſtly laboured therin) had propounded the ſame, and the Commiſſioners of <hi>Poland</hi> had aſſented therunto; in which Forme (or Draught) no mention of exerciſe was made, that ſo they might by ſome faire way explicate and free themſelves from that contention: This, they the ſaid Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did witneſſe and confirme to all whom it might concern, under their hands and Seals.</p>

He was Native of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and deſcended from that branch <note place="margin">His birth.</note> of the honourable houſe of the <hi>Duglaſſe</hi> entitled the <hi>Baronnie</hi> of <hi>Torthorrell,</hi> being Son to Sir <hi>George Duglaſſe</hi> Knight, whoſe Father (whileſt living) had been, and whoſe brother then was Lord thereof. His Mother was of the houſe of <hi>Dundaſs,</hi> a Family of good repute in that Nation, as being both Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Noble. His Father came into <hi>England</hi> either with, or ſoone after, King <hi>James,</hi> bringing with him his Children (whether his Lady were then living I cannot ſay) <hi>George,</hi> of whom the preſent mention is made; <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> Since married to Sir <hi>James Lockhart</hi> of <hi>Leigh</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and then of the privy Chamber in Ordinary to the late King.</p>
                  <p>His Education (after ſome yeares ſpent in the Schooles) <note place="margin">Education.</note> was at the Univerſitie of Oxford (if information erre not) and he ſo much a Schollar, as that the Latine tongue was fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to him both by ſpeech and pen, not onely for Ordinary but likewiſe for Elegant expreſſions; Neither was he ignorant of the Greek: But, thinking the Schooles an over ſoft courſe of exerciſe, he left them and betook himſelfe to Armes, as more Suitable both with his Complexion and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. <note place="margin">Entrie into Military em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</note>

                  <p>Under the Banner of that great Warriour (whom I have rightly tearmed invincible, as both living and dying ſuch) he ſerved ſundry yeares: And that Prince being no Prodigall of Military preferment, he attained onely to the degree of Lievtenant Colonell of a Regiment of Foot (by which Title we will now call him untill Providence give him another) whereof Sir <hi>James Ramſay,</hi> was Colonel, the ſame <hi>Bamſay,</hi> who ſo gallantly afterwards, for ſome yeares, defended <hi>Hanaw</hi> againſt the whole Imperiall Force in thoſe parts, untill releived by the then General Major <hi>Leſley,</hi> now Earle of <hi>Leven,</hi> and the ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel lying wounded of ſome hurt he had received at the Seige of the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Wirtzburg</hi> (if my relation faile not) his Lievtenant Colonel Commanded the Regiment, and at the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Creutznach,</hi> (a ſtrong Town in the Palatinate) was by the King Ordered to ſecure the ſame from thoſe inſolencies that might ariſe from the Souldier, which he did with ſuch celerity and ſatisfaction, as that the King (who entred ſoone <note place="margin">Deſigned to be Governour of <hi>Creutznach.</hi>

Generall, upon ſome miſtake in an addreſſe of his, gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for his reſtraint, which nevertheleſſe continued long: for that Prince, who was wont ſome times to take provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations before the bound, underſtanding the Errour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <note place="margin">Falls into the Kings diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> to releaſe <hi>Duglaſs,</hi> and to deliver him a Commiſſion for the foreſaid Government, which Order he left with that great States man (the Neſtor of <hi>Suethland) Axelius Oxenſtierne</hi> Knight, free Baron of <hi>Kymitho,</hi> Lord of <hi>Fiholmen</hi> and <hi>Tidoen &amp;c.</hi> his Chancellour, whom he, at his haſty departure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Noremberg,</hi> whither the neceſſity of that place, and his engagement, both by honour and promiſe invited him, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to abide at <hi>Francfort</hi> on the Maine, for the regulating, by his great Prudence, of the affaires in thoſe parts of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</p>
                  <p>It may be thought that our Lievtenant Colonell had cauſe <note place="margin">Seldome ſubject to paſſion.</note> to reſt contented, having received ample ſatisfaction, by a preferment ſo honourable, which alſo might have proved but a ſtep to greater: But he, who likewiſe was not exempt from the boy lings of paſſion, was reſolved to admit of no reparation as not enduring ought which he conceived to be an affront, from what hand ſoever it came. Or rather, we may (more Chriſtian like) conclude, that God, who had numbred his dayes, having decreed that before his Exit hence, he ſhould quit thoſe Courſes that impelled to the effuſion of bloud, and enter upon ſuch as were more acceptable to himſelfe, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtrumentall in preventing the ſame in others; and that having been ſundry yeares uſefull in Warrs, which the ſpirit of diſcention raiſeth between Princes; he ſhould cloſe up the remainder by being actually inſtrumentary for peace between jarring Kingdomes: The ſame God, (I ſay) who createth the fruit of the lips, Peace, and is the Lover and Author of Peace and Concord, had otherwiſe diſpoſed of him.</p>
                  <p>The Commiſſion for the foreſaid Government was tendred <note place="margin">Refuſeth the foreſaid Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> unto him, but (the meanes being appointed to the end by providence deſigned) was by him refuſed and a paſs demanded, which the Chancellour enquired into the cauſe of, telling him withall he could not grant it: yet, <hi>Duglaſs</hi> ſtill perſiſting, the Chancellour (who loving him, had uſed both reaſons and perſwaſions to divert him from his purpoſe, and could not prevaile) afforded him a <hi>Foreloff,</hi> being a conceſſion of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy for ſome time from his charge, during which he might repair to the King &amp; obtain his paſs if it ſhould be thought fit.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> Knight, Comptrollor of the houſehold to the late King, and one of his privy Counſell, being by him ſent his Ambaſſador Extraordinary to the King of <hi>Suethen,</hi> and then upon his journey toward that Prince, came to <hi>Erancfort</hi> aforeſaid: To him our Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

                     <note place="margin">Preſents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the King at <hi>Noremberg.</hi>
                     </note> (with his Army) then lay.</p>
                  <p>The firſt preſentment <hi>Duglaſs</hi> made of himſelf, was at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of his Arrivall, in the <hi>Tennis-Court</hi> of <hi>Noremberg,</hi> wherein the two Kings of <hi>Suethland</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi> were then exerciſing themſelves: And here it may be conceived not unlikely, but that the Chancellour had given his great Maſter notice, as well of the arrivall of the Ambaſſadour of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> as of the defection of the Lievtenant Colonel, yet meerly out of his duty of acquainting the King with all paſſages, even of the leaſt concernment, and not intentionally, as may be judged, to procure the Gentleman any prejudice, to whom he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſhewed ſuch faire, and more then common reſpects, as he was by his Camarades in Armes frequently called (either in jeſt or envy) the Chancellours Favourite.</p>
                  <p>The King had no ſooner eyed him but he was affected with <note place="margin">Againe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> Choller, and after he had demanded of him why he was not at his Charge, and by the other anſwered that he had none, or to that effect, with ſome other brief paſſages; He ordered the Lievtenant Colonel to be forthwith committed, which was immediatly done.</p>
                  <p>It may be conceived that great <hi>Brittaines</hi> Ambaſſadour was herewith but little pleaſed, and might think not onely him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but his Maſter likewiſe concerned, that one of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects intending for his Country, and to that and coming to crave his diſmiſſion, under the Protection of his own Prince in the perſon of his Repreſentative, ſhould therfore be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Yet from our Lievtenant Colonel, the Relator (who had it from himſelf) heard not that he ſuddainly moved ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whether willing to let the firſt heat over-paſſe; or that his main and much of buſineſſe, for ſuch an inch of time, at his firſt interviews diverted him.</p>
                  <p>That King underſtanding within few daies, that ſome of the Enemies Forces intended an On-ſlaught into his Quarters, or bound upon ſome other private, if not the like deſigne, gave order for two thouſand Horſe to be in a readineſſe the next morning (a ſure ſigne that himſelf would command that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) which was done accordingly, and himſelf already in <note place="margin">His releaſe moved by the Ambaſſador.</note> Coach, the Lord Ambaſſadour then preſent (who had diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him of other Affaires) being about to take leave, moved the releaſe of our Lievtenant Colonel, but the King

ſuddainly paſſionate, gave him an anſwer ſo lofty and trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Maſter, as might have been better ſpared, and ſhall therfore be here omitted: Nor was his Lordſhip wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to reply in ſuch a manner as became his Courage, and like a perſon of honour repreſenting his Prince.</p>
                  <p>As the great <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was ſubject to flaſhes of paſſion which were the onely Clouds in his Hemiſphere, and therby would (not ſeldome) give offence, ſo, had he thoſe ſpeedy recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; the beſt badge of a good diſpoſition, as permitted him not to retain them, but that preſent acknowledgment and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction enſued, as indeed it did here, and ſo fully as was not little, from a Prince, ſuccesfull and great in Armes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, which uſually elate even moſt equally tempered Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: But as the expreſſions that were diſtaſtfull, ſo likewiſe, the acknowledgment ſhall be here forborne, there being the ſame reaſon for the one as the other: Only this may be ſaid, <note place="margin">

Two Mannours (or Lordſhips) belonging to the Houſe Palatine had been committed into his of his Fathers hands, by the late King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> they being then good friends; but diſputes, ariſing afterwards between them, grew to a quarrell; whereupon Count <hi>Mansfeldt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the <hi>Landtgraves</hi> Countrey, took him priſoner, and ſo detained him certaine dayes; but his liberty being regained, and the Emperors affaires proſpering, he procured, as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for his ſufferings, a grant from the Emperor, not onely of thoſe two Mannours, but of ſeverall other Lands likewiſe, belonging to the Counts of <hi>Solmes, Iſenberg, Lewenſteyne,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, followers and domeſticks of the Prince Elector Palatine.</p>

                  <p>Whileſt ſome weeks of time were ſpent in ſuch like prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Letters of ſafe conduct and Convoyes were deſired from the Generals of the oppoſite Armies, through part of which we were neceſſitated to paſſe: His Lordſhip (in the <hi>interim)</hi> made entry upon his Commiſſion, by viſiting the great Chancellour of <hi>Suethen, Axelius Oxenſtierne,</hi> at <hi>Mentz,</hi> and by delivering to him the Letters he had from his Maſter, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <note place="margin">Enters upon his commiſſion by viſiting the Chancellour of <hi>Suethen.</hi>

Yet it is not improbable, and his Lordſhip did ſo conceive, that they would not unwillingly, have declined our interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it had been in their power, knowing that <hi>Englands</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the point of Trade and Commerce (on which their Toll in the <hi>Balthick</hi> Sea lay ſo heavy) would bring him in to croſſe their deſignes, and pull from them a Bit which they had found ſo ſweet, as they were loth to part with.</p>
                  <p>The Chancellor began (then) to diſcourſe of the Treaty that <note place="margin">The Chancellors diſcourſe.</note> was to enſue, wherin he demonſtrated, at length, the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that would occur, even at the firſt meetings, touching Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Titles, as hath plentifully appeared in that Treaties Narration.

                  <p>In the cloſe of that Treaties Narration, it was ſhewed that his Lordſhip (at his taking leave of the King of <hi>Poland</hi> in his Camp) had obſerved ſome alteration in the countenance of that King, and thoſe about him; but that, knowing no cauſe to have been given by himſelf, he was the leſſe troubled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, thinking it onely to be ſome little Cloud which would ſoon vaniſh: yet ſtaying that night in the Camp, he (for the more ſpeedy removing therof) ſent the next morning to the Lord <hi>Caſinowskie,</hi> great Chamberlaine of <hi>Poland,</hi> to deſire a private Audience of the King, which was promiſed, and that notice ſhould be given him of the time, but performance did not enſue; wherupon having ſeen the Army drawn into Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia, he retired to <hi>Marienburg.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour, who had received (as hath beene <note place="margin">

Our Ambaſſadour underſtanding it, was not a little moved at the indignity offered to his Maſter therby, but rather to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <note place="margin">His Lordſhip offended.</note> as being done contrary to their publike Stipulation, and therupon viſiting the <hi>Suethiſh</hi> Commiſſioners, he deſired they would not admit of the like, which they aſſured him of, as having already diſpatched their Inſtrument of the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles into <hi>Suethland</hi> by an Expreſſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Zavatzkie</hi> heard him with patience, and with fair words en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to pacifie and to confirm in his Lordſhip a belief of the King his Maſters ſincere and reall affection towards his Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> with his conſtant perſevering in his former intentions, of which the ſaid Lord had from the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> been the firſt Intimator and Propounder, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him withall, that undoubtedly there behoved to be ſome miſtake in the report he had received, for otherwiſe, he ſaid, it could not be but that himſelf being uſually ſo neer the King, and of his Secretaries, ſhould have known ſomewhat therof, deſiring withall, that his Lordſhip would not precipitate any advertiſement unto the King his Maſter, and aſſured him that he would forthwith poſt unto their Court, where having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <note place="margin">By him ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with promiſe of ſatisfaction not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> the matter fully, he would by Letters, or a ſpeedy perſonal return, faithfully certifie his Lordſhip of the truth, either there or at <hi>Dantzig</hi> within few daies.</p>
                  <p>Towards that Citie his Lordſhip retired ſoone after, daily expecting the effects of the promiſes forementioned, but in vaine: Nevertheleſſe upon <hi>Zavatzkie's</hi> perſwaſions, and his owne unwillingneſſe to render ill-offices by the returne of <note place="margin">He returned to <hi>Dantzig.</hi>

faithfull advice of ſome neere about him; who, as much as with fitting reſpect they might, urged a preſent diſpatch of that relation into <hi>England,</hi> as a thing moſt neceſſary, not onely for ſatisfaction to the State and the great Perſons therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, but likewiſe for his owne diſcharge; Inſtancing alſo the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, who would not ſtirr from <hi>Stumbſdorff</hi> (the Village where the Treaty had been concluded) untill he had by an expreſſe into <hi>France,</hi> ſent a Narrative of that whole affaire; But to all this he ſent a deafe Eare.

                  <p>Yet nothing leſſe then was promiſed, was by the <hi>Polander</hi> intended; in ſtead whereof (advantage of his Credulity being taken) a ſtrong complaint againſt his Lordſhip was ſent into <hi>England;</hi> which, for the time, gave an evill relliſh of him to <note place="margin">Receives notice by letter of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> diſtaſt.</note> his Maſter: The Firſt notice he had of their diſtaſt was by a letter from the Lord <hi>Andrea Rey,</hi> Starroſt of <hi>Libonza,</hi> dated the twenty fourth of <hi>September</hi> 1635. who, repeating the very words of his Lordſhips expoſtulation with <hi>Zavatzkie,</hi> cloſed them up, with this expreſſion; <hi>viz.</hi> That if any ſuch were ſpoken, he wiſhed they never had been: Whereunto his Lordſhip returned an anſwer the ſixth of <hi>October</hi> following, with ſo cleer a vindication of himſelfe, but in ſuch a ſtile as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemed his Ambaſſadoriall Office, as might have given them (in reference to him) ample ſatisfaction; yet without ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againe to repreſent his ſence of their more unfaire then expected or deſerved dealing.</p>

                  <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe ſpecious ſhewes, his Lordſhip <note place="margin">Their ſinceritie diſtruſted by his Lordſhip.</note> was ſtill doubtfull of their true meaning, and advertiſed home accordingly, yet could he not particularly conclude in whoſe breaſt the diſſimulation lay: For even they who profeſſed the ſame Religion with us, and were (at firſt) moſt earneſt in the purſuance of thoſe motions, were now become as cold as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:109514:126"/>
albeit they were intimate with that King and of his nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Counſells, ſo as it might ſeem that their Maſters intention, decreed eſpecially in matters ſo neerly concerning himſelf, ſhould have been the point of the Compaſſe by which they were to ſteer.</p>
                  <p>Yet (by the way) it may be demanded whether our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours Suſpitions were not cauſeleſſe, or whether by his jealouſies he did not injure that Prince, and ſo provoke him juſtly; wherunto is anſwered, that the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Poland Zavatzkie,</hi> when (with <hi>Gordon)</hi> he arrived in <hi>England,</hi> did not give that full and particular ſatisfaction which was expected, albeit the Profeſſions out wardly and in generall were as high as ever; ſo as doubtfull conjectures began upon his arrivall, to be made at <hi>Englands</hi> Court; and his diſmiſſion was viſibly <note place="margin">Suſpected in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </note> more cold then his reception had been: And conſidering it was with him that his Lordſhip made the diſrelliſhing fore-mentioned expoſtulation, it may be (and was then by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry) conceived, that the maine part of his Errand was to have boulſtered out the former complaint, if he had not been prevented by his Lordſhips death.</p>
                  <p>The ſame appeared more fully afterwards, when it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known that the King of <hi>Poland</hi> had proceeded even to <note place="margin">Made viſible ſoone after, and</note> conſummation of things directly contrary to his former propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, without previous advertiſement of his reaſons for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining them: in excuſe wherof <hi>(Poſt factum)</hi> he ſent the fore-named Lord <hi>Andrea Rey, Starroſta de Libonza,</hi> as Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to the late King, who underſtanding (before his arrival) <note place="margin">

                  <p>It was further ſhewed, that it had been ſome ſadneſſe to our late Lord, when upon his departure from <hi>Dantzig,</hi> he underſtood that he could not be permitted to make a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into <hi>Suethland,</hi> as having no deſire more earneſt nor more prevalent with him, then, by word of mouth, to have aſſured her Majeſty of <hi>Suethen,</hi> that he ſtill retained the ſame zealous intentions for her Service, which he had formerly for Sundry yeares, with the hazard of his life and the loſſe of ſome bloud, teſtifyed to her late Royall Father; and that he had not ſo layd aſide his Armes, but that he would alwayes have been willing, and had hope to reſume them one day by her Majeſties command, and to employ them under her Standard: That not onely thoſe Gentlemen preſent of his kindred, but all others likewiſe who knew ought of him, and particularly we his Servants, as having had the honour to be neere unto

                  <p>This Office of no more then fitting civility was well accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Lord Chancellour <hi>Oxenſtierne,</hi> who returned a faire commemoration of the great abilities and endowments of the deceaſed Ambaſſadour; of his Courage, Integrity, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet deportment whileſt he lived in the Service of their late King, and of his ſincere and equitable carriage in the late weighty affaire: He condoled his ſo ſoon death, whoſe life <note place="margin">His death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doled by the Chancellour.</note> (he ſaid) might have been of good uſe to the world; and that as they had received formerly proof of his affection toward their Crown and State, ſo they ſhould no way have doubted its continuance if his life had been longer continued: But that ſince it had ſeemed good to the ſupream Moderator of al things to tranſlate him from this Vale of miſery, to thoſe Manſions into which troubles nor ſorrow have no admittance: all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (how neerly ſoever concerned in him) ought to make an entire ſubmiſſion of their Wills to that All-wiſe Providence, upon which he exhorted us to rely for comfort in our ſo great loſſe. That he honoured his Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and ſhould be glad if what he had done might find acceptance with him, and that he would proſecute the Friends of the deceaſed (whom he had loved whileſt living) with all reciprocall friendly Offices, and concluded with wiſhing to us an unmole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted proceeding on our journey.</p>

                  <p>By him it was alſo thought convenient to acquaint the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of that City therwith, to prevent any miſtake or oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">The Senate advertiſed and Scruple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the entrie.</note> of the entry of thoſe armed Horſe, as vve intended: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice therof being given, a ſcruple vvas made (as he had fore-ſeen) of admitting the two Troops that conveyed the Body, they affirming, that it vvas a thing never uſed, and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent vvith their Cities Cuſtomes, that any extraneous Forces ſhould enter Armed vvithin their Gates, and that it might prove of dangerous conſequence: Reply vvas made, that ſuch a handfull, in ſo populous and vvell guarded a City, could neither breed danger nor ſuſpition of any: That vvhat vvas deſired vvas onely in honour to the memory of the deceaſed, and to render the Solemnity more celebrious in a remote Country, vvhere confluence of friends could not be made, as alſo for the more ſatisfaction to thoſe Troops that had atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Corps ſo far, vvho might think themſelves ſlighted, if not permitted to accompany the ſame unto the Repoſitory prepared.</p>
                  <p>It was urged on the other ſide, that whatſoever came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of their juriſdiction needed no other guarde, but was by them (in point of honour) to be protected, neither could they admit of ſuch a Preſident: Thereunto was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>replyed, that their Entrie might be permitted under the name

of his Meniall attendants (for the more fullneſſe of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie) which could be no way derogatorie to their Citie, wherein (for ought yet knowne to us) the laſt obſequies might be performed: That otherwiſe we would divert to <hi>Attenaw,</hi> a village thereby neer the Sea, but without their <note place="margin">Yet conſented unto as deſired.</note> precinct, and there retaine the ſame guard: The Senate at laſt conſented to what was deſired, conditionally that the Corps being once lodged, the two Troops ſhould immdiately retire without the Gates, which alſo was our deſire.</p>

About two dayes after, for avoyding of trouble to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as alſo to the houſe, by the curioſity of people who hourely flocked to ſee the viſage of the deceaſed, there being in the Coffin a Caſement, through which his face might be diſcerned, with part of his bodie, lying in a cloſe Gowne of black damaske, on his head a cap of the ſame over one of plaine linnen, ſilke ſtockings, plaine band and cuffes with white gloves: His Heart and Tongue (well preſerved) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a damaske cover, lying under his head, which reſted on a damaske covered pillow; the bodie was removed into a cloſe Chappell of the great Church in that Citie, where it remained <note place="margin">The Corps diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of by Order.</note> untill Orders came from <hi>England,</hi> whereupon it was imbarked for <hi>Scotland,</hi> attended by his Steward the forenamed Maſter <hi>Ewin,</hi> with one page and a Footeman all of that Nation.</p>

                  <p>A Period ſhould here be put to this relation, but that it is thought not unmeet to touch (once more) the accident mentioned to have happened in <hi>Daman</hi> the night before his <note place="margin">The portent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into and aſserted.</note> Lordſhips arrivall there, which was related unto him by the Governour at Table, and albeit, that as then no farther notice was taken therof, yet his death enſuing ſo unexpectedly and ſuddenly, gave occaſion of more ſerious animadvertion therin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to afterwards; and upon diligent enquiry, the truth of the thing was aſſerted, not by the Garriſon Officers, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour onely, but by the Inhabitants alſo: In confirmation wherof, the Relator received, from the Magiſtrates and Senate of <hi>Damin,</hi> an atteſtation in writing under the Seal of that Town, the Tenour wherof was in Engliſh as followeth.</p>

                  <p>It is now time to dravv tovvard a concluſion, this diſcourſe having enlarged it ſelfe further than vvas at firſt intended, but could hardly have been more reſtrained amongſt ſo many changes and relative circumſtances as may be obſerved throughout the Triple Narrative.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt, vve ſee <hi>Poland,</hi> from a Dukedome or Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note place="margin">Obſervations upon the whole</note> erected into a Kingdome, but ſoon after reverting unto the former Ducall Government, and vveary thereof, remounts unto a continued Elective Regality, neither is at preſent of ſmall conſideration, as being the Bulwark of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> on that ſide, againſt the incroaching <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Tartar. Suethland</hi> alſo (for avoiding the many miſcheifs and inconveniencies they had ſuſtained, by parties vvithin themſelves, differing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Election of their Princes) changed into a Hereditary Kingdome in the time of <hi>Magnus Smeeke;</hi> and the right Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell failing, remoter ſtreames are either taken or violently thruſt in, and upon prejudices flowing thence, are again as faſt ſluiced out. By publike and generall conſent and act of that State, a more direct Succeſſion, in the perſon and Male Iſſue of <hi>Guſtavus Erickson,</hi> the Vindicator of their liberties from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> bondage, is then entred into; yet that not of long perfect continuance in a deſcent immediatly conſecutive of his three Sons (all there Crowned) <hi>Ericke</hi> the eldeſt ſucceeds, but

                  <p>And here the profoundeſt Contemplatiſt may find a large field for his thoughts to expatiate in, to conſider and admire the inſtability of humane greatneſſe; the ſandy bottom of the ſolideſt ſeeming Acts of the moſt flouriſhing States: the facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of blaſting the wiſeſt and beſt conſentred counſels of the Sons of men, and overturning the Rock-like appearances of their ſtrongeſt cemented Conſtitutions, by that Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ever-Adorable Power, through whoſe Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, things conducing to the un-erring ends by him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained in the Decrees of his Eternall Providence, are brought to paſſe here below, for the pulling down and ſetting up of Princes: Sundry examples wherof are ſet before our eyes even of late years, and particularly in this royal <hi>Guſtavian</hi> Line.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> his eldeſt Son (albeit Crowned in <hi>Suethland, An.</hi> 1593.) enjoyes it not, but with his Seed is for ever expelled from that Kingdomes Regall Chaire by Parliamentary Act, in the year 1600. and that expulſion confirmed, <hi>An.</hi> 1504. by a like Act and a renewed reformed Hereditary Union, whereby his Seat and Dignity is conferred upon the Perſon and Heires of <hi>Charles,</hi> Duke of <hi>Sudermannia, Nericia,</hi> and <hi>Wermelandia,</hi> who was Crowned, <hi>An.</hi> 1607. being the youngeſt Son of <hi>Guſtavus Erickſon,</hi> and younger Brother to <hi>John</hi> fore-named: But here it may be demanded, albeit <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> had forfeited the Crown of <hi>Suethland</hi> both for himſelfe and his Poſterity, yet what offence had the Prince his Brother <hi>John</hi> (the younger Son of King <hi>John</hi> aforeſaid) committed, to be pretermitted in that Elective Hereditary Succeſſion (ſeeing themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be the neereſt; as he was, by how much a Son is neerer then a Brother, or a Brother then an Uncle) and to be induced to reſt ſo contented with the Dukedome of <hi>Oſtrogothia,</hi> as to reſigne for ever his whole right unto that Crown, unleſſe the ſame ſhould chance to drop upon the head of ſome one of his Poſterity, by the deceaſe of the totall lawfull Male Iſſue of the new King <hi>Charles</hi> (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fore-cited Entail, 1604.) whoſe ſecond Daughter the Princeſſe <hi>Mary Elizabeth,</hi> he married, <hi>An.</hi> 1612.

at any hand to relinquiſh: Yet, upon that Kings death, and ſolicitation by the two younger Princes, <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> and <hi>Charles Ferdinand</hi> his Brothers, made unto her, She out of a magnanimous mind (toward Princes of the ſame blood) did recommend unto the States of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Great Dukedome of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> that regard might be had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in their Election of a new King, but preſſed more particularly the promotion of <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> as being the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who accordingly was Crowned; yet did he not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards render (as the <hi>Suethes</hi> aſſert) the hoped for returne of thoſe faire Offices; for further ſatisfaction wherein, the Reader is referred to the <hi>Manifeſto</hi> by them lately publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>But this Princeſſe, borne, bred, and habituated to raigne, hath in one late action outſtript all her former; by reſigning, uncompelled that the World hath heard of, that Crown and Kingdome unto her Kinſman, the preſent King: A conceſſion to be admired, and which after Ages will (perhaps) account rather fictitious than true: Examples of ſuch great voluntary renounciations ſeldome hapning amongſt men: nor doe we reade of more than two; <hi>Diocleſian</hi> a Heathen diveſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of the Imperiall Wreath: <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth likewiſe, after a forty years Regall, and thirty ſix years Imperiall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, in the fifty and ſixth of his age, ſurrendred his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to his Son <hi>Phillip,</hi> and the Empire to his Brother <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand:</hi> But from the weaker Sex, which by how much it is ſo, is the more avidouſly tenacious of Power, by what meanes ſoever acquired, as Hiſtories Divine and humane doe teſtifie, none to be excepted, nor any equall Preſident to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                  <p>Neither had this Lady thoſe motives which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have induced that great Emperor laſt named, to quit his ſeverall Soveraigneties, thereby to live eternally in the memories of men; As the neerneſſe of Relations mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his advance into years, under the burthen of ſuch occaſions as could not but render him ſenſible of having received (as he had cauſed unto others) infinite toiles and troubles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undergone nine Voyages into <hi>Germany,</hi> ſix into <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſeven into <hi>Italy,</hi> foure into <hi>France,</hi> ten into the Low Countreys, two into <hi>England,</hi> two into <hi>Affrica,</hi> beſides eleven times tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing the maine Ocean. Certainely, He having been moſtly Succeſsful in continued Wars, might be apprehenſive of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of fortune, and therfore not unwilling to prevent it, as he did, by a Monaſticall Retirement.</p>
                  <p>But this Princeſſe never expoſed to perſonall hazards, hath denuded her ſelfe of a Royalty, and therwith inveſted her neereſt Kinſman, yet more remote then either a Son or a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

Much leſſe doth Hiſtory record any Princeſſe, who in the prime of her years hath freely relinquiſhed a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, hereditary devolved Poſſeſſion of a Diadem, this Lady excepted, who by this Conqueſt over her ſelf, hath atchieved a greater then by all her Commanders ſhe ever could, which happily may incite ſome accurate Pen to afford the World an <hi>Elogium</hi> befitting the Magnanimity of that Act in one of the fairer Sex; then which former Ages have not preduced a more lofty Subject wheron to ground the Gallantry of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>That Queen hath (all along) demonſtrated a good incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to preſerve a faire correſpondency with <hi>England,</hi> even in the heat and height of its late troubles; In <hi>An.</hi> 1644. Shee ſent Mr <hi>Hugh Mowet</hi> her Agent to the Parliament then ſitting, in which publike Miniſtry he was employed about two yeares: Neither did he make (in all that time) the leaſt addreſſe or application elſewhere: Severall ſubſequent entercourſes have (ſince) continued the Amity between this and that Nation: Neither have her reſpects, as well to our preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as to the Perſon of his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> the LORD PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TECTOR, been obſcurely teſtified by her ſolemne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and honourable Entertainment of the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Lord <hi>Whitlock,</hi> late Ambaſſadour Extraordinary in <hi>Suethland,</hi> and by her faire compliance with what deſired for the good of both Nations, which having concluded, and as witneſſing to the World that She would Dignifie that Act by rendring it the laſt of her Raigne, ſhe ſoon after reſigned her Kingdome, Crown, and Scepter, unto</p>

His early great Commencements, as well before as ſince his <note place="margin">This Act hath not come to my hands, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Heads therof had been particularized.</note> Exaltation to that Crown, do promiſe an equall progreſſe and the addition of <hi>Semper</hi> to his ſur-name of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> which <hi>(literis tranſpoſitis)</hi> is <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> for a perpetuating of the Glory of that <hi>Guſtavian</hi> Line, unto whoſe name and Scepter he hath ſo happily ſucceeded, as his late Armed Entry into <hi>Poland,</hi> and Succeſſe hitherto may ſeem to witneſſe. The Motives that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him therunto, the Curious may read in his Letter to the preſent Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the third, dated from <hi>Wolgast</hi> in the month of <hi>July,</hi> of the year currant, 1655.</p>
                  <p>But leaving this Digreſſion. In the Treaty of Pacification, <note place="margin">Obſervations on the Treaty.</note> continued Viciſſitudes may be ſeen; ſomtimes hopes of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, other whiles nothing but preſent rupture to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, about empty Airey Titles, or not much more: And when things ſeeme moſt deſperate, and without mediate meanes of reconcilement, the ſtiffer Partie comes fairely to hand by a gentle complyance. We may obſerve, the Mediators turne Parties for precedencie and formalities, which, in a juſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what amount they unto? thereby neceſſitating (in a manner) the Parties to become Mediators and ſo make compenſation for Offices received: In its Signature how little truſtis to be imputed to the aſſurances of great ones, doe they not meaſure obſervation of promiſes by the rule of Intereſt or ſelfe pleaſing.</p>
                  <p>In the Ambaſſadors life we may ſee one nobly deſcended, <note place="margin">On the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour.</note> ſprung from a race of Anceſtors honoured by Illuſtrious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, yet not unneceſſitated to purſue the advance of his Fortunes amidſt thoſe dangers that attend the honourable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Profeſſion; and having in ſome degree attained to the favour of his Royall Generall, falls twice under the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <note place="margin">Great begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</note> of that Greatneſſe, the frown whereof, according to the wiſeſt of men bringeth Death: And yet, the ſame Perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine buyed up by a hand equally powerfull, Aſcends to be what he expected not, an Umpire between Kings and Crowns; But what Merit can there be toward Princes? their turns once ſerved, their ends compaſſed; do they ſtick to kick up the heels of thoſe, whoſe aſſiſtance (they but a little before) <note place="margin">Have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies equall endings.</note> thought advantageous unto them? He falls at laſt under the undeſerved diſpleaſure of two mighty Monarchs, into his Grave; and, as having no more to do here below, removes to render an account of the whole Negotiation of his life above.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall We conclude upon the whole?

As to that Honourable Perſon deceaſed, who acted in that Treaty, and whom this preſent Narrative doth particularly concern, We are not without warrant to gather a Chriſtian confidence of his Reſidence in thoſe Manſions of durable Bleſſedneſſe, which admit of no more change; ſeeing he died not onely in the purſuance, but in the effecting and preſerving of Peace. For we have it aſſerted by the Divine Word, God-Man; <hi>That bleſſed are the Peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the Children of God.</hi> If ſuch be not, who can be eternally happy? <note place="margin">Happy cloſure.</note>
