         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and surely as this is a most profitable doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine

groweth in vs, when we are in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations,
to feare, that our former estate

are rebuked, for so much as he loueth them,
that hee correcteth, and scourgeth euery

spirituall aduersarie the deuill. This may
seeme very straunge that hee in whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was no corruption, (and therefore no

be tempted: but we are first to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sider that

first, that he might (euen in temptation)
wynne that, which our first parentes lost,
in whiche respect, the Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
an Antythesis betwixt <hi>Adam</hi>
               <note n="1" place="margin">Rom. 5. 14.</note> and
Christ, because the one did recouer that
whiche the other had lost, whiche is not in

that we might see and know, what
a professed enemy Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> is vnto mankind,
that durst presume to assayle (euen) the
sonne of God, when hee was in the forme
of man. Thyrdly that he might ouercome
in the fleshe, to the end that we commyng
into the like combate, and fighting against
the same aduersarie, may learne not to
quayle or languishe, but valiauntly to set
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> him, certaynly hoping that as our head
ouerthrew him in the flesh, so will he giue
power to vs (his weake members) to doe
the same. Fourthly, that we may know,
that temptations, tryals, and extremities


<pb facs="tcp:14306:14"/>
whatsoeuer, can be fall vnto man, are not
signes of Gods displeasure (as the worlde
imagineth) for somuch as the sonne of God
was partaker of them. Fiftly that in his
owne person hee might shewe the manner
how the aduersarie is to bee resisted, that
we (who are his members) and therefore
are to walke as he hath set himselfe for an
example, might learne to follow him in
the same. Sixtly that he hauyng experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>(<hi>To bee tempted</hi>) we see the partie that

set downe in generall, that hee was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(as <hi>Luke</hi> sayth) for the space of fourtie
dayes, for (although the particular, &amp; most

            <p>Before we come to the particular temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,

so farre as may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cerne our present instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.<note place="margin">The nature of the word tempted in the Hebrew and Greeke tounges.</note>
And first for the word (whiche in our

The wicked on the other side, if the Lord

the godly &amp; wicked, the godly by the sight
of Gods word &amp; power of his spirite do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him: the wicked take vp all the baytes
layd for them and obey him: and therefore
are not so properly sayd to be tryed. As for
example, when hee assayleth man to the
breach of any of the commaundementes of
God and the practising of any sinne, the
childe of God seyng that it is contrary to
Gods word, (and therfore must needes be
of the Deuil) striueth by all good meanes,
to ouercome and to stand sure to the course


<pb facs="tcp:14306:15"/>
of true godlynesse. Contrarywise the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
is caryed away with the present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of sinne, and coueteth the same with
greedynesse. By this also we haue occasion
to examine our selues in what estate we
stand. The Scriptures tell vs also, that
man doth trye: and that is two wayes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he tryeth God,<note place="margin">Man temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth God and man.</note> or he tryeth man: hee
tryeth GOD, when by continuaunce in

often: such he, they among vs, that
when they heare that God is mercyfull &amp;
ready to forgiue doe vpon the same gather
to them selues immunitie to sinne. But
the Scripture speaketh most fearefully, of
such, that<note n="2" place="margin">Rom. 3. 8.</note> their damnation is iust, that

which should lead them to repentaunce, do
heape vp vnto them selues wrath agaynst
the day of wrath, he tryeth man, when hee
doth any thing wherewith to moue his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
or to greeue him: many such there
be, who are driuen of Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> into such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie

sinne, if they thinke it will greeue
him that is wont to reproue them, cleane
forgetting that themselues, beyng the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
the vengeaunce of God shall fall
(not on the hearer, reprouing it according

of God in assayling his people: in
vexing him in his seruauntes: and seeking
to lessen his kingdome by seducing of those
whom it hath pleased God of his mercy to
make worthy that calling. He doth it also
in respect of man, whose estate he doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
for that it is better then his owne, and


<pb facs="tcp:14306:16"/>
therefore hee laboureth by all extremities
that he can deuise to vexe him in the same,
to make it lesse ioyous vnto him, and to
bring him, (if it were possible) to thincke
his condition odious in his owne eyes: hee
doth it moreouer in regard of himself, who
knowyng that hee is finally to be damned,
and that he is the kyng of hell, and Prince
of perdition, laboureth by all meanes to
bring (if it could be) the very elect into the

his kingdome: beyng desirous to haue all
others partakers with him in that endlesse
torment whereunto he is finally adiudged.
The course that he taketh in these tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is not forthwith to set before the
eyes of the godly, the thing that he aymeth
at, (for hee knoweth that in soule they are
brought to abhorre it) but first he will sley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suggest into their myndes, the cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and motions of his intent, whiche if
they rest vpon, and doe not forthwith beate
them backe, he will goe a step further, to
witt, to bring them to consent thereunto:
which once being gotten, there remayneth
nothing (for the partie is wonne vnto him)
but to put y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same in execution, the meanes

and there to make intercession for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
vnto god. Which no man will say, that we
must follow. The second sort are his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
whiche hee wrought in the world, as
turnyng water into wine, walking vppon

For the sonne of God is the heyre of all, to

vs an example in his owne person: A

I am not so simple, but I know, what is

no conscience of any sinne: cares not for the

mocketh and molesteth them that do &amp; all
this while hee persuadeth himselfe that the
deuill can neuer come neare him: when


<pb facs="tcp:14306:32"/>
(poore soule) he is euen running headlong

Manna from heauen: to shew that it is not
bread onely that man liueth by: but by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
word of God: that is euery decree and
determination, that God in his wisedome
seeth meete to put in execution, for so much

as hee can both make<note n="1" place="margin">Luke. 12. 15:</note> aboundaunce, of

that for as much as a man may bee

attempt any more to assayle him, for

see hereafter. The first thing that offereth
it selfe to our consideration is the tyme
when this second temptation was, namely
forthwith vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the end of the other. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

               </gap>ne
to the other. But we are to note


<pb facs="tcp:14306:35"/>
(for the solution of the doubt) that it is not
the purpose of the Euangelistes to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
in the obseruyng of y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> tymes, but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to set downe y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> thing, and therfore did
euery one of them (as we see if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ferre
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> together) set downe the things as they
came conueniently to hand. Now for so
much as this second te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ptation is in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cleane contrary vnto the former, &amp; we
know (by the worde of God and our owne
experience) that it is the course of Sathan,
so to assayle: it may appeare that <hi>Mathew</hi>
hath rather set them downe accordyng to
the tyme wherein they were done, then
<hi>Luke.</hi> The thyng then that we are first to
insiste vppon in this place, is, the tyme of
this temptation (that is) when the first tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
was ended, then began the second to
be taken in hand. Whereby we are first to
learne this lesson, that when one storme or
trouble is past,<note place="margin">VVe may not after one victorie agaynst Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than looke for continu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> and the grief of one afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ended, we must not then looke to rest
vnmolested: which is worthy to be noted,
for we see that fleshe and bloud naturally,
persuadeth it selfe, that (one broyle beyng
once ouercome) we shalbe in quietnesse and
securitie afterwarde: but we may not bee


<pb facs="tcp:14306:36"/>
lulled in the cradle of securitie in such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but learne, that for so much as our life
<note n="1" place="margin">Iob. 7. 1.</note> is a continuall warrefare: and man is<note n="2" place="margin">5. 7.</note>
borne to trauaile as the birde to flye: and
Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> is a sworne enemy to our peace and
well fare: that we assure our selues so long
as we tarie in this body<note n="3" place="margin">4. 19.</note> of clay, we shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
sure that the end of one trouble must be
the begynning of an other,<note place="margin">It is needful for vs in the end of one trouble, to looke for a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother.</note> and surely the
due consideration of this bringeth greate
case vnto him that weyeth it a right. For
what is the cause that wee see so many in
triall and tribulation, either impatient, or
counting it vntollerable, vtterly to relent
but onely this, that they haue promised vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them selues peace and safetie, dreame
of an heauen vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> earth, and hoping to liue
as they would wish? who beyng disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of their purpose, and falling into such
a sodden sorrow (which they neuer thought
vppon) doe most lamentably increase vnto
themselues their owne woe. If then we
will profite aright by this doctrine, wee
must rather looke for the worse, then the
best, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> shall no estate too much moue
vs, but in euery condition (whether of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie
or aduersitie) we shall set our hand


<pb facs="tcp:14306:36"/>
               <note n="1" place="margin">Luk 9. 62</note> to the plough, not lookyng backe, and so
shalbe founde meete for the kyngdome of

of exceeding co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fort, for though trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
come, one in the necke of an other, yet
is not our whole life one onely trouble,
without intermission. Wherein appeareth
the exceedyng loue of our good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
God, who knowing our weakenesse, &amp;
pitieng our estate, hath in his vnspeakable
wisedome, so tempered the afflictions of
his seruauntes, that yet in the midst of the
same, he geueth exceedyng comfort.<note place="margin">Gods great loue appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the maner of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> For he
knoweth well inough, that if our warrefar
should be one, &amp; euer in like maner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Therfore it hath pleased his gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
to make them many and diuers, and
to make them short, that we might haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of his presence, in our deliuerau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/>(<hi>He tooke him vp. &amp;c.</hi>) Now it remaineth
that we consider the place where this was
done, to wit the holy Citie (meaning Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>)
so called (not in respect that it was
a place of it selfe more holy then other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(nay) it was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> a place of greatest cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption)
but for that it had the sacrifices, &amp;
publicke seruice of God in it, and for that
there was wont to be great holynesse, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
the <hi>Israelites</hi> truely feared God. We must
not take this place as though hee caried
him thether in deede, but (as I said before)
in motion, labouring to suggeste such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s
into his mynde: now in that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ghost meaning Ierusalem, calleth it the
holy Citie, he doth (no doubt) geue vs there
by to vnderstand, what was the subtiltie of
Sathan herein, to weete, to assayle him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
this temptation, in such a place, as might
seeme to bee most voyde of Sathans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
thereby labouring the more cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to deceiue: Wherein we may learne a
lesson most needefull to be obserued, to wit
that Sathan (such is his subtiltie) when he
goeth about to seduce any (that maketh a


<pb facs="tcp:14306:37"/>
conscience of sinne,<note place="margin">Sathan tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth not the godly vnder the name of sinne but of godlynes.</note> &amp; knoweth in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
how GOD is to be serued and hath a
care to put the same in practise) hee will
not attempt his purpose, in the name of sin,
but sleely vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coulour of a good thing:
for we see here that he bringeth Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
vnto Jerusalem, where he might seeme
to be most voyde of any molestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, &amp; there
goeth about to moleste him, for (in deede)
he wilbe sure to be in those<note n="1" place="margin">Iob. 1. 6. Math. 13. 19.</note> places, and
prying into those exercises, that of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
be most excellent. As for example, if
he can not persuade with thee, to leaue of,
or neuer enterprise the hearing of the word
of God (because thou knowest it must bee
heard) if hee can neither make thy profite
keepe thee at home, nor thy pleasures cause
thee to be imployed els where:<note place="margin">VVhat course he (commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ly) taketh in the matter of hearing the worde.</note> yet will he
seeke to deceaue thee when thou commest
there: for either hee will labour to put into
thy mynde, the consideration of such a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
that thou hast at home, or such a thyng
that thou hast left vndone: or to make thee
heauie and fall on sleepe: or els if hee can
not preuayle that way,<note place="margin">Note this well.</note> hee will put other
motions into thy minde (which of themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
are very good and godly) to this ende


<pb facs="tcp:14306:38"/>
that he may steale thy hart from attending
vnto the doctrine in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d. And this is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous
subtiltie: for who would thinke
that it were Sathan that putteth good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations
into a mans mynde. But it is
most certaine, that if he can preuayle no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

in an other matter, lesse needefull for thee
at that insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, to the end that he may make
thee sinne agaynst GOD, in not listening
vnto him when he speaketh vnto thee: and
that he may depriue thee of the benefite of
that doctrine then deliuered. I speake not
all this while of those, whose myndes hee
doth carie away, by the wandring of the
eye, by beholdyng this man and that man:
yea &amp; often the disquietnesse of some, where
at thou art greatly greeued, doth hee also
vse as a meane to drawe thy hart from the
thyng in hand.<note place="margin">VVhat hee doth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraude thee of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of praier.</note> The same course he taketh
(euen) in the holy action of prayer, howe
hard a thyng is it, for a man to pray zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously,
feelingly, and attentiuely? either he
will make thee heauy, and therfore he will
say thou art vnfit to prayer, &amp; so let it passe
for that tyme: or thou feelest not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse

<pb facs="tcp:14306:38"/>
thou hast or which thou shouldest, &amp;

Or if by neither of these meanes hee can
dissuade thee from that holy exercise, yet
will he come stealing on thee to take away
thy hart from that which thou speakest, &amp;
so make it vnprofitable vnto thee. So that
the true child of God doth know (for to the
rest these thinges are parables) how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culte
and hard a thing it is to offer vnto
the Lord this sacrifice, in such maner, that
it may be a sweete smelling sauour in his

estate, whereunto (euen in the eyes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>)
Sathan hath brought the world, it maketh
me quayle for feare,<note place="margin">The great abuse of prayer in these daies.</note> and maruaile how the
Lord in his iustice can abide such propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his name, and abusing of his most
holy word, as is euery where to be founde.
For though we be gone from the Papistes

on the pinacle of the temple, in a most
highe and eminent place aboue the rest of
the whole Citie, where Sathan thought
more commodiouslie to assayle him, and to

because he knoweth that, as the Cedar tree
is not cut downe, but in the fall thereof, all
the shrubes, and inferiour trees are crushed

of Sathan, wherein we may note di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
doctrines for our instruction. First


<pb facs="tcp:14306:41"/>
how that the enemy (repeatyng agayne the

occasion to set vpon the sonne of GOD a

of this te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ptation an other of Sathans iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glinges
most needefull to bee obserued: to
wit, how he assayleth not Christ Jesus w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

for (if we shall view the thing in his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars)

leadyng to finall destruction: now doth he


<pb facs="tcp:14306:42"/>
labour to bring men vnto Atheisme, and to
be iust of no Religion at all. Wherewith
how greatly he preuaileth (to the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor
of God, &amp; grief of all the godly) it is
most manifest: for to put on the name of
Religion is present with euery man, and
to put of the title of Poperie (because the
law doth so) but to come to the point (which
in deede is the marke of a true Christian)
so to<note n="1" place="margin">Psal. 1. 1. 2.</note> refuse the counsell of the vngodly:
so to shunne the waye of sinners: and so to
abhorre the seate of the scornefull: as with
all (for so the originall text is to be expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

of offending God and his Church: the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we be from Poperie, and therfore the


<pb facs="tcp:14306:42"/>
safer, as in this one example shall appeare:
when we doe, by the word of GOD iustly
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>demne, the tyranny and butchery of that
Antechrist in captiuyng the consciences of
men, vnder his slauish subiection, and then
doe heare that the word of God hath pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
an order in his Church to bridle the
varulinesse, &amp; amend the abuses that rest in
euery one, who is called a brother: if once
we desire to haue the same executed, that
offences may be taken away (oh say they) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
were euen to become slaues vnto Poperie
agayne: and therfore that they neuer come
neare that, they wilbe sure to geue them
selues to all libertie and loosenesse: in the
meane while, they forget that Sathan
laboured to practise so with our Sauiour
Christ Iesus, to driue him too farre into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
contrary extremitie. If he can not preuaile
with man to make him couetously minded,
to be alwayes pludding vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> worldly cares,
that all good things may be choked in him
(whereunto almost) euery man yeldeth: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
will he at him with the contrary, to driue
him to carelessenesse, in respect of those
thinges which he is bounde to looke vnto.
In a word it is Sathans continuall prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,


<pb facs="tcp:14306:43"/>
neuer to let man rest in that golden
meane which Gods word prescribeth, but
euer to intise him to the one extremitie, or
the other: and therfore we haue great need
to pray vnto the Lord, to make vs wise har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that we may see the course commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and continually proceede in it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sathan, would haue him throw
himselfe downe headlong, which is (as you
haue heard) contrary vnto the other: it is to
the ende that hee may make him vaynelie
presumptuous, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> his owne power, which
is a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ptation greatly infecting the world,
for notwithstandyng that we be in our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
most foolish, ignoraunt, and simple, yet
Sathan will steale all the sight of that out
of mans mynde, and persuade him of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
very highly. Whereupon it commeth
that we see the whole worlde so caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in pride and presumption, that euery
man swelleth in his own conceite, seeking
to disgrace all other men in respect of him
selfe, and liketh of nothing bee it neuer so
good, holy<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> or wisely done or sayd, but that
which is forged in his owne imagination:
but wee must learne the lesson of the holy
Ghost set downe by the Apostle <hi>Paule,</hi> in


<pb facs="tcp:14306:43"/>
               <note n="1" place="margin">Rom. 12. 10.</note> geuing honor to preferre one &amp; an other,
and not our selues, in our owne blind per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion:
Sathan laboureth not onely in
this, to make Christ Jesus thinke too wel
of himselfe, but also vppon the same to vse
vnlawfull meanes, to make it knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
others, which is a brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ch (if you marke
it wel) secret poyson, wherewith he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
venometh mankynde. For when once he
can bring man to thinke better of himselfe
then others doe, or (in deede) is cause why
he or they should: then will he ticle him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
vayne glory,<note place="margin">The nature of vayne glory.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is with an inordinate desire

shalbe vnatchiued (such is his thirst after

knowne how noble, how worshipfull, how

man admireth their great estate thereby,
when (poore soules) they take the readyest
way, to be mocked and tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ted of euery one
that seeth them: esteemyng them rather of
foolish, vayne, and wanton, then wise, sober,
or honest behauiour. This kinde of decette
is yet further to be ripped vp, for it is an
infection that stealeth euen vpon him that
is (otherwise) watchfull: for it is a maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
hard thyng (such is our corruption) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
for the dearest children of God, to doe
any thyng that is good, or be in any good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
or condition, but as Sathan would
haue had Christ to haue misdemeaned him
selfe because hee was the sonne of God: so
doth he exceedyngly labour, to make their


<pb facs="tcp:14306:44"/>
affections corrupt in the same manner. In
respect whereof, I pray God that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
let passe from our remembraunce the
saying of that singular vessell of God S.
<hi>Paule,</hi> that sayth hee had the<note n="1" place="margin">2. Cor. 12 7.</note> messenger
of Sathan to buffet him (a pricke in his
flesh) least he should be exalted aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
through the aboundaunce of reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For of all sinnes,<note place="margin">Man hardly doth any good thyng but hee is proud of it.</note> I am persuaded that
the best and godliest ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> most hardly auoyde
this, to doe any thing that is good, &amp; not be
proude of it: but let vs pray vnto God, for
his grace, that our affections may be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that we neuer ascribe any thyng
to our selues, that is his: and then shall we
neuer bee proude of that which is not our
owne. Marke yet an other pointe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
doinges<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> he carieth him vnto an high
place, aboue the rest of the buildyng, but it
is to the end, that he may throw him down
the lower, and with the greater fall: for he
meaneth neuer any thyng lesse then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
any man, but his purpose is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to seeke by all meanes his destruction:
and yet will he set a goodly shewe vpon the
matter, as though he laboured for his well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
to the ende he may the more easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue:


<pb facs="tcp:14306:45"/>
whereby we may see, that as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
is contrary vnto God: so is his doyng
most vnlike y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> Lordes. For the Lord while

him, cast him downe, and make him
seeme base in his owne eyes, that hee may
aduaunce him, lift him vp and adorne him
with glory, and Sathan doth here cleane
contrary to wit, exalteth highly, to the end
he may throw downe the lower, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are to take heede of those thynges
in this world, that either offer vnto vs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

despise the snubes and checkes that the

much as (howsoeuer in present the former
may be more delightfull yet) the latter in
the ende (to him that hath the right vse of
it) is farre more profitable. Lastly (to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

ordained, For he telleth Princes, &amp; great
personages, that for so much as they bee in
so great and excellent estate all thyngs are
lawfull for them: their will may bee their
direction, and who may controll them?
whereby they promise vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>selues great
freedome to sinne: for that they are not to
be censured by man (the meaner man also
whom it pleaseth GOD to aduaunce, vnto
dignitie, and great estate in the worlde,
whereas he should reason thus: God hath in
his great mercy dealt thus graciously with
me, to preferre me, before many of myne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quales
and betters (no doubt) it is to this
end, that I should in more notable manner
aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce his glory, and in greater measure
bee a staffe vnto those that feare the Lord,
and a shield to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d them agaynst the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
Sathan teacheth him to reason cleane
contrary: as thus. Now I am adaunced,


<pb facs="tcp:14306:46"/>
now am I inriched, now am I esteemed, I
haue all thynges that I can desire,<note place="margin">How the wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse their high calling.</note> what
should now let me, why I may not geue
my selfe vnto my pleasures, to feede my

fault with it? I would to God that we had
not too manifest experience, of such reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges:
for where as great personages,
should bee glorious in great and raxe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
for others to immitate, it falleth out
(ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tymes) that they be patternes of most
monstrous sins, vnto those that will learne
to follow them. Sathan findeth such fruite
towards the building vp of his kingdome,
by this course, that hee infecteth all sortes
of people by the same, so that not so much
as the simple countreyman (if that hee can
any way persuade himselfe, that superiour
persons haue any good likyng of him) but
will attempt whatsoeuer, shall any way
serue his owne turne: alwayes thinkyng
thus with himselfe: if I be crossed in it, I
haue a frend,<note place="margin">The cause of all misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menoure in the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> weale.</note> a great man that will stand

he can make, either in Court or in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

And thus can Sathan cunningly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
the world. But (if it pleased God to
put it in the harts of superiours on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> all

for marke, his intent is (as we haue heard)
to persuade Christ Jesus to sinne, and yet
for the proofe of the same, hee will needes
alledge the Scripture in which maner (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

a double subtiltie, first he seyng him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

that hee may seeme to haue as much force

that he may the more easilie deceaue: and

those whom they know in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
to be the notable instrumentes of

for Sathans sleight in the alledging of the

it. (<hi>He shall geue his Angels charge ouer thee
&amp;c.</hi>) If you looke vpon the wordes of the
texte alledged, and conferre them with the
<note n="4" place="margin">Psal. 9. 11.</note> Psalme from whence he had them, you
shall see a notable peece of cunnyng. For
where as it is sayd here, that GOD will

geue his Angels charge ouer (those that
dwell vnder the shadow of the almightie)
to guide them in their wayes: hee leaueth
out this last word (their wayes) whiche (in
deede) is the very thyng that would haue
made him ouerthrow himselfe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he passeth it ouer. For the meanyng of
the promise is, that God will protect them
that walke in his wayes which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
vnto them. Now there is none so
ignoraunt, but knoweth, that when a man
is vpon the toppe of a pinacle, his wayes to
come down, is not to throw himselfe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
but, to come downe by y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> stayres, that
be made for that purpose. UUhich Sathan
knowyng well inough, doth leaue it out,
that his dealyngs may not be discryed: this
lesson doth hee teach many a one to put in
practise, as for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ple, when he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
a man to bee a Papist. He will tell
him that none can be saued, but whom the

Behold yet an other tricke of this enemy:
he would cary Christ Jesus into that safe

not to the end, that he may be safe, in deed,
but that he might make him abuse y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> same
to his owne ouerthrow. If you looke into

this lesson is greatly learned,<note place="margin">How Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> teacheth man to sin vnder cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the scriptures.</note> and of them

the consideration of Gods eternall

the foundation of the world was layd,
not to this ende that hee would haue them

haue the right vse of it, for the aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods glory, in their carefull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
vnto his lawes, and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes:
but rather, that he may make them
altogether carelesse of any thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
God, or godlines: and so satisfie the
lustes of their owne flesh with greedynesse
in the whole course of their life. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

decree is vnchaungeable, if I be elected I
cannot perish whatsoeuer I do, and if I be

I heare Sermons? pray? liue godly? or doe
any good thing els? Whereas the Lord in
his word teacheth a cleane contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion:
the decree of God being vnchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable,
is yet secret, and knowne by none
other meanes, but onely the fruites of it:
whiche is the holy ghost assuring the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,

me, as to elect me, and ordaine me to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

deceaueth the world in this pointe, so doth
he in many other: as the free iustification

the aunswere of our Sauiour Christ, vnto
the former assault,<note place="margin">The answer of Christ vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Sathan.</note> which (being in wordes
very brief) containeth, in effect thus much.
Thou goest about to persuade me to doe
that which is not lawfull: &amp; for thy purpose
thou seemest to alledge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Scripture. But
know, thou this, that the place of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Psalme
(if it were true as thou alledgest it) should
be contrary to an other text, where it is set
downe, as a generall decree, of all men to
bee followed for euer, that man must not
tempt God by doyng those thyngs that are
not warranted. In which aunswere (before
we come to consider the wordes of the law
alledged by Christ) we haue diuers lessons
to be learned for our instruction. First in
that hee (notwithstandyng that Sathan
had presumed to vse the sworde of Gods
word agaynst him) flyeth not to any other
weapon (as accompting that either abused
by the enemy, or vnable any way to serue
his turne) we learne that although the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
of the truth, do abuse the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and peruert them to their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
and though wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, will (for
the defence of sinne) and in mockyng ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)


<pb facs="tcp:14306:51"/>
take y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> word of God in their mouthes,<note place="margin">The wicked abusing the word of God, make it not the worse for the vse of the godly.</note>
yet is this no cause either to make vs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
in searching y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> foode of our soules out
of the same: or to make it lesse of force to
beate back, all our spiritual enemies. But
rather to bee so much the more diligent, to
meditate in the same day and night, that
we may attayne vnto the true vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of that (for our owne comfort) which
they snatching at, doe abuse to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
confusion. A lesson very needefull to be
learned:<note place="margin">How the wiked shake of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</note> for we see that the deuil hath won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
preuailed with all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> world
(the true professours of Iesus Christ onely
excepted) for if you reason with a Papist
concerning any point of doctrine or an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist
for the conuincing of any sinne, and
for your warrant doe alledge the worde of
God: tush (say they) euery man wil alledge
Scripture for his defence, &amp; so they thinke
that they haue notably au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>swered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But we are to learne, by the example
of our Sauiour (in this place) that as the
dronkarde abusing drinke, is no cause why
I should refuse it, to quench my thirst: and
the glutto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> gordgeing himself with meate,<note place="margin">A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note>
no cause why I should thinke meate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by


<pb facs="tcp:14306:52"/>
abused, or the blessing of God lessened
in the same vnto me, for the satisfieng of
my hungry body: no more was the abuse of
Sathan in peruerting the Scriptures, any
cause to driue Christ from defendyng his
innocencie by the same: neither ought the
godlesse practises of the wicked (in propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Scriptures) be any cause, why I
should not make it still my direction to<note n="1" place="margin">Tim. 3. 16.</note>
teach me true doctrine: to improue in my
selfe and others erroneous opinions: to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
me in the way of godlinesse: to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
sinne and wickednesse: &amp; to<note n="2" place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte
me in all calamities and distresses,
Moreouer (if you marke the manner of
Christes replye) you shall see how netably
he pulleth away the visarde from Sathans
face, and maketh him appeare in his owne
kinde to be (as he is) an abuser of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to a wicked purpose. Which is to be
noted in this word (<hi>agayne</hi>) wherein, Christ
maketh a contradiction (not betwixt scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and scripture) but betwixt the sence
whereunto sathan would apply the text, &amp;
other places of the word of GOD: as if he
should say, thou shewest thy selfe to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauer,
in that thou wouldest haue a peece


<pb facs="tcp:14306:52"/>
of Gods worde, so taken, as that it must
needes cary with it, a manifest contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to other places of scripture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou doest abuse the text. A notable
example, for our direction, when we deale
with any man, that would haue the worde
on his side:<note place="margin">How to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of the text.</note> to examine not onely the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunces
of the texte (as aboue) but also to
see how that place produced by him in that
his sence, accordeth with the rest of Gods
word and the course thereof, wherewith if
we finde it to consent, it is to be receaued,
if not (by the example of the sonne of God
in this place) it is otherwise to be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
This doctrine (beyng rightly learned
and vsed) is many wayes profitable. For it
is first, a most excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t way (when we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with others that being carnall, doe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

that it is an excellent rule for vs to
obserue in the reading (or by any meanes
searching) the true sence of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> word of God:
for oftentymes we shall meete with such
places, that either by reason of the figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
speach, or the phrase of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or

               <hi>Greeke</hi> text, which vnto our <hi>English</hi> tongue
is often straunge) seeme to bee hard to bee
vnderstoode, or diuersly to be taken, or els
at the first sight is a Paradoxe, and strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ge
opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, in the course of Religion: then will,
this lesson of our Sauiour Christ Jesus
stand vs in good stead: namely it wil teach
vs to conferre it, with other places of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and see how it may bee taken agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vnto them, &amp; so expounded, according to
the proportion of fayth: And further it will
bee a notable shield vnto vs agaynst many
and infinite temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s of Sathan, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he laboureth to seduce vs. For he (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most)
neuer commeth vnto the godly in
his owne name, but vnder coulour, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Gods word. Now if we haue the
right vse of this lesson, it will teache vs to
wey his drift to examine his proofe, and
conferre it with the course of true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and godlines, and then shall we see, that
howsoeuer the motion, that hee suggested
into our mynde, seemed to haue his founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Scriptures, yet was it no
better then an illusion of the deuill, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
vs to sinne. Moreouer in the manner of
his aunswere, hee geueth vs an other most


<pb facs="tcp:14306:53"/>
excellent ensample for our instruction, for
Sathan (in alledging the Scriptures) doth
not alwayes leaue out a peece of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
but sometymes he bringeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whole.
Now as we are taught in the former doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
to examine the sence, wherin he doth
vse it: so (agayn) doth he teach vs, to examin
the end whereat he aymeth, which Christ
doth thus: Sathan alledging the promise
of protection, driueth at this, to make the
sonne of God sin agaynst his father: which
Christ layeth open by ioyning y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with the promise and then he reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
thus: My father neuer promised pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
vnto any that goe about to breake
his commaundementes: now that whiche
thou wouldest haue me to do, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
without a direct breach of this law:
<hi>Thou shalt not te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pt the Lord thy God.</hi> A most
excellent pointe of Religion, for the Lord
in his promises and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maundementes, ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
at one thing, to witte, his obedience
and the comfort of his children, for if hee
say do this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> conclusion is vnto a true chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> therfore must obey him, or if he pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mise
protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, mercy, spirituall, or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
blessings, the conclusion is (still) ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb facs="tcp:14306:54"/>
thou must obey him, if thou depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
him. So that this doctrine serueth to
most notable vse, in the direction of mans
whole life. It is true that God hath geuen
vnto vs those lawes whiche (by reason of
our naturall corruption) we are not able
to fulfill, and therefore the authour of our
saluation is onely, his mercy in his sonne
Jesus Christ: yet are we to know, that the
law of god is not thereby adnihillated, but
<note n="1" place="margin">Rom. 3. 31.</note> established, for the continuall course and
direction of mans whole life: and therefore
if we shall at any time, reason to our selues
thus: I am saued by the mercy of GOD,
therefore why should I be so strickt &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
in my life? Let vs take heede, for in so
doyng we turne<note n="2" place="margin">Iude. 4.</note> the grace of God into
wantonnesse: and if at any time this motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
shall come into our mynde:<note place="margin">There is no vse of the promise of God, being seperated from his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> I may doe such
a thing, and I trust God will forgeue me,
or, to bee thus, and thus obedient, to Gods
word, and law, is a wearisome thing, God
knoweth that we are fleshe &amp; bloud, will
beare with vs, let vs know, that it is the
very temptation of Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, that seperateth
the promise from the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t: and
would haue vs fall into sinne, and then let


<pb facs="tcp:14306:54"/>
vs set this lesson before our eyes, that our
Sauiour ioyned them both together, the
one to shew vs the law of God, and to geue
vs matter of true confidence in him: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to keepe vs in order, by continuall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
vnto his lawes, to the adornyng
of our profession by a godly life and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
Now let vs consider, the text, that
our Sauiour Christ doth alledge which is
writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in Deut.<note n="1" place="margin">Deut. 6 16.</note> Where <hi>Moyses</hi> (shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wonderful loue of god to the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>)
persuadeth with them to take heede,
how they walke, &amp; what they do, least they
tempt the Lord their God vnto anger:
what it is to tempt God, we haue heard
before, to wit, to try his power or his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:
his power, when we, seeing hys
mightie protection ouer vs, set downe in
his word, doe take in hand some ventrous
thing, to see whether it be true or no: hys
patience, when we vnderstanding his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
vengeance pronounced in his word to
light vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that goe on carelesly in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
doe notwithstanding, little (or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all) regard the same:<note place="margin">VVhat it is to tempt God and what not.</note> but presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

<pb facs="tcp:14306:55"/>
of our owne fleshe: so that our Sauiour
Christ alleageth that place to proue, that
if hee should throwe himselfe downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
he should tempt God, in the first sort,
to wit in trying whether hee would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
him or no. The doctrine (therefore)
that we are to learne out of this place is
this: that we must not onely haue an eye
to this, that euery action which we take in
hand, and euery thing that we goe about,
be warranted by the word of God: but also
that the maner thereof, and the meanes for
the performance of the same, be suche as
God himselfe hath appointed, and not such
as we in our owne (foolishe wisedome) do
like well of: which lesson) (if it were right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learned and put in execution) would be
the cause of abridging many a mischief in
common weales: of healing many a breath
in Churches, and in letting many a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke

the last temptation

The firste thyng whereof is

the place whereunto hee brought Christ,
that hee might worke his feate vpon him,
whiche is a very high mountaine: not y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> he
caried him thether, in bodely maner, but (as
they were before) offred vnto him such a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation.
Now in that Sathan (before hee
offer vnto Christ the consideration of the
thyng that he goeth about) doth first bryng
him to a place (as he thinketh) most conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for his purpose, we may behold in an

this we haue diligently to note (that we

a matter worthy to be noted, for if Christ

world persuadeth it selfe, that thoughtes
are free, and man may behold what he liste

to tye vp our affections and keepe them in

great and haynous offences. Let vs yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a further slight of Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in this shew

he offereth them not simply as they are,<note place="margin">Sathan in tempting stealeth out of mans mind all thinges that may let his purpose.</note> but

For when Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> would make a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vayne

prayse of men, shew also the small affection
that men that be wise beare vnto such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
if with the present pleasure of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
he should recke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> vp the sicknesses and
punishmentes that follow: if with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
tast of straunge drinke he should


<pb facs="tcp:14306:60"/>
make mention of the sorrowes that ensue
the same: in short, if with the fleshly conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that sinne bringeth hee sheuld also
speake of the troubles that follow vpon it,
and what punishment such shall abyde at
the hands of almighty God, he might iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feare that he should preuaile but a litle.
And therfore when he goeth about to bring
man into any sinne, he leaueth out whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer

he may the more easily obtaine his purpose:
which we see him most notably to practise,
agaynst our Sauiour Christ in this place:
for goyng about to make him worshyp him
selfe in steade of the liuyng God (who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is to be worshipped) he would draw him
thereunto by the desire of the souerainetie
ouer kingdomes, the whiche (that it may
more forcibly moue the sonne of God) hee
propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>deth in the most excellent condition
that it can be of, and neuer sheweth him of
the great charge of a kingdome: the ficle

that they shall make, when the Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

an accompt of their stewardshippes. And w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
this course doth hee mightely blinde the

with the glory, pleasure, and profite of this

will learne (in deede) to shunne the estate
that Sathan would bring the sonne of god
in this temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, to consider of the world,
and the thyngs that are therein, as they be
described by the holy Ghost in the word of
God, and wey the manifold snares that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

set down vnto vs the forcible meanes
that Sathan vsed to obtaine his purpose,
for wee see that as pleasaunt thynges doe
greatly moue the mynd of man, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when no bitternesse is mingled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall,
so most especially when they (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng

and of a sodayne. All which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ces
you see how wisely the enemy hath
packed together. The doctrine then that
we are to learne out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same is this: that
Sathan will pretermit nothyng (be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so litle) but he will take his aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tage
by it to do vs harme: to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end that we may

seyng he is so watchful to seeke our destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
agayne in that this is sayd to be in a
moment or the Twinckling of an eye, we
may further behold that which before was
shewed, namely, that the sayd temptations,
were not corporally, but by cogitation. For
we know that the mynde of man (in such
wonderfull maner hath GOD created it)
can at once conceiue and see those thynges
that are farre distant,<note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the mind of man.</note> and (as it were) lay
them together, and make one common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
vnto it selfe of all the world: thinkyng
sometymes of all at once, and sometimes of
one part, somtimes of an other, and such is
the wonderfull celeritie &amp; quicknesse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that it is now here, &amp; forthwith at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
or in any of the vttermost partes
of the earth, which Sathan knowyng well
inough doth labour also to make this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and most excellent grace of God to
serue his turne,<note place="margin">Sathan la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth most to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the best graces of God.</note> for the accomplishment of

instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tes of sinne and imquitie to serue


<pb facs="tcp:14306:63"/>
his purpose, but also vsurpeth (euen) vppon
the best and most excellent graces of God,
seeking to peruert them from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right vse,
whereunto God hath allotted them: which
is a thing very needefull of vs to be noted,
for as it pleaseth God in his great loue to
mankinde, to bestow his graces both of the
mynde and body vpon man in most liberall
measure (as witte, wisedome, learnyng, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
honour, strength, beautie. &amp;c.) so doth
Sathan labour (euen) to make all these
thyngs, not onely vnprofitable vnto vs, but
(whiche more is) as instrumentes of our
greater falling from GOD, and so of our
more greeuous Judgement. For hee will
teache a man to turne his wit vnto crafty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
his wisedome to iniurye others, his
learning to bolster peruerse opinions, his
riches to choake the good motions of the
spirite in him, his honour to the forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God, to honour him, his strength to
oppresse others, and beautie to pride, euen
as he would haue vsed that excellent part
of man (in the sonne of God) his mynde, to
be a meane to draw him from his obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce
vnto God his father. And therfore we haue
great neede to take heede, that the graces


<pb facs="tcp:14306:63"/>
which God hath geuen vnto vs be not abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by vs through the suggestion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
to our greater hurt and Gods disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
which we shall the better regarde, if
we set this alwayes before our eyes (and
endeuour it vnfainedly in the whole course
of our life) that all that we haue, or are any
way able to doe, may be employed in such
wise, as may best serue to the glory of god
the father, the buildyng of the kingdome
of Jesus Christ and the benefite of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
with whom we doe liue.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>(<hi>All this will I giue thee if thou wilt fall
downe and worship me</hi>) all this while hathe
Satan done no more but onely made way
for his purpose: for hauing set him on an
exceeding high mountaine and shewed (as
it were) before his eyes the bewtie of all
kingdomes, hee commeth then to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to wit, to offer them all vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne
of God, so that he wil worship him, for (no
doubt) he thought that Christ must needs
be rauished with the desire of that glorious
sight, and therefore woulde be willing to
doe any thing, for the attayning thereof:
which is easily to be found in man, subiect
to corruption, but Christ was exempt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>


               <pb facs="tcp:14306:64"/>
the same, and therefore Satan was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of his hope and disappointed of hys
purpose. But let vs consider his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
how cunningly it is disposed and set
in order. Sathan doth not go simply to the
thing it selfe (as he did in the former) but
before he biddeth him worship him, he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
down the promise, to the end (that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the circumstances) he might ad this
as the life (if Christ would haue beleeued
him) that he wil bestow them all vpon him
but Christ saw his subtiltie, and therefore
resisted him, and hath prouided that the
same should be registred for our instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And yet doth the deuill most mightelie
preuayle with the world herein: for he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
such a colour vppon sinne, by glorious
promises, and manifold pleasures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
which come by the same that hee can
easily perswade (almost) any man to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
anie sinne, for that appeareth by the
course that men take in this world,<note place="margin">Euery man is sharpe sighted to sinne but dull to good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse.</note> that he
hath alreadie wonne theyr heartes vnto
this perswasion, that he will giue them all
thinges. For if there be a practise whiche
is cleane forbidden in the worde of God,
you shall finde euen the meanest (in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward


<pb facs="tcp:14306:64"/>
appearaunce) very perfite in it, but
as for those courses that God hathe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
(whereunto hee hath promised a
blessing, and which hee will haue done as
seruice vnto himself) if you aske them, they
know not what they meane: &amp; if you speake
of them you had as good speake to a post: he
doth not onelie (in moste liberall maner)
promise to bestow all these vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Christ: but
also, for a further assuraunce (as <hi>Luke</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth)
auoucheth that they are deliuered
vnto him, and to whome soeuer he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
them. And yet we know by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that<note n="1" place="margin">Psal. 24. 1</note> the earth is the Lordes, and
all that is therein.<note n="2" place="margin">Dan. 2. 37.</note> The Lorde God of

so that wee may behold the impudencie of
Sathan, and his lying presumption that
dare vindicate vnto himselfe that wherein
hee hathe no interest, where-withall (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding)
hee preuayleth muche in the
world: for they that do beleeue that these
things he the Lords, and are bestowed (as


<pb facs="tcp:14306:65"/>
blessings) vpon none,<note place="margin">who beleeue God to rule the world &amp; who not.</note> but those that receiue
them at hys hands (which is by those law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
meanes that he hymselfe in hys worde
hath prescribed and warranted) are careful
that they neuer desire that whereunto the
Lord doth not offer good meanes: contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they that beleeue it not, but haue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
taken out the lesson y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sathan is the
giuer of them, do by all subtle and indirect
meanes seeke to attaine vnto theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
holding this for a principle, that hee
that dissembleth not cannot liue: and this
for an other, that hee that dealeth iustly
shall dye a begger: hath not y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> deuil (think
you) perswaded such persons that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world
is hys, and hee hathe the bestowing of it at
hys pleasure? yes verely. And therefore they
make no conscience of right or wrong: they
neyther feare God nor man, but (so they
may haue theyr willes in pleasure, profite
or worldly estimation) they care for no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Contrariwise those that feare God
haue not onely learned to abhorre and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

in those monstrous <hi>Anachims</hi> that followe

to arise a doubt, howe this can be so, that

is prince of this world, first in respect of
the sin that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mitted in the same, for as

of the transgression of mankinde,<note place="margin">Sathan in thre respects called the prince of this world.</note> &amp; therfore
is the continuall ringe leader of all vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse.
Secondly he is called the prince of

<pb facs="tcp:14306:66"/>
not of that he may do, for he is an vsurper,
to wit through sinne captiueth and subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
man vnto his obedience and slauish sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
whereunto men doe so generallye
yeld, that he onely seemeth to be serued and
the Lord of heauen and earth thrust out at
the doores, and therefore is hee called the
prince of this world. Thirdly he is called
the god of this world for that they why (by
the iust Iudgement of god) are geuen ouer

beleue lyes, and obey Sathan in the whole
course of their life, yet all this his power
and souerainetie is ruled by the raynes of
Gods prouidence, that hee can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng,
without his<note n="4" place="margin">Iob. 1. 12</note> leaue, no not so
much as enter into<note n="5" place="margin">Mat. 8. 31</note> the swine, whiche is
vnto vs a great comfort and (indeede) the
staffe of all our affiaunce, for when we
see the malice of Sathan, the crueltie of
the wicked, and our owne wickednesse we
could haue nothing to resist, but onely this
that Gods prouidence, whom we feare and
in whom we repose our confidence, so dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
all thynges that without his will


<pb facs="tcp:14306:66"/>
(whiche is in his sonne Iesus Christ lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng
towardes vs) nothing can be attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or performed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou wilt fall downe and worship me</hi>)
We see hys liberall offer and how bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a hand he hath in that which is none of
his own, and yet notwithstanding doth hee
promise this vpon meere liberalitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect of anie other matter, no, it was
nener hys meaning, for none shal be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
by hym but such as will doe hym ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage:
so that we may note herein Sathan,
that mynde which he accused the seruaunt
of God<note n="1" place="margin">Iob. 1. 9</note> 
               <hi>Iob</hi> to be of: to wit that <hi>Iob</hi> dyd
not serue God for nothing: but because
God had enriched him therfore (onely) was
he godly and feared the Lord, and why did
he charge him with such a hainous crime?
for sooth because he was of the same dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
himselfe.<note place="margin">The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedest man thinketh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man as bad as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> The doctrine (then) that
we learne out of the same is this: that as
we see Sathan to be minded, euen so (if
you looke into the course of this worlde)
shall we see hys instrumentes to be affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
that is, to measure others by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and to (thinke though they be most
wicked, and most vilely desposed) that no


<pb facs="tcp:14306:67"/>
man is better: so that the deceitfull man
wil trust none, but thinketh that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
will beceaue him. The lyer beleeueth not
an other of hys word, because hee himselfe
maketh no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>science of lying, he that shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> offences that the world exclaymeth
against (onely) to stop mens mouthes, doth
think that no man doth more: in one word,
let a man be neuer of wickedly bent, yet
thinketh he no other men to be any better:
contrariwise, the man whose mind is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
regenerated thinketh so basely of hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and by charitie (the fruit of his faith)
<note n="1" place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 7.</note> hopeth so wel of euery man, that (vnlesse
he know the contrary) he alwayes iudgeth
the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ãâã</desc>
               </gap>. Againe you see how liberall he is
of promise, but he tieth it vnto a condition:
wherein you may perceiue howe contrarie
his affection is vnto the mind of the Lord:
it is true that God will be worshipped of
all that he dealeth mercifully withall, but
yet doth he freely bestow his mercy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any respect of our worshipping hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand.
But Sathan wilbe worshipped
before he will performe his promise. So
that as the contrarie disposition of God &amp;
Sathan appeare in this poynt, in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner


<pb facs="tcp:14306:67"/>
(if you examine it well) shall you finde
them that are of God,<note place="margin">VVich what minde the. godly are. liberall.</note> and them that are
of their father the deuill to be, for the godly
hauing obteyned mercy at the handes of
God, are also enclined vnto pitie and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
being carefull to doe good (accordyng
to theyr power) not for gayne, but because
God hath bene fauourable vnto them, the
wicked (on the other side)<note place="margin">VVhom the wicked doe like and whome not.</note> being minded
as he is by whome they are guided, will
promise very bountifully, and giue as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred
wordes and vse as glorious termes,
as though theyr tongues were made of
Butter: But all that euer they promise is
with an if for if, they gayne not by thee: or
if thou please not theyr humor, or if thou
crowch not vnto them: they will not onelie
not performe the least part of theyr large
promises, but thou shalt finde it in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that they will be vnto thee (as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
was euer after to Christ) thy greatest
enemies, and as much as in them lyeth) do
thee the greatest displeasure. Well, let vs
proceede the deuill worshipped: what doth
he desire when hee would haue Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
to fall downe and worship him? surely
no lesse then that whiche was due vnto


<pb facs="tcp:14306:68"/>
God the father: for looke what it is that
God requireth of vs in his word, when hee
biddeth vs worship him, and all that doth
Sathan most impudently challenge vnto
him: But you will say vnto me, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
shewed himselfe herein a very foole,
for no man was euer found that would say
he would worship the deuill. Well, thus
can he cunningly teache thee to play with
termes and speeches, while he get domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ouer thee to make thee worship hym in
deed. For (if we shal truely measure things
by the lyne of trueth) we shall see that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
is greatly obeyed in this poynt, for
what is it to worship God but to fear him,
and bring forth the fruites of the same
which is obedience? Nowe we cannot tell
one of vs when an other doth feare, but by

vs) the obedience vnto God is godlines, in
the keeping of his commaundementes, the
obedience vnto Sathan is wickednes in
transgressing the lawes of God. Now let


<pb facs="tcp:14306:68"/>
vs come to the poynt: if there be moe found
that giue themselues ouer vnto sinne, in
neglecting of the worde of God, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of his holie name, profaining of hys
Saboath, disobedience, whoredome,<note place="margin">VVho they be that fall downe and worship the deuill.</note> drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes,

then that bee carefull to knowe GOD,
and striue against all impedimentes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
theyr liues according to hys holy
word, it must needes follow that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
number (how soeuer they pretend the
contrarie) doe obey Sathan in this poynt
to fall down and worship him: besides this
there is an other way to worship Sathan,
which many do walk in &amp; that is thus. We
know that those which worshippe God do
propound vnto them selues his lawes to be
obeyed, and so make godlynesse their chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
studie: if then wee propound any other
thing for our chiefest marke, wee worship
Sathan. They therefore that make theyr

that make the vanitie of worldly pompe
and honor their principal end: (vnto one of

doe not serue God, but fall downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sathan and worship him. This is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
for Sathan preuayleth in this poynt
yet further not onely in getting men into
his iurisdiction to fail downe and worship
him, but also in making men his substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
herein,<note place="margin">Pettie De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils.</note> creating them pettie deuils
to challenge the same thinges vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,

thus put in execution, when soeuer any

which cannot be done without the breach
of Gods commandementes, or commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

of the glory of God and staying of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> course
of godlines. For God hath set euery man
in his seuerall place, not for the breaking,
but the further obeying of his lawes, and
he neuer erected that calling whiche is
a stoppe vnto hys glory: For so much as
he made<note n="1" place="margin">Pro. 16. 4.</note> all thinges to serue thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
Now you see (I trust) in some measure,


<pb facs="tcp:14306:69"/>
what the Deuill would haue Christ doe,
and how farre hee proceedeth in practising
this in the world among men. I am sure
that you thinke by this tyme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is not the subtilest, but the grosest
and most palpable impietie of all other, and
therefore Sathan may seeme to deale foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly,
but we are thereby to note, that hee
doth not onely deale cunnyngly but also
most impudently. For we see in experience
how that hee (often) laboureth to persuade
men vnto most horrible facces, as to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their dearest and nearest frendes: Yea
oftentymes, to make away their owne sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
and (alas) hee preuaileth many tymes

the sonne of God (who was come into


<pb facs="tcp:14306:70"/>
the world to teach men, the true worship of
god) to giue vnto him that honour which is
due to god alone: He aunswereth him more
sharply then before he did, saying vnto him
auoyde Sathan, as if hee should haue sayd
get thee hence, thou aduersary to me, and
to all mankinde, thou enemy to all truth
thou seducer and deceiuer, thou lyer and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper,

any good. So that by this first braunch of
the aunswere of Christ Jesus vnto sathan,
we learne, to begin withall this lesson that
the consideration of the name of the enemy
and what it doth signifie, because it expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his nature, is a forcible meanes to
beate him backe and disapoynt him of his
purpose, and weaken his stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>gth. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it hath pleased the holy Ghost in the
scriptures, to terme him with these titles
whiche doe make manifest his disposition,
as the name of Deuil signifieth a deprauer
and wrangler, he is called Lyon in respect
of his deuouring of men; the terme of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>


               <pb facs="tcp:14306:71"/>
importeth his venemous poyson, Christ
sayth hee is the<note n="1" place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44</note> father of lyes, to shewe
that he neuer meaneth so well as he prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
and here hee is reproued by the name
of sathan which signifieth an enemy or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary.<note place="margin">The fayre offers of an enemie<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> can not be in good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note>
All is to this ende that we may
learne this lesson: that for so much as his
whole indeuour is to destroye vs, and that
he is a professed enemy vnto vs, those offers
that hee seeketh to bestow vppon vs (for so
much as they come from him that wisheth
vs no good) though we see no hurt in them,
yet are we iustly to suspect them: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to take heede, that we in no wise yeld
vnto them. Agayne we see how Christ ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him vp farre more sharpely then in the
former aunsweres he did, for then hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
him simply with the text, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reproued him nor vrged the meanyng
of the wordes but onely in the bare alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of it, and here he not onely taketh him
vp with a most sharpe reproofe, but also
pressed him (as we shal see anone) with the
text in more forcible manner. The cause
whereof, we are to search out, that we may
haue the benefite of it to our owne instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If you marke well these thynges that


<pb facs="tcp:14306:71"/>
sathan vrged vnto Christ before this, you
shal finde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to be of an other kinde, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to concerne him selfe and not God (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly)
as this doth, for though it bee a
dishonour vnto God, when a man is vrged
to offend in the least poynt of his Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>:
yet it concerneth the Lord more nearely
when one shalbe sollicited to violate that
worship and honour thereof hee is very<note n="1" place="margin">Exod. 20 5.</note>
ielous, and which he will not giue vnto an
other, and accordyng as it is more haynous
in the eyes of the Lord, so is it to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a thyng more odious vnto man, and
therfore to be repelled with more courage:
Which (if you marke well) you shall in the
practise of our Sauiour in the combate, for
so long as sathan medled with those things
that concerned Christ himselfe (as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

but when he commeth vnto this pointe, to
vrge him vnto those thinges, whiche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the threatning of God from the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
of his creatures, and depriuyng
him of his glory and worship, he dealeth no

the repulse that Christ giueth vnto sathan:
&amp; such a blowe as made him (finally) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
for that time. The wordes that are
here alleadged, be not to be found, in so
many sillables in any place of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
though the sence and meaning is
in many places, that whereunto Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludeth

of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> where be these wordes:<note n="1" place="margin">cap. 16. 13 10. 20.</note>
thou shalt feare the Lorde thy God, and
serue him: In stead of feare, Christ putteth
worship: and to the worde (serue) hee ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
(onely) both whiche are to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:
for the first: where Christ taketh
worshippe for feare, the difference is no
more,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the feare and worship of God.</note> but to set downe the effect in stead
of the cause, for the feare of God is that
reuerent opinion that man ought to haue
of God, in regard of his greatnes and his
own weakenes: and the worship of God, is
that necessary fruite that feare bringeth
forth. Nowe for asmuch as Sathan chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
vnto hymselfe worshippe, which is
the fruit of the feare of god (and therefore
is alwaies included in the worde feare)
Christ opposing his aunswere, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
of the enemie, taketh that part of
the sence of the commaundement (though
not the very worde) which the aduersary
did seeme to arrogate vnto himselfe. Now
for the worde (onelie) which Christ seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to adde vnto the text, if wee marke it
well, we shall see that it is most agreable
to the meaning of the holy Ghost: for


<pb facs="tcp:14306:74"/>
that sentence (in so much as it belongeth
to the worshippe of God) must be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto the first commandement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God excludeth all others and taketh
all vnto him selfe, the meaninge of it
then must needes be, that this seruice is
(onely) to be giuen vnto God: Agayne
we know in the course of the whole scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that when god speaketh (as we call
it) indefinitely, the sence is euer to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
generally: as when he sayth<note n="1" place="margin">Ier. 17, 5. Ioh. 5. 39.</note> cursed
is he that maketh flesh and bloud his arm,
he meaneth all and euerie sort of flesh and
bloud, agayne when hee sayth, searche the
scriptures, for in them you thinke to haue
eternall lyfe: hee meaneth in them onely,
so when he saith, thou shalt feare the Lord,
and serue him, he meaneth onely him: you
see then how the answere of christ though
it vary something in the words of the text
which he aleageth, yet it differeth nothing
from the sence and meaning. Now if you
marke the wordes spoken and lay them to
the demaund of Sathan you shall see that
they are (being thus alleaged) much more
forcible then otherwise. For if Christ had
spoken in generall of the feare of God, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than


<pb facs="tcp:14306:74"/>
(being a cauyller) might haue replied
that hee required worshippe and not feare,
but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Christ speaketh of worship, which
(in deede) is conteined in feare, he stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
his mouth that way, agayne, if he had
said thou shalt serue God: Sathan might
(peraduenture) haue aunswered, so thou
mayest, and yet worship mee. But when
Christ addeth this word (onely) hee spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no more, then the text conteyneth in
it (being compared with other places) and
yet cutteth of all occasions, from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of further wrangling. The manner
therefore of Christs dealing, with the text
doth teach vs: that for the right ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an aduersary, and conuicting of any
gaynesaier,<note place="margin">An example how to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge the scriptures.</note> it is greatly materiall how the
scripture bee aleaged: for it is not onely,
meet that the sword of the spirit be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
out to cut downe, all that is raysed
agaynst the truth: but also, that an edge be
set vppon it, by the wisedome of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.
For as euery one that canne handle
a swoorde, is not bye and bye able to
wounde his enemie, and defende himselfe
with it, so euery one that alledgeth the
Scripture (though hee alledge it truely,


<pb facs="tcp:14306:75"/>
and to a good purpose) is not able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the aduersarie with it, vnlesse hee
doe vnderstand the true meanyng of it,
that hee may produce it, to the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage
to his cause. Thus we see how
Christ applyeth the Scripture, and what
we haue to learne, out of the manner of
the same. The doctrine that we are to
obserue out of the aunswere is this, that
(in the matter of Religion) not onely the
hart and inward affection, is due to God,<note place="margin">VVhat it is to worship God.</note>
and to bee geuen onely vnto him, but also
all externe and outwarde gestures either
of worde, countenance, or corporall beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.
Whiche is diligently to bee noted
because of our Papistes, who will confesse
that God (for so much as hee is a<note n="1" place="margin">Ioh. 4. 14</note> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite)
must haue all spirituall worshyp, but
(say they) that letteth not, but wee may
giue outward worshyppe, vnto Sainctes
Images Reliques &amp;c. Wherein they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shewe themselues marueilous igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt,
or (rather) wilfully obstinate, for
the worde that Christ here vseth for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppe,
is not to bee vnderstoode onely of
inwarde but outward worshyp rather: and
signifieth (properly) to prostrate, or fall


<pb facs="tcp:14306:75"/>
downe vppon the face or knees: Now for
as much, as Christ vendicateth this to be
due onely vnto God, it is euident that no
outwarde worshyppe (in respect of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion)
is due to any other, but because
they will euidently shewe themselues, of
set purpose, to gaynesaye the manifest
truth, they flee vnto a foolishe and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
distinction of two <hi>Greeke</hi> wordes <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,</hi>
and <hi>Doulia:</hi> and say that (in deede)
the worshyppe, whiche is called <hi>Latria,</hi> is
due to God, but <hi>Dulia</hi> is due to Saintes
and Angels, but if I shall shewe vnto
them, that both those wordes are vsed in
the booke of God indifferently when the
worshyp of God is spoken of,<note place="margin">The popish distinction of Latria &amp; Doulia ouer throwne.</note> what will
then become of their distinction, for the
first worde they make no question, and
therefore I neede not speake of it, but let
them (or their Clarkes that vnderstande
the tongues) looke into the sixtenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
of the Epistle to the Romanes 6 the<note n="1" place="margin">Rom. 16. 18.</note>
eightenth Uerse and there they shall see
that hee (speakyng of the seruice of Jesus
Christ) vseth the <hi>Greeke</hi> worde, from
whence <hi>Doulia</hi> is deriued: But let them
goe (as not worthy to be named when we


<pb facs="tcp:14306:76"/>
speake of the seruice of GOD) and let
vs learne the lesson that our Sauiour doth
teache vs in this place, to knowe that
God will haue all inward and outwarde
seruice that euer any man ought to doe, in
respect of Religion, and therefore let vs
take heede that while we parte stakes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and others (who in deede can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

and left him (<hi>Luke</hi> sayeth) for a season,
whereby we learne: First that the ende of
tryalls is, (<hi>Iames</hi> sayth) if we resiste the
Deuill hee will flee from vs. Secondly,<note n="2" place="margin">Iam. 4. 7.</note>
that yet hee will neuer finally bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
so long as we liue, for as he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from Christ (but for a season) so doth
he leaue vs, not as though he were vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

wee may neuer promise our selues
rest, from his assaultes so long as wee
are in this tabernacle of clay (as is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

consolation, in their seruice, which is the

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost gracious God and louing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we thy vnworthy seruauntes
present our selues here before thy
glorious Maiestie, not trusting to
our owne merites or worthynesse, but onely to
thy mercy in thy sonne Iesus Christ. For we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
from the bottome of our hartes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our selues, that we are not onely concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and borne in sinne, but also haue continued
in the same, from the beginnyng of our tyme
vnto this present, transgressing thy lawes and
commaundementes both in thought worde
and deede, in so much that we are not worthy
to appeare before thee much lesse to presume to
begge or craue any good thing at thy handes,
with hope to obteine the same, if thou shouldest
deale with vs according to our deseruinges, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
(most mercyfull and holy Father)
for as much as thou hast commaunded vs to
call vpon thee, when we feele our selues loden


<pb facs="tcp:14306:78"/>
with the burthen of our sinnes, and hast promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to ease vs. We trusting vnto the truth of
this thy promise do come vnto thee at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
most humbly beseeching thee (for thy
sonne our Sauiour Iesus Christes sake) to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and forgeue vs all our sinnes, to blot them
out of thy remembraunce, and to bury them is
silence that they neuer appeare before thee to
accuse vs. And beseeche thee (good Father) to
worke in our harts an earnest loathing of sinne,
a detestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of all iniquitie with a carefull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and an vnfayned indeuour, to frame our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
and conuersations, according to thy blessed
will. Lord for somuch as we haue learned out
of thy holy word, that all those whom thou hast
vouchsafed to giue into the handes of thy son
Iesus Christ, shall be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tinually (so long as they
liue in this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t world) be assailed, with trials,
temptations, tribulations and afflictions, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the malice of Sathan, their enemy, the
allurementes of the world: and the enticements
of their owne sinnefull nature: We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and confesse, that a greater honor can no
way befall vnto vs, then to be molested by thy
enemies for the testimonie of thy truth: yet
(Lord) such is our weakenesse by nature, and
so vnfit is our fleshe to begin, or continue any


<pb facs="tcp:14306:78"/>
good thing, that we must needes quayle in the
same, and vtterly renounce thee and thy truth,
vnlesse thou of thy gracious goodnesse assiste vs
with thy grace, in such wise, as both the loathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our flesh (to do any good thing) be taken
away, and also thy fauour so support vs, that we
may be strengthened to abide in thy true feare
and seruice. We beseeche thee therefore good
Father (euen for his sake whose bloud thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptest
not too deare for our redemption) that
as it is thy will to impose vppon vs this estate
of bearyng the Crosse for thy sake, so thou
wouldest giue vs strength, contentednesse and
pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce to make vs able to vnder go the same.
Lord let not our weakenesse, betray thy glory,
let not our shrincking, giue aduauntage vnto
thy foes: neither let our wantes, any way hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thy graces from comming vnto vs: but for
as much as thou hast thought it most meete, to
haue thy glory shewed in weakenesse, thy power
to be perfect in infirmitie, and the foolish ones
of the world to confounde the wise, graunt (we
beseeche thee) that wee may so sight vnder the
banner of Iesus Christ thy sonne, and so striue
to builde his kingdome, in the middest of his
enemies, that by vs thy name may be glorified,


<pb facs="tcp:14306:79"/>
thy truth may be magnified, thy Sonne Christ
Iesus may be aduaunced, and our soules and
consciences euerlastingly comforted.
Lord we pray thee graunt these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
not alone to vs that are
here present. &amp;c.</p>
