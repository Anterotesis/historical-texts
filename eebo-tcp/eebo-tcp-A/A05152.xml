            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He sayde these thynges, partly to vs, which spake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of hym selfe. For he is that riche man, which not only had, but hath, and shall haue euermore, I say not one, but many stewardes, euen to thende of the worlde.</p>
            <p>¶ He is man, seing that he is god and man. He is ryche, not onely in mercy, but in all kynde of rychesse. For it is he, that giueth vs al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges abundantly.

            <p>They haue a wonderfulle prety ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to perswade this thynge, of a certayne maried woman, whiche whan her husbande was in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, in that fyry fornays, that hath burned away so many of our pens, paide her husbandes ransome, and so of duetie claimed hym to be sette at lybertie: Whyle they thus prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <note place="margin">Deade y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</note> to the people, that deade ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (which at the first, as I thinke, were set vp onely, to represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges absent) not onely ought to be coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with golde, but also ought of al faythful &amp; christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, yea in this scarsenes and penurye of all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to be cladde with sylke garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:25926:5"/>
&amp; those also lade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with precious gemmes &amp; iewels, And that besyde all this, they are to be lyghted with waxe candelles, bothe within the churche and withoute the churche, yea at noone dayes, as who shulde say, here no coste can be to greatte, where as in the meane tyme, we see Christis faitheful and lyuely yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, bought with no lesse price, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his most precious bloud, alas alas, to be an hungred, a thurste, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colde, and to lye in darkenes wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in all wretchednesse, yea to lye there, vntyll dethe take away theyr miseries: While they preched, these wylworkes, that comme but of our owne deuotion, althoughe they be not so necessarye, as the workes of mercy, and the preceptes of god, yet they sayd, &amp; in the pulpet, that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes were more principall, more
<pb facs="tcp:25926:5"/>
excellent, &amp; (playnly to vtter what they meane) more acceptable to god than workes of mercy: as thoughe now mans inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions and fansies, coude plese god better than goddis preceptis, or straunge thinges bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his owne: while they thus preached, that more fruite, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion cometh of the beholdyng of an image, though it be but a <hi>Pater noster</hi> whyle, than is gotten by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge and contemplation in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though ye rede and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate therin seuen yeres space:</p>
            <p>Finally, whyle they preached thus, sowles tourmented in purgatorie, to haue mooste nede of oure helpe, and that they canne haue noo ayde, but of vs in this world, of the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che two, if the one be not false, yet at the least it is ambiguous, vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayne, doubtefull, and therfore
<pb facs="tcp:25926:6"/>
rashly &amp; arrogantly with such bold<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes affirmed in the audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Thother by all mens opinions is manifestly false. I lette passe to speake of moche other suche lyke countrefayte doctrine, whiche hath ben blasted and blowen out by som for the space of. iii. houres togither. Be these the chrystian and dyuyne misteries, and not rather the drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of men? Be these the faithful dispensers of goddis misteries, and nat rather fals dissipatours of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? whom god neuer put in office, but rather the dyuell sette them ouer a myserable familie, ouer an howse myserably ordred and intreated.</p>
            <p>Happy were the people, if such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <note place="margin">More hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>py, if they preached neuer.</note> seldome. And yet it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to see these, in their generation, to be moch more prudent and poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, than the faithfull ministers at
<pb facs="tcp:25926:6"/>
in their generation, whyle they go about more prudently to stablysshe mennes dreames, than these do, to holde vppe Goddis commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</p>
            <p>¶ Thus it commeth to passe, that workes lucratiue, wylworkes, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fansies reigne, and christian wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, necessarye workes, fruitefulle workes, be troden vnder the foote. Thus the euyll, is moche better set out by euyll men, than is the good, by good men: bycause the euylle be more wise, than be the good in their generation.</p>
            <p>¶ These be the false Stewardes, whom al good and faythefull men euery day accuse vnto the rych ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the householde, not without great heuynesse, that they wast his goodes, whom he also one day wol call to hym, and saye to them, as he
<pb facs="tcp:25926:7"/>
dyd to his stewarde, whan he sayd, What is this, that I here of the?</p>
            <p>¶ Here God partely wondereth at our ingratitude and perfidie, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chydeth vs for them, and beinge bothe full of wonder, and redy to chyde, axeth vs, What is this, that I here of you? As though he shulde saye vnto vs, All good men in all places, complayne of you, accuse your auarice, your exactions, your tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny. They haue required in you a longe season, and yet require, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and synceritie. I commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you, that with all industrie and labour, ye shulde fede my shepe: ye cruestly fede your selfes, from daye to daye, wallowynge in delytes and ydelnesse. I commaunded you, to teache my commaundementes, and not your fansies, and that ye shulde seke my glory and my vantage: you
<pb facs="tcp:25926:7"/>
teche your own traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and seke your owne glorie and profite. You preache very seldome, and whan ye do preche, ye do nothynge but cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them that preache truly, as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che as lieth in you, that it were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che better, suche not to preache at all, than so perniciously to preache.

Noo no, ye haue not deceyued me, but your selues. My gyftes and benefites towarde you,

Bycause ye haue contempned the lenitie and clemency of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the howse, ye haue right wel deserued, to abyde the rygour &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie of the Judge.

But I confesse playnely, this thynge to be farre aboue my power. Therfore this beinge onely left to me, I wysshe for that I haue not, and am sory, that that is not in me, whiche I wold so gladly haue: That is, power so to handle the thynge, that I haue in hande, that all that I say, may turne to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of god, your sowle helthe, and <gap reason="missing" extent="2+ pages">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned rather, that it shulde be so: as many men speke many thinges, not that they oughte to be so, but that they are wonte to be so. Naye, this greued Christ, that the children of this worlde, shuld be of more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycie, than the chyldren of lyghte, whiche thing yet was true in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis tyme, and nowe in our tyme is most true. Who is so blynde, but he seeth this clerely, excepte perchance there be any, that can not discerne the chyldren of the worlde, from the chyldren of lyght? The chyldren of the worlde, conceyue and brynge forth more prudently, and thynges conceyued and brought forth, they nouryshe and conserue with moche more polycie, than do the chyldren of lyght. Whiche thynge is as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull to be sayd, as it semeth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surde
<pb facs="tcp:25926:10"/>
to be herde. Whan ye here the chyldren of the worlde, you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the worlde, as a father. For the worlde is father of many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not by first creation &amp; worke, but by imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and loue. He is not only a father, but also the sonne of an other father. If ye knowe ones his father, by and by ye shall know his chyldren. For he that hathe the dyuelle to his father, muste needes haue dyuellyshe chyldren. The dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelle <note place="margin">Prynce of the world the dyuell.</note> is not onely taken for father, but also for prince of the world, that is, of worldly folke. It is eyther all one thynge, or els not moche diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, to say, chyldren of the worlde, and children of the diuel, according to that, that Christe sayd to the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, <note place="margin">Ioan. 8.</note> Ye are of your father the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel: where as vndoutedly he spake to childerne of this worlde. Nowe
<pb facs="tcp:25926:11"/>
seing the diuell is both author and ruler of the darkenes, in the which the chiiderne of this worlde walke, or to say better, wander, they mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hate both the lyght, &amp; also the children of lyght. And hereof it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that the chyldren of lyght ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, or very seldome, lacke persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this worlde, vnto which the chyldren of the world, that is of the dyuell, bringeth them. And there is no man, but he seeth, that these vse moche more policie in procurynge the hurte and damage of the good, than those in defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng them selfes.</p>
            <p>¶ Therfore brothern, gather you, the disposition and study of the chil dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the disposition and studye of the fathers. You knowe, this is a prouerbe moch vsed, An euyl crow, an euyll egge. Than, the chyldren of this worlde, that are knowen to
<pb facs="tcp:25926:11"/>
haue so euyll a father, the worlde, so euyll a grandefather, the dyuell, can not chose but be euyll. Surely the fyrste heed of theyr auncester, was that deceytfull serpent the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, a monster monstrous aboue all monsters. I can not holly expresse hym, I wote not what to call hym, but a certayne thynge, all together made of the hatrede of god, of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truste in god, of lyenges, deceites, periuries, discordes, manslaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; to say, at one word, a thinge, concrete, heaped vp, and made of al kynde of myschiefe. But what the dyuell meane I, to go about to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criue particularly, the dyuels na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whan no reason, no power of mans mynde, can comprehende it. This alonly I can say grossely and as in a summe, of the whiche al we, our hurte is the more, haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

            <p>¶ Then this dyuelle beynge suche one, as canne neuer be vnlyke hym selfe, To of enuye, his welbeloued leminan, he begatte the worlde, and after left it with discorde at nours. Whiche worlde, after that it came to mans state, had of many concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, many sounes. He was so fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunde a father, and had gotten soo many chyldren of lady pride, dame glottony, maystres auarice, ladye lechery, and of dame subtilitie: that no we hard and scant, ye may finde any corner, any kynd of lyfe, where many of his chylderne be not.

Howe be it, they that be secular and lay men, are not by and by chyldren of the worlde, ne they chylderne of lyght, that are called spirituall, and of the clergie. Noo noo, as ye may fynde among the laitie, many chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light, so amonge the clergie (howe moche so euer we arrogate these holy tytles vnto vs, &amp; thynke them only attributed to vs, vos <hi>estis</hi>

In the clergy, the worlde also hath lerned a waye, to make of men spirituall, worlde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges, yea and there also to forme worldly children, wherewith great pretense of holynes, and crafty co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of religion, they vtterly desire to hyde and clooke the name of the worlde, as though they were asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of theyr father, whiche do exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate and deteste the worlde (beyng neuer the lesse theyr father) in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and outewarde sygnes, but in hart and worke, they colle and kysse hym, and in all theyr lyues declare them selfes to be his babes: in soo moche that in all worldly poyntes, they far passe and surmount those,
<pb facs="tcp:25926:13"/>
that they call seculars, lay men, men of the worlde. The chylde so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently foloweth the steppes of his father, neuer destitute of the ayde of his grandfather. These be our holy holy men, that say they ar deed to the worlde, whan no men be more lyuely in worldly thinges, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some of them be.

For I feare, leste in all orders of men, the better, I must saye, the greatter parte of them, be out of order, and chylderne of the worlde. Many of these myght seme ingrate and vnkynde chyldren, that woll no better aknowledge, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognyse theyr parentes in wordes and outwarde pretense, but abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and cast them of, as though

they hated them as doggis and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes. Howe be hit they, in this wise, are most gratefull to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, bycause they be moste lyke them, so lyuely representyng theym in countenaunce, and condytions, that their parentes seme in them to be yonge ageyne, for as moche as they euer say one, and thynke an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

The childerne of lyght haue <note place="margin">Chylderne of sightes polycie</note> policie, but it is lyke the polycie of

the serpent, and is ioyned with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uysshe symplicitie. They ingendre nothyng but simply, faythfully, and playnly, euen so doing all that they do. And therfor they may with more facilitie be combred in theyr ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dryng, and be the more redy, to take iniuries. But the chyldren of this worlde, haue worldly policie foxely crafte, lyonlyke crueltie, power to do hurte, more then eyther aspis or basiliscus, ingendrynge and doing al thynges, fraudulently, deceyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, gylefully.

The chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this worlde be lyke crafty hunters, they be misnamed children of lyghte, for as moche as they so hate lyghte, and so study to do, the workes of darknes. If they were the chyldren of lyght, they wold not loue darknes. It is no meruayle, that they go aboute to kepe other in darknes, seinge they be in darknes, from top to toe ouerwhelmed with darknes, darker tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the darknes of hell. Wherfore it is well done, in all orders of men, but in especiall in the order of prelates, to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene children of light, and chyldren of the world, bicause great deceyte aryseth in takynge the one for the other.

And yf any man resyste theym, euen with these weapons they procure to slee hym. Thus they boughte Christis deathe, the veray lyght it selfe: and obscured hym after his deth. Thus they bye euery daye the chyldren of lyght, and obscure them, and shall so do, vntyl the world be at an ende.

            <p>¶ Do ye se nothynge in our holy <note place="margin">Holydaye</note> dayes? of the which very fewe were made at the fyrste, and they to sette

Thus men serue the dyuell, for god is not thus serued, all be it ye saye, ye serue god. No, the

dyuell hath more seruice done vnto him on one holy day, than on many workynge dayes.

            <p>¶ What thynke ye of these images <note place="margin">Images.</note> that are had more than theyr felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes in reputation? that are goone

vnto, with suche labour and wery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the bodye, frequented with suche our coste, sought out and vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited with suche confidence? What say ye by these images, that are soo famous, so noble, soo noted, beinge of them so many and so dyuers in Englande? Doo you thynke, that this preferrynge of picture to pyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, image to image, is the righte vse, and not rather the abuse of y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages? But you woll saye to me, Why make ye all these interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?

Be not al thinges well doone, that are doone with good intente, whan they be profitable to vs? So surely Couetousnes bothe thinketh and speketh. Were it not better for vs, more for estimation, more meter
<pb facs="tcp:25926:24"/>
for men in our places, to cut awaye a piece of this oure profytte, if we wyll nat cutte awaye all, thanne to wynke at suche vngodlynesse, and so longe to winke for a lyttell lucre, specially if it be vngodlynesse, and also seme vnto you vngodlynes?</p>
            <p>These be two thinges, so oft to seke <note place="margin">Relikes of sayntes.</note> mere images, &amp; sometyme to visite the relikes of saintes. And yet as in those, there may be moche vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes committed, so there may here some superstition be hydde, if that sometime we cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to visite pigges bones, in stede of sayntes reliques, as in tyme past it hath chaunced) I had almoste sayde) in Englande.</p>
            <p>Than this is to great a blyndenes, a darkenesse to sensyble, that these shuld be so commended in sermons, of somme men, and preached, to be done after suche maner, as though
<pb facs="tcp:25926:25"/>
they coude not be euyll done, which not withstandynge are suche, that neyther god nor man commandeth them to be done. No rather, men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> manded them eyther not to be done at all, or ess more slowlyer and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domer to be done: for as moche as our auncetours made this consty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>we commaunde the priestes, that they oft admonysshe the people, and in especiall wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they make no vowes, but after longe deliberation, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of their husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and counsell of the prieste.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ The church of England in time past made this constitution. What sawe they, that made this decree? They sawe the intollerable abuses of images. They sawe the peryls, that myght ensue, of goinge on pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gremage. They sawe, the supersty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious difference that men made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
<pb facs="tcp:25926:25"/>
image and image. Surely somwhat they sawe.</p>
            <p>¶ The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitution is so made that in maner it taketh awaye all suche pylgremages. For it so plucketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye the abuse of them, that it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth eyther none, or els seldome vse of them. For they that restreyne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge vowes, for goynge of pyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gremage, restreyn also pilgremage. Seinge that for the moste parte, it is sene, that few go on pilgremage, but vowemakers, and suche as by promyse bynde them selfe to goo. And whan, I praye you shulde a mans wife go on pilgremage, if she went not, before she had well deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the matter with herself, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined the consent of her husbande, beinge a wyse man, and were also cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selled by a lerned priest so to do? Whan shuld she go farre of, to these
<pb facs="tcp:25926:26"/>
famous images? For this the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of Englande thynke to be goinge on pilgremage, to go to somme deed and notable image out of towne, that is to saye farre from theyr house.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe if your forefathers made this constitution, and yet thereby dydde nothynge, the abuses euery day more and more encreased, what is left for you to do? Brotherne and fathers, if lye pourpose to do any thynge, what shulde ye sooner do, than take vtterly awaye, these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytfull and iuglyng images: or els if ye knowe any other meane, to put awaye abuses, to shewe it, if ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to remoue abuses. Me thinke it shulde be gratefull and pleasant to you, to marke the ernest mynde of your forefathers, &amp; to loke vpon their desyre, where they say in their
<pb facs="tcp:25926:26"/>
constitution, <hi>we commaunde you,</hi> and not, <hi>we counsell you.</hi> Howe haue we ben so longe a colde, so longe slacke in settynge forth so holsome a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte of the churche of Englande, where we be so hote in all thynges, that haue any gaynes in them, all be it they be neyther commaunded vs, nor yet gyuen vs by counsell: as though we had leauer, the abuse of thynges shulde tary styll, than it taken awaye, lose our profyte.</p>
            <p>¶ To lette passe the solempne and nocturnal bacchanals, the prescript myracles, that are done vpon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne dayes in the Weste parte of Englande, who hath not harde, I thynke, ye haue harde, of sayncte Blesis harte, whiche is at Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, and of saynct Algars bones, how longe they deluded the people? I am afrayde, to the losse of many
<pb facs="tcp:25926:27"/>
sowles. Wherby men may wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, that all aboute in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme, there is plentie of suche iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge deceytes. And yet hytherto ye haue sought no remedy. But euyn styll the myserable people is suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to take the false myracles for the true, and to lye styll a stepe in all kynde of superstytion. God haue mercy vpon vs.</p>
            <p>¶ Laste of all, howe thynke you of <note place="margin">Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye.</note> matrimonie? Is all well here? What of baptisme? Shall we euermore in ministring of it, speke latine, and not englyshe rather, that the people may knowe what is sayd and done?</p>
            <p>¶ What thynke ye of these masse priestes, &amp; of the masses them selfe? <note place="margin">The abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Masse is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minisshed, but rather set forth.</note> What saye ye? Be all thynges here so without abuses, that nothynge ought to be amended? Your forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sawe somwhat, whiche made
<pb facs="tcp:25926:27"/>
this constitution, against the vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and sale of Masses, that vnder peine of suspending, no priest shuld sell his sayinge of trice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nals, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. what sawe they, that made this constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? What pristes sawe they? what maner of masses sawe they, trowe ye? But at the last, what became of soo good a constitution? God haue mercy vpon vs.</p>
            <p>¶ If there be nothing to be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded abrode, concernynge the holie, lette euery one of vs make one bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If there be neyther abrode nor at home any thinge to be amended, and redressed, My lordes, be ye of good chere, be mery: and at the least bycause we haue nothyng els to do, lette vs reason the mattier, how we may be rycher. Let vs fall to some pleasant communication: after let vs goo home, euen as good as we
<pb facs="tcp:25926:28"/>
came hyther, that is right begotten chyldren of the worlde, and vtterly worldlynges. And whyle we lyue here, let vs all make bon chere. For after this lyfe, there is smalle plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, lyttell myrthe for vs to hoope for, if nowe there be nothynge to be chaunged in our facions. Lette vs say, not as S. Peter dyd, Our ende <note place="margin">1. Petr. 4.</note> approcheth nighe, this is an heuye herynge: but let vs say, as the euill seruaunt sayde, It woll belong ere <note place="margin">Matt. 24.

Surely, as ofte as we do not take away the abuse of thynges, so ofte, we beate our felowes. As oft as we gyue not the people their true fode, so oft we beate our felowes. As oft as we let them dye in superstition, so ofte we beate them. To be short,
<pb facs="tcp:25926:28"/>
as ofte as we blynde, leade theym blynde, so oft we beate and greuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly stryke our felowes. Whanne we walter in plesures and idelnes, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we eate and drynke with drunkar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. But God wyll come, God wyl come, he woll not tarye long away. He woll come vpon suche a day, as we nothynge loke for hym: and at suche houre, as we knowe not. He woll come, and cutte vs in pyeces. He woll rewarde vs, as he doth the hypocrites. He woll sette vs, where wayling shalbe my brothern, where gnastyng of tethe shall be my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne. And let here be the ende of our tragedie, if ye woll. These be the delycate dysshes, prepared for worldes well be loued chyldren.</p>
            <p>These be the wafers and to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kettes, prouided for worldly prelates, <hi>way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge</hi> and <hi>gnasshynge</hi> of teethe. Can

there be any mirth, where these two courses, laste al the feaste? Here we lawghe, there we shall wepe. Our teeth make mery here, euer dashing in delicates, there we shall be torne with teeth, &amp; do nothing but gnashe and grynde our owne. To whatte ende haue we nowe excelled other in policie? What haue we broughte forth at the laste?</p>
            <p>Ye se brothern, what sorow, what punyshement is prouyded for you, yf ye be worldlynges. If ye wol not thus be vexed, be not ye the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne of the worlde.
