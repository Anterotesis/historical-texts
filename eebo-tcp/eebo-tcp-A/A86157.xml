         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

yet is pleaſed to give unto his poore creatures
the children of men a directory in his Word,
which reacheth to all the particular actings of
the Sons and daughters of men, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17.
Therefore Kingdomes and Armies are to be
regulated and ordered by it; and no other ſpecious pretence
muſt be intermingled with it; and this is Gods order upon
pain of damnation, <hi>Deutro. 4. v.</hi> 2, and 12. <hi>v. 32. Joſhua</hi> 1. 7.
<hi>Prov. 30 6. Revel.</hi> 22. 18. This God is the great Law-giver
which is not to give an account of any of his matters to any of
his creatures <hi>Job</hi> 33. 13. Yet although the great God hath taken
to himſelf this Prerogative of not giving an account of any
of his matters; either of his ſecret will, or of his revealed
will: yet in all Gods actings and doings in the World, he
himſelf doth nothing that is contrary to his own laws: for
God himſelf hath ſworn to keep his own laws, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.
15. and now although we are not to liken God to any thing,
or to equall the holy One, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 25. Yet God himſelf is
pleaſed to hold forth himſelf with the head Magiſtrate on
Earth, and that in theſe words: <hi>My Sonne feare thou the
Lord and the King, and meddle not with thoſe that are given
to change. Prov.</hi> 24. 21. and in the 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 17. This particular
place of Scripture is an exemplary to the King, and holdeth
forth unto us Gods unchangeableneſſe in his laws: Now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord is pleaſed to hold forth the Kings Prerogative by
his own example, as in theſe words: <hi>Where the word of a King
is there is power? And who ſhall ſay unto him, What doſt thou?</hi>
Here God is pleaſed by the ſcripture, to hold forth unto all
this heavenly pattern, which is exemplary to the earthly:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117087:3"/>
which is this, That the King, which is ſupream is not to give
an account to any man on earth of any of his matters; but to
God that is in heaven: for he onely is higher then the higheſt
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 8. and this Prerogative God hath taken to himſelf,
and left it in his word for our learning.</p>
            <p>Now all you that require to have it ſhewed by divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation,
and not by Court Maxims, nor by haire-looms
onely of the Conqueſt; of the abſolute Impunity of Kings
that they are not accountable to any on earth; and now that
theſe are not haire-loomes and therefore not ſo much in Law-bookes,
as in the word of God originally Old Teſtament and
New: and therefore his aſſumed priviledges are not begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

that God hath given the Parliament or you this power over
the King, that you aſſume; yet you ſay, God hath given it
page 48. but the truth is your propoſalls long a gone, and
this remonſtrance without any foundation upon the word or
light from it.</p>
            <p>This truth before ſpoken is held forth by ſeverall places of
Scripture <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 3. the words are theſe, <hi>Be not haſty to
goe out of the Kings ſight: ſtand not in an evill thing, for
he doth whatſoever pleaſeth him? he that reſiſteth the power,
reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and he that reſiſteth ſhall receive
to himſefe damnation. Rom.</hi> 13. 2. Now therefore the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iticall
and Carnall reaſon and prudentiall proviſion muſt
ceaſe; for this is not that wiſdome that dwelleth with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and findeth out knowledge of witty inventions <hi>Prov.</hi>
12. And further the Holy Ghoſt by the Preacher ſets forth
the power of a King by the way of an Allogory, and ſayth,
<hi>there be three things goeth well; yea four are comely in going,
a Lion which is ſtrongeſt among Beaſts, and turneth not away

and beware leaſt thou Incur the wrath of the Lion, of the

Father and Prince King <hi>Charles.</hi> For God himſelfe hath

that ſupremacy for ever and it ſhall be exalted <hi>Job.</hi> 36 7.
For ſayth <hi>the Lord, by me Kings Reign and Princes decree
Juſtice, by me Princes rule and Nobles, even all the Judges of
the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now no queſtion but Kings which are ſupreame have their
failings, and are men; yet although it be ſo God hath not any
where in his word put them over to any of their Inferiours
to be tryed by them, and as be foreſayd, who may ſay to the
King. what doſt thou? <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Further <hi>Eliſha</hi> convincing <hi>Job</hi> hath this expreſſion; <hi>Is it fit
to ſay to a King, thou art wicked? and to a Prince thou art
ungodly? Speak not againſt the King, no not in thy Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
for the Birds of the Ayre ſhall carry the voice, and that
which hath wings ſhall tell the matter: Ecl.</hi> 10. 26 Here we ſee
what care God hath taken for the preſervation of ſupremacy of
Kings; for indeed the ſupremacy of the 5 Commandment is the
foundation, and therefore God hath a tender care of his own
honour, and of the honour of his own Word, and of the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of Kings: and here is the double fountain from whence
all true and dew dutie doth proceed by divine deſignation;
<hi>Fear God and honour the King,</hi> and this is the whole dutie of
man; and this is the fountain from whence all ſupremacy doth
redound to arents and Maſters.</p>
            <p>Now where are thoſe pot-ſheards and ſeminary Prieſts, that
doth ſtill go on to contend with him that is mighter then they,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 6. 10 and theſe three ſcriptures before ſpecified 2. <hi>Pet.</hi>
17. <hi>Prov. 24. 21. Job.</hi> 34. 19. I ſay, that God in theſe ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
hold forth the King only with himſelf and no man elſe:
And further, there is a confirmation of it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 19. more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
the Prophet of the Earth is for all; the King himſelf is
ſerved by the field: here is none held forth with the King,
therefore he hath no equall.</p>
            <p>Now, who or where is this <hi>Goliah,</hi> or theſe <hi>Goliahs</hi> that
ſtand upon their ſwords <hi>Ezech. 33. 16. and hold out defence
againſt the Lord of Hoſt the God of Iſrael,</hi> in caſting off, and
trampling under their feet commandements of God; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117087:4"/>
this they ſay in their Remonſtrance, That they muſt minde the
Parliament of their Votes once paſt of making no more addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to the King; and of their own engagement to adhere to
the Parliament therein, and what they in their engagement
did ſummarily lay down, that which the Parliament took ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
therein; which was, that none of the extraordinary,
or arbitrary power, afore mentioned, may be exerciſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the people by any of Right; but by that ſuprem Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
or Repreſentative body of the People, nor without their
advice and conſent; Neither may any be impoſed upon, or
taken from the people; or if it be otherwiſe attempted by any,
that the people be not bound thereby but free, and the attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters
puniſhed. Now contrary to this Order, there was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimation
publiſhed with Drums and Trumpets without any
word from the ſupreme Parliament ſo called.</p>
            <p>Now here is a Lime-twig, and yet this ſnare is not broke,
and this is the independency that may properly be called, a
corrupt and outſide Religion; and of neceſſity it muſt be ſo,
when Reaſon is ſaid to be the teacher, <hi>pag.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>And now that it is ſaid, That the King was the Author of
this unjuſt war, and therefore guilty of the higheſt treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the higheſt law amongſt men; and therein guilty of all
the innocent blood ſpilt thereby; and of all the evill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
or concommitant thereunto? Now ſeeing this queſtion
is thus ſtated, it is deſired that every one would reflect, and
caſt an eye upon their own actings; and not judge partially,
for God would judge righteous Judgement, and render to
every one according to the fruits of their doings. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 17. 10</p>
            <p>And therefore to conſider a little the firſt beginning of our
troubles, after the ſecond Parliament was ſet and ſettled by
our King: If you pleaſe to call to minde what extraordinary
Petitions there was from the City and Country, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their grievances unto the Parliament, as making complaint
againſt the King of their heavy oppreſſures that they had laid
under, which were but as the weight of a little finger in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
what hath been along time together ſince.</p>
            <p>And that mens backs or rather eſtates have been broken in
peeces, and their hearts too almoſt at the ſad events: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the hand of God hath been ſore upon us in that we were
not content to have Chriſts Kingly Office held forth to us
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117087:4"/>
in theſe three Kingdomes by one Head, according to God
diſtinct order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21. And now inſtead of having one
Head to make up the Body with the Members compleat, wee
have had a prepoſterous Body without a Head; and what we
have now we know not, which are ſaid to hold forth the
ſupremacy of the Kingdome or People: which Title I finde
not in Holy-writ, belonging to the Members ſubordinate
to the Head: but indeed theſe Members have well reſembled
the Feet and Toes of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> image, which was
compoſed of Iron and Clay; and in regard of Coveteouſnes
and Self-ſeeking, are now in great danger to be broken in
pieces, becauſe they are not ſenſible of regaining their ſtrength
nor the danger that they hazard in being without it.</p>
            <p>And now at firſt beginning of our troubles, when there
were ſuch reſort to the Parliament, and the King ſo ſleighted,
for he was not at all then looked upon as a ſupreme Prince;
and by reaſon of the great concourſe of people which were at
Weſtminſter Petitioning, and Murmuring up and down; the
Parliament at laſt, commanded the Trained Bands to attend
them, and multitudes of the Citizens came with them, and
Courts of Guards were kept by Commiſſion of Parliament.
And ſtrange untruths were raiſed, as if the King would Sack
the City, and ſpeeches went up and down, that the King had
thouſands of men in yards ready armed to come in the night
to ſurpriſe the City; and falſe alarums there was given in the
night according to the falſe hoods that were raiſed: and the
brooding of theſe Egs hath brought forth Serpents and Coca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſes.
And the King being in a deplored condition, there were
gathered Gentlemen unto him, ſome of them having loſt their
Fortunes, as they did to <hi>David</hi> in his deplored condition,
and at length indeed, I think, the King had his Court of Guard
as well as the Parliament; then the Parliament came into the
City and ſat in Guild-hall.</p>
            <p>Now a litle before this the King had required five Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
out of the houſe, and againe he did it at <hi>Guild-Hall:</hi> and
ſome dayes after this, the Parliament was to returne to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
at their returne its Well knowne to the Citty and
Kingdome, what proviſion there was made for them, and
what rumours there were up and downe the Citty and
multitudes of the Citizens, and multitudes of the ſea men
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117087:5"/>
that were to lie with their murdering peices all over the
Theames, and it was ſo; and in theſe times of theſe rumours
and deſtractions, the King could not but be put into feare and
at laſt fled away: and after the King had acted his part, now
it may be called to mind that the Independant company in
the Parliament and elſewhere, and the Preſbyterians, all Sects
comprehended, I ſay theſe two parties hath plaid their parts
ſeverall yeares together, and in all this time, the Kingdome in a
very ſad condition; and God and his Lawes was not at all
looked after in a due and true manner, for diſobedience to
Parents and Maſters increaſed in abundant manner; and
now at this day it is come to a full height and ripeneſſe, the
reaſon is becauſe God ceaſed to govern, and carnall reaſon
prevailed and want of love (to do as we would be done unto)
ceaſed yet ſtill a ſaying, let the Lord be magnified <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 5. 8.
and making Covenants, calling God to witnes, now in all this
time many petitions were ſent to the King to deſire his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Parliament with many expreſſions in them, that it
would be a meanes to put an end to all the troubles in the
Kingdome, and that was a truth ſpoken, but not really intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as it doth appeare ſince; and at length he did returne, and
that the <hi>Scots</hi> can witneſſe, to his Parliament; what the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
were that paſſed betweene the two Kingdomes about
the King; it is knowne to them that made them, and God
alſo beſt knowes.</p>
            <p>Now further concerning ſome of the particular proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Parliament and Army, as the King required five
Members ſo did the Parliament impriſon ſome of the City
when they came to petition for there Lawes and Liberties,
and the Army they playd their parts, and demanded a 11
Memberes, and had them: and now the 2 part of the tune
ſounds abundantly higher. And what was the common
ſpeech when the King demanded 5 Members; that if he had
them he would by degrees take away all that ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
him and his party in their luſts? and muſt the Ceader
be pulled downe, and the Thiſtle ſet up? Now, ſeeing the
Parliament and Kingdome did not helpe themſelves in that
way that is warranted by the word of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21 15.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117087:5"/>
Which is to obey all that have the overſight of them; <hi>Heb.</hi>
13. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 17. We all underſtand there is a double

                  <hi>This ſcripture ſhould have been towards the beginning but it could not be found; and now God hath brought it</hi> The feare of a King is as the roaring of a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh him to anger ſinneth againſt his own ſoul. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 2, 3, &amp;c.

Active or Paſſive, as our Saviour and his Apoſtles did: now
God is pleaſed to diſcover the depths of that wickedneſſe
which was in the hearts of men, which they themſelves were
not aware of.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid, the reaſon why the Parliament denyed the King
in his demands, was, becauſe of the wicked counſell he had
about him, which put him on to ſatisfie their luſts; and indeed
there was wicked ones about him, which the Parliament by
the Army, was ſaid to ſeek to ſuppreſſe them: and it was their
ſaying, for many years together; and if their hearts had been
down right ſincere in that particular, God would have owned
their actions, ſo far forth as they were warrantable by his
Word and honoured them: for God hath commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the wicked from the King, and hath promiſed that his
Thron ſhall be eſtabliſhed; but not a word of touching the
Kings Perſon: but ſeeing it is deſired in your Remonſtrance
pag. 23. that the guilt and blame may be laid where its due;
Now God hath ſhewed unto you, that you are not to meddle
with the King, no not although he hath acted and done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the command of God and his own laws: yet God
will have you to know he hath not put him into any of your
hands, to paſſe your ſentence upon him, yet you ſay, with
hazard of your lives and fortunes, you ſhall cloſe unite and
joyn with the Parliament for the ſpeedy executing of Juſtice
upon the grand Incendiaries of our late and former troubles,
that the heads of the Authors go not down with peace to their
graves; and God hath given him clearly into the Parliaments
hand to doe Juſtice, you ſay; Whether it can be juſt before
God and good men not to do it? You deſire an anſwer from
God concerning the juſtnes of your Demands: and in the
2 <hi>Rom</hi> at the beginning, God gives you an anſwer with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
to your ſelves, who would take his work out of his hand
and in <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 22. Chriſt telleth the evil ſervant, <hi>that out
of his own mouth he ſhall be judged:</hi> But to proceed (to ſay
ſomething) out of the <hi>Rom. 2. Therefore thou art unexcuſable
O man, who ever thou art that judgeſt, for wherein thou judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf? for thou that judgeſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117087:6"/>
doſt the ſame things:</hi> and in the 2 verſ. <hi>But we are ſure the
judgement of God is according to truth, againſt them that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſuch things: and thinkeſt thou this ô man that judgeſt
them that doe ſuch things, and doſt the ſame; that thou ſhalt
eſcape the judgement of God, or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his
grace and long ſuffering?</hi> and will not yet look back and
know that you are fully out of the way and walk of God, as the
King of <hi>Aſſeriahs</hi> army was. Now I deſire the Lord to open
your eyes, that you may ſee your palpable blindnes, and that
you may finde out the ſteps and degrees of your ſins, ever ſince
you point blank broke the Command of God, and would not
disband at the Parliaments command: and you bolſter up
your ſelves in that particular, that God hath made you inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
to take away the wicked from the King; (and there
reſted) Now if God be pleaſed to afford that mercy unto you
(which I earneſtly deſire) as to give you repentance, if not,
look to your ſelves: for the earth growns (as I ſhall hereafter
ſhew you) and the heavens hath a long while mourned. I
pray you remember, what the wiſeman ſaith; there is a time
wherein one man ruleth over another for their own hurt, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi>
8. 9. But wickedneſſe ſhall not deliver thoſe that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
over to it.</p>
            <p>Now conſider your monſtrous Remonſtrance, which is like
to <hi>Rabſhekahs</hi> arrand, that he brought from his Maſter, but
not from God: and your Declarations, Proclamations, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi>
with trumpets; but no commiſſion from God, or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in all this: yet <hi>Zimery</hi> like, you attempt the killing of
your Maſter, and by violence have taken him into your own
cuſtody; but <hi>Zimry</hi> lived but ſeven dayes after he had kil'd
his Maſter, for the earth could not bear him: but <hi>Hazael</hi>
reigned certain years after his Maſter, and went on violently
to do the work of the Devill, and fill up the number of his ſins,
and ſhed much blood. Now conſider, if at any time ſince <hi>Saul</hi>
was made King, to the comming of our Saviour Chriſt, and
ever ſince; whether ever any Subject but (theſe three that
have been ſpecified) <hi>Zimry, Jehu,</hi> and <hi>Hazael,</hi> did attempt
the like: but <hi>Jehu</hi> had a ſpeciall command immediate from
God: but the ſcripture is full of counterdemands to your act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
But to the matter firſt of <hi>Saul,</hi> after he was made King,
we know he did exceedingly break the ſpeciall commands
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117087:6"/>
which were given him by the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> from Gods
own mouth: I have not time to expreſſe all the particulars,
how he ſlew eightie and odd of the Prieſts of the Lord, and did
obſerve his own will in the exerciſe of his government among
his people; as the Prophet before had told the people hee
would doe: yet for all this, when <hi>David</hi> who was anointed
to be King in his room after him, did but cut off the tip of the
skirt of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, God ſmote his heart for it, ſo ſaith
the Text; and <hi>Pharoah</hi> that did uſe the children of Iſrael ſo
hardly, yet they were not to doe any thing to contrary his
will; no not <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> not did <hi>Moſes</hi> carry the
children of Iſrael out of Aegypt without his leave: Nay, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
himſelf did ſo honour the ſupremacy of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> that he
held it an honour to be commanded by him; as in theſe words
of his: <hi>Glory over me, when ſhall I intreat for thee, and</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah
<hi>ſaid, to morrow.</hi> And we know <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and
<hi>Solomon</hi> was not without their failings: yet they were not
reproved by any of their own Subjects, not ſo much as by the
Prophets, but by ſpeciall command from God to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
and then their arrand was expreſſely given them from
God, every word what they ſhould ſay, and God hath left
the ſame word.</p>
            <p>And when our Saviour Chriſt was born and <hi>Horod</hi> made
King over the Jews by <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus,</hi> we read in holy
writ that many male children <hi>Herod</hi> ſlew thinking thereby to
deſtroy Chriſt; yet for all that blood he ſhed, God did not
take him away till the full time of his dayes were expired:
Nay, God cauſed <hi>Joſeph</hi> to carry his own ſonne Chriſt into
Aegypt till <hi>Herod</hi> was dead; for God hath ordained his word
from the beginning, and it ſhall continue firme and ſure; not
a title of it ſhall fall to the ground. And thus ſaith the Lord,
Children muſt obey their Parents in all things, and Servants
their Maſters according to the fleſh; yea, though they are
wicked, and doe beat them for well doing, they are not to turn
again, but to bear it patiently; and in ſo doing its thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to God. But Gods commandements are not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be obſerved in the publike ordinances, nor generally in
mens lives; like the Scribes and Phariſes taught children to
diſobey their Parents, and they thought to have taught Chriſt
too. For they came and asked him, why his diſciples did eat
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117087:7"/>
with unwaſhed hands? but Chriſt anſwered them by way
of a queſtion, why doe you tranſgreſſe the commandements
of God by your traditions? for God commanded ſaying, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thy father and thy mother:</hi> Hee that curſeth father or
mother let him dye the death (I would know of our Divines
whether the penalty of this command bee abrogated) the
Scribes and Phariſees would have had it ſo, and it is amongſt us
fully abrogated in the obedience of it; but Chriſt called the
Scribes and Phariſees hipocrites, and told them, in vain they
did worſhip him, teaching for doctrine the traditions of men,
which were their own wils, as it is at this day amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Now where are thoſe or <hi>Jeremiahs,</hi> to mourne and cry
out in regard of the pitifull complaints that are amongſt
us, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did; concerning the reproach that is
come upon them and upon their inheritances; for their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
were turned unto ſtrangers, and their houſes to aliens;
and now there is a beginning of like condition amongſt us: for
ſaith <hi>Ieremiah, Servants have ruled over us, and there was
none to deliver out of their hands: and theſe ſervants hang up
their Princes by their hands, and the faces of their Elders
were not honoured;</hi> Lament. 5. 1, 8, 12. If it be well obſerved
in this place of the Lamentations, that the breach of the fifth
Commandement was the chiefe ſinne that brought all that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
upon them: and the 22 of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> maketh it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
            <p>And the Holy-ghoſt by the Preacher further ſets forth the
practiſe of ſuch Servants as break their rancks, and caſt the
commandement of God behinde them; and ſaith, there is a
generation who teeth are as ſwords, and their jaw teeth as
knives to devoure the poore from off the earth, and the needy
from among men <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 21, 22, and the Preacher perſiſts
in his ſpeech, and goeth on, and ſaith; there be three things
for which the earth is diſquieted, and foure which it cannot
bear; two of them are, a Seavant when he reigneth, and a
fool when he is fil'd with meat.</p>
            <p>And now for the ſonnes of <hi>Corath,</hi> that are not contented
with their particular places and callings, and are not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to ſtudy their duties to God and man, and to doe violence
to none, and waight till God ſhall honour them, if he ſees it
good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:117087:7"/>
But with <hi>Corah, Numb.</hi> 16. they think themſelves fit to
hold forth (as publike Perſons) the Prieſtly office of Chriſt;
and they think themſelves fit for the Kingly office too: and
indeed, one ſinne goeth not alone; for ſinne is of that ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
nature, according to its tutor Satan, it will aime at the
top.</p>
            <p>But when things comes to this paſſe, that Servants gets the
government into their hands, the earth groans, as before ſaid,
in the Proverbs) and the heavens hath manifeſted it ever ſince
the King was taken from <hi>Holmby,</hi> and the ſouldiers drawing
near to the City (as we have already in briefe expreſt.) And
now all that hath eyes and will not ſee, and ears and will not
hear, take heed and remember that God cauſed the earth that
groans; and becauſe it could not longer bear, it ſwallowed
<hi>Corah</hi> and his Company; for he preſerveth not the life of the
wicked, but giveth right to the poore. <hi>Job</hi> 36. 6.</p>
            <p>And the delaying to keepe a good conſcience before God
and towards all men brought danger, and the Army breaking
their ranks took the King from <hi>Holmby,</hi> and becauſe there
was great and much reſort to him, and ſome ſecret intentions
withall, at length, he was put in feare of his life, whereby hee
might make his eſcape, and ſo be further remote; and after
he was fled to the <hi>Iſle of Wyght,</hi> there was no right way
thought upon to bring him back againe, but rather ſuch
wayes taken which were not lined out by Gods word, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath beene bleſſed by him. Yet a ſeeming to ſtand up
for the great God, by faſting and prayer, as people that
would be taught of him. But yet ſtill in all proceedings, the
actings, doings, looked ſquint-eyed, and quite contrary to
the rule; and this we know, a man in a journey if he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
and rides out of his way, the longer he goes out, the
more adoe he hath to come back againe, without he doth
come into the way he cannot get to his Journeyes end: this
earthly reſemblance holds forth a heavenly to us: But to
goe on,</p>
            <p>Then there was an act of Indemnity deſired by the Army
to be procured by the Parliament, and a ſeeming falling out
betweene them there grew; whereupon the Parliament
commanded the Army to keep thirty miles from the Citty,
and at length to draw into ſeverall Regiments and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117087:8"/>
but the Army diſobeyed the Parliaments command
as well as the Prince and Duke; and marched neerer and
neerer to the Citty, and upon the ſudden the Malitia muſt be
altered, which was appointed by the common counſell of the
Citty and confirmed by order of Parliament. And after this
leading Card the Citty began to be touch to the quick, in
regard of the loſſe of their Charter, they indirectly made a
combuſtion, the Army being upon their march there muſt
be no denyall, but the Tower muſt be ſurrendered to them;
and it was concluded thar they ſhould come through the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And at the very time, yea the inſtant of time although
it was a very faire ſun-ſhiny day the Heavens all about the
Citty gather blackneſſe, and preſently there was ſuch a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſtorme of Haile, Thunder and Raine; and all of it in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Citty, and foure miles of there was none, but very
cleare weather: But this Thunder of Haile did hold forth
that height of Gods diſpleaſure againſt the Armies diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Parliament; in Gods account diſobedience is a
greater neglect then ſacrifice, becauſe it is abſolutely the
breach of Gods commandment: and <hi>Samuel</hi> told <hi>Saul</hi> that
Rebellion is as the ſinne of Witch-craft, and Stubbornneſſe is
as the Iniquity.</p>
            <p>But to proceed they did come, march through the Citty
which was of a Satterday, and the ſecond part being againe
played upon the ſame tune but higher: they came in and about
the Citty this Saterday <hi>December</hi> the 3 alſo in the afternoone,
and in ſtead of preparing for the Lords day; put the Citty
<hi>Suſan</hi> in a diſtraction and perplexity, and they in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs
running out of their houſes and a great deale a doe to
provide for the Souldiers almoſt all that night.</p>
            <p>Whether they took the King away without any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from the Parliament on Satterday night or Sabbath day I
know not, but this I know the Lords day was a wonderfull
dark day as ever I ſaw; and if it be but called to minde the
unreaſonableneſſe of the weather that hath bin ever ſince the
King was taken from <hi>Holmby:</hi> and God hath held out by this
Summer unto us the ſtrange and prepoſterous government
that is amongſt us.</p>
            <p>And now in regard there hath been aboundant of unjuſt
doings in the Kingdome; coveting, and not onely coveting
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117087:8"/>
their neighbours goods, but actually the taking away of them;
multitudes have ſuffered, both they and their poſterities are
like to ſuffer hereby; and the greateſt part of the treaſure of
the Kingdom gathered into ſuch laps: but for this particular,
here what God ſayes, Alſo I ſhook my lap, and ſaid, ſo God
ſhake out every man from his houſe and from his labour, that
performeth not his promiſe, even thus be he ſhaken out <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah.</hi>
5. 13. and the generall ſpeech to cover unjuſt procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that title of Malignant was the cloak, and all that held of
the Kings ſide were to have their goods confiſcated for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>And now I pray conſider, who hath kept or broken the
commandement of the great God of heaven and hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it: but when the Lord hath taken the King out of your
hands (as he will certainly doe) and ſet him upon his Thron
too.</p>
            <p>And when it ſhall appeare that God doth tranſlate the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
of thoſe that withſtand the King to the King, then it
will plainly be ſeen, or appear, that the Lord was highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
at the ſtanding out againſt the King. Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and example was, To give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that
are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and unto God the things that are Gods: and had
it been ſo, the bleſſing of God had been upon us at our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out and at our comming in; and we had had our peace in
our borders: but we have been an empty Vine, and we have
brought forth fruit to our ſelves, according to the complaint
of God to the children of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the Covenant that was made to ſtand for
the Truth, the true and pure Religion, and to preſerve the
Kings Perſon; and herein God hath performed his Covenam
in preſerving the ſupremacy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8, yea and hath preſerved
the Perſon of the King too.</p>
            <p>But in their Remonſtrance, there is a diſpenſation given for
it of that ſufficiency, to free thoſe that doe make a Covenant to
maintain true and pure Religion, which is to keep themſelves
unſpotted in this world, and to preſerve ſuch or ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
and becauſe after they have made the Covenant, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perſon will not at their command enter into it at all:
though they themſelves are not in ſuch a capacity to demand
ſuch a thing at his hand; and becauſe he refuſed it and will
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117087:9"/>
not take it: it is ſaid, that this tye which they voluntarily
bound themſelves in, and called God to witneſſe to it, may be
broken by man.</p>
            <p>But now ſeeing there hath been abſolution given, but not
from God to Covenant breakers: heare therefore what the
Lord ſaith, <hi>Zecha.</hi> 8. 16, 17. Theſe are the things that ye ſhall
doe, ſpeak yee every man the truth to his neighbour, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the judgement of truth and peace in your gates, and let
none of you imagine evil in your hearts againſt his neighbour,
and love no falſe oath; for all theſe are things that I hate,
ſaith the Lord: and further, hear what the Holy Ghoſt ſaies
by the Prophet <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 5. and I will come near to you in to
judgement, and I will be a ſwift witneſſe againſt the ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and againſt the adulterers, and againſt falſe ſwearers, and
againſt thoſe that oppreſſe the hyreling in his wages, the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
and the fatherleſſe; and that turn a ſide the ſtranger
from his right, and feare not me ſaith the Lord of Hoſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
119. 104. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome object and ſay, that our Kings are not ſo
conſtituted, nor our laws ſo as they were in the times of the
Kings of Iſrael? and this objection hath cauſed many through
ignorance to ſtumble: and whether the Moral law be not of
the ſame uſe to us now under the goſpel, as it was unto the
Jews under the Ceremonial law? and whether there be not
the ſame penalty by Gods ordination to be executed upon the
tranſgreſſours, as was heretofore? and whether every one ſhal
not give an account of all his actions to God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 11, 12
<hi>Iſai.</hi> 45. 23. Saint <hi>James</hi> will tell you they are, <hi>Iames</hi> 2 12.
So to be judged every one according to the fruit of his doings,
<hi>Ierem. 17. 10. Iohn</hi> 12. 48.</p>
            <p>Now here is a further word of the Lord, that doth put
bounds to all that hath or ſhal be ſpoke, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 21. As for me,
this is my Covenant, ſaith the Lord my ſpirit, that is upon thee,
and my words which I have put in thy mouth ſhall not depart
out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of
mouth of thy ſeed ſeeds, ſaith the Lord of hoſt, from hence
forth even for ever.</p>
            <p>I have not taken example by your Remonſtrance to lay
blood at any of your doors, no not the blood that hath
been ſhed ſince you tooke the King from <hi>Holmby;</hi> and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117087:9"/>
that at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> you remember, and that in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> For I
deſire to be acquainted with the Laws and Word of God, for
the laws of the land I doe not ſo well know them, but I know
the purſuer of blood will purſue the guilty perſon in time,
<hi>Dutro.</hi> 19. 6. and now a little further concerning the
lawes of God, which ought to be the higheſt law to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
amongſt men; and it is this, <hi>Ezera 7, 27. And whoſoever
will not doe the law of God, and the law of the King, let judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be executed ſpeedily upon him, whether it be unto death
or baniſhment, or to confiſcation of goods, or impriſonment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now that you all are out of Gods wayes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
go on further, but come quite back again, and put your
ſelves into the right way ſpeedily: and if you doe not beware
of the immediate wrath of the great God, that bids you lay
down your temporall ſword, leaſt God cauſe you to turn it
one upon another; for you have no cauſe to hold it forth in
this manner. And for thoſe that you call malignants, there is
no queſtion, but they may prove as honeſt men as your ſelves,
(through the power of God) and go you every one to his own
field and vinyard, (if you have any) and take pains to earn your
own bread, for the commandement of God is, that they that
will not work ſhould not eat.</p>
            <p>And now that you have made your Will, and ſet forth your
<hi>Magna Carta,</hi> which is to kill your Lord and King, that his
inheritance may be yours (and you have diſpoſed of it already)
and this you ſay, that it will give the moſt authentique Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and Seal that ever was: to doe it you have moulded the
Parliament to your modle.</p>
            <p>And now that you dare break the commandement of Chriſt
and teach men ſo to doe <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 25. remember what Chriſt
ſaith, they ſhall be leaſt in the Kingdome of heaven.</p>
            <p>And now a word to all ſuperiours and inferiours, And firſt
to all governours that they ſhould be informed themſelves
from the Word, what is amiſſe in their own particulars, and
ſeek unto God to teach them, and reform themſelves; and
then they are fit to inform and reform others: and this muſt
ſpeedily be done; from the higheſt to the loweſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
that ſo all Families, Cities, Towns, Pariſhes may be
brought into an orderly frame, and every one to be informed
of his duty in his particular place; and this muſt be the ſtudy
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117087:10"/>
of all: and remember that Chriſt hath ſaid, he will come in
an houre when people are not aware of him. And we ſee that
God is exceedingly diſpleaſed with theſe Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>And now behold (<hi>Eſai.</hi> 59. 1.) the Lords hand is not ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that it cannot ſave, neither his eare heavy that it cannot
hear; and further, hearken what God ſayes in the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in verſe 14, and judgement is turned away backward, and
juſtice ſtandeth afar off; for truth is faln in the ſtreets, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
cannot enter: for behold, what Sabboaths we have
kept with thoſe that would indent with God to have a new
heart for others, and go on themſelves in that old old capital
ſinne of diſobedience: and in the 15. Yea truth faileth, and he
that departeth from evil maketh himſelf a prey, and the Lord
ſaw it, and it diſpleaſed him that there was no judgement. 16.
<hi>verſe</hi> And he ſaw that there was no man, and wondered that
there was no interceſſor, therefore his arme brought ſalvation
to him, and his right hand it ſuſtained him. And now if you
deſire to be at peace with God and all men; I beſeech you
all, Parliament and Army, bring your ſelves and actions,
to the rule, and agree with God which is your adverſary, now
while you may.</p>
            <p>And now for Indemnity, ſo far forth as Gods word would
give it you, no queſtion but you ſhall have it, if you prove
your ſelves worthy perſons; if not, your foot ſhall ſlide in
due time. <hi>Deutro.</hi> 32. 35.</p>
            <p>And now for thoſe that are ſet in authority, according to
the laws of God and of the land; let them ſpeedily take King
<hi>Artaxarexes</hi> counſel and learn the laws of God, <hi>Ezera</hi> 7.
25. and take the Prophet <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> counſel to the law and to the
Teſtimony, whoſoever doth not according to it, its becauſe
there is no light in them: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19 10. deale couragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an the Lord ſhall be with you: but you muſt not turn
neither to the right hand, nor to the left. <hi>Deutro,</hi> 17. 11. and
much in this chapter: and remember that the eyes of the Lord
are upon the wayes of man; and he perceiveth all his goings,
and the iniquity of the wicked, if he turn not away from it,
ſhall ſlay them. <hi>Prov. 5. 21. Iſai.</hi> 55. 7.</p>
            <p>And now that there are, and hath been long this many
years, and a company in ſhipskins, that doth ſeek to deceive
the hearts of the ſimple and honeſt party; and theſe and ſome
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117087:10"/>
colourable to ſet up Chriſts Kingdome: But indeed their aim
is to ſet up Antichriſts Kingdome; and a party they are who
heretofore in the Queens time, and a party of thoſe hath been
all along in the Parliament and the Army, and up and down in
the Kingdome brooding, and he that they call <hi>Dell</hi> in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is one of them he baptized Major <hi>Cowels</hi> childe without
the Element of water; and that holds forth, that he is one
of Antichriſts Seminaries: and yet it is well that there is a
ſeveration now in the Parliament, and I would it were ſo
in the Army to: leaſt the juſtice of God break out upon the
good with the bad; and this party their deſigns all along hath
been ſquint-eyed: and it may be called to minde, that it was
ſaid there was a great plot found out, juſt before the Army
came into the City the firſt time.</p>
            <p>And indeed that plot was to make that party ſtrong in the
Parliament by the Army, that ſo they may bring their luſtfull
deſires about. And now when Remonſtrance came forth
it was noiſed about, that the Parliament and the King were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed;
and whileſt, they took the King and poſſeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of <hi>White-hall,</hi> and of the City; and now the pretence is,
that the Army is come into the City becauſe of the backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of their paying: and the Army want their Arrears. But
the aboundant of money that hath been gathered in all theſe
times, both in the Countryes and City for the Army, and no
account given that ever any of it was paid; for the Souldiers
reports they have had but a little in compariſon of what hath
been gathered. And indeed the Army aboundant of them are
kept like Vaſſels: and their pay kept from them becauſe there
ſhould be ſome colourable pretence for the indirect courſes,
that hath been long a foot: and upon this colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
treaſure is ceazed upon, and much more their Demands
holds forth, of taking by force out of mens houſes, if they may
not have their wils.</p>
            <p>And this they hold forth now, (and it is their own words)
and if it ſeem ſtrange unto you, it is no leſſe then that our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have been ordered to doe by the Parliament in ſeverall
Counties of the Kingdome: and becauſe there was order
from the Parliament, in the ſeverall Counties heretofore, they
make that of ſufficiency to cary forth all their prepoſterous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
now: but no order now (for all theſe actings) but from
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117087:11"/>
               <hi>White-hall</hi> ſince their Remonſtrance came forth, for all this
is acted and done: and who but a King, Cals and Sets the
Parliament, and who but a King can ſet a period unto it. And
indeed this is not to doe now as doth appeare: but take heed
fellow ſouldiers, covet not that that is none of your own, but
for your pay, which is fit you ſhould have. There are ſome
will ſhake their laps, and pay you ſuddenly, yea repay to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if they doe not leave your cauſe to him that is higher then
the higheſt; and the Lord will be with the good.</p>
            <p>And remember the civill war that was between <hi>Iſrael</hi> and
<hi>Benjamin,</hi> and how that <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell twiſe before <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
and how that 40000. men were ſlain, and yet not with ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the third time <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevailed and ſubdued <hi>Benjamin</hi> and
ſo it will be now: and the Lord that hath choſen <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
will rebuke you, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p>And now if you will yet be Vaſſels, I ſpeak to the good
party (disband immediately) for God himſelf will end the
war: And there is a party will be brought down wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
and I feare, that ſome will hardly die the common
death of all men: and now let us wait to ſee the ſalvation of
God, farewell fellow Souldier, God hath warned the twiſe by
me, and too much writing is a weariſomnes to the brain:
Fear God and keep his commandements, for this is the whol
dutie of man: For God will bring the work to judgement
with every ſecret thought whether it be good or evill.</p>
            <p>You were told long agone that you were turned into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
way; alſo, you were told, who was the Perſon in
chiefe that God hath ſet to govern: you will ſee it ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
you that are ſo haſty to try your brethren that break your
commands, and forget God, take heed, he is comming to
tear you in pieces, and who ſhall deliver you, Chriſt will not
own your cauſe: and the latter end of the 50. Pſalme. But
you ſay, that you obſerve providence, and that and your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
are the teachers; but ſeeing it is ſo that you have left
the two Teſtiments, your great fabrick will fall, read the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
for all things comes alike to all. I refer you to three
chapters in ſpeciall <hi>Proverb.</hi> 26. and <hi>Iſai. 57. Rom.</hi> 2. and I
will ſing the 46. <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
