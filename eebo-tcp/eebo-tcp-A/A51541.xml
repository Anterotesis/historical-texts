            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This sort of Learning has sufficiently justifi'd its Excellency, both from the Certainty of its Principles, and Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of its Practise, to all Ingenious Men.</p>
            <p>Nor had the number of its Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries been so few as they are, had not the difficulty of the Terms (some <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,</hi> most <hi>Greek,</hi> and divers of them <hi>Latine,</hi> according as they have
<pb facs="tcp:44995:5"/>
been derived to us from the most Learned of those respective Nations, in several Ages) deterr'd many of great Natural Parts from wading in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its Mysteries, or at least clowded its ravishing Beauties from their Eyes.</p>
            <p>To remedy this, and at once promote such Praise-worthy and advantagious Arts, and serve the young Students therein, I have taken the pains to Collect and Explain the Hard Words, Difficult Terms, and Abstruse Phrases used by Authors, in all the several Mathematical Sciences, and Branches depending thereupon; than which, nothing has hitherto more discouraged hopeful <hi>Tyro's</hi> from Proficiency.</p>
            <p>But here is offered them a Key, that will open to them the choicest Treasures of <hi>Urania,</hi> and her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary Handmaids: Nay, We have taken care to demonstrate the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Things, as well as genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44995:6"/>A main thing which induced me to this Undertaking, was from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, how much such a Work was wanting: For about thirty years ago, when I first began to apply my self to Mathematical Learning, I found my self not a little perplex'd with the difficult Terms used by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and therefore then began to Collect such hard Words as I met with, that I might either by my Reading, or Enquiry of some of my Mathematical Acquaintance, learn to know the meaning of them. Thus have I ever since been storing up Words and their Interpretations, with <hi>Memorandums</hi> in what Book and Folio I might find their Definitions or Explanations, against I should be ready to digest them into an Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betical Method; which at last (though long first) I did, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then speedily to have finished this Book. But finding my self encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb facs="tcp:44995:6"/>
in many other Concerns, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the Task would be too tedious for me to run through alone, and therefore desired the assistance of my good Friend, Mr. <hi>H. C.</hi> by whose pains it is at last arrived to what you see.</p>
            <p>It is true, that since this was, as aforesaid, Collected, I did light on <hi>Vitalis,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Author, Printed in Latin; and by comparing my Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and his Book, I found I had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered more Words <hi>purely Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> than he had done: But he hath indeed inserted the Names of most Stars, and upon them made somewhat long Discourses; which, before I saw his Book, I had also Collected: But upon consideration, that it would make this Book swell beyond its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Size, and that they would prove of small vse to <hi>English</hi> Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, I left them out.</p>
            <p>Having given thee this Account,
<pb facs="tcp:44995:7"/>
it onely remains to advertize thee a word or two for thy better apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the scope of the Book.</p>
            <p>First, Consider, 'Tis intended for Beginners, not Accomplish'd Artists, therefore adapted to the meanest Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities; preferring sometimes a Plain, Familiar, and Intelligible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, before a Rigid, Abstruse (though Exact) Definition: Nay, rather (though rarely) venturing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Repetition, than running the hazard of not being understood.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Observe, We have in most places hinted the Derivation of the Word, which both assists the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and informs the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: yet have put the <hi>Greek</hi> words in <hi>English</hi> Characters; for those that understand <hi>Greek</hi> know them well enough now; but those that do not, could not perhaps have read them otherwise, so much as to have perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any Analogy between them and
<pb facs="tcp:44995:7"/>
the Words, we say owe their Original to them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Letter <hi>G.</hi> or sometimes <hi>Gr.</hi> shows the Word Originally <hi>Greek;</hi> and <hi>L.</hi> or <hi>Lat. Latin.</hi> And what is included between these two [] Crot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets, is the natural, strict, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Signification of the Word; what follows is the Mathematical acception: and in that where I have been forc'd to use any hard Word, I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd it by another Synonymous (of the same signification) in a Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis immediately following.</p>

But neither this way, nor that other called the <hi>Trutine of Hermes,</hi> is so much to be approved as the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Rectifying by <hi>Accidents;</hi> but are chiefly used in Childrens Nativities, calculated before Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents have happen'd.</p>

                  <p>From the Lat. <hi>Aspicio,</hi> to behold: is a correspondence or familiarity of two Planets mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually beholding each other with some Ray har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monically consider'd; or when they are posited at such a certain distance in the Zodiack wherein they mutually help or afflict one another; or have their vertues encreased or depraved: For by good Aspect they assist, but in evil they are said to hurt each other. Of these Aspects properly there are but 4., <hi>viz. Sextile, Quartile, Trine,</hi> and <hi>Opposition;</hi> to which is added a <hi>Conjunction,</hi> though improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called an Aspect. <hi>Kepler</hi> defines an Aspect thus; that it is <hi>an Angle formed on the earth, by the luminous Rays of two Planets, efficacious to the stirring up of Nature; for when two Planets are joyned with, or beheld of each other, they seminate something in sublunary Bodies according to their own nature.</hi> See the Appendix.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44995:27"/>
but the truth is, the reason of those Conflicts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Nature and the Disease, is the Moons coming to the Quadratures, Opposition, or Radical place, where she was at the beginning of the sickness; and one of these generally happens about the 7th day; but as the Moon is swifter, or slower in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it often comes sooner or later. Therefore the discreet Physitian ought to consult <hi>Ephemerides,</hi> without which they cannot give any true or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Account of their observing these Critical days: For the better doing it, they should Erect a Scheme with 16 Houses; the form whereof you have in Mr. <hi>Culpeper's Semiotica Uranica.</hi>

By the Declination of a Star, we know the Quantity of its Diurnal and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal Arch, its Elevation above the Horizon, Distance from the Zenith, Circle of Position, and the like. Of great use in Astronomy.</p>

But between an Eclipse of the Sun, and of the Moon, there are several differences. 1. In the Lunar Eclipse, she really loses her Light, and is obscured, by wanting the Illumination of the Sun; but in the Solar, he loses not his Light, but onely we are deprived of it. So that to speak properly, we should call it an Eclipse of the Earth, rather than of the Sun. 2. As the Moons Eclipse is Real, so 'tis Universal, and appears always in the same Quantity on every Superficies of the Earth, where 'tis visible; but the Suns Eclipse is not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, but varied greater, lesser, or not at all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diversity of the several Climates.

But because every Orb or Heaven contains within it self like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise other Orbs; as for example, the Orb of the Sun contains three other several Orbs, of which, two are Excentrick after a certain sort, and the third simply so: Therefore for avoiding confusion of words, use has obtain'd, that now the Heavens themselves should not be called <hi>Orbs,</hi> but <hi>Spheres;</hi> and thus the greatest Sphere is the <hi>Primum Mobile;</hi> next the Sphere of the Fixed Stars, after that of <hi>Saturn,</hi> then of <hi>Jupiter, &amp;c.</hi> to that of the <hi>Moon,</hi> the lowest and least of all, as well in circuit as thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the compass of her Concave being 758250 miles; the thickness, that is, the space contained between her Concave and Convex 109056 miles; the compass of her Convex, which is the same

                  <p>A Greek word, signifying a Change or Variation, but used in Astronomy for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation or Error of the Sight, occasion'd by the distance of the Term of the visual Line, proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Superficies of the Earth to a Star, or other <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> in Heaven, from the Term of another Line projected from the Centre of the Earth to the Body of the same Star, in the place where he truly is: For when we behold the Stars from the Earths Superficies, which is almost 3035 miles from its Centre, it must needs follow, that the place designed, by a Right Line from the Centre of the Earth, would be different from what we now make, so that the Star would seem to be quite otherwise situate. This variation or diversity of Aspect is called the <hi>Parallax,</hi> which is greater or lesser, according to the greater or lesser nearness
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44995:60"/>
that the Star has to the Earth. Besides, it has place, in a Ray obliquely cast, or when a Star, not being Vertical, projects his Beams, as it were, on one side, and so to the Centre and Superficies of the Earth: For when 'tis Vertical, casting its Beams directly to the Superficies, it must needs pass by the Centre which is just under, and so suffer no Parallax: Therefore the further they are from the Zenith, and nearer the Horizon, so much the greater is their Parallax; which on the contrary is proportionably decreased, as they more and more approach the Vertix.</p>

To know when this Aspect happens, you must know the quantity of each Planets Orb; and add them together, and take one half thereof, and if your Planets be within so many Degrees of a Partile Aspect, then they are in Platick Aspect one with another; the quantity allowed to each Planet for its Orb, before or after any Aspect, is as follows.</p>

                  <p>But since these Poles are onely Points conceived in the Heavens, therefore that the Artick Pole of

the World may be known, we must imagine a Right Line from the Pole-star to another next it in the Tail of the Little Bear; on which Line, make an Equilateral Triangle towards the Head of the Great Bear, at the top of which Triangle is the <hi>true place</hi> of the Pole. But this labour will be saved in the next Age, for then the Pole-Star, that has 88 Deg. Declination, will have 90, and so fall directly on the Pole.</p>

Proportion,</label>

                  <p>[called in Greek <hi>Analogy,</hi> and sometimes after the Latines, <hi>Proportionalitas</hi>] <hi>Is a similitude or likeness of two or more reasons between themselves.</hi> This is the Basis on which the whole Structure of Geometry is founded, and the scope to which all its Precepts tend. But because Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is two-fold, Continu'd and Disjoyn'd, hence arises a <hi>Two-fold Proportion, Geometrical,</hi> and <hi>Arithmetical;</hi> the first is regarded in <hi>Continued Quantity,</hi> the second in <hi>Numbers,</hi> comparing one with another, and thereby coming to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of others before unknown; yet both are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Numbers, and retaining each his own name, extends it self to consider the others Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, according to the divers reason of Proportions, and habitude of one thing to another; applying afterwards to Continued Quantity what was made out by <hi>Quantity Discrete:</hi> And on the contrary, feigning in Numbers all the Passions of Continued Quantity, that what in one is conspicuous, may be made appear so in the other, by the same reason of Habitude. Thus in <hi>Quantity Discrete,</hi> 'tis as easie as in <hi>Continued,</hi> to assign a Whole and Parts, Indivisible Points, which are Units, composing the same Discrete Quantity, Numbers, Plain, Solid, Square, and all other sorts of Figures. The <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical Proportion</hi> therefore is, when three or more Numbers proceed with the same difference, as 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, &amp;c. each Number exceeding that which goes before by the Number Three. But the <hi>Geometrical Proportion</hi> is, when three or more Numbers have the same Reason, as 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, &amp;c. where every Number bears the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to that which precedes, or <hi>Triple Reason,</hi> containing three times as much.</p>

                  <p>But in Astronomy 'tis taken more specially for the whole Frame or Machine of the World, being of a Spherical Figure: but most strictly, for the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> embracing all the other Orbs and Celestial Bodies, which, in the space of one Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Day, is volv'd and carri'd round on the Poles of the World about the Earth, according to <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy;</hi> and which by reason of its different habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or respect of the parts of the Earth to its Poles, is said to be either Right or Oblique.</p>
                  <p>A Right or Direct Sphere hath both the Poles of the World in the Horizon, &amp; the Equinoctial transiting the Zenith; so that all the Circles parallel to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator make Right Angles with the Horizon, and by it are divided into two equal parts, the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> being always 12 hours above, and 12 hours below the Horizon; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Days and Nights always just 12 hours long: and is called <hi>Right,</hi> because all the Celestial Bodies, by the Diurnal motion of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Mobile</hi> Ascend directly above, and Descend directly below the Horizon As at the Isle of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> and other places under the Equator.

                  <p>From this division of the Sphere arises the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Ascensions, to wit, of the Degrees of the Equator, and parts answering thereunto, thence denominated <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Oblique.</hi> For in a Right Sphere, all the Ascensions are Right; but in an Oblique Sphere, Oblique.</p>

                  <p>A Greek word whereby is intended the general Constitution, Fabrick and Harmony of the Universe, or an orderly Representation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, according to some noted Hypothesis, wherein the Celestial Bodies are so disposed amonst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and in respect of the Earth; as their Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Order, Motions and Passions, may in such an Authors opinion best answer Appearances and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Demonstrations; To this purpose the Ancients agreed, that the Globe of the Earth and Sea should be the Centre of the World, about which was diffused the Air, and round that the more light Element of Fire; Then the Orb of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and so <hi>Mercury, Venus, Sol, Mars, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> in order, all respecting the Earth as their Centre; After which they placed the Firmament or Orb of the fixed Stars, and last of all the <hi>Primum Mobile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But of late, <hi>Copernicus,</hi> (a most ingenious Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer) the better to Solve the appearances Invented, or rather revived, (for it was many ages before Started by some old Philosophers, but now buried
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44995:85"/>
and forgot) he, I say, revived another Hypothesis, which Constitutes the <hi>Sun</hi> Immoveable in the Centre of the World, next the Orb of <hi>Mercury,</hi> then <hi>Venus,</hi> in the third place the Globe of Earth, with the <hi>Moon</hi> continually moving about it, to which Globe of Earth, he assigns a threefold Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Diurnal,</hi> in 24 hours from West to East, which was before attributed to the <hi>Primum Mobile, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual,</hi> which the <hi>Sun</hi> antiently challeng'd, and a third of <hi>Libration,</hi> whereby he solvd the Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Equinoxes, and obliquation of the Ecliptick from the Equater, for the <hi>5th.</hi> Planet he places <hi>Mars,</hi> then <hi>Jupiter,</hi> then <hi>Saturn,</hi> and last of all the Sphear of fixed Stars,</p>
                  <p>Since this, the Noble <hi>Tytho Brahe</hi> proposed his Hypothesis, making the Earth the Centre of both the Luminaries, and the Orb of fixed Stars, but the <hi>Sun</hi> the Centre of the othet four Planets; whom he counts all Eccentrick to the Earth, and constantly moving in the fluid Ether about the <hi>Sun, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All these Systemes have found their Disciples, and Propugnators: if any have a mind to be better Instructed in all or any of them, there are Sphears extant fitted for every of them, and shewing all the Motions and Affections of the Celestial Bodies truly, according to the intention of each Hypothesis.</p>
