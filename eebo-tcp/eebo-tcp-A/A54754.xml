         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Perfection of knowledge the one, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers't
in swinish sloth and ignorance the
other; I am apt to wonder how it could
possibly be imagin'd that the same rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Soul should inform alike, as we
are oblig'd to beleive by the authority of
Sacred Scriptures, and the Doctrine of the
Souls Immortality, the whole masse &amp; frame
of Human Nature, and not rather that
there should be a gradation of Notion from
the lowest brute up to the Angelic Region:
But that calling to mind the common maxim
of Philosophy, that the perfection of Soul is
the same in the Infant, as in the ripe of
age, only acting more or less vigorously, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the capacity of the Organs; I thence
collect that there is also a different capacity
of the Organs, whence ariseth a different
Spirit and Constitution, or some interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cause, by which it either acts or lies dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant
even in Persons of the same age: the
first is that <hi>Melior Natura,</hi> which the Poet
speaks of, with which whoever is amply
indued, take that Man from his Infancy,
throw him into the Deserts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> there
let him converse some years with Tygers
and Leopards, and at last bring him where
civil society &amp; conversation abides, and ye
<pb facs="tcp:58787:2"/>
shall see how on a sudden, the scales and
dross of his barbarity purging off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
he will start up a Prince or Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator,
or some such Illustrious Person; the
other is that noble thing call'd <hi>Education,</hi>
this is that Harp of <hi>Orphe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Amphion,</hi> so elegantly figur'd by the
Poets to have wrought such Miracles among
irrational and insensible Creatures, which
raiseth beauty even out of deformity, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and regularity, out of Chaos and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion;
and which if throughly and rightly

through the 4 quarters) commonly call'd
<pb facs="tcp:58787:3"/>
to <hi>Euripides</hi> for Tragedy, yet nevertheless
sleep inglorious in the croud of the forgotten
vulgar: and for as many of those Names
of Writers, whether more or less Eminent,
as have been preserv'd from utter oblivion,
together with an account for the most part
of what they writ, all Learned Men espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
such as are curious of antiquity are
oblig'd to those generous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Registers who have
been studious to keep alive the memories of
Famous Men, of whom it is at least some
satisfaction to understand that there were
once such Men or Writings in being:
However since their works having by what
ever casualty perisht, their Names, though
thus recorded, yet as being dispeirc't in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Authors, and some of those not of the
most conspicuous note, are scarce known to
the generality, even of the Learned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and since of later Ages the memories
of many whose works have been once made
public; and in general esteem, have never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
through tract of time, and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of new Generations, fallen to decay
and dwindled almost to nothing; I judged
it a Work in some sort not unconducing to
a public benefit, and to many not ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
to muster up together in a body, though
<pb facs="tcp:58787:3"/>
under their several Classes, as many of
those that have imploy'd their fancies
or inventions in all the several Arts and
Sciences, as I could either collect out of
the several Authors that have mention'd
them in part, or by any other ways could
come to the knowledge of, but finding this
too various and manifold a task to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
at once, I pitcht upon one Faculty
first, which, not more by chance than incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
falls out to be that of the Poets, a
Science certainly of all others the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and exalted, and not unworthily tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Divine,</hi> since the heighth of Poetical
rapture hath ever been accounted little less
then <hi>Divine Inspiration:</hi> Pardon me
therefore most Honour'd <hi>Friends,</hi> if having
undertaken a Province more weighty and
difficult then the account of any other Art
and Science, and which beyond all others
exerciseth the utmost nicety and sagacity of
judgement, I ambitiously make address to
the Patronage of Persons of so fair a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as well in Poetry as other parts of
Learning, and who are your selves partys
not obscurely or without just merit concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whom against what ever may happen
either of deserv'd or undeserv'd Censure,
<pb facs="tcp:58787:4"/>
vouchsafe but the two first letters of their
Names, and these, it is to be supposed, desire
to be known onely to some Friends, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Interpretation of those letters,
or some curning Men in the Art of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
now as to the last part of the objection,
I have so much the more confidence to stand
upon my own justification, by how much I
rely upon this Maxim, that it is less inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to admit of 20 that deserve no notice
or mention, then to omit one that really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves;
and here methinks there seems to
arise a large feild of examination and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
between those that are in truth
of no valew or desert, and those that are
generally reputed so; it is to be observed that
some have been once of great esteem, and
have afterwards grown out of date, others
have never arriv'd to any esteem, and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in both cases the merits of the cause may
have been various on either side; yet I am
apt to beleive that as it, is a more frequent
thing to over then undervalew, so a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
contempt is a shrew'd, not infallible,
sign of a universal indesert; the reason is
plain, for though no doubt the number of
the judicious and knowing is as great if
not greater then ever, yet most confessedly
<pb facs="tcp:58787:4"/>
not so great as that of the ignorant or only
superficially knowing, there are many that
think, few only that judge; therefore
things of the most transcendent excellence
are for the most part only valw'd by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of transcendent judgment, whereas
the indifferent and plausible are received
with general and vulgar applause. So
that those Works which being advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously
publisht, nevertheless obtain no
Fame, may be justly suspected of little or
no worth, since, had they been excellent,
they might falling into the hands of the few
that judge, have been vuoy'd up by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
had they been plausible, they would

I shall not be hasty to determin, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
to call in question the judgment of
the present Age, only thus much I must
needs see, that Custom &amp; Opinion ofttimes
take so deep a root, that Judgment hath
not free power to act. To the Antient
Greecs and Latins, the Modern Poet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of
all Nations and for several Ages, have
acknowledged themselves beholding, for
those both Precepts and examples which
<pb facs="tcp:58787:6"/>
have been thought conducing to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Poetry; for the manner of its
Garb, and dress, which is Vers, we in
particular to the <hi>Italians,</hi> the first of the
Moderns that have been eminently Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in this Faculty, the Measure of the
Greec and Latin Verse being no way
suitable to the Modern Languages; &amp; truly
so far as I have observed the Italian
<hi>Stanza</hi> in Heroic Poem, and the Sonnet,
Canzon, and Madrigal in the Lyric,
as they have been formerly more frequently
made use of by the <hi>English</hi> than by any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so except their own proper Language they
become none better then ours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having been used with so good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
I see no reason why they should be
utterly rejected; there is certainly a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
in one sort of Verse more then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
which custom cannot really alter,
only by familiarity make it seem better;

<hi>Spencers</hi>'s <hi>Stanza</hi> (which I take
to be but an Improvement upon <hi>Tasso</hi>'s
<hi>Ottava Rima,</hi> or the <hi>Ottava Rima</hi> it

Poets) is above the way either of Couplet
<pb facs="tcp:58787:6"/>
or Alternation of four Verses only, I am
perswaded, were it revived, would soon
be acknowledg'd, and in like manner the
<hi>Italian</hi> Sonnet and Canzon; above <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daric</hi>
Ode, which, whatev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r the name
pretends, comes not so near in resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to the Odes of <hi>Pindarus,</hi> as the
Canzon, which though it answers not so
exactly as to consist of <hi>Stroph, Antistroph</hi>
and <hi>Epod,</hi> yet the Verses, which in the first
<hi>Stroph</hi> of the Canzon were tied to no fixt
number, order or measure, nevertheless in
the following Srophs return in the same num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
order &amp; measure, as were observ'd in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir; whereas that which we call the <hi>Pindaric,</hi>
hath a nearer affinity with the <hi>Mono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s
of <hi>Aeschylus</hi> his Tragedies: one thing more
is to be observ'd between the <hi>Italian</hi>
Verse and ours, namely that the Dissylia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which in that Language is the only
way of Riming, is also in ours, very
applicable to Rime, and hath been very
much used formerly; I was going to say
with as much grace, sometimes, if not more,
then the Monosyllable; but that I am
loath to appear too singularly addicted to
that which is now so utterly exploded, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="tcp:58787:7"/>
since there are other things of much
greater consequence then the Verse; though
it cannot be deny'd, but that a Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
fancy is much seen in the choise of
Verse proper to the chosen subject, yet
however, let the fashion of the Vers be
what it will, according to the different
humour of the Writer, if the Style be
elegant and suitable, the Verse what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is, may be the better dispenc't
with, and the truth is the use of Measure
alone without any Rime at all, would
give far more ample Scope and liberty,
both to Style and fancy then can possibly
be observed in Rime, as evidently appears
from an <hi>English</hi> Heroic Poem, which
came forth not many years ago, and from
the Style of <hi>Virgil, Horace, Ovid,</hi> and
others of the <hi>Latins,</hi> which is so pure
and proper, that it could not possiby have
been better in Prose: another thing yet
more considerable is conduct and design
in whatever kind of Poetry, whether the
<hi>Epic,</hi> the <hi>Dramatic,</hi> the <hi>Lyric,</hi> the
<hi>Elegiac,</hi> the <hi>Epanetic,</hi> the <hi>Bucolic,</hi> or
the <hi>Epigram;</hi> under one of which all
the whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> circuit of Poetic design, is one
way or other included; so that whoever

both from the <hi>Doric, Ionic, Corinthian,

delightfull subject, in verse most apt for
Musical Composition, such as the <hi>Italian</hi>
Sonnet; but most especially Canzon and

not too much exceeding apprehension, or
the beleif of what is possible or likely,

chiefly upon this consideration; because
being supposed as he ought, to understand
the ways of Heroic vertue &amp; Magnanim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from better principles then those of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

then probably can be drawn from known
<hi>History,</hi> and indeed there is no ingenious

            <p>They likewise very much erre from

               </gap>ntient things after a modern

that it shows no otherwise th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n
as if a Man should read the Antient

besides that our Author should avoid, as

            <p>There is a also a <hi>Decorum</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in the style of the H. Poem that
<pb facs="tcp:58787:10"/>
is that it be not inflate or gingling with
an empty noise of Words, nor creepingly
low and insipid, but of a Majesty sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Grandeur of the subject, not
nice or ashamed of vulgarly unknown, or
unusual words, if either tearms of Art,
well chosen, or pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fear of frighting the Ladies from reading,

Next to the <hi>Heroic Poem,</hi> if not

very different, in heighth of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alike as treating only of the Actions

by which latter is meant that moving and
Pathetical manner of expression, which
in some respect is to exceed the highest
that can be delivered in Heroic Poesie,
as being occasioned upon representing to
<pb facs="tcp:58787:10"/>
the very life, the unbridled passions of
Love, Rage and Ambition, the violent
ends or down falls of great Princes, the
subversion of Kingdoms and Estates, or
what ever else can imagined of funest
or Tragical, all which will require a style

as for the <hi>Ethos,</hi> waving farther large
Discourses, as intending a Preface only,

Scope within that circuit, I judged it
not impertinent to mention as well those
<pb facs="tcp:58787:11"/>
Famous Men in other Faculties, who
have also writ Poetically, as the most
Famous of Poetical Writers, considering
especially how largely the Name of <hi>Poet</hi>
is generally taken; for if it were once

right, genuie and true born <hi>Poets,</hi> I
fear me our number would fall short, and

take him throughout, and we shall find in
