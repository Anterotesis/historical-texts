         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And we no inconſiderable part of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms Commonallty (our vocation, as to uſe, reflected on) in our ſence of your late renownfull reſolutions overcoming all obſtructions and difficulties) to ſettle the Nation in a bleſſed poſture of liberty and ſafety, humbly commenſurate with the bleſſing: preſent this acknowledgement of our great thankfulneſſe; And whereas rumour not able to belye their deſperate and implacable malice: loudly ſpeaketh the common enemy, buſie in ſoliciting and inciting <hi>forreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and States to an Invaſion, We with much joy reſent your vigilance and timely circumſpection for their repulſion and our defence, and more eſpecially in your preſent preparation of a numerous and well appointed Fleet; whereunto moved by common piety and duty of devotion, we became thus bold to obtrude zeale, and in this glorious cauſe of reſtored freedom, againſt all malignant oppoſers, make this hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of our lives and ſervices.</p>
            <p>And becauſe they but vainly pretend perfect health, who only fortifie againſt the evills without, and not expell the pecan humours within, We with a better providence, but confining it to our own ſpheare, humbly deſire that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous practices and abuſes (of long time, and yet) acted and ſuffered in and about the Navy, to the infinite diſhonour and prejudice of the whole Nation, may in this happy jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Reformation ſpeedily be taken into conſideration and redreſſe.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:164931:4"/>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt the improper and dangerous mode and Cuſtome in electing all ſorts of Officers, but more eſpecially of Captains and chief Commanders of Ships and Pinaces in former times, by Court favour and paraſitiſme, and under pretence of eſtate (and indeed more frequently pretended then reall) whence iſſued much diſſervice to the State in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and no publique pay ſtated (excepting meerely allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the table, many ſubſequent cheates too many here) but upon further diſcuſſe and oportunity (to be enumerated in theſe latter times, by corrupt or indirect meanes, as bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and inſinuating into the Secretaries Clarkes, and the like Miniſters of Committees, whence diſaffected perſons that would ſubmit to ſuch diſhoneſt contracts accepted, and wel-affected that would not, excluded, have ſucceeded many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults in our Seas, and that the laſt years ſo foule defection and perrilous Revolt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That all, or moſt places and Offices, in, or belonging to the Navy, are by ancient Cuſtom tenanted, as it were, and to be poſſeſt for life, whereby much ſupinenes, neglect, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice hath, and cannot but accrew, for then a conſciouſneſs of being ſtrictly obſerved, and if faulty, diſplaſt; a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table both reigne to diſſoluteneſſe and ſpur to duty cannot be.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The great want of time, and conſequently detriment to ſervice, occaſioned by the preſent Cuſtom in victualling the Navy, every Ship defaulking ſix weeks of the ſix months, ſhe is bound forth, and not ſeldom lying, as many more wind-bound.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The moſt injurious, and no leſſe pernitious ingroſing, committed by the former Committees and Commiſſioners of the Navy, of all the imployment at Sea, and impropriating it to their own ſhipping; for thereby at farre greater rates then otherwiſe would have been, hath the State been long ſerved with Ships leſſe ſerviceable, and undoubtedly, the will and power of the owners (to bear all out reflicted on) unexpoſeable to any hardſhip of fight and weather.</p>

            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, the Exiguity of pay for all ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons engaged in, and attending on this kind of ſervice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much impoveriſhment to many particular Families, and generall decay of the Service it ſelf, hath followed; many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe able, for want of a competent ſupport, either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declining or deſerting it.</p>

            <p>That the Commanders of Ships and Pinnaces, be from henceforth made choice of, rather then a vaine pretence of eſtate (Bribery, Paraſitiſme, or Lordly favour) by their abilities in <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Sea ſervice,</hi> in caſe they be, as only then apt, for ſo great Truſt, of Religious life, and honeſt converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereby will enſue a greater compliance and love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the commanded Sea-Men; and more ſervice done in one yeare, then before this Parliament in one and twenty.</p>
