         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114938:3"/>
at <hi>Windſor,</hi> of an intention to diſarm
the City, and then to Plunder the ſame:
And that divers reports to that effect have

from divers parts of this Kingdom, and
from Forain parts: Which Reports, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the preſent Drawing and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
of the Army ſo near the City; and
the encreaſe of the number of Souldiers in
the Tower, hath been, now is, and will be
occaſion of great fears, and a great decay of
Trade, and an enhauncing of the Prizes of
Victuals within this City: The which fears
are much encreaſed by the taking and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down of the Chaines within the ſame.
And the Petitioners doe humbly conceive,
That their danger is encreaſed, and their
ſtrength much abated by the diſuniting of
the command of the Forces of the City, and
the Parts within the late Lines of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and the weekly Bills of Mortality.
For the removing of which Feares, and

of buſineſſe at <hi>Windſor</hi> upon Thurſday the 20
of <hi>April,</hi> 1648. as he did lye in Bed, did heare ſome
Gentlemen diſcourſe in the next Chamber, the number
of whom he cannot tel, but by their diſcourſe they could
not be leſſe then three or four; And that he doth beleeve
they were all Officers of the Army under the command
of his Excellency the Lord <hi>Fairfax;</hi> one of them was
Quartermaſter-generall <hi>Gravener</hi> as he ſuppoſeth; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
one Colonell <hi>Ewer,</hi> or ſome ſuch name: And
after ſome merry diſcourſe, they began to be ſerious,
and propounded what they thought fit to bee done
in reference to the preſent exigencies of the Kingdome,
upon which ſubject they diſcourſed an houre or more:
They made no doubt of the comming in of the <hi>Scots;</hi>
and with the ſame confidence beleeved that the City of
<hi>London</hi> would joyne with the <hi>Scots;</hi> For the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114938:5"/>
of which, they could find no way but to Diſarm the
City both Friend and Foe: And afterwards, they ſaid,
they would intimate that thoſe who were the Friends
of the Army, ſhould come forth into the Fields, and
there they ſhould be armed: And that they ſhould have
the power of the City of <hi>London</hi> put into their hands,
to keep the reſt of the Citizens in awe: And that they
ſhould be maintained at the Charge of the City, ſo long
as it ſhould bee thought fit to continue them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that Money is the ſinews of Warre, having which,
they doubted not but to procure Men enow, if there
were occaſion to uſe them: And therefore for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
advancement of the ſame, if need were, (this City
being Diſarmed) they would make them advance a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of Money, or elſe plunder them: And the Party
that ſpake this, ſaid, Hee had acquainted Commiſſary-generall
<hi>Ireton</hi> with it. All which, or to the like effect,
was ſpoken in this Deponents hearing.</p>

Aldermen, and Common-councell of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
for the good affections that they have expreſſed in
this their Petition, aſſerting the reſolutions of the City
to adhere to the Parliament according to their ſolemn
League and Covenant.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe have commanded me to aſſure you,
That it hath ever been a principall part of their care to
prevent any danger or inconveniency that might threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the diſturbance of the quiet of the city of <hi>London,</hi>
or tend to the decay of the Trade thereof, though to
their great grief theſe late troubles have much hindred
the ſucceſſe of their endevors therein; which care they
are fully reſolved ſtill to continue to the utmoſt of their
power. And they aſſure you, That it never entred into
their thoughts to have the City of <hi>London</hi> to be diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
And they hope there can be no ſuch intentions in
any others who wiſh well to the ſafety of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>As to the report which hath been brought unto you by
one <hi>Iohn Everard,</hi> they will put it into a further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that they may be ſatisfied of the truth or falſhood
of it: and except there be further proof of it, they hope
ſuch a report ſhall not render the Army to be ſuſpected
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114938:6"/>
of any ſuch deſign, conſidering the many former and
late experiences that the Parliament and City have had
of the fidelity and good ſervices of the Army.</p>
            <p>As to the particular of ſetting up the Chaines within
the City, they doe fully leave it to the Lord Major,
Aldermen, and Common-councell, to doe therein as
