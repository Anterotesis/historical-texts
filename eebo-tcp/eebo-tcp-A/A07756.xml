            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Such (if a man wil examin them (is in few woords, the nature of woorldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.

            <p>I néed not héer rehearse such displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures as no man can denye, as strife, debate, wounds, murder, flight, disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and other hasards, which sometime his owne incontinencie, and somtimes the insolencie of this vnruly age bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him into. So that the pleasures ther of béeing but displeasures, or his sorowe drunck as a mixtion with wormewood water, it plainly appéereth what gréef &amp; bitternes he féeleth or tasteth of. This to be bréef, is the life of a young man, who béeing gotten out of the lawfull wardeshippe of either his Parents or maisters, yéeldeth and abandoneth him self vnto all licence, or rather indéede bondage of his passion, whiche neither more nor lesse, but as an vncleane spirit that possesseth him dooth still vex &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>God only and no other enforceth him to take this way, who guideth his steps euen to the end, graunting him victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in all his combates, and yet we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Well, let him followe either the one way or the other, he must fully resolue him self, either to yeelde to a tyrannous passion, or els to vndertake a perpetuall and greeuous warfare: yea, either to cast him selfe downe he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Thus in few woords on the one side, you sée how the youngman who in his youth hath quaffed of by full cuppes the false and vain pleasures of this world, (resembling drunckards the next day after their feasts &amp; royotous banquets) is either quite astonished, either so far out of taste and temper that he will no more, or els is finally so quayled that he can no more, and then dooth neuer af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terwarde thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>On the otherside, you may also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how faint, wery, and as it were euen broken with this continuall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This is the commoditie and contentation of this flourishing age whiche Children doo so ernestly aspire vnto, and olde men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at.</p>
            <p>Next followeth the age of perfecte man, wherein eche one hopeth of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and taking his owne ease. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in déed it may be called, but in this only respect, that all the imperfections of humain nature, which before, either vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> simplicitie of Childehood, or els vnder the lightnes of youth lay hidden, are therein reuealed and doo come to perfection. Wherfore we wil ouerpasse all such as worldly iudgement accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth wise, happy or blessed, and come to the rest.</p>
            <p>Hetherto as you sée, we haue alwayes played in feare, and inioyed short plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, accompanied with long repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>But now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to sight Couetousnes and Ambition, which doo promise vnto

What therfore is the end of all this contentation?</p>
            <p>The couetouse man maketh a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand voiages by sea and by land, incur reth infinit dangers of pirats &amp; théeues, escapeth wunderful perils and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks, and liueth in continuall feare and danger, yea and often loseth all his time and laboure, reaping nought els but diseases, goutes, with suche other like discommodities for the time to come. For the obtaining of his preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated ease, he now hath forgone his quietnes, and in séeking for money: hath loste his life. But admit be hath obtained great welth, that he hath rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the East countries of their pearles, and dryed vp all the westerne mines, shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:20229:10"/>
that through his passed trauailes with labour and toil both of body and minde, he hath sufficiently heaped and horded vp for time to come, is he not fallen out of one inconuenience into an other? This then is no end but a chaunge of his miserie.</p>
            <p>Aforetime he sought the obtaining of goodes, now he seareth the losse of the same: he got them through painful heat and trauail, he now possesseth them in quaking colde and trembling: he hath incurred daunger of rouers and théeues in séeking for them: now théeues and murderres doo on alsides assail him. He took paines to dig and hale them out of the Earth: he now laboureth to hide them vp again. To be bréef, after all his voiages and iorneyes he is entred into a prison, and as a conclusion of all his bodily labours he hath begunne an infinit trouble of minde. What ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finally hath this poor wretch obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as a recompence of so many mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes?

Wherfore we are to return to this point, that the obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all these false goods is no other, then trauaile of the body, the possession wherof, is moste commonly trouble of minde, and that so much the greater, as the spirite is more sensible, suttle, and delicate then the body.

            <p>To be bréefe, the recompence that Couetousnes yéeldeth to his continuall scholers, resembleth the rewardꝭ of the Deuil his progenitor, namely that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing awhile gratified them with their prophane desires, he finally either deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth them ouer to the hangman, or els him selfe breaketh their necks.

moste mortall men doo stay &amp; abuse them selues, the body is slain, the minde vexed, and the soule co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned without any pleasure or contentation at all.</p>
            <p>Now then let vs come to ambition which with desire of honor dooth fondly bewitch the mightyest in the worlde: shall we ther in finde any more ease the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the other, or not rather lesse?

            <p>Happie is he onely who liueth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in his minde, and farre more accurssed then any, is he that canne be content with nothing.

            <p>Finally, in few woords to rehearse all the blisse that may be comprehended in whatsoeuer ambition promiseth to them. They indure much euil to the end to obtain euil.

               <pb facs="tcp:20229:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>You wil say that in death is paine, be it so, so is there also in the healing of wounds, for such is the nature of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine things, that one euil cannot be healed but by an other.

            <p>We thinck not that we dye before we yéelde the last gaspe, and yet if we looke wel we doo dayly in euery houre and moment dye. We feare death as a thing vnaccustomed, and yet haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more common in vs, for our life is but a continuall death: euen so long as we liue, so long doo we die: as we doo growe, so dooth our life diminish. We

let not one step so soon into life, but as soon we set an other into death. Who so hath liued a third parte of his yéeres, hath also passed a third part of his death, and who the tone halfe, is alredy halfe dead. So much of our life as is passed, is dead: that whiche is present dooth liue and dye togither, and that whiche is to come shall likewise dye. That that is past is no more: that that is to come is not yet, and that that is present bothe is and is not. To be bréefe, all this life is but death. It is as a candle lighted in our bodies. In some y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> winde wasteth it, in other some it putteth it out before it be half spent, and in other some it suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it to continue to the end: but be it as it wil, according as it lighteth, so dooth it burn, his light is a burning, his flame a vanishing smoke, and his last fire is the vttermoste end of his cotton and the last drop of his moisture. Euen so is the life of man.</p>
            <p>The life and death of man is all but one thing. If we call y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last breth death, the like name must we giue to all the rest afore pasied, for they all doo procéed out of one place and are all of a like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion.
