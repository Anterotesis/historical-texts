            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Reverend Father in GOD, We greet you well. Having oftentimes with great grief observed, That many of Our Loyal Subjects, who formerly took up Arms for Us, and Our Royal Father of blessed memory, to resist that Torrent of Rebellion, which at last overturned this Monarchy, and Church, or who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when We were driven hence, followed Us into Foreign Countreys, are now by Old Age, and Wounds, or other Accidents befalling them in that Service, and disabling them for all other, reduced to so extream Poverty, that some of them have been forced to beg their bread; And farther, foreseeing, that in Our Guards, and standing Garrisons, and other Our Forces necessary to be kept on Foot for the Safety of Our Royal Person, and Government, there will be many from time to time, who by reason of Age or Sickness, or other disabilities, will become unfit to be continued in Our Service and Pay, and so unavoidably fall under the same miserable circumstances with the former:</p>
            <p>We therefore out of a tender and deep Compassion of the sad and deplorable Condition of so many Loyal and brave Men, and being desirous (as much as in Us lies) to remove this also, among other discouragements, which else may hinder even Men of Courage, from entring into this kind of Service to the Crown; have after mature Consideration of the best Means and Methods of attaining so good an end, Resolved to Found and Erect at <hi>Chelsey</hi> (in a Place very proper for such a Design) a Perpetual Hospital, in which more then Four hundred Aged, or otherwise-Disabled Souldiers may at present, (and so successively the like Number for ever) be Lodged and Supplied with the necessary Supports of Life, suitable to their respective Conditions: In the beginning, and carrying on of which so Pious, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable a Work, We have of Our own Royal Bounty already expended great Sums of Money, as by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick to that purpose in great part Erected appears. But now being sensible, that the compleat Finishing of so Chargeable a Building, and much more the Perpetual Endowment thereof for the constant Maintenance of so many Aged, and Infirm Persons, will require a greater Expence, than Our particular Bounty (as Our Affairs now stand) can well extend to; We have thought fit to call in the Aid, and Assistance, of all Our Charitable and well-disposed Subjects of Estate and Quality, and particularly of those of the Clergy, who are such: And do therefore hereby Will, and Require you, that you forthwith send your Circular Letters, to all the Bishops of your Province, earnestly inciting them both by their own Example (if they be men of plentiful Estates) and (however) by such Arguments of Perswasion, wherewith so great, and so good a Cause will abundantly furnish them; to deal effectually with all Our good Subjects, within their respective Dioceses, who are Masters of considerable Estates, exhorting them to contribute liberally to so good a Design, tending so manifestly to the glory of Almighty God, and the Service of their King and Countrey. And We do hereby assure both you, and them all, that whatsoever hath been, or shall be done, in compliance with this Our Royal Command, and Our so just Expectations, shall be by Us most Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously accepted, as a particular Evidence of their good affection towards Us, and of their Zeal for Our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And so We bid you very heartily farewell. Given at Our Court at <hi>Whitehall</hi> the Fourteenth day of <hi>November</hi> 1684. In the Thirty sixth year of Our Reign.</p>
