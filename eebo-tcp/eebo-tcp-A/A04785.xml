            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I considered with my selfe (gentle Reader) the great calamitie, miserie, and most distressed state of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, on which it hath pleased God to inflict the heauie scourge of his wrath, by imposing on them that poysonous infection the plague, I therefore (as one partaker of their griefe and sorrowe) seeing also the same contagion so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dispersed throughout this land, and not finding anye english author that hath to my content written the meanes how to preserue and keepe vs from the contagion thereof, haue thought it good to publish this small treatise vnder the title and name of a defensatiue against the Plague. Which worke I haue collected and drawne from sundrie both aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and later writers, the which being shaddowed vnder the calme shroude of auncient consent, and strengthned with the abundant sappe of late experience (as well mine owne, as others) I heere present the same, not so exquisitely plotted with so orderly a method, or so finely pollished with so filed an eloquence, thereby to breede a delight to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which would be a loathing to the vnlearned, I haue therefore thought best to disclose it, euen in the playnest manner I could deuise, whereby the simpler sort might reape the commoditie thereof, whose safetie I tender, and for whose sakes I haue taken this paynes. I doubt not but that
<pb facs="tcp:9748:5"/>
some (<hi>Aristarchus</hi> or other) whose filthie stomackes being inflamde with malice, will attempt to nip off the crop of my future hope, obiecting the barrennes of my soyle wherein it first tooke roote, and my want of skill in trimming and proy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it as it would require to be such, as small hope of frute is to be loked for to proceede thereof, but high disdaine wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no man good, I giue them leaue to glose as they list, knowing it most friuolous to afford vnto such an answere, seeing in stead of reason there commeth nothing from them but either a disdainefull smile, or a scornefull mocke (but it skilleth not) sith many of my ancients haue tasted of their mallice, whome I may iustly compare to <hi>Antiphilos,</hi> that peerelesse pickthancke. Only vppon this hope do I rest, that as in good will and loue I haue done it, so the well disposed will censure it in the best sort, and where defects are (as I doubt not of many) they will in friendly and charitable manner correct and amend the same, which may occasion me to take some further paynes heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

I doo not thinke that this booke can passe cleane away with the good liking of euery one, but that it will drinke of the same enuious cup, that other famous workes heretofore haue done. I could rehearse a number that haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned thereof, whose eternall fame shall neuer be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished. The Author of this treatise, his good and zelous intent, and sufficiencie in his profession, I knowe to be such, as deserueth well. His willing and godly mind to do his countrie good, (not only this booke) but also many people both rich and poore that haue already receyued helpe at his hands, can and will testifie the same. This which he hath written is no new inuention, but the ground thereof allowed, both of auntient and later writers: and besides he hath considered that in euery place a good Phisition is not to be gotten at all times, so that the partie infected may be dead before any such helpe can be had, (yea) and the most part of the best of them will not hazard them selues in so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an enterprise: he considering the same, hath heere taught the most easye and approued medicines, with
<pb facs="tcp:9748:6"/>
the whole order of the cure, not only for such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, but also haue to preserue them that are sounde. What doth he deserue that thus hath done, let the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort iudge: for the rest, I thinke if either they haue the feare of God, any sparke of honestie, or iudgement in any thing, they will for shame hold their peace, least their ignorance and hatred bewray their folly, and so deserue the same punishment which the wisest sort haue alreadie set downe, which I hope none will so wilfully hazard to incurre. Now, considering his zealous intent, it is the part of euery good minde, to encourage him in so godly, and good an enterprise, whereby others may be anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do the like: and therefore considering the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the matter, and necessitie of the cause, the whole common wealth is to embrace him, who lookes but only for a thankefull acceptance in lewe of his trauell, which is the least may be yelded him.

               <p>The second meanes is to flye far off from the place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and as <hi>Rondoletius</hi> sayth, not ouer hastely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne there againe, for feare of an afterclap: which saying is confirmed by <hi>Valetius,</hi> in these wordes, <hi>non enim mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietur in bello, qui non est in illo</hi>: and the farther from it, the safer shall we be, yet were it a very vncharitable course, that all which are of abillytie should so doe: for then howe should the poore be relieued, and good orders obserued: but for children it were best to send them far off from the place, because their bodyes are most apt to receiue the infection, as also for that they cannot so continually vse antidotes and preseruatiues, which by their great heate may indanger them almost so much as the disease it selfe.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9748:38"/>
which is easily perceiued by the great and almost intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paine, that by some is felte in the place where nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to expell it: which in the most parte of people, is by bloudletting, Cordials, and sweate, is cleane taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and euacuated: but if after al this done it goe not away, then vnto these you must vse all the meanes you can to bring it to the outwarde partes. First by giuing to the sicke often times some Cordiall electuary to keépe it from the harte, then, (if no great paine in the outwarde parte) you must applie a cupping glasse, with Scarryfication, directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the place where the griefe is felte, and let it remaine thereon a quarter or halfe an houre, then take it away, and presently applie the rumpe of Chickens, Hens, or Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the place (as before hath beene shewed) that being done, then lay some Attractiue and Maturatiue playster or Cattaplasme to the place which here following is shewed, and euery sixth houre you must applie the cupping glasse, as also the rest, vntill such time as you haue brought the venimous matter to the outward partes, there to be visiblie seéne, or at least by feéling to be perceiued, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is effected at the second time, then vse no more cupping, but onely applie a maturatiue to the place.</p>
