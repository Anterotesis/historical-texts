            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DECLARATION Of the Right Honorable the Earl of NEVVCASTLE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is no new thing (though it was never ſo frequent as now) for Incendiaries to accuſe Innocents, as diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the publike tranquility of the Countrey. So ugly is the face of Rebellion when it comes unmask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without ſome cloke or vizard over it, that even ſeditious perſons cannot fancy it in themſelves. The Charge which the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> gives againſt me in this Declaration, is like that of a Roman againſt his fellow Citizen, That <hi>he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his whole weapon into his body:</hi> He was angry that his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhould defend himſelf; and my Lord, that I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect His Majeſties good Subjects from his violence. And though a generall accuſation might juſtly be ſleighted as a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to which by the Laws of this Land no man is bound to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to which it is impoſſible for any man to make a direct Anſwer (ſince it is not inveſted with the due circumſtances of time and place and perſons) neither is the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> able to bring one particular inſtance to make good his generall calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations; yet ſince it proceeds from a perſon of his eminency, I have thought fit, as well for the vindication of mine own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as for the confirmation of the mindes of His Majeſties well affected ſubjects in their loyalty, to repell his ſlanders in the Preſſe, as I doubt not by Gods aſſiſtance to do his Forces in the Field. Yet give me leave to wonder who they are that have an ſuch influence upon his Lordſhips underſtanding, as to draw him in ſix lines to publiſh to the world ſix groundleſſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111616:1"/>
aſperſions, againſt a perſon that hath not deſerved ill of him, without the leaſt provocation.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, That <hi>contrary to the Laws of the Land I have raiſed a great Army.</hi> I might anſwer, That the Laws are indeed an excellent ſtandard and meaſure of Juſtice, ſo long as they are common to all parties: But when they become like ſpiders webs, to entangle ſome, and let thorow others; when ſome men muſt obſerve Law, and others will be free from all Law, it is the greateſt partiality, and the falſeſt meaſure in the world. And as our Saviour ſaid to the Phariſees; <hi>If I by Beelzebub caſt out Devills, by whom do your children caſt them out? they ſhall be your judges.</hi> So ſay I; If I be a Delinquent againſt the Laws for raiſing defenſive Arms by vertue of His Majeſties Commiſſion (with whom alone the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted both by God and man) what is the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and his partners for raiſing offenſive rebellious Arms againſt their fellow ſubjects, without, nay, againſt His Majeſties Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But he hath appealed to the Laws: to the Laws let him go; Let him ſhew but any one particle of the known Law, Statute or Common, which I have violated, and I ſhall lay down Arms as cheerfully as I took them up. But if this be impoſſible (as without doubt it is) then ceaſe at lenth to tell us of Laws in the clouds, or of Laws written in the Sybylls Books, which no men ever read or heard of but your ſelves. All true Engliſh men will diſdain to exchange their Inheritance, the ancient Laws of this Land (under which they and their proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors have already enjoyed ſuch happy and Halcyonion dayes, and hope ſtill for better from His Majeſties greater experience and late Acts of Grace) either for a company of far-fetched dear-bought principles, drawn without Art or Judgement, by factious unskilfull perſons, out of the Law of Nature or of Nations, as a Lesbian-Rule to ſerve their ambitious ends: Or for Arbitrary Government, which knows no boudns or limits, but the will of head-ſtrong diſcontented perſons. With what face can theſe men name the Laws of the Land? when one of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111616:2"/>
them hath lately told the world in Print, That they are but <hi>the Inventions of men;</hi> yea, <hi>morall Precepts, fitter for Heathens then Chriſtians.</hi> In a word; I raiſe Arms by the Law, and for the Law, to protect the Laws and Religion eſtabliſhed; you, to ſubvert them both: I raiſe Arms under His Majeſty, for His Majeſty; you without Him, againſt Him, by vertue of your own Warrants: If it be not ſo, ſhew us but one text, one Statute, nay, but one poor caſe or preſident for your juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And that you may ſee I am in earneſt, I deſire God to vouch ſafe his bleſſing and aſſiſtance to that party which ſtands truely and cordially for the defence of the known Laws of this Realm, and to deny it to all others.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Charge is, That <hi>mine Army conſiſts of Papiſts and other Malignants.</hi> That I have in mine Army ſome of the Romiſh Communion I do not deny; yet but an handfull in compariſon of the whole Body of it, I believe not above one of fifty: and I wiſh their conſciences as well ſatisfied as mine own of the truth of our Profeſſions: Theſe I admitted for their loyalty and abilities, not for their Religion, as was moſt lawfull for me to do; a courſe warranted by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples both of God and man, and chalked out to me by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: yea, it was a note higher in them, in a War pretended againſt Papiſts, to make uſe of Papiſts in places of great truſt and command: nay, do they not ſtill admit all ſorts of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, Familiſts, &amp;c. I have demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the equity of this courſe to the world, which they know not how to anſwer: the fidelity of the one, ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt the Rebellion of the other, and condemn it: Certainly in this particular ſervice they ſhew themſelves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter friends to the Proteſtant Religion then the others. But they are not ſatisfied to rob me of them, unleſſe they may ſweep away all the reſt under the ſtale and empty name of Malignants: I do not much blame them, their intended work would be more eaſily atchieved. But let us enquire who in their Dialect are theſe Malignants; Are they who do not willingly part with their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111616:2"/>
Religion, Laws, Liberties, Lively-hoods, left them by their fathers, upon Arbitrary Votes. So a thief may term a true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a malignant, becauſe he doth refuſe to deliver his Purſe upon demand: So the Wolves in their Treaty of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Sheep, deſired the Dogs to be delivered up to them as malignants. Thoſe have hitherto been eſteemed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant humours in the body Naturall, which being ſtubborn, rebellious, venomous, are with difficulty reduced to their right temper, either by ſtrength of Nature, or skill in Phyſick; not thoſe which are not eaſily infected, or diſtemper'd. This is new Learning, and requires a new Dictionary to warrant it. Before they conclude them malignant, they ſhould do well to prove them to be <hi>peccant</hi> againſt any authentick Rule: The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſsion;</hi> To accuſe boldly, is not ſufficient to convince. If a common adverſary did not keep them in a kinde of <hi>Herodian</hi> unity for a time, your Browniſts would ſoon condemn your ordinary diſciplinarian<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for malignants, and your Anabaptiſts again your Browniſts, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you charge me <hi>to have invaded this County of York.</hi> An inſolent and preſumptuous Challenge. Can the Kings Forces be ſaid to make an Invaſion in His own Dominions: The ſecond blow may be ſaid to make the fray, but it is the firſt that makes the Invaſion. Say in good earneſt, Did not your Forces firſt make Inrodes into the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> under my charge? where they had no pretence of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Did they not rob and plunder ſundry of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties liege people at <hi>Darnton,</hi> in ſuch cruell manner, that the prime Officer of the Town died of grief within three or four dayes? Did they not give an aſſault upon <hi>Pierſ-bridge</hi> to their loſſe? And when I come to chaſtiſe theſe Intruders, can it be called an Invaſion? Neither did I then ſet foot into this County, but upon the earneſt ſolicitation and intrerty of the prime Nobility and Gentry of York-ſhire, to ſecure them from your violence and oppreſſion. If Protection be Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion,
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:111616:4"/>
then this is Invaſion. I could nouriſh little hopes that theſe reſtleſſe ſpirits, who could not be bounded within their own calling, would be contained within the limits of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Or that they would ſpare me any longer, then untill they had fully ſubdued their Neighbours and fellow Subjects at home. Neither could I have been ever able to have given an Account to His ſacred Majeſty for ſuch an unpardonable omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if being Armed by His goodneſſe with ſufficient power to repreſſe ſuch tumultuous diſorders, I ſhould ſee before mine eyes His loving and loyall Subjects trampled upon by His and their Enemies, in His Cauſe, and for His ſake, and whileſt they ſeek to me for ſuccour, I ſhould be wanting in my Duty to my dread Soveraign, and my neceſſary aſſiſtance to them. All this while the <hi>Lincoln-ſhire</hi> Forces are quite forgotten, they were Brethren, no Invaders.</p>
            <p>The fourth Charge ariſeth yet higher, <hi>For killing and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome numbers of the Religious Proteſtant Subjects.</hi> Where did ever my Forces kill one man who did not take up Arms againſt us, or was not ready to have killed us firſt if he could? The weight of guiltleſſe blood is more heavy then a mountain; The ſtain thereof not to be waſhed out with all the water in the Ocean, but onely by the tears of Repentance, and the blood of Chriſt. This weight and guilt of blood ſhall lie heavy upon the heads of thoſe men, and of their ſeed after them, who have been the authors and fomentors of theſe horrid diſtractions, when <hi>Peace ſhall be upon the head of our Soveraign, and His Seed, and His Throne for ever. They that take Sword</hi> (without lawfull calling) <hi>ſhall periſh by the Sword.</hi> And <hi>he that ſheddeth mans blood</hi> (without a Commiſſion from the King of Heaven, who onely hath originall Power over the lives of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and no multitude of men in the World, collective or repreſentative, whatſoever) <hi>by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</hi> The ſupreme Magiſtrate is Gods Vice-gerent, and <hi>beareth not the Sword in vain.</hi> But thoſe who preſume to uſe the Sword, and can derive no power from Him, it were meet for them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111616:4"/>
to make their Accounts betimes with God, leſt they die in the eſtate of Murtherers both of themſelves and others, both of ſoul and body. It is an eaſie thing for an Orator to caſt a miſt before the eyes of vulgar people, and make them a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Diſcourſe of the <hi>Cauſe of God,</hi> the <hi>true Religion, of ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Superſtition and Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>ſetting up the right Worſhip of the Lord.</hi> They had hard hearts, if they could not afford them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a good word. But admitting, not granting, all this to be true (which is moſt falſe) will this Plea yet ſerve before the Judge of Heaven and Earth? Nothing leſſe. Theſe very men, and their Predeceſſors, have taught the contrary, have proteſted the contrary, have printed the contrary, <hi>Ant<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mota certamina,</hi> before theſe unhappy differences began, whileſt mens eyes were not faſcinated with faction and prejudice: Then themſelves condemned this very Doctrine which now they practice, as <hi>Antichristian and Anabaptiſticall;</hi> and their preſent practice which they now defend, as <hi>ſeditious and ſinfull:</hi> this would be truely laid to heart. And withall, That if the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and his friends had been men of their words, or perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Agreement to which Honour and Juſtice did oblige them, all the blood which hath been ſpilled, or ſhall be ſhed hereafter in this Cauſe, had been ſaved; and upon their ſcore it will be caſt in the end, both by God and man. It would be known who they are whom emphatically (if not excluſively) he calls Proteſtants: Are they the ſucceſſors in Doctrine of thoſe firſt Reformers in <hi>Germany,</hi> whom from a Proteſtation made, they named <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> No, what theſe old Proteſtants allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and practiſed as lawfull and neceſſary, theſe new Proteſtants condemn as ſuperſtitious and Antichriſtian. This is beyond the power of Omnipotency, to make both parts of a contradiction to be true, Proteſtants whileſt they continue the ſame to be no Proteſtants; and no Proteſtants to be Proteſtants. If they do cordially love the thing, as they do hugge the name, why do we not all ſhake hands, and become friends.</p>
            <p>And ſo from murthering their bodies, he proceeds to ſtarving
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111616:5"/>
their ſouls; that is, By <hi>baniſhing and impriſoning the Zealous Miniſters:</hi> This is my fifth Charge. I envy no mans zeal, but wiſh them Diſcretion proportionable to their Devotion. To ſatisfie their Charge home, firſt, <hi>de jure,</hi> what may be done. It hath ever been accounted lawfull to binde a phrenetick mans hands: Shall it be lawfull for theſe ſeditious Orators to bring railing Accuſations to the Pulpits daily againſt the Lords An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynted; ſuch as <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel durſt not bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Devill, and yet be free from queſtion? May they proſtitute the Ordinance of God to the rebellious deſigns of ambitious men, yet be free from queſtion? Could theſe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of Peace keep themſelves to that Theme, which was bequeathed to them by the Prince of Peace, they might long enjoy their Benefices and Liberties; yea, with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence to a truely tender conſcience. But when a man may frequent their Sermons a whole yeer, and hear nothing but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives to War, ſhedding the blood of the ungodly, and joyning with others to make a great. Sacrifice to the Lord, may not a man juſtly ſay to them, as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſometimes to an Ambaſſadour, <hi>Hei mihi vocem Pacem expectavi, cur Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li clamorem audio?</hi> Are not theſe the ſame men who teach in their own Caſe, That <hi>he deſerves more rigorous puniſhment who ſhall infect the Souls of men with poyſoned Doctrine, then he that ſhall destroy their bodies with poyſon.</hi> Are not theſe the men who upon the ſame grounds have ſilenced or impriſoned, or to uſe their own phraſe, baniſhed from their Churches ſo many of our Reverend, Learned, and Worthy Divines thorowout the whole Kingdome, to ſub-introduce Hetere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and contentious perſons in their Rooms? and may no man ſay to their Minions, not worthy to ſit at the feet of the other, <hi>Domine cur ita faeis?</hi> Sir, why do you ſo: Or ſhall we once again bring in an exemption of Church-men privately at the back-door, which we have publikely thruſt out at the fore-door. Thus you ſee it might be done, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own Grounds, in point of Right.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:111616:5"/>
Now for the matter of fact, it is as much miſtaken as the right, I have recollected my ſelfe, I have inquired of my Secretary, yet can I not find one Miniſter by me either baniſhed or impriſoned. If any Miniſter either before my coming or ſince, being apprehenſive of his owne demerits, or out of a guilty Conſcience, without other compulſion did forſake his Church, and leave it as the Oeſtridge doth her eggs in the ſand, without care or proviſion, you cannot call this Baniſhment. Or if any of your Miniſters have aſſumed a pluralitie of Profeſſions and added the Sword to the Word, if my Officers ſhould meet with him in ſuch a garbe, might they not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>an haec tunica Filii tui ſit,</hi> and take him in his ſecond capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Or Laſtly, if the Juſtices of this County, who live upon the place, and doe beſt know ſeditious perſons, and the juſt feares and dangers of the County, have thought fit to reſtraine any man from doing hurt, was I bound to give a protection or a ſuperſedeas? when you inſtance in particular perſons you ſhall receive particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>And ſo from the Body and Soule he deſcends to the Eſtate, the laſt ſtep of his accuſation, in theſe words, <hi>And hath beſides done infinite ſpoile and waſte upon the good Subjects, plundering, and taking away their goods and cattle, in ſo much as in many places, there are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men nor cattle left to till the ground.</hi> Lord how theſe men are touched to the quick, when any man but themſelves dare offer to plunder, as if they deſired not only the free Trade, but even the Monopoly of Plundering to themſelves. I know no ſuch places in this County as he mentions; if there be any ſuch, without doubt they muſt needs know the deſolation which themſelves have made. But doe they thinke with ſuch clamours and outcries to deafe the eares of men, and drowne the ejulations of poore people, whom they have harrowed. They have ſpared no Age, neither the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Old-man, nor the innocent Child; No orders of Men, The long Robe as well as the ſhort hath felt their fury. No Sex, not Women, no not Women in Child-bed, whom common humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould protect: No condition, neither Fathers nor Friends.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111616:6"/>
They have ſpared no places, The Churches of Chriſtians which the Heathens durſt not violate, are by them prophaned. Their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments have been made either the ſupply of their neceſſities, or the ſubject of their ſcurrillities, their Chalices, or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Cupps (let them call them what they will, ſo they would hold their fingers from them have become the objects of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, the Badges and Monuments of ancient Gentry in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and Pedigrees have been by them defaced; Old Evidences, the Records of private Families, the Pledges of Poſſeſſions, the boundaries of Mens Properties have been by them burned, torne in pieces, and the Seales trampled under thir feet. Seelings and Wainſcot have been broken in pieces, Walls demoliſhed, (a thing which a brave Roman Spirit would ſcorne to tyranniſe over Walls and Houſes.) And all this by a Company of Men crept now at laſt out of the bottome of <hi>Pandora's</hi> Boxe. The poore <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> found out by experience that Gold was the <hi>Spaniards</hi> God, And the Countrey finds to their loſſe what is the Reformation which theſe men ſeek. At this very time I am informed they are executing the illegall Order for the Twentieth part of every Mans Eſtate in <hi>Craven,</hi> This would be a ſufficient anſwer for them, but not a ſufficient plea for me.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the ſecond place, I adde that my caſe is clear diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from theirs, There may be Treaſon againſt the King, there can be none againſt them. There may be Forfeitures of Eſtates to the King, none to them. The King may raiſe Arms and leavy a juſt Warre, whatſoever they doe in that kind is void by the Law of Nations; whatſoever they ſhall acquire in ſuch a Courſe is not by Right, but a meer Nullity. No tract of time can weare away the unlawfulneſſe of the firſt acquiſition, but after an hundred yeares poſſeſſion, they are ſtill <hi>malae fidei poſſeſſores,</hi> poſſeſſe it with a bad Conſcience, and are bound to make reſtitution.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, for matter of fact, when I came firſt into this County, I made a publicke Declaration againſt Plundering, (in-Print) which I have ſince endeavoured to obſerve. Yet that ſome men of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:111616:6"/>
their party have ſuffered in their Eſtates I doe readily grant, that is, either ſuch as have abſented themſelves, or have refuſed to pay thoſe proportions of money which were impoſed upon them by the County. But whatſoever hath beene done in that kind hath beene done by the Gentry or the Committees by them named, with as much moderation as the preſent exigence of affaires would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, wherein I have rather acted the part of their Miniſter, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute what they reſolved, then looked upon that great truſt which His Majeſtie hath impoſed upon mee. So I have done with the charge.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> requires all Parties to appeare, and I Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them all upon their Allegiance to ſtay at home. They may perhaps come thither without danger, but the difficulty will be to get ſafe back againe, <hi>ſed revocare gradum, hic Labor hoc Opus eſt,</hi> and afterwards to avoyd certaine puniſhment for theſe tumultuous and Rebellious meetings. It were a more conſcionable and diſcreet part of them, to repaire all as one unanimous body to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign's Standard, and drive out theſe Incendiaries from among them, who have beene the true authors of all the preſſing grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and miſeries of this County.</p>
            <p>Withall, his Lordſhip talkes of driving me and mine Army out of the County; he knowes this cannot be done without a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. If it be not a flouriſh, but a true ſpark of undiſſembling Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, he may doe well to expreſſe himſelfe more particularly for time and place: This is more conformable to the Examples of our Heroicke Anceſtors, who uſed not to ſpend their time in ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another out of holes, but in pitched Fields determined their doubts; This would quickly ſet a Period to the ſufferings of the People, unleſſe he deſire rather to prolong thoſe miſerable diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which were begun with breach of Promiſe. It were pitty if his deſires lead him this way, but he ſhould be ſatisfied: And let the God of Battells determine the right of our Engliſh Lawes and Liberties.</p>
