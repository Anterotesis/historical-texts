            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

heed your ſelves bee not a part of the miſery of the times, that they bee not the worſe for you. And
then make this the day of <hi>Jacobs</hi> truſt alſo, for God is never neerer to his Church, then when the
greateſt troubles are neere to them: when in Earth men are concluding an utter overthrow (as now)
God in Heaven is concluding a glorious deliverance: <hi>Chriſt</hi> now ſtands upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and there is
a Councell in Heaven will daſh in pieces all the Counſells on Earth, and which is more, God will
worke the raiſing of his Church, by that very meanes by which the enemies ſeeke to ruine it: God
gave to great a price for the Church to ſuffer it long to remaine in the hands of cruell men.</p>
            <p>And for the flouriſh the enemies now make, it is but for a meaſured time, their day is comming, and their Armes
and Armies ſhall both be broken, and ſhall not onely vex, but torment themſelves, to ſee their Projects diſappointed, and
the mould of all their deviſes turned upon their owne heads.</p>
            <p>The depths of miſery, are never below the depths of mercy, God often for this very end, ſtrips the Church of all
helps below, that it may relie onely upon him for help from above; And that it may appeare the Church is
governed by an higher power, then that whereby it is oppoſed. And then is the time when the Church may expect her
greateſt deliverance, when there is a great faith in the great God; then the captivitie of the Church ſhall returne
as Rivers in the South, and ſhe ſhall become a cup of trembling in the hands of her enemies, for the prayers of
the Church cry, the blood of the Saints cry, and the violence of the Enemie themſelves cry, for deliverance
and vengeance. And then an Armie of prayers will ſuddenly turne the ſtreame; a few <hi>Moſeſes</hi> in the Mount
will doe more then many ſouldiers in the valley.</p>
            <p>It is your ſelves keepe <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and his faction alive to plague the unthankefull World, his ſtrength is not
from his owne cauſe, but from your want of zeale and confidence in God: You hinder your <hi>Halalujahs</hi> by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Brabbles, ſelfe-ſeekings; coldneſſe, and formallitie: If God had once his ends, in the humiliation of the
Church for ſinnes paſt, with Reſolution of Reformation for time to come, this preſent age might expect to
ſee the ſalvation of GOD, which the generations at hand ſhall be witneſſe of.</p>
            <p>It will therefore prove the wiſeſt reſolution to fall and riſe with the Church of Chriſt, for the enemies themſelves
ſhall ſee and ſay, God hath done great things for them; Kings ſhall lay their Crownes at Chriſts feet, and bring all their
glory to his Church.</p>
