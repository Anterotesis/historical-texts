            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
RIGHT HONOURABLE
Our Worthy and Grave SENATORS
The LORD MAYOR, and ALDERMEN,
To be ſuddenly communicated and conſulted with the COMMONALTY of
the City of LONDON, in <hi>Common-Councell</hi> Aſſembled.</head>
            <head type="sub">The further humble Petition and Remonſtrance of the <hi>Free-men </hi>and <hi>Prentices
of the City of LONDON.</hi>

            <opener>Humbly acknowledging</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He favour and juſtice you did us in your ſo fatherly Reception of Us and our humble Petition, which is with
our hearty acknowledgement redoubled in us, by Your late Votes of the 9th <hi>December</hi> preſent, wherein (among
other things) You were pleaſed (though We Attended not this Court for Anſwer to Our Petition, it being ſo
ſuddenly called, that We knew not of it) to order Thanks to us for it, (and that the Particulars in our Petition
were under Conſideration) and that upon the Report of the Committee appointed by this Court to Conſider
of the Peace and Safety of this City, that the Militia of the ſame, hath time out of mind been in the Lo. Maior,
Aldermen and Commons of <hi>London,</hi> to Raiſe, Array, and Exerciſe a Militia for their own Defence: Upon
which Report, this Honourable Court Voted the Aſſerting that Power, and gave Directions to a Committee to
Confer with the Lord <hi>Fleetwood</hi> about Setling the ſaid MILITIA; as alſo concerning a FREE PARLIAMENT, as
being the only Expedient for the Peace and Safety of this Nation</p>
            <p>Now ſo it is, May it pleaſe You our Honourable Senators, to give Us leave, out of the ſadneſs of our ſpirits, to breath forth to
You our Fears and Dangers upon the Experience We had of the 5. of this Month, how the Mercenary Souldiers did Murder,
Slay, and Wound many of Us, only to prevent our peaceable Way of Petitioning You for ſuch things as concern'd the Safety
of this City, and well-being of this Nation; that we cannot but be jealous by reaſon of their then barbarous Uſage of Us,
their main DESIGN is to gain Time till a great Body of Horſe of Two thouſand or more be Drawn from other <hi>Parts</hi> into
this City, (which We are not ſenſible of without good Grounds) will be Here in a very Few days; when they will be Able not
only to plant Guns at all our Gates, but make Uſe of thoſe Granadoes and other prepared Inſtruments of Violence to the Ruine
and Deſtruction of the Rights and Liberties of this Famous City: Which done, they will Command Your <hi>Perſons</hi> and
<hi>Purſes</hi> to Satisfie their <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Avarice,</hi> and Charge their Cruelties and Murders upon You and Us, though innocent and
paſſive.</p>
            <p>Out of our great ſenſe and apprehenſion thereof, and as the only means to prevent the evil Conſequences that may follow,
We hold it our Duties for the good and ſafety of this City, and to prevent the michiefs that threaten us, that You will be
pleaſed ſeriouſly and ſuddenly to conſider, that nothing can make this City ſafe, nor us under You, but a ſufficient ſtrength
within us, by which you may defend Your ſelves and us from all ſuch attempts as may be made upon You, and obtain
that univerſally deſired <hi>Free Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore our humble and moſt earneſt Prayer, as You have Voted the Arraying of a Militia for the defence of the
City is in the Lord Maior, Aldermen and Commons of <hi>London,</hi> That You will be pleaſed not to be deluded and delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by thoſe who work wholy by their Plots and Policies to keep all power in their own hands, to Subjugate and Enſlave
the Nation to their own Ambition and Covetouſneſs inſtantly without loſſe of one hours time Night or day, (the
Lords day alſo in this Exigency not exempted, being confident it is his own work,) until You have made Choiſe of the
moſt Valuable and Conſiderable Perſons in this City for Field Officers and Commanders for a Conſiderable Body to
be preſently arrayed within this City for the defence thereof, which if You ſhall delay you may unhappily be acceſſary
to your and our Ruines. And that you may with the more Courage and Confidence proceed therein, we hereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
our Selves, our Lives, and all that's dear to us, if there ſhall be any interruption in this our proceeding, We,
with Sea-men, Water-men, and all other Artizens and Tradſmen of this City (who are in their Lively-hoods and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
engag'd with us herein,) will riſe as one Man in your Defence: which Safe and Honourable way if upon any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
pretence whatſoever (raiſ'd by Subtile Deſigners to Entrap you,) You ſhall not inſtantly purſue to Action, We
have done our parts, and doubt not but GOD will out of his great Mercy and Wiſdome find out a way (though by
weaker means to Accompliſh this great Work, to which Gratious Providence we Commit both You and Our Selves.</p>
