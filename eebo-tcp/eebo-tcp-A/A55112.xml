            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And now these Men would throw all the Dirt they can upon Dissenters, and wipe their Mouthes, as if the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were the only spotless Assembly; there's an Eye open that sees them, and how consciencious sober Men have Suffered by them, many of the Goals in this Kingdom are witnesses thereof; many others Particulars may be taken notice of, in these Orders worthy of observation, wherein that Spirit is manifested, that under the profession of Zeal for God, the Honour of the King, and the Preservation of the Established Religion (as they say) have Persecuted and Ruined many So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And because the Author of the said <hi>Letter to Dissenters</hi> saith, <hi>If you had now to do with those ridged Prelates, &amp;c.</hi> I will give one instance more as before hinted, of a Prelate now, or very lately in being.</p>
            <p>A certain Prelate acting as a Justice of the Peace, with some other Justices, convicted a Meeting of <hi>Dissenters,</hi> twelve Miles from their Homes, on the Oathes of two credible Witnesses, as they say (one of which not long after was convicted for Perjury, and stood in the Pillory for the same) Seven of these <hi>Dissenters</hi> coming before the said Prelate, or Bishop, and because it was so far from their Homes, borrowed each of them a Horse or Mare to ride; being fined Three Pounds a piece, they were all kept Prisoners in the Bishops Palace, until about seven at Night, it being in <hi>February,</hi> and in the mean time all their Horses taken away (tho not their own, nor either of the Owners at the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) and sold or conveyed them away; the Horses were worth Thirty two Pounds Ten Shillings, the Owner of one of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed his Mare for Seven Pound; and it being alledged that the seven Horses were not sufficient to pay the Fine, they ordered them to be had to an Inn, and strip of their Cloaths, it being dark, about seven at Night: One of the Dissenters, when they were come into the Street, said, <hi>They would not go into an Inn, but if they would strip them, they should do it in the Street,</hi> and there made a stand; and a Concourse of People coming about them, and they declaring their unchristian dealing with them, the Executioners were almost ashamed, and left the Prisoners, the Townsmen standing by them, and promised not one Cloath should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, and so they returned with the loss of the seven Horses.</p>
            <p>Now what the Author of the Letter accounts ridgedness is a Question, if these Actions do not render these Men ridged Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, let Men of Moderation judg; many other particulars of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty may be instanced, that Men of Civility and Humanity would even blush to hear of, acted by force of those Laws (utterly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Christianity and Humanity) by <hi>Church of England-Men</hi> upon the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> which these <hi>Devonshire</hi> Men in one of their Orders

               <p>Its left to the serious consideration of all that loves true Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom rather then cruel Bondage, whether it be not far better to accept and trust the King, for the Liberty and Freedom promise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
