         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not ſafe to judge another, yet if the tree may be
known by the fruit, and the ſecret and hidden diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the heart, by words which proceed out of a
mans mouth; then my Lord of Canterbury his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being conſidered, and his laſt Speech examined,
he may be judged otherwayes, then according to that verdict
which he hath pronounced of himſelf in that his laſt Speech: but
to paſſe by his actions, but as they ſhall onely occaſionally inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veen,
we will examine his Speech, without wreſting it to a worſe
ſence then of neceſſity it muſt bear; and as all is not gold that
gliſters, ſo upon review and examination, it will not be found to
be ſo charitable, as by ſome poſitive affirmations it pretends to be,
and all along the Reaſons inforcing will be found contradicting
thoſe affirmative concluſions expreſt therein, whether they intend
himſelf or others; for of himſelf, a great deal of humility and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is affirmed, when much preſumption and want of charitie
may be collected. For preſumption, his ſpeech is full of it, and
chiefly in his compariſons and inſtances: for firſt he compares his
Innocencie with reference to his ſufferings, to Chriſts, in theſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:158507:3"/>
words, that <hi>Jeſus deſpiſed the ſhame for him, God forbid but he ſhould
deſpiſe the ſhame for Jeſus.</hi> In which words, is implyed, that as Chriſts
ſufferings in regard of himſelf were undeſerved, ſo were his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
without any juſt cauſe on his part, but that his ignominy and
ſhame was no leſſe for Chriſts ſake, and for his fidelity to Chriſt,
then Chriſts ſufferings were for his love to mankind; and from
thence concludes, that his hope was, that God was bringing him
to the land of Promiſe, in regard he was to paſſe through the Red
ſea, alluding to his ſuffering by the effuſion of his blood: but he
could not be ignorant that it was <hi>cauſa non paena</hi> that makes the
Martyr; and therefore his argument will onely hold if his cauſe
were juſt, and that he ſuffered undeſervedly: but if otherwayes, his
paſſage through the Red ſea, or his forced paſſage out of this
world by a violent death, will prove but a weak argument, that
God was therefore bringing him to a land of Promiſe, for then no
death, ſo deſirable as a violent death, if it were a concluding argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that therefore, he who is forced to ſuffer, is entring into a
land of Promiſe. Neither doth his next inſtance conclude better,
that becauſe the Paſſeover was to be eaten with ſowre herbes, that
therefore his preſent ſufferings (which he confeſſeth that in regard
of his weakneſſe and infirmity of fleſh and blood, were unpleaſing
and unwelcome unto him) ſhould by their reſemblance into ſowre
herbs, prove, his forced ſubmiſſion unto death to be either a Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
or a willing ſubmiſſion to the will of God: for whoſoever ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
onely to the will of God when he cannot otherwayes chooſe,
ſubmits not to the will of God, but is compelled by neceſſitie. And
by the words following, it appears plainly, that whatſoever he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to the contrary, yet was he angry with the hands that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
thoſe herbs, or brought him to that place to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>And out of all queſtion had it been as much in his power to have
prevented their purpoſes, by executing of vengeance, as it had
been formerly to inflict puniſhment on thoſe who did profeſſe any
diſlike againſt his and other the Prelates unwarrantable uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
nothing on his part ſhould have been referred to the juſtice
of God, but if he himſelf could not call down fire from heaven to
conſume them, he would have raiſed a perſecution upon earth to
ſcourge them. But the date of his power was now expired, yet did
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:158507:3"/>
his indignation remain which he did not conceal, but when he
could do no more he did think it fit to put the good people in
mind, that <hi>when the ſervants of God, old Iſrael, were in this boyſterous
Sea and Aaron with them, the Egyptians which perſecuted them, and did
in a manner drive them into that Sea, were drowned in the ſame waters,
while they were in purſuit of them; and he knows, his God whom be ſerved,
is as able to deliver him from this ſea of blood, as he was to deliver the 3 Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
from the furnace,</hi> Dan. 3. In which words are implyed two
things; the firſt is hope of vengeance from God on thoſe that did
proſecute him. The ſecond is hope of a temporall deliverance to
himſelf. The firſt argueth want of charitie; the ſecond implyeth
want of true faith, or which is equivalent an erroneous faith.</p>
            <p>And what is implyed here is evidenced in the words following,
by which <hi>he moſt humbly thanks his Saviour, that his reſolution was now
as theirs was then; their reſolution was, that they would not worſhip the
Image which the King had ſet up, nor ſhall be the imaginations which the
people are ſetting up, nor will forſake the Temple and truth of God, to follow
the bleating of Jeroboams Calves in Dan and in Bethel.</hi> Where nothing
is or can be clearer, then the manifeſt difference and diſſimilitude
between the different conditions of the ſeverall parties propoſed,
and from the reſult, the grounds of his faith will appear. For the
3. Children, to whom he doth reſemble himſelf, were meerly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
preferring a paſſive ſufferance before any actuall obedience,
to unlawfull and prohibited Idolatry: Whereas on the contrary,
he was brought to that place of execution, for his active introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of reall changes in the worſhip of God, expreſly againſt the
Word of God, and the Laws of the Land. For by the Word of God,
we are taught that we muſt not make to our ſelves any graven
Image, nor the likeneſſe of any thing that is in heaven above, nor
in the earth beneath, nor in the waters under the earth, to bow
down to them, and worſhip them: and we are moreover taught by
the ſame Word, that the Judiciall and Ceremoniall Law being
fulfilled by the death of Chriſt, all externall worſhipping of God,
ariſing from any Commandment either of God or man, is in it ſelf
inacceptable before God, and therefore ſuperfluous and needleſſe:
If not firſt ſpringing from a true and lively faith, begetting true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
and inward ſanctification, and by conſequence onely, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:158507:4"/>
reverence and worſhip, and therefore the chief duty of the
Miniſters of the Goſpel, is by information and inſtruction to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
in the people true knowledge as a foundation of ſound belief,
from whence onely ſpringeth true faith; and then to incite them
to externall duties, as evidences of their faith, but have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from the Word of God to injoyn or command any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
duties, but to exhort onely to the performance of thoſe which
were commanded and ordained by God himſelf: neither had they
ever any ſpirituall authority committed unto them for the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of obedience unto any thing that ſhould be ordained by
themſelves: For the Apoſtles never had, nor never exerciſed any
ſuch authority. In brief, the ſumme of all is briefly thus, that as
under the Law, all bowing down to any graven Image, and the
worſhipping of God in the likeneſſe of any thing in heaven or in
earth was Idolatry: So under the Goſpel, which was the end and
conſummation of the Law, all externall worſhip of God that doth
not ſpring from faith, as from the root, is to be accounted Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as being a counterfeit worſhip ſet up by the imagination of
men, not according to the will of God. And my Lord of Cant.
doth here in ſome ſort acknowledge this for a truth, but removes
the guilt from himſelf to lay it upon the people; for here he doth
account the worſhipping of God according to the imaginations
of the people to be Idolatry; but doth not conſider that what he
eſteemed Idolatry in them, might be in himſelf. If he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
no better warrant then his own imaginations, for with God
there is no reſpect of perſons; but then the queſtion will be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was brought to that place to ſuffer, for refuſing to ſubmit to
that idolatry, which here he affirmeth was ſetting up by the people,
or for impoſing upon them a will worſhip according to his own
imaginations onely? And if he himſelf had given the anſwer, he
could not ſay that the people did impoſe any thing upon him in
the worſhip of God, but it was apparent and undeniable that he
did upon the people: for doing whereof he neglected his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Office conſiſting chiefly in Information, Inſtruction, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation;
thereby to convince the conſcience, which is uncapable
of conſtraint from the authority of man, and uſurped an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which is onely peculiar to God, and cannot be communicated
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:158507:4"/>
to man: for which the people notwithſtanding were not his
Judges, but the Law of the Land, againſt which he did no leſſe
tranſgreſſe, for impoſing upon the people any thing by a lawleſſe
authority not warranted by the Laws, then he did offend againſt
the Word of God by uſurping a ſpirituall authority not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Word. For the Law of the Land reſtraineth the making
of all Laws and conſtitutions, and the impoſing of any new thiug
upon the Subjects of this Kingdome, to the Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
And albeit the Clergy might aſſemble in Convocation,
yet were all their Acts and Conſtitutions of no force nor validity,
untill confirmed and ratified by Parliament: whereas my Lord of
Canterbury did not onely innovate many things in the worſhip of
God, but did introduce and impoſe many new things in the
Church by his own authority, and in the State by his credit with
the King by the Regall Power, directly againſt the Laws of the
Kingdom, for which he was at that time brought upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
to ſuffer, not becauſe he did preferre a paſſive ſufferance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an actuall obedience to unlawfull and prohibited Idolatry as
did the 3. Children; but becauſe he did exact obedience from
others to his lawleſſe commands, without any warrant from the
Word of God, nor from the Laws of the Land, but by an uſurped
authority over both: wherefore his caſe can no wayes be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the 3. Childrens, but without any injury done to him, he
may juſtly be taxed with preſumption for his paralels or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons.</p>
            <p>And as his preſumptions are notorious, ſo is his want of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
manifeſt, notwithſtanding his ſeeming profeſſions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as appeareth in his next Section, which he beginneth with
a charitable prayer, <hi>That God would bleſſe all this people, and open their
eyes, that they may ſee the right way.</hi> The which his charity doth ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
and end in himſelf, which is not charity, for charity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
chiefly to others; and the inference which he maketh,
doth diſcover the ſumme of his deſires for a bleſſing upon this
people, for the opening of their eyes to be chiefly meant, that they
might ſee and acknowledge his Innocencie which he doth here
preſent to their conſideration, not obſcurely implyed, but poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirmed againſt all accuſation whatſoever by the atteſtation of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:158507:5"/>
his own conſcience: <hi>Having upon this occaſion ranſacked every corner of
his heart, where he hath not found any of his ſins that are there, deſerving
death by the known Laws of the Land.</hi> Certainly he was not, nor could
he be ſo ignorant, as here he pretends to be innocent; for he could
not chooſe but know that it was death by the known Laws of
this Kingdom, for any Subject to innovate againſt the eſtabliſhed
Government. But ſuppoſing there had been no poſitive Law againſt
it, yet was it to have been eſteemed an unpardonable crime deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the moſt rigorous of deaths for any Subject to attempt it; no
leſſe then it had been in an Athenian to murther his own father,
when the Laws were ſilent for the puniſhment, as preſuppoſing no
ſuch crime would be committed: nor could his conſcience be ſo
ſeared as not to dictate unto him, that he was the adviſer to the
King, needleſly to aſſume an arbitrary power, for the introducing
of many things, whereof he himſelf was the chief Author, againſt
the known Laws of the Land. And if nothing elſe had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
yet one thing was ſo manifeſt, that it needed no proof at all,
the aſſuming of a Legiſlative power, by making of Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
in a Provinciall Aſſembly, binding to the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and Clergy in generall, to be inforced by Spirituall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or Eccleſiaſticall cenſures; and impoſing a generall tax upon
the Clergy without any confirmation but of the Kings Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
which was a manifeſt uſurpation over the conſciences of
men, and a breach againſt the fundamentall Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the King himſelf having no ſuch power nor prerogative,
and former Kings having never aſſumed it; beſides the cheat which
he did put upon the King in perſwading his Majeſtie to eſtabliſh
that by his Prerogative, which was not onely derogatory, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to his Prerogative, as ſhall be opened more pertinently
hereafter; and yet he would here perſwade the people he dieth
innocently, not deſerving death. For which his undeſerved ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
notwithſtanding he is ſo charitable, as <hi>to charge nothing, not
in the leaſt degree upon his Judges, for they are to proceed by proof, by valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
witneſſes, and in that way he or any Innocent in the world may juſtly be
condemned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he had ended here, it had been againſt charity not to beleeve
him; but as fire cannot long be concealed, after it hath taken hold
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:158507:5"/>
any combuſtible matter, but will break forth and appear: So the
fire of his indignation againſt his Judges, being kindled in his
breaſt, muſt needs break forth in deſpite of diſſimulation, and his
next words demonſtrate clearly what opinion he had of his
Judges, whom he compareth to the <hi>Danes</hi> when Heathens, to the
fury of <hi>Wat Tyler,</hi> and his fellows, to the malice of <hi>a lewd woman,</hi>
to a <hi>perſecuting Sword,</hi> and laſtly to <hi>Herod,</hi> and to the <hi>perſecuting
Jews,</hi> and maketh <hi>the charge againſt himſelf to look like that againſt St.
Paul, in the 25. of the Acts, and againſt St. Stephen in the 6. of the Acts.</hi>
To whoſe caſes his had no more reſemblance then it had to the
3. Childrens; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> were perſecuted for
opening the kingdome of heaven, by ſhewing a clear way to enter
therein, by a true and lively faith, grounded upon the death and
mediation of Jeſus Chriſt onely, without any reference to our
ſelves, and our own merits. But he on the contrary did what in
him lay to ſhut the kingdome of heaven to ſuch as was deſirous to
enter, directing them into falſe wayes, ſuch as could never bring a
man thither. For if the old Iſraelites, by following after the Lavv
of righteouſneſſe attained not into the Law of righteouſneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of
the Law, <hi>Rom. 9. 31, 32.</hi> and therefore were excluded from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes;
what muſt become of them, who going about to eſtabliſh
not the righteouſneſſe of the Law, which once was the ordinance
of God, but a righteouſneſſe of their own preſcription, conſiſting
for the moſt part in externall rites and ceremonies, commanding
the obſervation of them as the principall part of Gods worſhip
and of mans duty; when in the mean time they neglect the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God which is their Miniſteriall office, conſiſting chiefly
in reforming of the will, and informing the underſtanding, by the
operation of the Word preached, which may be performed by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
and Inſtruction; but can never by any authority or
command, for there is a vaſt difference between him, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth
the production of deſired effects by the operation of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
and appointed means, and him who commands onely the
performance of the like effects, without the application of ſuch
means as are neceſſary: for the one requireth an omnipotent
power; the other may be performed by a creature of a finite capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:158507:6"/>
What affinity or reſemblance then can my Lord of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buries
caſe have with St. <hi>Pauls</hi> or St. <hi>Stephens,</hi> who ſuffered under
the rage of the people for offering their pains, to ſhew them onely,
a clear and infallible way for purchaſing the kingdom of heaven,
which was left to their own choice to beleeve or not beleeve? But
my Lord of Cant. neglecting the wayes of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
(conſiſting onely in demonſtration and in the efficacy of perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the obtaining of their purpoſes and ends) was legally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſed
and condemned, for making uſe of externall force, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
for the obtaining of his, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> nor St. <hi>Stephen</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did: and moreover, he having ſcrewed himſelf into the favour
of the King, did make the Regall Power inſtrumentall to his ends,
and (which among other things is inexcuſable) did endeavour to
lay the odium and obloquy of all upon the King when it could not
otherwayes be defended; as if that had been ſufficient, that he was
onely inſtrumentall to the Kings commands, when it was too well
known that he was the director of thoſe commands. And as his
caſe differed from theirs in the means, ſo muſt it differ likewiſe in
the ends, for the end of all their labour and pains, was to bring
men in ſubjection to the will of God, by declaring unto them the
power of God and of the Deity, and manifeſting the inexpreſſible
love of God to mankind, in ſending his onely begotten Son into
the world to take upon him our humane nature, and expounding
unto them the vertue and efficacy of Chriſts death and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but the end of his labour and pains, was to bring men in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to his own will, by making them ſenſible how dangerous
it was to offend him. For he took more pains to inflict puniſhment
on ſuch as offended him, then to inſtruct ſuch as were ignorant.</p>
            <p>But odious is his next compariſon, comparing himſelf with
Chriſt, and his accuſers to the Phariſes, who having accuſed Chriſt
for fear, that <hi>if they did let him alone, all men would beleeve on him, and
the Romans would come and take away both their place and Nation.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
from thence, with a prayer to God, that God would not
reward this people as then he did the Jews for their cauſleſſe fears
and unjuſt ſentence; but the caſes being ſo different, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons
ſo odious, it were a ſuperfluous labour to go about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
any mans underſtanding in the diſcovery. Nor needs any
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:158507:6"/>
time be ſpent in detecting his vain preſumption, and arrogant
boaſting in applying that deſerved triumph of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
as if he could no leſſe truely, then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did, ſay, <hi>by
honour and diſhonour, by good report, and evill report, as a deceiver
and yet true, he was now paſſing out of this world,</hi> for it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
that he coveted and courted that honour, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
accompted but loſſe and dung, and did runne a cleer contrary
courſe to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> accompted it no ſhame,
<hi>To the weake to become as weak,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 28.</note> 
               <hi>that he might gaine the weake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nor to be made all things to all men, that he might by all meanes ſave
ſome,</hi> but hee accompted it not onely a ſhame but an indignity,
to condiſcend one jot to the weakneſſe of any man, and rather
then hee ſhould bee croſſed in his purpoſe and will,
thoſe gifts and abilities, which God had beſtowed upon him,
for other purpoſes and ends, and that credit and eſteeme which
he had purchaſed with his Majeſty, by thoſe gifts and abilities,
and in reverence of the holineſſe of his calling, ſhould bee all
imployed to ingage King and Kingdome in a War, as was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by the Warre with Scotland, eſpecially after the firſt paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
at the camp neer Barwicke.</p>
            <p>But having taken all this paines in a generall juſtification of
himſelf to the people, who were his Auditors at length he thinkes
of it not amiſſe to ſpeak of ſome particulars, and firſt <hi>is he bold to
ſpeake of the King,</hi> who he ſaith <hi>hath bin much traduced by ſome for
labouring to bring in Popery,</hi> which he might truely affirme, If
any ſuch affirmation had been made of His Majeſty but the truth
hereof is prevaricated as other truths are by him, and made uſeof,
for his own juſtification rather then for the Kings, the King being
rather aſperſed then juſtified by ſuch manner of juſtification, for
no man did ever affirme that the King was a Papiſt as is here
implyed, nor that His Majeſtie did labour to bring in Popery as
is here affirmed, but that he was overreached by the ſubtilty
and fraud of ſome, and he himſelfe eſteemed the principall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
and undermyner of the King, and it alwayes hath been
one of his chiefeſt ſubtilties, ſo to confound the Kings actions
and his owne, that they could not eaſily be diſtinguiſhed, that
by ſo doing he might never be reached but by wounding the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:158507:7"/>
King firſt, building thereby great hopes, if not aſſured confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to eſcape himſelfe, and here labouring to juſtifie himſelfe
to the People, from having ever had any intention to introduce
Popery, he purpoſly makes mention of the King, for whoſe
purpoſes &amp; intentions he might ſafely take any deep Proteſtation,
as if that conduced much to clear himſelf in the opinion of his
Auditors (which was the chiefe thing he now aimed at) of all
practices tending to that end, as a thing impoſſible for him to
bring about, without the concurrent conſent of the King,
which was but a fancy but no ſolid argument neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
what he would have beleeved, for the worke might be
advancing, without any diſcovery in the King, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
tending to ſuch an end, untill ſuch time that it ſhould
be too late, if not impoſſible to retire, as a Deere may be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
into a toyle, not ſuſpecting any danger, but having leiſure
at ſome times to feed by the way, untill ſuch time as ſeeing and
apprehending his owne danger, by being unawares reduced to
ſuch a ſtraight as doth leave him no variety of choice, but to
place his onely ſafety and meanes of eſcape in leapping into that
ſnare which had been prepared for him, and to which much
paines had been taken to drive him; for it is not to be imagined,
that either his Majeſtie or any other Chriſtian King, ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themſelves to the bondage of Popery if they rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
what they did, for (to paſſe by the danger which it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to their ſoules, by leading them into by-pathes of errour
which can never bring them to heaven,) it ſubjects all temporall
authority into a vaſſalage and ſubordination to its ſpirituall, and
that not ſo much by any accident or contingency ariſing from
the different diſpoſitions of the ſeverall perſons who ſit upon the
ſeverall thrones ſpirituall and temporall (which may be turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
and ambition in the one, and infirmity and weaknes in the
other) as by the very principles and Fundamentall conſtitution
of Popery, by reaſon of the acknowledgement of, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
into a ſpirituall authority, being once rooted and firmely
fixed in the beliefe or imagination by all who embrace it, and
the naturall effects which doe neceſſarily ſpring from thence;
For when the world was blinded by ignorance as by darkneſſe,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:158507:7"/>
at what time the Popes did ſit as God in the Temple of God and
by their ſpirituall authority in excommunicating and abſolving
whom they pleaſed, and for what they pleaſed, did uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably
oppoſe and exalt themſelves above all that is called God,
that is above all Magiſtracy and power in earth: What lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and ſad effects, did Chriſtendome groane under and feel
from ſuch tranſcendent and omnipotent a Power, ſo long as
from a generall beliefe, it was univerſally ſubmitted unto? But
when mens eyes began once to be opened, and by the cleer light
of the truth revealed in Scripture, ſome men did cleerly ſee and
perceive that no ſuch power was ever, nor could be given into
any one man upon earth, yet the apprehenſion of ſuch a power
and authority, that it was given unto ſome, being ſunke deeply
into all mens underſtandings, great difference did ariſe where
the ſame ſhould reſide, and all men acknowledging it to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the Clergy onely, did place it amongſt them as it were by
a generall conſent, in ſome one of thoſe formes which are
knowen to be beſt capable to preſerve authority, all or the moſt
part of all concluding that it muſt be preſerved in one of them,
each imbracing and ſubmiting into that forme, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
and made choice of by thoſe who bare the greateſt ſway,
or had the greateſt eſteem and reputation with them, but none of
them foreſeeing into all effects and events which might follow,
hath bin the chief cauſe why ſo much diſcord &amp; contention hath
riſen and continued, which will never be wanting ſo long as the
cauſe remains, that is, until it be clearly underſtood what the pow-of
the Church, and of Churchmen is, whether any ſuch thing as
ſpirituall authority doth appertain to them, &amp; by what right, and
to what end, whether or no, it be conducing to Religion, or be
compatible with the end of government, for albeit there be no
ſuch thing as ſpirituall authority acknowledged, yet all power is
not thereby taken away from the Church, but the conſequence
will only be, that the power of the Church, &amp; of Church-men, is
no more then opperative, and declarative, not at all authoritative,
and having no authority, they can have no legiſlative power
of making Lawes and conſtitutions, (call them by what name ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they will) binding to the conſcience, having no penalties
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:158507:8"/>
to inforce obedience; and why ſhould any ſuch thing as ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
authority be admitted to be when it cannot be evidenced
what execution doth follow, for authority without execution
ceaſeth to be authority by loſing its vertue, for if authority ſay
to one go, he muſt go, or to another come, he muſt come, and
likewiſe to a third, doe this, he muſt do it, but no Clergy man
nor Miniſter of the Goſpel can ſay, enter thou into heaven, and
goe thou into hell, all hee can ſay is, thus beleeve and do, and
thou ſhall be ſaved, but if otherwiſe you will be damned, but
both the doing and beleeving dependeth upon the hearers owne
choice, nothing is determined by the appointment of the
Miniſter, all that reſts in the power of the Miniſter is to declare
to others, the effectuall meanes of their ſalvation, from the
revealed will of God, to which whoſoever ſubmits
by a voluntary profeſſion teſtifying his beliefe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of baptiſme which is the ſeale of his beliefe, but
brings not forth fruit according to his Profeſſion, and walkes
not according to the rules ſet down in Scripture, and will not
be convinced nor reclaimed by no admonition nor reproofe,
then may the Miniſter ſafely and boldly pronounce that he is ſtill
in the ſtate and condition of an Infidell and unbeleever, no
more capable of any thing that may accrue unto him by the
death and mediation of Chriſt then a heathen or pagane, and
therefore may debar him from admiſſion into the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
which is, or ought to be, the Communion of Saints or
true beleevers, and is Gods Sacrament to us, that is to ſay his
Covenant and ſeal unto us, of the fruits and benefits, that we
hope for hereafter, by vertue of Chriſts death and reſurrection,
but the party offending is not preſently caſt into hell by that
ſentence, and though hell fire may follow upon it hereafter, yet
is it not the Miniſters ſentence, nor the debarring him ſrom the
Sacrament, that doth ſend him thither, but his want of faith,
which is made evident and nortorious, by no ſingle act of any
declared ſinne, but by an obſtinate perſerverance in any one ſin
or more that hath been judged already by the unappealable
judgement of God, to be an evidence of want of faith in him
who commits it, and doth take pleaſure and delight into it,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:158507:8"/>
which is made manifeſt and apparent to men by a perſeverance
in it onely; and therefore it is the ſentence of God, and not of
the Miniſter, the Miniſter being onely Gods Herauld or meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
to declare to others the revealed will of God, and for
doing thereof he hath an expreſſe warrant from God recorded
in Scripture; nor muſt it be any part of the Miniſters purpoſe to
ſend any man to hell (but purpoſe and intention of doing exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
upon the offender is eſſentiall to authority and inſeparable
from it) but onely to prevent (what in him lieth) his going
thither: for albeit that the Miniſters ſentence, being rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
be ratified in heaven, (which is undenyable) yet
may it be recalled again, but never at the Miniſters will and
pleaſure (which at ſometimes is incident to authority) but by
the contrition and repentance of the obſtinate party publikely
promiſing, and vowing his amendment, upon which evidence the
Miniſter may pronounce his abſolution receiving him again into
the boſome of the Church, and admitt him againe into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints, and this ſentance is likewiſe ratifyed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
If the parties repentance be unfained and ſincere, which
notwithſtanding may be hypocriticall and diſſembled in him,
albeit he doth refraine and forbeare from the performance of
that wherein he gave the offence and ſcandall, and doth moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
proceede to amendment of his life, not onely in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
but doth walke unblameably and without any deſerved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
from the judgment of men in all other, howſoever upon
a viſible purpoſe of amendment, the Miniſter not onely may, but
muſt receive him againe into the boſome of the Church, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him againe into the holy Communion with others, ſo that
nothing is left to the will of the Miniſter, nor to the finall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Miniſter, but all is referred to the will and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, and where will and knowledge are excluded, their
Authority is wanting, and though much may be effected and
brought to paſſe by them, yet whatſoever is effected deſerves not
the name as differing from the nature of Authority: and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Chriſt having no Authority in thoſe things wherein
they cannot ere ſo long as they follow the cleare light revealed
in Scripture, they can much leſſe have any Authority for ſuch
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:158507:9"/>
things which flow from their owne Invention, nor can they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
obedience by any ſpirituall meanes or cenſures of the
Church, unto any thing whereof they themſelves are Authors,
when no ſpirituall meanes are compulſive in regard of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
that muſt apply them, and whatſoever efficacy or vertue
they have, yet may they never be applyed for the inforcing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing whereof man is Author, for then it would follow that
the will of man or ſomething proceeding from the will of man
would be a rule to the Juſtice of God, when one man muſt be as
a Publican, or Heathen and conſequently uncapable of the fruits
of Chriſts death, for diſobeying onely the will, or ſomething de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon the will of another, which no man dares to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
and having no compulſive meanes to inforce obedience,
they can have no legiſlative power of making of cannons and
conſtitutions binding to the conſcience, for a law without a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
or power ſufficient to inforce it, is no law, nor neede they
have any ſuch power, for ſuch a power is not conducible at all
to that end of Religion which is committed to them, &amp; to their
care and paines, but is deſtructive to the end of government; for
Religion hath a two fold end, the one reſpecteth God, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, the end of religion in reſpect of God is to glorify God,
that man who was therefore created to glorify his Maker ſhould
by a true knowledge of the true God glorify him aright, and the
end of religion in reſpect of man, is to bring a man from all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in himſelfe or the creature, to rely upon the Providence
and goodneſſe of God who is the Creator, to the end he may
renounce his own righteouſneſſe to be made partaker of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and Righteouſneſſe of the Sonne of God, the Redeemer of
Mankinde, that by faith in him he may obtaine grace and ſome
meaſure of ſanctification in this life, for the remiſſion of ſinnes,
and fruition of Glory hereafter: and for this end of religion no
humane lawes do contribute any thing at all, for unto this the
Scriptures are ſufficient being compleate in themſelves, and the
chiefe duty of the Miniſters of the Goſpell is to explaine and
expound the true meaning of ſcripture to others, for doing
whereof they ſhould be learned in all neceſſary learning and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as alſo have a lawfull Calling by a lawfull Ordination, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:158507:9"/>
for which it is very fit that they be ſet apart from all other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and have a ſufficient maintenance that they may the
better attend that to which they are called; but for the other
end to glorify God, humane lawes doe contribute much, but
they are required of Chriſtian Kings and Magiſtrates, and not of
Chriſtian Miniſters, for God did from the begining put Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
into the hands of the Magiſtrate, and endowed them with
effectuall meanes for inforcing of obedience to what ſhould be
commanded by them, ſo did he never in the hands of the Prieſts
and Levites under the Law, nor of the Apoſtles under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
and by conſequence into the hands of no Miniſters what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſucceeding them, and God doth require of the Magiſtrate
to improve his Authority (which is the talent that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him) for the gaining of others by force and compulſion,
(when no other meanes will prevaile) to the performance of
thoſe dutyes that are required of them, as he requires of all who
are called to labour in the Miniſteriall function and office, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their gifts and graces (which are the talents beſtowed upon
them) painfully and dilligently for the enlightning of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of others, whereby every exalted thought and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be brought downe, which the Magiſtrates Power and
Authority can never reach, for the Power of the Magiſtrate
reacheth no further then to the outward life &amp; converſation, when
the operation of the Miniſtry ſubdueth the will, and therefore the
principall care of the Magiſtrate is and ought to be to enforce
men to live uprightly and juſtly as they ought to doe, for by ſo
doing men glorify God, but this is not all, the glory that is to be
performed by man to God, for beſides there muſt be a ready
ſubmiſſion to the Will of God, ſpringing from a perfect love to
God, and grounded upon an aſſured confidence of Gods love to
us, which may be begotten and kindled in a man, but can never
be inforced, and to this duty tendeth the Miniſters paines and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
but it is and ought to be the Chriſtian Magiſtrates care to
provide for all that can onely be introduced by force and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
in the Service of God, wherefore the ſeverall ends of
Magiſtracy and of the Miniſtry are different but not contrary, but
the ſeverall meanes by which they attaine their ends are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:158507:10"/>
different but contrary, and thoſe meanes which are effectuall
to the one, are not only ineffectuall but uſeleſſe to the other, for
the Magiſtrate can never attaine that end to which his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
conduceth by no perſwation nor information onely, nor can
the Miniſter ſubdue the will nor informe the underſtanding by
any Authority from or in himſelfe, and both of them have their
Commiſſion immediately from God, and each of them are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the other without any ſubordination of offices from the
one to the other, for the Magiſtrate is no leſſe ſubject to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the word from the mouth of the Miniſter then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man whatſoever, and the Miniſter againe is as much ſubject
to the Authority of the Magiſtrate as any other Subject whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and therefore though there be no ſubordination of offices,
yet is there of Perſons, the Perſon of the Miniſter remaining a
Subject, but not the function of the Miniſtry, but there needes
not two Tribunalls nor Independent Courts be erected to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for their ſeverall ends and dutyes required of them, for the
Miniſter can never attaine the end of his labours, by no Judiciall
proceſſe nor legall proceedings whatſoever, and therefore all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
courts are needeleſſe and uſeleſſe to his ends, yet are they
not ſo to himſelfe having other ends then what are required of
him for the diſcharge of his duty and function, but it is eſſentiall
to the Magiſtrate to have a tribunall and judiciall Courts, for the
attaining of his ends and duties required of him, without which
he can never diſcharge his dutie as he ought, but whenſoever the
like Tribunall is erected in the Church as is neceſſary in the
State, they muſt be Independent one of another in regard the
ſeverall offices governing Church and State are ſo, but all that is
to be got by Independant Tribunalls, is either diſſention and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
which is the uſuall fruite that deviſion of Authority bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
or by compliance to provide for one anothers Intereſts, or
particular ends differing from their publick dutyes, with the
manifeſt loſſe of true religion on both ſides, which many times
drawes downe the Judgment of God upon one or both, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a third perſon no leſſe interreſſed in Juſtice and Honour then
either, and many times the Juſtice of God is moſt greeveous
when leaſt apprehended, as ſuffering men to wallow in their ſins
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:158507:10"/>
to dye in ſecurity, nor is it a ſmall Judgment to leave men to the
neceſſary effects, which diviſion of Authority produceth: for the
end of all government is the preſervation of humane ſociety, the
meanes of doing whereof is by union and unity, and Authority
is the effectuall meanes of producing and propagating unity?
and therefore whenſoever Authority is divided, Vnitie may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
and ſometimes muſt admit of diviſion which deſtroyes it,
for unity and diviſion are deſtructive one of another, and when
two Tribunalls are erected for the determining of ſeverall and
different cauſes and crimes, both armed with a forcible Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
weilding ſwords of a different nature, agreable to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
conſtitutions, and without any dependency and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
the one to the other, what laſting concord and agreement
can there be beweene theſe two, they that mannage them muſt
be juſter then men are knowne to be, or advantages will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
when given by the one, (as no ſublunary ſubſtances which
are ſubject to change can remaine long in an equall ballance)
for ſubjecting the other; and therefore it was, when the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
world did by a generall conſent beleeve that the Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a ſword though inviſible, for the cutting off of all ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
and refractory Members, no leſſe really and truly then the
State hath a viſible materiall ſword, which for the preſervation
of union and unity, was eſteemed neceſſary to be put into the
hands of one, and therefore willingly ſubmitted their necks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Imaginary ſtroake thereof, from the ſentence of Popes,
or Biſhops of Rome; How eaſie was it for them by reaſon ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to ſubject all Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates unto a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
and ſubordination unto them and their Authority, and
how did they trouble the Chriſtian world, by transferring of
rights and ſtirring up of rebellion whenſoever any of thoſe
Princes did oppoſe them, or contradict their wills by a ſuppoſed
Intrenching upon their pretended Prerogatives though uſurped<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but when the Popes right began to be queſtioned by ſome,
whereby his reputation did decline, even amongſt thoſe who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing
ſtill to the doctrine of the Church of Rome as to that in
which they had beene educated and bred, yet did not beleeve his
cenſures to be ſo dreadfull as before they apprehended them to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:158507:11"/>
be; but the edge of his ſword being thereby blunted, and the
edge of the temporall ſword being not onely viſible but ſharpe,
the advantage returned to Princes, whereby thoſe Princes who
continued in union with the Church of Rome, profeſſing ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and obedience to the ſpirituall Authority thereof, doe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
now reduce that power and Authority to which
they profeſſe ſubjection, unto a ſubordination of them and their
Authority to be directed by them, which will be of no longer
permanency, then that Church can inſnare the world againe to
an apprehenſion and beleife of the reality of their power, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
which they continually indeavour and aſpire, and have
no ſmall hopes from the differences and diviſions amongſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
for the increaſing and fomenting whereof it is not to be
imagined that they are idle; but whatſoever their hopes and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
are, their greateſt ſtrength remaineth in this, that it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
beleeved that the Church hath a ſpirituall Authority for
the cutting off of all ſchiſmaticall Members, and that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is to be preſerved in ſome one forme or other without
any derivation thereof from any humane power, for
then it cleerely and undoubtedly followeth, that whoſoever by
ſuch principles of reaſon taken from the end of government doth
incline to Monarchy, and that this ſpirituall Authority can beſt
be preſerved by the Supremacy of one man, then the Biſhops of
Rome, having had for a long time, and for a long ſucceſſion, and
ſtill having the poſſeſſion, beſides other advantages of greatneſſe
and power which begetteth ſtrength and reputation, muſt and
will be acknowledged by all thoſe to be the onely ſpirituall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
in the Church armed with ſpirituall Authority; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
out of prejudice againſt the Church of Rome, taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her by reaſon of either her errours or abuſes, or both, doth
ſeperate themſelves from the Communion of that Church, and by
conſequence onely free themſelves from her ſubjection, but doe
notwithſtand adheare to and retaine the grounds of thoſe errours
and abuſes, by acknowledging and beleeving that the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Authority (which was preſuppoſed to have beene abuſed
by the Popes and Biſhops of Rome as Vſurpers onely over the
reſt of the Clergy, or too great a power and conſequently dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:158507:11"/>
in the hands of any one man) is not onely lawfull but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
as being Inherent in the function, and eſſentiall for the
preſervation of union and unity, to be preſerved in ſome other
forme which they agree upon and like better then the incontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
Supremacie of one man, then this doth neceſſarily follow,
that albeit they free themſelves from all the errours and abuſes
which were introduced by the Supreamicie of one man, yet ſo
long as they acknowledge that the ſame power and Authority is
reſident in others, they can never free themſelves of all errours
and abuſes which are introducible by Authority, but that the
property and condition of things in themſelves indifferent will
be changed from being indifferent and converted into the nature
and neceſſity of abſolute duties, which ever begets bondage
and ſubjection, and ſenſe of bondage doth ever beget deſire of
liberty, which can never be obtained ſo long as the opinion of a
neceſſity of Authority in ſome forme or other is retained; and
experience hath now taught us, what could not be foreſeene by
reaſon alone, without ſome additionall helpe from divine illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
that in the Church of England which did not onely
ſhake off the Supreamicie of the Pope, but had purged her ſelfe
of all thoſe errours which had either crept in, or were introduced
by the power of that Supreamicie, by retaining of Biſhops, and
giving them a part onely of that ſpirituall Authority, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
was acknowledged to Popes, and though quallifying that
part by reſtraining it from all legiſlative power, or a power to
inact any thing, but allowing it a Power of Iudicature, the
effectuall operation and proper working of that part of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Authority, hath now fully manifeſted it ſelfe to tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogate
ſuperſtition and errour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather then the ſincerity and truth
of Religion; and as the naturall motions of different bodies, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in quality and ſubſtance tend to different centers, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
motion of Epiſcopacy, hath now diſcovered it ſelfe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
continually to unite it ſelfe to ſuch a head to which it is
capable to aſpire, rather then to be in ſubjection under ſuch a
head to which it hath no capacity to aſpyre, and that received
principle of State, that Epiſcopacy, is a ſupport to Monarchy, is
now likewiſe diſcovered to be fraudulent and deceitefull, for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:158507:12"/>
it is true that it is a ſupport to a ſpirituall Monarchy or Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
in the Church, as being the baſis and foundation thereof,
but doth undermine and deſtroy Monarchy in the State, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in that State which doth truſt unto it as to a ſupporter, and
the reaſon is cleere, for all ſupporters which have no ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
doe ruinate thoſe buildings, which are erected upon them
being of greater weight and ſubſtance then the foundation can
beare, and the foundation of Epiſcopacy being layed in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing
of ſpirituall Authority or Eccleſiaſticall cenſures; Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Authority it ſelfe hath no other exiſtence nor being, but
what it hath in the Imagination and beleefe, which is too ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
a ground to ſupport a ſolid ſubſtance, ſuch as temporall
Monarchy is, but may be ſufficient to ſupport an aery and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
bulk, ſuch as ſpirituall Monarchy is, which Epiſcopacy not
only ſupports, but continually tends towards as to its proper cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and my Lord of Cant. when he obtained the Kings good will
to confirme by his Letters Patents, the late Canons, did put a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
cheate upon his Majeſty, for thereby the Kings Supreamicy
in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall was cut off, and from thence forth his
Supreamicy over Eccleſiaſticall perſons ſhould have been rather
titular then reall, If the conſent of Parliament could as eaſily have
been obtained as his Majeſties own: But to conclud this part of
my Lord of Cant. Speech he might ſafely proteſt upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
that his Majeſty was a ſound Proteſtant, according to
the Religion by law eſtabliſhed, yet did it not thereupon follow,
that he himſelf was guiltles from the ſentence of the law, becauſe
his actions being all warranted by his Majeſties conſent, they
could not be divided from the Kings; which is the cheife thing
implied by this particular. His ſecond <hi>particular</hi> is concerning th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>
great and populous City, to which he is very kind and prayeth
<hi>God to bleſſe it,</hi> but all his prayers for thoſe who he conceiveth had
done him injury have a ſting in them, and this prayer ends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
thoſe he prayes for, as if ſome had ſubordned <hi>witneſſes
againſt his life by gathering of hands,</hi> which he affirmeth <hi>to be a way
that might endanger many an innocent man, and may plucks innocent
blood upon their own heads, and perhaps upon this City alſo,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he prayed God to bleſſe, and now again to <hi>forbid this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but his prayers are mixed with threates and all tending to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:158507:12"/>
juſtify himſelf to his Auditours, whereof he is never unmindefull
upon all occaſions, and having here occaſion to mention the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
he beſtowes glorious and honourable Titles and epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrates
upon it, as if that were ſufficient to teſtify his reſpects
thereof, but he doth contradict his owne teſtimony by his Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and Applications, for by Inference he applyeth the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of hands, (which he affirmeth to have been practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
himſelf,) to the ſtirring up of <hi>the people againſt Saint Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>
and <hi>to Herods lying in waite for Saint Peters death, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
how the people tooke the death of Saint James.</hi> By which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
he muſt meane that <hi>great, honourable, and wiſe Court of the
Kingdome, the Parliament,</hi> (thoſe be the titles he beſtowes upon
them) for it was they that gave ſentence againſt him, as Herod
did againſt Saint James, and would have done agaynſt Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which no Chriſtian thinkes was either honourably or wiſely
done of him, and therefore what opininion he had of that great,
honourable, and wiſe Court for ſentencing of him may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and that his eſteeme of them was not ſo honourable as
his expreſſions; but whatſoever his eſteeme of them was, they
were his Judges ſo will he never be theirs which he here appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
when he did put the City in mind of the Juſtice of God,
and <hi>how fearfull a thing it was, to fall into the Hands of the living
God, becauſe God remembers and forgets not the complaynts of the
poore,</hi> a leſſon which he never remembred when he himſelfe did
ſit upon the Tribunall, but is of ſpeciall comfort unto him upon
the Scaffold, for his blood was innocent blood, and not onely
innocent blood in his owne eſteeme but he had a ſpeciall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
from God to tell them ſo, as Jeremiah had, in the <hi>26.
Chap. of Jeremiah, ver. 15.</hi> the words were not expreſſed by him
but directions given to the place, the words be theſe, <hi>But know
ye for certaine, that if ye put me to death, you ſhall ſurely bring inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood upon your ſelves, and upon this City, and upon the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
thereof: for of a truth the Lord hath ſent me to you to ſpeake all
theſe words in your eares.</hi> The words are ſo plaine they need no
comment.</p>
            <p>His third particular is, <hi>this poore Church of England,</hi> as he
calls it, but from thence no obſervation is to be drawne, for it is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:158507:13"/>
an undeniable truth what is there affirmed, onely it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after, who hath beene the principall and Inſtrumentall
cauſe of this great change, but he hath made no application and
ſo will I.</p>
            <p>His laſt particular is himſelfe, and that about his religion, in
which he is very breefe, chooſing to expreſſe himſelfe by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
which admit of a latitude that may deceive the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
or reader, rather then poſitively and cleerly whereby he leaves
the hearer or reader as little ſatisfied as if he had ſaid nothing at
all, yet doth he confeſſe his labouring to <hi>keep up an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in
the externall worſhip of God,</hi> but makes no mention at all of what
meanes he uſed to doe ſo, for in the wayes which he tooke and in
the meanes which he uſed conſiſted his cheefeſt guilt, but that
he paſſeth over, and ſo comes at laſt to ſpeake of his accuſation,
which was no leſſe then an accuſation of High treaſon, and by
no meaner perſons then by the whole Commons of England aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
in their repreſentative body in Parliament, and there and
by them proved agaynſt him, yet hath he the confidence to ſay
it was a crime his ſoule ever abhorred, howſoever he proceeds to
the parts of his charge being two, <hi>an Indeavour in him to ſubvert
the Law of the Realm, and a like Indeavour to ſubvert the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion eſtabliſhed by thoſe Laws,</hi> both which he ſeemeth to
deny, but ſo miſtically as that his meaning is rather to be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then that it can be cleerely diſcerned. For he expreſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
variouſly, and anſwereth in another forme of words then
which were propoſed by him; for having propounded them,
that the charge againſt him was an Indeavour to ſubvert the
Law of the Realme, and a like Indeavour to overthrow the true
Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed by thoſe lawes, he anſwereth
having firſt proteſted, <hi>In the preſence of Almighty God, and all his
holy and bleſſed angels, that hee did take it now upon his death, that he
never endeavoured the ſubverſion of the Lawes of the Realme, nor
never any change of the Proteſtant Religion, into Popiſh ſuperſtition;</hi>
the ſenſe of which words doth imply a great change from what
they were, when firſt propounded, for by his firſt propoſition of
them he expreſſeth himſelfe, to have been accuſed of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ſubvert the Law of the Realm; by which word Law
in the ſingular number as in the abſtract may bee underſtood the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:158507:13"/>
legiſlative power, or power of law-making, comprehending the
frame of this government, and including King and Parliament,
which he was charged to overthrow, by an Indeavour to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an Arbitrary government, depending upon the will of the
King alone, and excluding the Parliament; and in his anſwer he
makes mention of the ſubverſion of the lawes in the plurall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where they are confined to different ſubjects, as to ſo many
individuall ſubſtances, by which may be meant the particular acts
and laws iſſued forth and derived from that power, and may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them all, which no man did ever thinke or lay to his
charge that he indeavoured the ſubverſion of all the whole lawes,
and of every particular, and therefore here doth appeare a fallacy
and deceite, which is agreable to his former practiſes, ſo likewiſe
in the other branch about Religion he firſt propounds it, of an
Indeavour to overthrow the true Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed
by thoſe lawes, and anſwereth, of any change of the Protteſtant
Religion into Popiſh ſuperſtition which is a manifeſt difference,
whereof hereafter: having occaſion to ſpeake firſt of his eſteeme
of Parliaments, which he takes occaſion to mention here as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bin accuſed as an enemie to them, the which he denies expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a Reverend eſteeme of them in the generall, as of the <hi>greateſt
Court over which no other Court can have any Juriſdiction in the
Kingdome;</hi> but profeſſeth his diſlike againſt ſome few one or two
Parliaments in particular, <hi>for ſome miſgovernments in them as he did
conceive,</hi> but what thoſe miſgovernments were hee doth not
expreſſe, onely in ſtead thereof a generall reaſon is given,
<hi>Coruptio optimi eſt peſsima,</hi> but from thence he might
condemne and deſtroy all Parliaments and the beſt of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and of every thing as often as he pleaſeth, if nothing
more be required but that his affirmations muſt be admitted for
proofes, for there is nothing wherein the frailty of man muſt bee
imployed but may admit of errour, and corruption, but it doth
not follow, that whatſoever may, doth; nor doth it any where
appeare that any of thoſe Parliaments, which hee here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth,
were guilty at all of any ſuch corruption as he layeth
to their charge, but the contrary is manifeſt, and if for no
other thing yet for this his eſteem of them, for undoubtedly by
him they ſhould have been better eſteemed, If really and truely
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:158507:14"/>
they had been more corrupted; for Parliaments may be then
ſaid to be corrupted, when all or moſt part of the members do
ſubject their Votes to the determination and judgement of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
preferring the particuler pleaſure, interreſt or ends, of
ſome whom they reſpect, before the generall good of all whom
they repreſent; neither is it any impoſſible thing ſo to pack a
Parliament as not onely the things to be propoſed and debated,
but the greater number of the Members Votes ſhall depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the pleaſure of others, being agreed and united amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for a particular and ſiniſter end; for it is no falſe report but
a well known and undenyable truth, that in the choice of the
Members of the lower Houſe of Parliament which doth depend
upon a free Election by the Gentry, Communalty, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
in England, the major number within their ſeverall limits
and juriſdictions giving it to whom they pleaſe, yet the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome in ſome places eſpecially, hath been ſuch as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to thoſe who were to chooſe, who ſhould be choſen by
them, whereby many have been returned by the favour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
of others rather then by any merit of their own,
and it is probable that a deſigne of changing Religion and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the government having been for a long time purſued by a
faction of men who had obtained power and favour about the
King that they were not negligent, in making uſe of this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
for their own ends, &amp; it plainly appears that they were not,
becauſe at divers times they had recourſe to Parliaments in time
of proſecution of the deſigne, before it was finiſhed, which to
ſome might ſeeme a likely meanes in all apperance to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
all ſuch deſigne for ever, but the ſucceſſe of thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
and the concluſion which they made, doth cleerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
what the deſigners purpoſe and intention was in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them: for the end of calling of all Parliaments, is either a
purpoſe and deſire of releiving the Kings wants, and to ſupply
his neceſſities or to redreſſe the grievances of the ſubjects, or
both: for ſuch hath been the prudence of our anceſtors, in ſetling
the frame of this government, not only to deny to their Kings
all power of impoſing any taxes upon the Subjects with
out their own free conſents, by their repreſentative body aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
in Parliament, but did as it were binde the hands of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:158507:14"/>
their Kings, by their own conſents ſignified by divers Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
from ſo doing for ever. For which their Kings were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed,
with a ſpeciall and abſolute Prerogative of calling
and diſſolving of Parliaments, at their will and pleaſure onely.
The people being thereby aſſured, that if a deſire to right the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
grievances, and for providing of beneficiall Laws were not
ſufficient motives and inducements to the King for calling of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments;
yet the confideration of, and reſpect to his own neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and wants would move him: and divers Parliaments having
been called, during the proſecution of this deſigne, which have
been diſſolved again, by the ſame Prerogative that called them,
without any application of redreſſe either to the grievances of the
Subjects, or to the Kings wan<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, doth manifeſt that (whatſoever
the pretence was) the chief end and purpoſe of calling thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
was never neither for redreſſe of the Subjects grievauces,
nor for relief of the Kings wants; but chiefly to make triall what
ſtrength they could make in the Parliament to finiſh their deſigne
by Authority of Parliament. For having advanced their deſigne
ſo farre at Court by their prevalencie with His Majeſtie, that they
had obtained the poſſeſſion of the greateſt places, and places of
greateſt truſt, both about His Majeſtie and in the Kingdom: they
were thereby of that credit and reputation, that none were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to places of truſt, nor to dignities, nor honors, without
their approbation, if not recommendation. Which did ſo ſecure
them, that they needed not fear the diſappointment of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
by any oppoſition at Court, and ſo farre as the Kings power
and Prerogative could further it. But the Kings Prerogative being
not abſolute, the Laws of this Kingdom, and the Conſtitution of
this Government, having neither conferred an abſolute power
nor Prerogative upon the Kings thereof, they could never finiſh
their deſigne (whatſoever it was) by the Kings Prerogative alone,
without an additionall confirmation by the Subjects conſents aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
in Parliament whereof they were likewiſe aſſured; if by
the reputation and ſtrength of their Faction they could procure
ſuch a certain number to be returned Members of the lower Houſe,
as they might be confident of, would ſuffer their Votes to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by them, by which means they might hope to carry any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:158507:15"/>
thing in that Houſe which ſhould be propoſed by His Majeſtie, or
in His Majeſties name, of whoſe deliberations and determinations
they were the chief diſpoſers.</p>
            <p>As for the Houſe of Peers, there was no doubt at that time of a
prevalent party to concurre with them, by reaſon of the Biſhops
Votes, and Court Lords, and others who were obliged to them by
many favours; they being the chief diſpoſers of all favours, which
did either depend upon or proceed from His Majeſties gift. For
all which cauſes and conſiderations there was no danger to call a
Parliament, whenſoever they pleaſed: For if the Parliament did
not anſwer their expectation, it was in the ſame mens power to
perſwade the King to diſſolve it, who had the credit to perſwade
His Ma. to call it. His Majeſty ſuſpecting no ends in them but what
was pretended for His Majeſties ſervice. But the ſucces of thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
declared, that the credit of the Faction was not ſo great
in the countrey as at Court; for which my L. of Cant. doth here tax
them with miſgovernment, profeſſing his diſlike, againſt them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which muſt be conceived was, becauſe they were not yet moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
nor brought to that frame to condeſcend to every thing that
he and others ſhould project, as was the late Synod. And the great
number of Patentees, and Monopoliſts choſen this Parliament,
and others who have deſerted the Parliament, and have ſitten
ſince in an Anti-parliament at Oxford, doth ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
upon whom they depended, and for whoſe Intereſts their
Votes have been devoted from the beginning, whether for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
benefit of King and Kingdom, or onely to ſerve the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ends of ſuch who either in all probability did recommend
them, or otherwayes from whom they did expect preferment or
ſome other reward.</p>
            <p>But from hence may be collected, that the deſigne for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Religion, and the frame of the Government being two
different things, that they were not alike intended by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigners,
but that the deſigne for altering of Religion was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
intended by them; and that the other deſigne of introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
an Arbitrary government to the King was but the bait to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the King, thereby to inſinuate the better with him, and to
ingage His Majeſtie to them, and was chiefly made uſe of, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:158507:15"/>
and conducing to the other deſigne of Religion that
was the onely deſigne with them: which is made manifeſt by the
progreſſe of both deſignes. For as all motions which by their
ſlowneſſe or diſtance ſeem inſenſible to the beholder, ſo as at firſt
view it cannot be diſcerned whither they tend, yet are eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by their progreſſe: ſo the dark and diſguiſed ends of this
deſigne, which could not endure the light of open profeſſion, is
clearly diſcernable by the progreſſe which it hath made. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
that an Arbitrary power in the King hath been made uſe of
in many things, to the great prejudice of the Subject, tending to
the manifeſt deſtruction of the Subjects Liberties, and Priviledges
of Parliament; yet when a true account ſhall be taken, what great
benefit hath returned to the Regall Authority by all that hath
been done, the totall ſum will be found at the end of the Church-mens
bill, but none at all at the Kings; where on the contrary, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
detriment and loſſe will appear, and that the Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
hath been ſtretched upon the tenters beyond its true by as,
to ſet up and ſettle an abſolute or Independent Prerogative in the
Church to Church-men, which is inconſiſtent with the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the Crown: for whenſoever the Prerogative of Church-men
is advanced to ſuch a height, as that it groweth either abſolute or
Independent, the Prerogative of the Crown is either ſubjected or
undermined, and the King parts with a reall Authority, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon his own reaſon and judgement chiefly, to be directed by
the will and judgement of another, unleſſe the ſmart of his Sword
doth terrifie more nor the apprehenſion of theirs, which is all the
remedie that will be left him whenſoever the chief Governor or
Governors of the Church and he do differ. And the remedy which
the late Cannons applyed for the ſecuring of all men, againſt any
ſuſpicion of revolt to Popery, hath manifeſted to all men how far
the progreſſe to Popery was advanced, when it durſt appear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all diſguiſed, but under a thin vail of ſome few deceitfull
words, in a Pontificall robe of abſolute Authority conſtituting and

Church of England was grown, the words; <hi>We ſtraitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

Articles publiſhed, which are all words of abſolute Authority and
command, and the penalties inforcing obedience to all thoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
commands, are either <hi>ſuſpenſion and deprivation</hi> to the Clergy,
or the dreadfull cenſures of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and caſting into hell
to all others. For no leſſe puniſhment doth the ſentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
imply, becauſe the party excommunicate being
caſt out of all communion with the Church, is thereby preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be deprived of all the benefits that he may hope for by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Chriſts death and mediation, ſo long as he remains in the
ſtate of excommunication, which is a great terror to all them that
do not rightly underſtand the nature of Excommunication, and
what the authority of Church-men is, which is ever the much
greater part of thoſe who are members of any Church, beſides the
great number of others which be in all Churches that ſleight the
cenſure of Excommunication, as being a cenſure from which they
feel no preſent ſmart, without which it hath no operation with
them, for the inforcing of whom eſpecially, it was by theſe Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
injoyned, that <hi>every Biſhop ſhall once every yeer ſend into His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
high Court of Chancery a Significavit of all ſuch who have ſtood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated

Writ</hi> De Excommunicato capiendo <hi>might be at once ſent out againſt
them all,</hi> Ex Officio. And for the better execution of their Decrees,
<hi>They did moſt humbly beſeech his moſt ſacred Majeſtie, that the Officers of
the high Court of Chancery, whom it ſhall concern, may be commanded to
ſend out the aforeſaid Writ from time to time, as is deſired, and that the
like command alſo may be laid upon the Sheriffes and their Deputies, for the
due and faithfull execution of the ſaid Writs, as often as they ſhall be brought
unto them.</hi> Which whenſoever they ſhould obtain, would put the
Supremacy of all Authority into the hands of ſome of the Clergy,
by neceſſitating the ſmarting ſtroke of the Magiſtrates Sword to
follow of courſe upon notification of theirs, whereby all Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and Law ſhould be but executioners of their ſentence, from
which there was no appeal, but by ſubmiſſion deſerving abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was ordained by the authority of the foreſaid Synod,
not to be given, untill the party to be abſolved ſhould come as a
penitent, humbling himſelf upon his knees, and firſt take an Oath,
<hi>De parendo Juri, &amp; ſtando mandatis Eccleſiae.</hi> And for a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:158507:16"/>
ſubjecting of all men into a vaſſalage and ſubjection to the
Authority of Biſhops and others of the Clergy, it was there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
<hi>That all Clergy men, and all others who ſhould take any degree of
learning in any of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, and all that ſhould be licenſed to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe

in a preſcribed and ſet form of words, before they ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to take their degrees, <hi>Never to give their conſent to alter the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of this Church by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, and Archdeacons,</hi>
By which means, an equall allegiance ſhould have been payed to
them as to the King and his Succeſſors for ever: And all this was
preſented to the blinded world, and abuſed King, as a remedy to
ſecure men againſt any ſuſpicion of revolt to Popery, which was
nothing elſe but a publick ſetting up of Popery, though not yet
of the Popes ſupremacy, which was to follow; and imploying the
help and aſſiſtance of the Magiſtrates Sword, and the force and
power of the Laws of the Land to that very uſe and end; For Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
conſiſteth neither in this or that ſuperſtition nor Idolatry,
nor in this or that erroneous Doctrine, nor in all-together, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
and chiefly; but in the abſoluteneſſe of ſpirituall authority
commanding Implicite obedience, to whatſoever Doctrine or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
ſhall be invented by man, as neceſſary and eſſentiall to
the true worſhip of God, under the threatned pain and penalty of
Excommunication and Interdiction, and promiſing the kingdome
of heaven to whomſoever it pleaſeth, as a gift or reward within
the power of man: and the aſſumption of which ſo divine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent
a power to any man or mankind united together,
and the deriving thereof from one ſolely to others, as inherent in
the perſon or function of one onely, doth neceſſarily inferre and
preſuppoſe the gift of Infallibility in him who doth ſo aſſume it,
that he may become an unappealable Judge, which doth exalt
him, in the ſight and eſteeme of thoſe men who do beleeve in him,
and willingly ſubmit unto him, to the nature and dignity of the
incommunicable prerogative of God, and makes him undeniably
the revealed Antichriſt to others, by uſurping and poſſeſſing the
throne of Chriſt upon earth, for whom onely, ſuch dominion and
authority is reſerved in heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:158507:17"/>
And the root of Popery or Antichriſtianity (for ſo it may be
termed, as tending continually thither by the Doctrine which it
teacheth, and the Authority which it uſurpeth) lieth in this very
principle, that a power of excommunicating and abſolving, or
ſending into heaven or hell, is aſſumed by ſome as depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the purpoſe and will of man, according to the nature of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and conſented to and beleeved by others; aud the danger to
temporall Authority lieth in the univerſality and generality of
the beleef and aſſent, and the difference between the incontrolable
ſupremacy of the Pope, and the exalted Prelacy of Biſhops pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the ſame Authority is but a difference of degrees, but
not of kinds. For, for the ſetling of this Authority into the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of any one, there is a neceſſity of ingroſſing it into the
hands of ſome few firſt; and Popes had never mounted to their
omnipotent throne of Supremacy, if a ſuperiority of ſome of the
Clergy inveſted with ſpirituall authority over others had not
been firſt aſſented unto. For the ſame rule, neceſſity, and end requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the ſupremacy of one Biſhop over all other Biſhops, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
the ſuperiority of any Clergy man into the dignity of a
Biſhop over many others of the Clergy: and the ſame danger of
ſpirituall error indangering the ſoul lyeth upon all that are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to this ſpirituall authority, whether it be derived from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of one, or a ſuperiority onely of others, or from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy
of all the Clergy aſſembled together, or from the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie
of everyone within their ſeverall Congregations, ſo
long as it is entertained and received in the beleef as a ſufficient
ground or warrant for obedience to what ſhall be ordained by it:
and the exerciſing of ſpirituall authority under a different form
of externall government onely, being a difference rather in form
then ſubſtance, all of them may divide unity in the ends and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of government, by dividing of Authority which is the
preſerver of unity; but each of them doth admit of degrees of more
and leſſe, according as the form imbraced is more or leſſe abſolute.
The ſuperiority therefore of Biſhops over the reſt of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
which may be as Independent as any other form, but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be ſo abſolute as the ſupremacy of the Pope, in regard it can
never beget nor inforce ſo generall a dependencie and ſubjection
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:158507:17"/>
of all men unto it, wherin union and ſtrength conſiſteth, is never ſo
dangerous to that State which entertains it, as when it declares its
Independencie, and aſpires to be abſolute. And albeit that Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
doth continually endeavour and aſpire to be united by
the Supremacy of one of their own order, becauſe thereby they
ariſe to a further degree of ſtrength and perfection, to which all
ſublunary creatures have a naturall propenſion, inclination, and
deſire; yet can they not at all times, nor whenſoever they pleaſe,
attaine to their deſires. And the Archbiſhop of Canterbury having
diſcovered and manifeſted unto the world how independent the
authority of Church-men here in England was grown, and how
abſolute they coveted to be, did give a clear evidence at the ſame
time how farre the progreſſe to the Popes Supremacy was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
which is made more manifeſt by the concurrence and joynt
endeavours of Papiſts of all ſorts, not onely agreeing with, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
in the ſame deſigne with ſome of our Clergy-men and
others. For their indefatigable labours and renewed pains, with
ſo much blood and danger to the undertakers ever ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
have all tended to that end chiefly, as to the onely
mark at which they have ever aymed. The threatning Bals, and
many dangerous conſpiracies and invaſions in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
time, and the moſt damnable Gunpowder Treaſon in King <hi>James</hi>
his time, are clear proofs how implacable their malice hath been
againſt all Reformation, that did depoſe the Pope from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
right of Supremacy, and how violently they have been
tranſported to reinthrone him again, which is but the ultimate
end of all ſuch dangerous and deſperate undertakings, but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
is alwayes and ever hath been for ſome particular ends
to the undertakers, ſpringing from their own ambition, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
deſire of dominion and rule, from which Papiſts are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Laws of this Land eſtabliſhing the Reformation: for the
deſire of authority, and to have a command over others is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
deſire to all ambitious men; and ambition is an inherent
quality in all men, flowing from the operation and effectuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the ſpirituall ſubſtance of the ſoul, which coveteth to
mount and aſpire continually, but is predominant onely in ſome.
And no man (that may chooſe) doth hazard his own life, for reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:158507:18"/>
of another to his right being loſt, but he that hopes to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
and ſhare with him or under him after the recovery, in
ſome proportion and meaſure, though not in an equal degree. And
ſince the Gunpowder Treaſon, they having not onely forborn all
forcible attempts, againſt either the life and ſafety of the King, or
the publick peace and tranquillity of the Kingdome, untill the
preſent Rebellion in Ireland did break out, upon which the warre
againſt the Parliament enſued; but ſeeming extraordinarily and
ſtrangely converted in their diſpoſitions and deſires, and of deadly
and implacable enemies, appearing the moſt dutifull Subjects of
all others, pretending to be the moſt zealous inſtruments for the
inlargement and promotion of that power and authority which
was bound by ſpeciall intereſt to ſuppreſſe them, is an argument
of ſome well ſtudied and cloſe followed deſigne, rather then any
ſymptome of change of diſpoſition; for they can never change
their diſpoſitions, ſo long as they retain their wicked principles
and falſe doctrines, which principally gives life and motion to the
wickedneſſe of their diſpoſitions, and the deſire of dominion and
rule is impetuous and inceſſant, to which they can never have a
legall right in this Kingdom untill all thoſe Laws be repealed
which diſable them; the doing whereof and not the Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
is a principall motive with them in all their undertakings
and deſignes, and the great potencie and prevalencie of Papiſts
about His Majeſtie in all his conſultations and actions, do manifeſt
and declare what their purpoſes and intentions are; that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
authority of Biſhops coveting to be ſo abſolute (which
hath been ſet up of late in the Church of England, and confirmed
by the King, and by his Prerogative Royall) ſhall acknowledge
the Pope for their Head and not the King: for Popes were never ſo
munificent rewarders of any mans deſerts or duties, as to part with
that which they accounted their right, to give it away to another;
and Papiſts were never ſo undutifull ſons as to labour for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up of an Arbitrary power and unlimited Prerogative to an
hereticall King: when his Holineſſe hath given ſentence that no
Heretick is capable of any Authority at all, and that all men are to
be accounted for Hereticks who deny the Popes Supremacy;
wherfore in the concluſion, His Majeſtie muſt either part with that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:158507:18"/>
Supremacy which the Law hath given him, and ſubmit to the
Popes, or be deprived of all Authority whatſoever, which is all he
muſt expect from them, or by their aid and aſſiſtance. And the great
favours which hath been alwayes ſhewed to Papiſts ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of His Majeſties Reigne, but more eſpecially now, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
indulgence towards the bloodieſt and cruelleſt of all Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
and to the moſt perfideous of all Nations, the Iriſh, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them for good Subjects after ſo many barbarous maſſacres
and horrid executions of an infinite number of Engliſh &amp; Scottiſh
Proteſtants, rather then the King ſhall agree with his Parliament
in England, for the ſaving of the lives of his Proteſtant Subjects
here, and chooſing to continue the warre in England at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of his Engliſh Subjects lives; by whom his Majeſtie hath ever,
and muſt ſtill, if ever, ſubſiſt in power, dignity, and honour; and to
the great perill and manifeſt hazard of His Majeſties own life, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then break off that Ceſſation, which His Majeſtie had not
power to make with the Iriſh, from whom His Majeſtie never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
better fruits then at a great expence of treaſure, and of his
other Subjects lives, to reduce and keep them to a forced duty and
allegiance; and the over-ruling of His Majeſties reaſon and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to approve and conſent to the Popes Supremacy in Ireland,
which is known and acknowledged to be deſtructive to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Supremacy and juſt Prerogative, rather then an extirpation
of Epiſcopacy which is the foundation and aſſent to the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
ſhall be conſented to in England, upon a bare preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
that it is a neceſſarie ſupport to Monarchy; when it hath never
been yet examined what Monarchy it ſupports, whether ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or temporall: and whether that which is a neceſſary ſupporter
to the one, is compatible with the other, having ſhaken off the yoke
of ſpirituall Monarchy, and renounced not onely all ſubjection
to it, but all communion with it; and truſting of Papiſts upon
their bare words and deceitfull profeſſions, againſt their known
unſound tenets and doctrines, rather then the Parliament and
Proteſtant Subjects ſhall be beleeved upon their ſolemne Vow and
Covenant for the preſervation and defence of His Majeſties perſon
and Authority. And laſtly, imploying of known and profeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euſants,
truſting them with Arms and Authority, without any
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:158507:19"/>
caution or conſideration how they may be diſarmed again, rather
then that the Parliament ſhall be ſuffered to diſpoſe of the Militia
of the Kingdom for the ſafety and ſecurity thereof for ſome limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
time, are all clear and manifeſt proofs what their power and
prevalence with the King is; And do all conclude, that an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
power and unlimited Prerogative pretending for the King,
having been made uſe of and exerciſed by them, yet was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for the King, nor for the improving nor advancing of the
Kings Prerogative; but onely to make uſe of it for erecting and
ſetting up of an Independent Authority in the Church to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
perſons: and by means thereof to introduce the Popes
Supremacy as the chief and ultimate end of their deſigne. And
that His Majeſtie hath been groſly abuſed, and craftily over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by diſguiſed Impoſtors, and deceitfull paraſites, pretending
one thing when intending the contrary. Whereof amongſt other
things my Lord of Canterbury his equivocall expreſſions at the
houre of his death giveth ſome light; at what time being deſirous
to juſtifie himſelf publickly to the world, of his endeavours for
changing the Religion, he expreſſeth himſelf of endeavouring one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to change the Proteſtant Religion to Popiſh ſuperſtition, as if
there had been no other danger from Popery but of introducing
of groſſe and abſurd Superſtition, to many of which imbraced by
them, and ſet up by Papall Authority, it may be granted him and
beleeved that he was no reall friend, but might condemne them in
his own opinion and judgement; when notwithſtanding it was
certain and clear, that he not onely befriended, but courted and
ambitiouſly coveted that honour and authority which did eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
that ſuperſtition; and which muſt of neceſſitie ſtill produce
ſome ſuperſtition or other in the worſhip of God: and hath now
ſufficiently diſcovered it ſelf to endeavour continually to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Superſtition and Ignorance as the principall means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
men, by a blind devotion to ſubmit to an implicit obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of what ſhall be required of them, and impoſed upon them.
But that was paſſed over by him as a thing wherein he was not
concerned; yet his practiſes tending thither was the chief thing
concerning Religion whereof he was accuſed, and for which he
was condemned: and poſſibly he might be deceived himſelf by the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:158507:19"/>
fallacy of deceitfull grounds and falſe principles, the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
whereof might not appear ſo clearly to himſelf as to others,
which might be the cauſe, why he did endeavour to juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of his intentions onely; when the charge againſt him, was for
his practiſes and actions chiefly which he acknowledged to have
been proved againſt him, by acquitting his Judges as having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata.</hi> For he might flatter himſelf
with an opinion of good intentions, thinking all was neceſſarie
and good which he went about: but thinking ſo, he did but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
himſelf as well as others, which is the beſt charity that can
be allowed him by the moſt <hi>charitable Chriſtians</hi> that are not miſled
by the ſame principles and grounds that did deceive him; and the
moſt favourable conſtruction that can be made of him is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he was a great Doctor and Stateſman alſo, yet was he to learn
the true principles of the Chriſtian Religion, when he went out of
the world, and that his principles of government were no better,
then his principles of Religion.</p>
            <p>By the reſult of all which two things are demonſtrated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
The firſt is, that they who do beleeve and are of opinion,
that they are the onely aſſertors and defenders of the Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
and of the Regall power, by fighting againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the maintaining and defending of all that is eſtabliſhed
and approved by the King in this difference between King and
Parliament, do but contribute their help and aſſiſtance for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
and deſtroying of the Regall power, and of the Kings
juſt Prerogative The ſecond is, that the King is not reſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his will is oppoſed by his Parliament, which is the Kings
great Councell, and the repreſentative body of his Kingdom; and
the reaſon of both is, becauſe by the conſtitution and frame of this
Government Kings of this Kingdom may never give away their
rights, and that power and authority which they themſelves have
over the Subjects, nor transferre the ſame upon any other, without
the generall conſent of the Subjects; which can never be obtained
but by their repreſentative Body aſſembled in Parliament. And
the obtaining of His Majeſties will in this, would be of more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
conſequence to himſelf, and to the Regall Authority, then
ever yet appeared to himſelf, or can ever appear, ſo long as he is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:158507:20"/>
ſeparated and divided from his great Councell, where, by a free
debate of all conſequences, and by a clear diſcovery of all ſiniſter
ends and fraudulent practiſes, the truth of all can onely appear;
and without whom His Majeſtie can determine nothing by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
nor by his own judgement therein. The queſtion being of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
himſelf, his Succeſſors, all his Subjects, and their poſterity
to a bondage, and ſubjection under a heavie yoke and forraigne
Head; uſurping a ſpirituall Authority, and claiming homage and
univerſall obedience thereunto by Divine right, as being, Chriſts
Vicar generall, and the ſupreme Head of the Church upon earth:
And the conſequences of which being, that the acknowledgement
of this claime, and a generall beleef thereof onely, doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
ſubject all other power and Authority unto it; by reaſon that
the faculties of the ſoul upon which this ſpirituall authority hath
the chiefeſt influence and operation, do eaſily ſubject and ſubdue
all the powers of the body. And it is now experimentally known,
that men being once ſubdued to the apprehenſion and beleef of
this ſpirituall Authority, by their intellectuals and rationall parts
chiefly, they are kept in obedience as to their duty by their
ſenſitive parts, and by all manner of forcible means, which makes
it a reall power and authority that before was onely imaginary;
and by means thereof becomes a power ſuperior, to all humane
power, and cannot be contradicted nor controlled by no power
nor authority, that is in man, and can neither be limited nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
within any certain bounds, nor be directed by no rule nor
Law whatſoever.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding would ſuddenly vaniſh, if the grounds and
ends of all ſpirituall authority, to be exerciſed under any form
of Eccleſiaſticall government, were fully examined, and diſcovered
to be nothing but the imagination of man, which would infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
follow if nothing were taken for granted without evidence
and proof, which is the end of all Councels and Conſultations,
and the principall duty of every rationall man: and reaſon is in
nature before all the other faculties of the ſoul, and is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all other gifts and graces whatſoever, but not the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and therefore is it given to all men as a difference and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between man and beaſt: when other gifts and abilities are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:158507:20"/>
given onely to ſome; And the end of Government is diſcovered to
man by the light of reaſon, and conduceth to the very being of
man, which muſt be provided for, before any thought or conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
can be had of well being, or of any other perfection. And
therefore unity, which is the preſerver of humane ſociety, muſt
be provided for before any other duty that is required of man.
For the preſervation of humane ſociety tendeth to the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mankind, in which the being of man conſiſteth, as from
which it is derived, without recourſe to a new creation; and all
Authority, which is the preſerver of Unity, muſt be derived from
one head or fountain which in this Kingdom is from the Regall
Power. For no man denieth that the King is the Head of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and all men know and acknowledge that He is never in his
Supremacy nor abſolute but by his Parliament. Which as it is the
repreſentative Body of the people; ſo is it the Supreme Councell of
the King. And therefore without it He is neither the head of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
body (but of a Faction) nor a compleat head; For the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
being the repreſentative of the people becomes thereby
their living ſoul, including the will and deſires of all the people,
as comprehending them all: But being the Kings great Councell,
who is the head of the people, it doth ſupply the office and nature
of all the externall ſenſes which are placed in the head for the uſe
of the body, and eſpecially to inform and aſſiſt the intellectuall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
inhabiting the head, for the giving of due influence
upon the body, without which a body politick doth languiſh and
conſume; being fed and nouriſhed by the vigorous operation of the
intellectuals deſcending from the head, as a body natural doth by
ſuſtenance and meat. Wherefore <hi>what God hath conjoyned, let no man
ſeparate:</hi> and whoſoever wiſheth well to the proſperity of this
Kingdom, let him endeavour the conjunction of King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And whoſoever nouriſheth diviſion between them, let them
be eſteemed as the betrayers of their Countrey, and enemies to
mankind; and <hi>let God ariſe and his enemies will be ſcattered.</hi> But as my
Lord of Canterbury had a legall triall, and juſt ſentence, ſo may
all ſuch diſguiſed Traitors to the Kingdom, and fraudulent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
of the King, in going about to ſteal from him his reall
right and Authority, by a counterfeit ſhew of making it better,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:158507:21"/>
periſh and be confounded in their own craft as publick Enemies to
King and Parliament, where onely the Supremacy of all Authority
in England doth reſt, with the King, and in the King; but not in
the Kings will, but in his reaſon: which as it rendreth him moſt
abſolute, ſo doth it appear moſt eminent, by concurring with the
deſires of all his people, when exhibited to him by them who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
them all; and are likewiſe his ſupreme Councel, to which
all other Councels and Courts whatſoever are ſubordinate and
accountable: by doing whereof onely he is united with his people,
and his people with him, wherein the ſtrength of both conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and then may he confidently ſay, <hi>If God be with
us, who can be againſt us.</hi>
