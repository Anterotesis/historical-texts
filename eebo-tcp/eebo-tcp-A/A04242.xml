            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AS euery humane body</hi> (deare Countrey men) how wholesome soeuer, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding subiect, or at least naturally inclined to some sorts of diseases, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: so is there no Common-wealth, or Body-politicke, how well gouerned, or peaceable soeuer it bee, that lackes the owne popular errors, and naturally enclined corruptions: and therefore is it no wonder, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this our Countrey and Common-wealth, though peaceable, though wealthy, though long flourishing in both, be amongst the rest, subiect to the owne naturall infirmities. VVee are of all Nations the people most louing and most reuerently obedient to our Prince, yet are wee (as time hath often borne witnesse) too easie to be seduced to make Rebellion, vpon very
<pb facs="tcp:9591:3"/>
slight grounds. Our fortunate and oft prooued valour in warres abroad, our heartie and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent obedience to our Princes at home, hath bred vs a long, and a thrice happy peace: Our Peace hath bred wealth: And Peace and wealth hath brought foorth a generall sluggishnesse, which makes vs wallow in all sorts of idle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and soft delicacies, the first seedes of the subuersion of all great Monarchies. Our Cleargie are become negligent and lazie, our Nobilitie and Gentrie prodigall, and solde to their priuate delights, Our Lawyers couetous, our Common-people prodigall and curious; and generally all sorts of people more carefull for their priuat ends, then for their mother the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>For remedie whereof, it is the <hi>Kings</hi> part (as the proper Phisician of his Politicke-body) to purge it of all those diseases, by Medicines meete for the same: as by a certaine milde, and yet iust forme of gouernment, to maintaine the Publicke quietnesse, and preuent all occasions of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: by the example of his owne Person and Court, to make vs all ashamed of our sluggish delicacie, and to stirre vs vp to the practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of all honest exercises, and Martiall sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb facs="tcp:9591:3"/>
of VVarre; As likewise by his, and his Courts moderatenesse in Apparell, to make vs ashamed of our prodigalitie: By his quicke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and carefull ouerseeing of the Cleargie, to waken them vp againe, to be more diligent in their Offices: By the sharpe triall, and seuere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the partiall, couetous and bribing Lawyers, to reforme their corruptions: And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by the example of his owne Person, and by the due execution of good Lawes, to reforme and abolish, piece and piece, these old and euill groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded abuses. For this will not bee <hi>Opus vnius diei,</hi> but as euery one of these diseases, must from the <hi>King</hi> receiue the owne cure proper for it, so are there some sorts of abuses in Common-wealths, that though they be of so base and contemptible a condition, as they are too low for the Law to looke on, and too meane for a <hi>King</hi> to interpone his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, or bend his eye vpon: yet are they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, aswell as the greatest of them. So is an Ant an <hi>Animal,</hi> aswell as an Elephant: so is a VVrenne <hi>Auis,</hi> aswell as a Swanne, and so is a small dint of the Toothake, a disease aswell as the fearefull Plague is. But for these base sorts of corruption in Common wealthes, not onely the
<pb facs="tcp:9591:4"/>
               <hi>King,</hi> or any inferior Magistrate, but <hi>Quilibet e populo</hi> may serue to be a Phisician, by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering and impugning the error, and by perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reformation thereof.</p>
            <p>And surely in my opinion, there cannot be a more base, and yet hurtfull, corruption in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, then is the vile vse (or rather abuse) of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Tobacco</hi> in this Kingdome, which hath mooued me, shortly to discouer the abuses thereof in this following little Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>If any thinke it a light Argument, so is it but a toy that is bestowed vpon it. And since the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect is but of Smoke, I thinke the fume of an idle braine, may serue for a sufficient battery against so fumous and feeble an enemy. If my grounds be found true, it is all I looke for; but if they cary the force of perswasion with them, it is all I can wish, and more then I can expect. My onely care is, that you, my deare Countrey-men, may rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue euen by this smallest trifle, of the sinceritie of my meaning in greater matters, neuer to spare any paine, that may tend to the procuring of your weale and prosperitie.</p>

            <head>A Counterblaste to Tobacco.</head>
            <p>THat the manifolde abuses of this vile custome of <hi>Tobacco</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, may the better be espied, it is fit, that first you enter into consideration both of the first originall thereof, and likewise of the reasons of the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try thereof into this Countrey. For certainely as such customes, that haue their first institution ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a godly, necessary, or honorable ground, and are first brought in, by the meanes of some worthy, vertuous, and great Personage, are euer, and most iustly, holden in great &amp; reuerent estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and account, by all wise, vertuous, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate spirits: So should it by the contrary, iustly bring a great disgrace into that sort of customes, which hauing their originall from base corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and barbarity, doe in like sort, make their first
<pb facs="tcp:9591:5"/>
entry into a Countrey, by an inconsiderate and childish affectation of Noueltie, as is the true case of the first inuention of <hi>Tobacco</hi> taking, and of the first entry thereof among vs. For <hi>Tobacco</hi> being a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon herbe, which (though vnder diuers names) growes almost euery where, was first found out by some of the barbarous <hi>Indians,</hi> to be a Preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, or Antidot against the Pockes, a filthy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, whereunto these barbarous people are (as all men know) very much subiect, what through the vncleanly and adust constitution of their bodies, and what through the intemperate heate of their Climat: so that as from them was first brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christendome, that most detestable disease, so from them likewise was brought this vse of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> as a stinking and vnsauorie Antidot, for so corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and execrable a Maladie, the stinking Suffumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation whereof they yet vse against that disease, making so one canker or venime to eate out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And now good Countrey men, let vs (I pray you) consider, what honour or policie can mooue vs to imitate the barbarous and beastly maners of the wilde, godlesse, and slauish <hi>Indians,</hi> especially in so vile and stinking a custome? Shall wee that disdaine to imitate the maners of our neighbour <hi>France</hi> (hauing the stile of the first Christian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) and that cannot endure the spirit of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards (their King being now comparable in large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Dominions, to the great Emperor of <hi>Turkie</hi>) Shall wee, I say, that haue bene so long ciuill and
<pb facs="tcp:9591:5"/>
wealthy in Peace, famous and inuincible in Warre, fortunate in both, we that haue bene euer able to aide any of our neighbours (but neuer deafed any of their eares with any of our supplications for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance) shall we, I say, without blushing, abase our selues so farre, as to imitate these beastly <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> slaues to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> refuse to the world, and as yet aliens from the holy Couenant of God? Why doe we not as well imitate them in walking naked as they doe? in preferring glasses, feathers, and such toyes, to golde and precious stones, as they do? yea why do we not denie God and adore the Deuill, as they doe?</p>
            <p>Now to the corrupted basenesse of the first vse of this <hi>Tobacco,</hi> doeth very well agree the foolish and groundlesse first entry thereof into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. It is not so long since the first entry of this abuse amongst vs here, as this present age cannot yet very well remember, both the first Author, and the forme of the first introduction of it amongst vs. It was neither brought in by King, great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, nor learned Doctor of Phisicke.</p>
            <p>With the report of a great discouery for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, some two or three Sauage me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were brought in, together with this Sauage custome. But the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is, the poore wilde barbarous men died, but that vile barbarous custome is yet aliue, yea in fresh vigor: so as it seemes a miracle to me, how a custome springing from so vile a ground, and brought in by a father so generally hated, should be welcomed vpon so slender a warrant. For if
<pb facs="tcp:9591:6"/>
they that first put it in practise heere, had remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred for what respect it was vsed by them from whence it came, I am sure they would haue bene loath, to haue taken so farre the imputation of that disease vpon them as they did, by vsing the cure thereof. For <hi>Sanis non est opus medico,</hi> and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoisons are neuer vsed, but where poyson is thought to precede.</p>
            <p>But since it is true, that diuers customes slightly grounded, and with no better warrant entred in a Commonwealth, may yet in the vse of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, prooue both necessary and profitable; it is therefore next to be examined, if there be not a full Sympathie and true Proportion, betweene the base ground and foolish entrie, and the loathsome and hurtfull vse of this stinking Antidote.</p>
            <p>I am now therefore heartily to pray you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, first vpon what false and erroneous grounds you haue first built the generall good liking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and next, what sinnes towards God, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish vanities before the world you commit, in the detestable vse of it.</p>
            <p>As for these deceitfull grounds, that haue speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mooued you to take a good and great conceit thereof, I shall content my selfe to examine here onely foure of the principals of them; two founded vpon the Theoricke of a deceiueable apparance of Reason, and two of them vpon the mistaken Practicke of generall Experience.</p>
            <p>First, it is thought by you a sure Aphorisme in the Physickes, That the braines of all men, beeing
<pb facs="tcp:9591:6"/>
naturally colde and wet, all dry and hote things should be good for them; of which nature this stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king suffumigation is, and therefore of good vse to them. Of this Argument, both the Proposition and Assumption are false, and so the Conclusion cannot but be voyd of it selfe. For as to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, That because the braines are colde and moist, therefore things that are hote and drie are best for them, it is an inept consequence: For man beeing compounded of the foure Complexions, (whose fathers are the foure Elements) although there be a mixture of them all in all the parts of his body, yet must the diuers parts of our <hi>Microcosme</hi> or little world within our selues, be diuersly more inclined, some to one, some to another complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the diuersitie of their vses, that of these discords a perfect harmonie may bee made vp for the maintenance of the whole body.</p>
            <p>The application then of a thing of a contrary nature, to any of these parts, is to interrupt them of their due function, and by consequence hurtfull to the health of the whole body. As if a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Liuer is hote (as the fountaine of blood) and as it were and ouen to the stomacke, would ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore apply and weare close vpon his Liuer and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke a cake of lead; he might within a very short time (I hope) be susteined very good cheape at an Ordinarie, beside the cleering of his conscience from that deadly sinne of gluttonie. And as if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Heart is full of vitall spirits, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall motion, a man would therefore lay a heauy
<pb facs="tcp:9591:7"/>
pound stone on his breast, for staying and holding downe that wanton palpitation, I doubt not but his breast would bee more bruised with the weight thereof, then the heart would be comforted with such a disagreeable &amp; contrarious cure. And euen so is it with the Braines. For if a man, because the Braines are cold and humide, would therefore vse inwardly by smells, or outwardly by application, things of hot and drie qualite, all the gaine that he could make thereof would onely be to put himselfe in a great forwardnesse for running mad, by ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watching himselfe, the coldnesse and moistnesse of our braine beeing the onely ordinarie meanes that procure our sleepe and rest. Indeed I doe not denie, but when it falls out that any of these, or any part of our bodie growes to be distempered, and to tend to an extremitie beyond the compasse of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures temperate mixture, that in that case cures of contrary qualities, to the intemperate inclination of that part, being wisely prepared and discreetely ministred, may be both necessarie and helpefull for strengthning and assisting Nature in the expulsion of her enemies: for this is the true definition of all profitable Physicke.</p>
            <p>But first these Cures ought not to bee vsed, but where there is neede of them, the contrarie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is daily practised in this generall vse of <hi>Tobacco</hi> by all sorts and complexions of people.</p>
            <p>And next, I deny the Minor of this argument, as I have already said, in regard that this <hi>Tobacco,</hi> is not simply of a dry &amp; hot qualitie; but rather hath a
<pb facs="tcp:9591:7"/>
certaine venemous facultie ioyned with the heate thereof, which makes it haue an Antipathie against nature, as by the hatefull smell thereof doeth well appeare. For the Nose being the proper Organ and conuoy of the sense of smelling to the braines, which are the onely fountaine of that sense, doeth euer serue vs for an infallible witnesse, whether that Odour which we smell, be healthfull or hurtfull to the braine, (except when it fals out that the sense it selfe is corrupted and abused through some infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and distemper in the braine.) And that the suffumigation thereof cannot haue a drying quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it needes to further probation, then that it is a smoake, all smoake and vapour, being of it selfe humide, as drawing neere to the nature of the ayre, and easie to be resolued againe into water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there needes no other proofe but the Meteors, which being bred of nothing else but of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and exhalations sucked vp by the Sunne out of the earth, the Sea, and waters, yet are the same smoakie vapours turned, and transformed into Raynes, Snowes, Deawes, hoare Frostes, and such like waterie Meteors, as by the contrarie the ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie cloudes are often transformed and euaporated in blustering winds.</p>
            <p>The second Argument grounded on a show of reason is, That this filthie smoake, as well through the heat and strength thereof, as by a naturall force and qualitie, is able and fit to purge both the head and stomacke of Rhewmes and distillations, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth, by the spitting and auoyding
<pb facs="tcp:9591:8"/>
fleame, immediatly after the taking of it. But the fallacie of this Argument may easily appeare, by my late preceding description of the Meteors. For euen as the smoakie vapours sucked vp by the Sunne, and staied in the lowest and colde Region of the ayre, are there contracted into cloudes, and turned into raine and such other watery Meteors: So this stinking smoake being sucked vp by the Nose, and imprisoned in the colde and moyst braines, is by their colde and wett facultie, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and cast foorth againe in waterie distillations, and so are you made free and purged of nothing, but that wherewith you wilfully burdened your selues: and therefore are you no wiser in taking <hi>Tobacco</hi> for purging you of distillations, then if for preuenting the Cholike you would take all kinde of windie meates and drinkes, and for preuenting of the Stone, you would take all kinde of meates and drinkes that would breede grauell in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, and then when you were forced to auoyde much winde out of your stomacke, and much gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in your Vrine, that you should attribute the thanke thereof to such nourishments as bred those within you, that behoued either to be expelled by the force of Nature, or you to haue <hi>burst at the broad side,</hi> as the Prouerbe is.</p>
            <p>As for the other two reasons founded vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, the first of which is, That the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would not haue taken so generall a good liking thereof, if they had not by experience found it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie soueraigne and good for them: For answere
<pb facs="tcp:9591:8"/>
thereunto, how easily the mindes of any people, wherewith God hath replenished this world, may be drawen to the foolish affectation of any nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I leaue it to the discreet iudgement of any man that is reasonable.</p>
            <p>Doe we not dayly see, that a man can no sooner bring ouer from beyond the Seas any new forme of apparrell, but that hee can not bee thought a man of spirit, that would not presently imitate the same? And so from hand to hand it spreades, till it be practised by all, not for any commoditie that is in it, but only because it is come to be the fashion. For such is the force of that naturall Selfe-loue in euery one of vs, and such is the corruption of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie bred in the brest of euery one, as we cannot be content vnlesse we imitate euery thing that our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes doe, and so prooue our selues capable of euery thing whereof they are capable, like Apes, counterfeiting the maners of others, to our owne destruction. For let one or two of the greatest Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Mathematickes in any of the two famous Vniuersities, but constantly affirme any cleare day, that they see some strange apparition in the skies: they will I warrant you be seconded by the greatest part of the Students in that profession: So loath will they be, to bee thought inferiour to their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, either in depth of knowledge or sharpnesse of sight: And therefore the generall good liking and imbracing of this foolish custome, doeth but onely proceede from that affectation of noueltie, and popular errour, wherof I haue already spoken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9591:9"/>
The other argument drawen from a mistaken experience, is but the more particular probation of this generall, because it is alleaged to be found true by proofe, that by the taking of <hi>Tobacco</hi> diuers and very many doe finde themselues cured of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers diseases, as on the other part, no man euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued harme thereby. In this argument there is first a great mistaking, and next a monstrous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie. For is it not a very great mistaking, to take <hi>Non causam pro causa,</hi> as they say in the Logicks? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause peraduenture when a sicke man hath had his disease at the height, hee hath at that instant taken <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and afterward his disease taking the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall course of declining, and consequently the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of recouering his health, O then the <hi>Tobacco</hi> forsooth, was the worker of that miracle. Beside that, it is a thing well knowen to all Phisicians, that the apprehension and conceit of the patient, hath by wakening and vniting the vitall spirits, and so strengthening nature, a great power and vertue, to cure diuers diseases For an euident proofe of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in the like case, I pray you what foolish boy, what sillie wench, what olde doting wife, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant countrey clowne, is not a Phisician for the toothach, for the cholicke, &amp; diuers such common diseases? Yea, will not euery man you meete with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, teach you a sundry cure for the same, and sweare by that meane either himselfe, or some of his nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest kinsmen and friends was cured? And yet I hope no man is so foolish as to beleeue them. And al these toyes do only proceed from the mistaking
<pb facs="tcp:9591:9"/>
               <hi>Non causam pro causa,</hi> as I haue already sayd, and so if a man chance to recouer one of any disease, after he hath taken <hi>Tobacco,</hi> that must haue the thankes of all But by the contrary, if a man smoke himselfe to death with it (and many haue done) O then some other disease must beare the blame for that fault. So doe olde harlots thanke their harlotrie for their many yeeres, that custome being health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (say they) <hi>ad purgandos Renes,</hi> but neuer haue minde how many die of the Pockes in the flower of their youth. And so doe olde drunkards thinke they prolong their dayes, by their swinelike diet, but neuer remember howe many die drowned in drinke before they be halfe olde.</p>
            <p>And what greater absurditie can there bee, then to say that one cure shall serue for diuers, nay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarious sortes of diseases? It is an vndoubted ground among all Phisicians, that there is almost no sort either of nourishment or medicine, that hath not something in it disagreeable to some part of mans bodie, because, as I haue already sayd, the nature of the temperature of euery part, is so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from another, that according to the olde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, That which is good for the head, is euill for the necke and the shoulders. For euen as a strong enemie, that inuades a towne or fortresse, although in his siege thereof, he doe belaie and compasse it round about, yet he makes his breach and entrie, at some one or few speciall parts thereof, which hee hath tried and found to bee weakest and least able to resist; so sickenesse doth make her particular as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
<pb facs="tcp:9591:10"/>
vpon such part or parts of our bodie, as are weakest and easiest to be ouercome by that sort of disease, which then doth assaile vs, although all the rest of the body by Sympathie feele it selfe, to be as it were belaied, and besieged by the affliction of that speciall part, the griefe and smart thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the sence of feeling dispersed through all the rest of our members. And therefore the skilfull Phisician presses by such cures to purge &amp; streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that part which is afflicted, as are onely fit for that sort of disease, and doe best agree with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that infirme part; which being abused to a disease of another nature, would prooue as hurtfull for the one, as helpfull for the other. Yea, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will a skilfull and warie Phisician bee carefull to vse no cure but that which is fit for that sort of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, but he wil also consider all other circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances, and make the remedies sutable thereunto: as the temperature of the clime where the Patient is, the constitution of the Planets, the time of the Moone, the season of the yere, the age &amp; complexion of the Patient, &amp; the present state of his body, in strength or weakenesse. For one cure must not euer be vsed for the selfe-same disease, but according to the varying of any of the foresaid circumstances, that sort of remedie must be vsed which is fittest for the same. Whear by the contrarie in this case, such is the miraculous omnipotencie of our strong tasted <hi>Tobacco,</hi> as it cures all sorts of diseases (which neuer any drugge could do before) in all persons, and at all times. It cures all maner of distillations, either
<pb facs="tcp:9591:10"/>
in the head or stomacke (if you beleeue their Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes) although in very deede it doe both corrupt the braine, and by causing ouer quicke disgestion, fill the stomacke full of crudities. It cures the Gowt in the feet, and (which is miraculous) in that very instant when the smoke thereof, as light, flies vp into the head, the vertue thereof, as heauie, runs downe to the little toe. It helpes all sorts of Agues. It makes a man sober that was drunke. It refreshes a weary man, and yet makes a man hungry. Being taken when they goe to bed, it makes one sleepe soundly, and yet being taken when a man is sleepie and drowsie, it will, as they say, awake his braine, and quicken his vnderstanding. As for curing of the Pockes, it serues for that vse but among the pockie Indian slaues. Here in <hi>England</hi> it is refined, and will not deigne to cure heere any other then cleanly and gentlemanly diseases. O omnipotent power of <hi>Tobacco</hi>! And if it could by the smoke thereof chace out deuils, as the smoke of <hi>Tobias</hi> fish did (which I am sure could smel no stronglier) it would serue for a precious Relicke, both for the superstitious Priests, and the insolent Puritanes, to cast out deuils withall.</p>
            <p>Admitting then, and not confessing that the vse thereof were healthfull for some sortes of diseases; should it be vsed for all sicknesses? should it be vsed by all men? should it be vsed at al times? yea should it be vsed by able, yong, strong, healthful men? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine hath that vertue, that it neuer leaueth a man in that state wherin it findeth him: it makes a sicke
<pb facs="tcp:9591:11"/>
man whole, but a whole man sicke. And as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine helpes nature being taken at times of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so being euer and continually vsed, it doth but weaken, wearie, and weare nature. What speake I of Medicine? Nay let a man euery houre of the day, or as oft as many in this countrey vse to take <hi>Tobacco,</hi> let a man I say, but take as oft the best sorts of nourishments in meate and drinke that can bee deuised, hee shall with the continuall vse thereof weaken both his head and his stomacke: all his members shall become feeble, his spirits dull, and in the end, as a drousie lazie belly-god, he shall eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish in a Lethargie.</p>
            <p>And from this weakenesse it proceeds, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this kingdome haue had such a continuall vse of taking this vnsauorie smoke, as now they are not able to forbeare the same, no more then an olde drunkard can abide to be long sober, without fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into an vncurable weakenesse and euill consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: for their continuall custome hath made to them, <hi>habitum, altera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> naturam:</hi> so to those that from their birth haue bene continually nourished vpon poison and things venemous, wholesome meates are onely poisonable.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing, as I truste, sufficiently answered the most principall arguments that are vsed in defence of this vile custome, it rests onely to informe you what sinnes and vanities you commit in the filthie abuse thereof. First, are you not guiltie of sinnefull and shamefull lust? (for lust may bee as well in any of the senses as in feeling) that although you bee
<pb facs="tcp:9591:11"/>
troubled with no disease, but in perfect health, yet can you neither be merry at an Ordinarie, nor las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuious in the Stewes, if you lacke <hi>Tobacco</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke your appetite to any of those sorts of recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lusting after it as the children of Israel did in the wildernesse after Quailes? Secondly it is, as you vse or rather abuse it, a branche of the sinne of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, which is the roote of all sinnes: for as the onely delight that drunkards take in Wine is in the strength of the taste, &amp; the force of the fume there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that mounts vp to the braine: fot no drunkards loue any weake, or sweete drinke: so are not those (I meane the strong heate and the fume) the onely qualities that make <hi>Tobacco</hi> so delectable to all the louers of it? And as no man likes strong headie drinke the first day (because <hi>nemo repente fit turpis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus</hi>) but by custome is piece and piece allured, while in the ende, a drunkard will haue as great a thirst to bee drunke, as a sober man to quench his thirst with a draught when hee hath need of it: So is not this the very case of all the great takers of <hi>Tobacco?</hi> which therefore they themselues do attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to a bewitching qualitie in it. Thirdly, is it not the greatest sinne of all, that you the people of all sortes of this Kingdome, who are created and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined by God to bestowe both your persons and goods for the maintenance both of the honour and safetie of your King and Common-wealth, should disable your selues in both? In your persons hauing by this continuall vile custome brought your selues to this shamefull imbecilitie, that you
<pb facs="tcp:9591:12"/>
are not able to ride or walke the iourney of a Iewes Sabboth, but you must haue a reekie cole brought you from the next poore house to kindle your <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi> with? whereas he cannot be thought able for any seruice in the warres, that cannot endure of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the want of meate, drinke, and sleepe, much more then must hee endure the want of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco.</hi> In the times of the many glorious and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious battailes fought by this Nation, there was no word of <hi>Tobacco:</hi> but now if it were time of warres, and that you were to make some sudden <hi>Caualcado</hi> vpon your enemies, if any of you should seeke lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to stay behinde his fellowe for taking of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,</hi> for my part I should neuer bee sorie for any euill chance that might befall him. To take a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome in any thing that cannot bee left againe, is most harmefull to the people of any land. <hi>Mollicies</hi> and delicacie were the wracke and ouerthrow, first of the Persian, and next of the Romane Empire. And this very custome of taking <hi>Tobacco</hi> (whereof our present purpose is) is euen at this day accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so effeminate among the Indians themselues, as in the market they will offer no price for a slaue to be sold, whome they finde to be a great <hi>Tobacco</hi> taker.</p>
            <p>Now how you are by this custome disabled in your goods, let the Gentry of this land beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, some of them bestowing three, some foure hundred pounds a yeere vpon this precious stinke, which I am sure might be bestowed vpon many farre better vses. I read indeede of a knauish Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
<pb facs="tcp:9591:12"/>
who for abusing the fauour of the Emperour <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> his Master by taking bribes to intercede, for sundry persons in his Masters eare, (for whom he neuer once opened his mouth) was iustly choked with smoke, with this doome, <hi>Fumo pereat, qui fumum vendidit</hi>: but of so many smoke-buyers, as are at this present in this kingdome, I neuer read nor heard.</p>
            <p>And for the vanities committed in this filthie custome, is it not both great vanitie and vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that at the table, a place of respect, of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, of modestie, men should not be ashamed, to sit tossing of <hi>Tobacco pipes,</hi> and puffing of the smoke of <hi>Tobacco</hi> one to another, making the filthy smoke and stinke thereof, to exhale athwart the dishes, and infect the aire, when very often, men that abhorre it are at their repast? Surely Smoke becomes a kitchin far better then a Dining cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and yet it makes a kitchin also oftentimes in the inward parts of men, soiling and infecting them, with an vnctuous and oily kinde of Soote, as hath bene found in some great <hi>Tobacco</hi> takers, that after their death were opened. And not onely meate time, but no other time nor action is exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the publike vse of this vnciuill tricke: so as if the wiues of <hi>Diepe</hi> list to contest with this Nation for good maners, their worst maners would in all reason be found at least not so disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest (as ours are) in this point. The publike vse whereof, at all times, and in all places, hath now so farre preuailed, as diuers men very sound both in
<pb facs="tcp:9591:13"/>
iudgement, and complexion, haue bene at last for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take it also without desire, partly because they were ashamed to seeme singular, (like the two Philosophers that were forced to duck themselues in that raine water, and to become fooles aswell as the rest of the people) and partly to be as one that was content to eate Garlicke (which hee did not loue) that he might not be troubled with the smell of it, in the breath of his fellowes. And is it not a great vanitie, that a man cannot heartily welcome his friend now, but straight they must bee in hand with <hi>Tobacco?</hi> No it is become in place of a cure, a point of good fellowship, and he that will refuse to take a pipe of <hi>Tobacco</hi> among his fellowes, (though by his owne election he would rather feele the fauour of a Sinke) is accounted peeuish and no good company, euen as they doe with tippeling in the cold Easterne Countries. Yea the Mistresse cannot in a more manerly kinde, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine her seruant, then by giuing him out of her faire hand a pipe of <hi>Tobacco.</hi> But herein is not onely a great vanitie, but a great contempt of Gods good giftes, that the sweetenesse of mans breath, being a good gift of God, should be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully corrupted by this stinking smoke, wherein I must confesse, it hath too strong a vertue: and so that which is an ornament of nature, and can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any artifice be at the first acquired, nor once lost, be recouered againe, shall be filthily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with an incurable stinke, which vile qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is as directly contrary to that wrong opinion
<pb facs="tcp:9591:13"/>
which is holden of the wholesomnesse thereof, as the venime of putrifaction is contrary to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue Preseruatiue.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, which is a great iniquitie, and against all humanitie, the husband shall not bee ashamed, to reduce thereby his delicate, wholesome, and cleane complexioned wife, to that extremitie, that either shee must also corrupt her sweete breath therewith, or else resolue to liue in a perpetuall stinking torment.</p>
            <p>Haue you not reason then to bee ashamed, and to forbeare this filthie noueltie, so basely groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, so foolishly receiued, and so grossely mistaken in the right vse thereof? In your abuse thereof sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against God, harming your selues both in persons and goods, and raking also thereby the markes and notes of vanitie vpon you: by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome thereof making your selues to be wondered at by all forraine ciuil Nations, and by all strangers that come among you, to be scorned and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. A custome lothsome to the eye, hatefull to the Nose, harmefull to the braine, daungerous to the Lungs and in the blacke stinking fume there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, neerest resembling the horrible Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian smoke of the pit that is bottomelesse.</p>
