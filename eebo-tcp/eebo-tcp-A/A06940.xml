         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſaying, <hi>Tempus

So I, <hi>Gentle
Reader,</hi> hauing
gained experience all my life
to theſe preſent dayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I am ready to creepe into
the earth, willing now at the
important requeſt of my beſt
Friends, haue yeelded my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:23895:3"/>
to lay the Glorie of my
Skill in <hi>Horſemanſhip</hi> open to
the World: And hauing kept
ſecret in the Cabinet of my
Breſt, theſe Secrets, by which
I haue gained from many a
Noble perſon many a fayre
pound, I now beſtow it vpon
thee for the value of <hi>Foure
Pence.</hi> It may bee ſome will
account mee a Foole in print
for diſcloſing my Secrets, but
I euer regarded the life of a
worthy Horſe, before the
Word of a Foole. For bee
thou Noble, or what elſe, this
here I doe is for thy Good.
If you take pleaſure either in
an Horſe to <hi>Hunt,</hi> or for the
<pb facs="tcp:23895:3"/>
               <hi>Warre,</hi> or for the <hi>Race,</hi> or for
to <hi>Draw,</hi> or a <hi>Hackney,</hi> come
hither, buy, ſee, and welcome.
Take my opinion, and thou
ſhalt finde in this my honeſt
<hi>Faithfull Farryer,</hi> a <hi>Shoppe</hi> of
Skill for thee to view: Let
this bee thy Doctor, and thy
Druggiſt: Let this be thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructer
and Director. I hope
that no good minded <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryer</hi>
will be greeued with me
becauſe I giue inſight to the
Maſter of the Horſe: For if
thy Houſe were on fire, why
ſhouldeſt thou run to fetch
thy Neighbours Water to
quench it, when thine owne
is neerer at hand? So if the
<pb facs="tcp:23895:4"/>
Horſes Owner know by this
Booke how to ſaue the life
of his Horſe, why ſhould he
either ride or run to the <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryer?</hi>
But it may bee euerie
Owner of an Horſe will not
buy a Booke. It matters not
if but euery <hi>Farryer</hi> haue one,
and but that one in a Towne,
I doubt not, but with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vſe of that one, many
a Man ſhall ſaue the life of
his Beaſt. Come therefore
and reade theſe Secrets, which
coſt me <hi>Paines, Studie, Practiſe,</hi>
and <hi>Labour;</hi> All which hath
coſt mee <hi>Trouble</hi> for thy <hi>Eaſe.</hi>
This ſhall bee thy <hi>Pleaſure</hi>
which hath beene my <hi>Toyle.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23895:4"/>
It ſhall bee thy <hi>Profit</hi> which
hath beene my <hi>Trouble:</hi> And
this ſhall bee thy <hi>Faithfull
Farryer</hi> and <hi>Inctructer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what Creature canſt
thou name more neceſſarie
than the Horſe, and what
more helpefull at a time of
need?</p>
            <p>For were wee without
Horſe, in what a ſtrait ſhould
wee bee in, hee being our beſt
Seruant both in <hi>Warre</hi> and
<hi>Peace,</hi> and of that ineſtimable
value, that hee makes a Man
proud of his ſeruice.</p>
            <p>Now if an Horſe be ſuch
a profitable Seruant for Man,
let vs then reſpect the meanes
<pb facs="tcp:23895:5"/>
that God hath giuen vs for
his Cure: For here is a <hi>Schoole</hi>
of Skill for thy knowledge.
Firſt, How to make choyſe of
a good Horſe: Secondly,
what Countrey Horſe is the
moſt fit for thy vſe: Either
for ſeruice in <hi>Martiall</hi> or <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>
imployment, or for <hi>Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
or for <hi>Long trauell,</hi> or for
<hi>Draught,</hi> or for <hi>Coach,</hi> or for
<hi>Cart,</hi> or for <hi>Packe,</hi> or any other
<hi>Burthen.</hi> This ſhalt thou find
here, in as ample manner, as
if thou wert an old Maſter
in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> And this ſhall
bee my Glorie euen as long
as I liue, that I haue liued to
leaue this my laſt and beſt
<pb facs="tcp:23895:5"/>
Worke to the World, and to
them which will not liue to
ſee it buried in <hi>Obliuion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But mee thinkes I here
ſome <hi>Momus</hi> ſay, That the old
Captaine was vnaduiſed to
put this in print, which hee
euer kept as a rare Secret, and
it is true, <hi>Veritas odium parit.</hi>
But I reply, <hi>Tempus omnia ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat.</hi>
And though I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to my ſelfe, neuer to
haue publiſhed this worke,
yet being ſo continually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned
to print it, I was
forced to yeeld, though I had
promiſed the contrarie. And
let this excuſe mee to thoſe
<hi>Noble</hi> perſons whoſe bountie
<pb facs="tcp:23895:6"/>
I haue felt, that for them I was
the willinger to publiſh it in
print while I liued, fearing
that after my death, my then

this, being begot in my old

yellowes in the whites of the eyes,

then the ſignes are a perplexed and

            <p>Thus you haue the foure occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſickneſſes, and the ſignes by
which to know thoſe occaſions.
Now for as much as ſickneſſes
come many times ſuddenly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt
for, and that not any man
(how skilful ſo euer) but may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
bee ouertaken with the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſickeneſſe of his horſe: And
though hee can after vpon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
giue an account for ſuch
ſickneſſe when it is apparant, yet
till nature haue thruſt it forth, the
diſeaſe was obſcure to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
therefore I will here ſhew
thoſe generall and moſt vſuall
ſignes which doe attend and waite
vpon euery ſickneſſe, by which you
may bee enabled to know the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
or beginning of ſickneſſe
before it take faſt hold on the vitall
parts, and ſo vſe preuention; or if it
haue taken ſome ſmall hold, then
how to fortifie nature againſt it,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23895:14"/>
and ſo to kill the Contagion, ere it
come to any great height of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
or being at the higheſt, how to
qualifie the extremitie, and to bring
euery vitall part and ſpirit to its
firſt moderate ſtate and temper.</p>
            <p>Now that you may effect this the
better, it is requiſite that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
your knowledge well with
the complections, qualities, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes,
and conditions of horſes;
for whenſoeuer you ſhall finde any
alteration in any of theſe, bee ſure
there will follow alteration of
health, as thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in the complections of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which I draw from their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
and countenances: If your
horſe be a faire bright daplegray or
a fleabitten, a white, a white-gray
or the like; if any of theſe colours,
being naturally cleare and bright,
ſhall grow duskiſh or cloudy, or the
white hayres ſhall turne ſandy and
reddiſh, it is a ſigne of ſome vnnat u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23895:14"/>
diſtemperature in the horſe,
and that hee is euill affected, and
either entreth into a conſumption,
or into ſome other inward diſeaſe
of body.</p>
            <p>If the horſe bee of a pure blacke
colour, a bright bay, a browne bay,
or a red ſorrell without flexen
Maine, or flexen Taile, a cleare
cheſſenut or a mouſe-dun; if thſe
haires ſhall grow diſcoloured and
contrary to their proper natures,
that is to ſay, of a weaker and worſe
complection; as if the black turne
dunniſh or yellow, the bright bay,
cloudy, pale, &amp; ſandy; the browne
bay like the mouſe-dunne; the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorrell,
corrall or like the yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunne;
the cheſſenut, hoarie and
grey; and the mouſe-dunne, of a
more blacke and pale blue then is
naturall, all theſe are ſignes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſickeneſſes. And as of theſe
colours, ſo of any other colour
whatſoeuer, if they ſhall alter from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23895:15"/>
their proper and true natures, to a
worſe and more vncomely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection,
that is to ſay, to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection
that is vnuaturall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
for an horſe, they are moſt
pregnant ſignes of ſome inward
ſickneſſe, which either lingereth
vpon the horſe, or elſe is ſodainly in
breaking forth; and therefore by
all meanes remember, that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of colours bee vnnaturall.
For you muſt vnderſtand, that if
the daple-grey, in proceſſe of time,
do turne to white; the darke Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grey,
to a bright grey; the blacke,
to an Iron grey, and ſuch like; that
then this is a naturall, and no vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
alteration, and ſo no ſigne of
ſickneſſe; and therefore not to bee
deceiued, or to ſtand doubtfull at
all, acquaint your ſelfe well with
the true colour and complection of
your horſe, which you ſhall beſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne
when hee is in the pride and
height of luſt, when hee is wanton,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23895:15"/>
full of fleſh and ſmooth, ſleeke, and
ſhining: and when you ſhal ſee this
complection alter, in part, or all;
then euer expect ſome ſickneſſe,</p>
            <p>As you thus acquaint your ſelfe
with the complection of your
horſe, which I include in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
ſo you muſt alſo haue a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
knowledge in his countenance
and geſtures; and to that end you
ſhall be carefull to marke and note
his countenance and behauiour in
all his actions and motions, as well
within doores as without, as well in
his play, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s in his reſt, at his times of
feeding, &amp; at his times of exerciſe;
you ſhall note the cheerefulneſſe of
his eye, the cariage of his head and
necke; which be his angry Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
and which bee his pleaſant,
when he biteth for wantonneſſe or
for offence; and theſe you ſhall beſt
finde out, in his feeding, in his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
and playing, and in his dreſſing;
and if at any time you finde any of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23895:16"/>
theſe Characters of fayle on the
ſudden, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is geſture is more
lumpiſh heauy; then call your ſelfe
to account what you haue done, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in exerciſe, feeding, ayring, or
ordering: For there is no doubt
but there is diſtemperature, and
ſickneſſe is approaching, if it be not
preuented.</p>
            <p>As you thus acquaint your ſelfe
with the complection and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of your horſe; ſo you muſt
alſo not be ignorant, but obſerue
diuerſe other outward and inward
quallities, for they are the greateſt
lights that can bee, both to health
and ſickneſſe; and to this end you
ſhall eſpecially marke his filling &amp;
his emptying, that is, his manner of
feeding, and the manner of diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his body.</p>
            <p>In his feeding, whether he eateth
with a good appetite, or a weake
ſtomacke; the firſt is healthfull, the
latter vnwholeſome. If he eate with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23895:16"/>
a good Appetite, he will Neigh and
call for his meate before it come,
when either he ſeeth his Keeper, or
a preparation for feeding, as ſifting
of his Oates, chipping of his Bread,
and the like; hee will receiue it
cheerefully, and greedyly, ſhaking
his Head, and ſhewing other ſignes
of alacritie and reioycing, which
quallities after he hath vſed, if on
the ſuddaine he refraine and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
his meate dully and vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly,
it is a great ſigne of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>As his feeding, ſo you ſhall marke
his quallities in emptying, as the
Time, the Place, the Subſtance: the
Time, as whether he emptieth in

commonly falleth out according to
the Food he eateth; if it be cleere,
firme, and pale, with white graines,
and in complection like ſweet ſope,
then it is wholſome; if it be blacke
it ſhewes heat in the body, if grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
then it ſhewes foulneſſe, if red

pale and looſe, then inward cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
And as thus you obſerue his
Ordure, ſo you muſt alſo obſerue
his Vrine: Of both which I haue
written ſufficiently in my former
Bookes.</p>
            <p>As theſe quallities of feeding
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23895:17"/>
and emptying, ſo you ſhall note his
quallities in Reſt and Watching,
that is, in his lying down and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vp, what howres and time hee
obſerueth for either, and how long
he perſeuereth in them, and if at
any time you find any ſuddaine or
groſſe alteration, then be aſſured of
ſome ſickneſſe approaching. And
thus of any other particular qualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in your Horſe (which you ſhall
obſerue in his health) for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to nominate all, if you find
them ſuddainly to ſurpriſe, it is
doubtleſſe that there is ſome ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
following.</p>
            <p>As you thus obſerue the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection
&amp; quallities of the Horſe,
ſo you muſt obſerue his naturall
cuſtomes and conditions, and how
in his liuelihood and beſt health he
ſtandeth affected, for to name them
I cannot, becauſe they proceed moſt
from hidden inclinations, or elſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall
apprehenſions, which by

continuance of time grow to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
habits. And any of theſe when
they ſhall ſurceaſe or faile, are true
progoaſtications of diſtemperature
and ſickneſſe.</p>
            <p>Many other ſignes of ſickneſſe
there are, as the not caſting of the
Coate in due time, Hyde-bound,
continuall diſlike and leanneſſe,
where there is good feeding, beſide

            <p>Whenſoeuer, either by the ſignes
before rehearſed, or other accident
or knowledge you ſhall find your
Horſe grieuouſly payned with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſickneſſe, the firſt thing you
doe you ſhall open his Neck-veine
and receiue ſome of the firſt blood
into a Pewter porrenger, which if
you ſet it in cold water it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
diſcouer the foulneſſe and
putrefaction; ſo then you ſhall let
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23895:19"/>
the Horſe bleed well till the blood
change, neither muſt you be nice or
tender in this action, becauſe you
muſt vnderſtand, that all inward
ſickneſſes in Horſes, draw their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
from the putrefaction of the
blood only: And this is the reaſon.</p>
            <p>It is certaine that the Horſe (of
all other Creatures) hath no Gall
or naturall Veſſell into which to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the skummy and putrefied
matter which ariſeth fom the
corrupt and collericke blood, but it
is either auoyded in excrements,
humours, or moderate exerciſe and
ſweates, or elſe by immoderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
and violent labour. By too
much repletion and fulneſſe, by
vnwholſome food and euill dyet, or
by ſome other naturall defect, this
chollericke corruption increaſing
and ouerflowing, it preſently and in
an inſtant ouer-ſpreads the whole
body, hauing its courſe through
euerie veine, and ſo diſcoloureth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23895:19"/>
the skin, and makes all the outward
partes yellow, eſpecially the Eyes,
and inſide of the Lips; alſo mixing
with the better blood, and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the ſtrength and vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
it brings a generall faintneſſe
ouer all the body, and in the end ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focating
the heart, of force there
muſt follow ſodaine and certaine
mortallitie, and hence proceedeth
thoſe ſodaine deathes of Horſes for
which our weake <hi>Farriers</hi> can giue
but an idle and fooliſh account.</p>
            <p>But to returne to my purpoſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
you haue taken away good ſtore
of blood, and (as you imagine) all,
or at leaſt moſt part of that which
is corrupt, you ſhall then ſet him vp
in the Stable, tying his head to the
emptic Racke gently and at lyberty,
neither ſo high that he ſhall be
compelled to reſt his Head vpon
the Bridle, nor yet ſo low that hee
may thruſt his Head into the
Maunger, and thus ye ſhall let him
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23895:20"/>
and at leaſt two howres.</p>
            <p>Now if the ſickneſſe be not very
contagious, and dangerous, you ſhall
not adminiſter any potion vnto him
that day, becauſe the veine being
opened, and all the humors, powers
and faculties of the body diſturbed,
it will bee a double vexation to the
ſpirits to haue the working of the
Potion alſo; therefore in this caſe,
the ſickneſſe not being violent, you
may forbeare further adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and onely after the Horſe hath
faſted, as before ſaid, you ſhall giue
him ſuch food as he will eate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it bee Hay, Bread or Corne, and
alwayes prouided, that it be ſtrong
ſauorie, ſweet, dry, and cleane dreſt:
as for the quantitie, it matters not,
for a ſmall pittance will maintaine
life; and humor is now to the Horſe
as food, beſides, emptines is no great
diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>At high Noone you ſhall giue
him a ſweete Maſh of Malt and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23895:20"/>
Water made in this manner.</p>
            <p>Take halfe a pecke of good Malt
well ground, and put it into a payle
by it ſelfe, then take a gallon of
faire, cleere Water, and ſet it on the
fire, then when it is come to the
heighth that it is ready to boyle,
put as much of it to the Malt as
will moyſt and couer the Malt all
ouer, and ſtirre them exceedingly
well together, cruſhing the Malt
with a flat Rudder as much as you
can, euer and anon taſting it with
your finger, till it bee as ſweet as any
Honey, and then couer it ouer with
Cloathes as cloſe as you can, and ſo
let it ſtand and ſtoone for two or
three howres at the leaſt; then the
howre being come in which the
Horſe is to receiue it, vncouer the
Maſh, and ſtirre it well about, but
finding it too hot, then put to it
ſome cleere cold Water that may
temper and allay it, but in any wife
not ſo much as may take away any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23895:21"/>
part of the ſweetneſſe, and in this
tempering, with your hand cruſh
and ſqueeze the Malt as much as
you can, then (the Maſh being luke
warme) giue it the Horſe to drink,
and if he will eat of the Malt, let
him take thereof at his pleaſure.
This is the beſt manner of making
an ordinarie Maſh, or Horſe-Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
for of that nature and quallitie
it is, and to that purpoſe that a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
is adminiſtred to a Man, is this
giuen to a Horſe, for you muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that in theſe contagious
diſeaſes nothing is more peſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ilent
than cold Water, and eſpecially
when exerciſe cannot be vſed.</p>
            <p>The ruder <hi>Farriers</hi> and Horſe-Groomes
doe make the Maſh ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, putting the Malt to the
Water at the firſt, and ſo boyling
them both together, but this is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome
and naught, and that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
good Houſe-wife can witneſſe,
for this long boyling ouer-ſcaldes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23895:21"/>
the Malt, takes away the ſtrength
and ſweetneſſe, and giues an harſh
and vnſauorie taſte, which is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue
to the Horſes nature.</p>
            <p>If your Horſe be coy and refuſe
to take the Maſh, as many are, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for want of vſe and cuſtome, and
partly through weakneſſe of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
then you ſhall ſtraine the
Water from the Malt exceeding
hard, and ſo giue it him with an
Horne to drinke, then take the
Graines which you haue ſo ſtrained
and put them in the Manger before
the Horſe, on which whether he
feed or no it matters not, for if he
but ſmell and ſnuffell his noſe vpon
them, it is ſufficient, and the fume
thereof is wonderous wholſome
for his head.</p>
            <p>After you haue thus giuen him
his Maſh, you ſhall ſee that he be
very warmely cloathed, as namely,
a good woollen Body-Cloath to
come round about his heart, a large
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23895:22"/>
Cloath or two to come ouer it, and
to be well wiſpt round about, with
ſoft, thicke, and large wiſpes; for the
little, hard, and neat wiſpes, though
they are comly to the eye, yet are
they vnwholſome for the body, for
their hardneſſe and ſmalneſſe makes
an impreſſion into the Horſes ſides,
and cauſeth him forbeare to lye
downe when Nature and reſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
it.</p>
            <p>The Horſe being thus warmely
cloathed as aforeſaid, and with a
very warme Breſt-cloath before his
breaſt, for that is an eſpeciall part to
keepe warme, you ſhall then cauſe
one or two to rub all his foure Legs
from his Knees &amp; Cambrels down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with very hard wiſpes, and to
rub them ſo hard as may be, and
whilſt his limbes are thus in rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
you ſhall take a courſe rubber
or two made of new harden or
hempen Cloth, and warming one
after another ouer a pan of Coales,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23895:22"/>
with them rub the Horſe exceeding
much in the nape of the Necke, or
the Polle iuſt betweene his Eares,
and on the Temples of the Head;
for there is nothing more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
than theſe frictions and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fings,
for they diſſolue humours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue
all naturall heat, bring a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
nimbleneſſe into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>limbes,
and purge the head of all groſſe,
cold, and tough matter, cleanſing
and purifying the Brayne, by which
the members and other faculties
are fortified, and the whole Body
reduced backe to its firſt ſtrength
and abillitie.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as you haue ended this
action of rubbing, you may then
let the Horſe take his reſt for two
or three howres, and onely leaue a
locke or two of ſweete Hay in his
Racke, and no more, for the leaſt
quantitie of any things too much
ſoone cloyeth a ſicke Horſe.</p>
            <p>In the Euening you ſhall come
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23895:23"/>
to the Horſe againe, and hauing
rubbed all his limbes and head, as
was before ſhewed, you ſhall then
perfume his head in this manner.</p>
            <p>Take of the beſt and pureſt <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anum</hi>
an ounce, then as much <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax,</hi>
and as much <hi>Beniamin,</hi> and
bruiſe all them together, I doe not
meane bruiſe them to ſmall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but onely breake them into
ſmall lumpes, and mixe them well
together, ſo that taking them vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
your fingers, you may not
take vp one ingredient alone, but
ſome of all. Then take a Chafing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh,
and if it be poſſible, a Chafing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
after the manner of the perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Chafingdiſh, which is wide
below where the fire is, and narrow
at the top where the ſmoake auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
and in this Chafingdiſh put
well kindled Wood cole, or ſmall
Charcoale; then take ſome of the
aforeſad perfume, and lay it vpon
the Coales, but in any wiſe ſo as it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23895:23"/>
may not flame but ſmoake, then
hold the Chafingdiſh vnder the
Horſes noſe, and let the ſmoake
goe vp into his Noſtrils, and thus
perfume him well for the ſpace of
a quarter of an howre, or halfe an
howre at the moſt. Now it may be
the Horſe may ſeeme coy to receiue
this at the firſt, becauſe it is ſtrange
vnto him, but doe you continue the
action, and cheriſh him, for be you
well aſſured, after he hath once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the ſmell into the head, hee
will be as greedy to haue it, as you
are willing to giue it, for there is
nothing that delighteth an Horſe
more, or more reioyceth his ſpirits,
than ſweet ſauors, and odoriferous
ſmells, of which this perfume is one
of the cheefeſt.</p>
            <p>The effect which this perfume
worketh, is, that it purgeth the
Brayne of all filthy and corrupt
matter, and (as you ſhall find by
experience in the working) it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolues
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23895:24"/>
tough matter into water, and
brings it away in ſuch abundance,
that it is ſometimes ready to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the fire as it falleth. It is the
greateſt comforter of the Braine
that can be, and from thence ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
ſuch cheerefullneſſe to the
heart, that it reioyceth the whole
body.</p>
            <p>There are diuers other perfumes
which weake <hi>Farriers</hi> vſe in this
caſe, as namely, wet Hay, or rotten
Litter, and putting a burning Coale
therein, giue the ſmoake to the
Horſe: But this is a ſtinking sauor
and no perfume, and although it
make the Horſe ſnoare and neeſe,
and ſo you may imagin it auoydeth
fowle matter, yet it is nothing ſo,
but it offendeth both his Brayne
and ſtomacke, and by the noyſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the ſmell dulleth and
weakeneth the ſpirits, and rather
ingendereth infection, than any way
abateth infirmitie; for from rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23895:24"/>
there can but rottenneſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>Next there is the Perfume of
<hi>Brimſtone,</hi> either ſimple of it ſelfe
and put vpon the fire; or elſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
with another body, as <hi>Butter,
Oyle,</hi> or the like, and ſo thruſt vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Horſes noſtrils. This I muſt
needes confeſſe is a ſharpe Perfume,
and euacuateth much foule matter,
and diſſolueth the thickeſt matter
into thin water: But yet you muſt
know, that there is in this <hi>Sulphure,</hi>
or <hi>Brimstone</hi> a certaine earthy and
poyſonous quallity, which not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth offend the vitall parts, but is
alſo moſt malignant and iniurious
both to the eyes of Man and Beaſt,
ſo that like <hi>Margery Goodcowe,</hi> if it
haue one vertue, yet two vices at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it.</p>
            <p>Then there are the Perfumes of
the Stalkes of <hi>Onions, Garlicke,
Leekes, Muſtard-ſeed,</hi> and the like, or
the Perfume of the Fruits them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

perfumed, as beforeſaid, you ſhall
let him reſt for a quarter of an

howre, and then giue him ſuch food
as he wil eat, either Bread or Oates,
of which how little ſoeuer he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

that his ſtomacke is now at the

            <p>After he is fed you ſhall toſſe vp
his Litter, for you muſt know that
he muſt ſtand vpon Litter Night

            <p>When you haue taken halfe an

Potion to drinke. Then if he haue
any ſmall ſtrength, you ſhall mount

and faſt for another houre, or more,
then offer him a little ſweete Hay,
or any other meat that he will eat,
and ſo let him ſtand till betwixt
twelue and one of the Clocke in
the afternoone, at which time you
ſhall firſt rub his Head and Legges
well, as was formerly declared for

you ſhall offer him either Oates or

handfull by handfull and be ſure it
be ſweet &amp; cleane dreſt, ſifted and
duſted, and ſo let him reſt till eight
of the clocke at Night, at which
time you ſhal againe perfume him.
Then put ſweet Hay in his Racke,
toſſe vp his Litter, and right his

Cloathes, but in any wiſe bare not

            <p>The next day being the third day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
you ſhall doe all things as you did
the ſecond day, already rehearſed.
As firſt, you ſhall giue him his Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Diapente</hi> and ſweete wine,
then ayre him, at Noone his Maſh,
at Euening and Night his perfume,
with all other obſeruations that
were before declared.</p>
            <p>The next day, which is the fourth
day, there is no doubt (with the
helpe of God) but you ſhall finde
alteration and health approaching,
which you ſhall know by his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
by his more cheerefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and by other outward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
and finding that health is
comming, you may then forbeare
to giue him any more Potions, and
onely attend him with good Food,
good dreſſing, and moderate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23895:27"/>
neither ſhall you giue him any
more Maſhes, for although they be
wholſome in the extreamitie of
ſickneſſe, yet being any thing too
much vſed, they take away the
Horſes ſtomacke, and brings him to
a loathing of other meat, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in ſteade thereof, you ſhall in
the Morning after your Horſe is
well rubd and dreſt, take a pottle of
faire Water, and heat it ſcalding
hot, then put it into a gallon, or two
of cleere cold Water, that it may
take away the extreame coldneſſe
thereof, and then being ſcarcely
lukewarme, giue it the Horſe to
drinke: You may, if you pleaſe,
throw an handfull of Bran, or an
handfull of Wheat-Meale into the
Water, for it is good, and not hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
As ſoone as the Horſe hath
drunke, take his backe, and ride
him forth gently for an howre, or
two.</p>
            <p>At Noone perfume him, at Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23895:28"/>
water him as you did in the

               </gap>
time of health, and thus doe for
three or foure dayes more, then
finding his ſtrength increaſing, you
may be degrees abate his Cloathes,
you may water him abroad at ſome
cleare Riuer, or Spring, gallop him
after his watering, and draw euerie
thing to the ſame cuſtome as you
did in beſt health.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the manner how to
cure an Horſe that is ſicke, but not
violently ſicke, and as it were at the
very poynt and doore of death,
which Cure is this which
followeth.</p>

When this Confection is made,
you ſhall take a full halfe ounce
thereof, or more, and diſſolue it in a

ſo giue it the Horſe to drinke with
an Horne: Then if he haue ſo much

or ſome cloſe Barne, or emptie

him, cloathe him, dyet, and order
him in all reſpects as was ſhewed
you in the former Cure, and thus
you ſhall doe for three dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without all fayle, and then no

            <p>At the end of three dayes you
ſhall forbeare all ſorts of Maſhes of
both kindes, and follow all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
before declared.</p>
            <p>Now if during the Cure, either
through the violence of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
or the foulneſſe of the Horſes
Body, you ſhall finde any hard Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtules
or Swellings to ryſe vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Horſes Chaps, and at
the Root of the Tongue, then you
ſhall firſt clip away the hayre as
cloſe as may be; then you ſhall take
a Waxe Candle, and therewith
burne the ſwelling, till you may
ſcarifie the Skinne, then take a peece
of Leather, ſomewhat larger then
the ſwelling, and hauing prickt it
all ouer with the point of your
Knife, ſpread thereupon in ſome
thicke manner your blacke Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers-Waxe,
that is well ſeaſoned
and new; then warming it ouer a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23895:30"/>
few Coles, lay it vpon the ſwelling
and remoue it not, till it either fall
off by it ſelfe, or els the ſore breake,
then renew the Plaſter, and with it
onely heale vp the Sore. This
Plaſter for the cheapneſſe, and
meanneſſe will hardly win credite
with thoſe which are curious: But
I dare aſſure you (that are a louer
of Truth) that there is not a more
exellent or ſoueraigne Plaſter
which belongs to an Horſe, for it
ripeneth and breaketh any Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumation
whatſoeuer, it aſſwageth
any hard ſwelling or tumor, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Ioynts, or other Fleſhy
parts, and it healeth what it brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
or ripeneth, and with its heat
it diſſolues all manner of humours
that are knit together, and occaſion
paine or ſwelling.</p>
            <p>There is another accident which
attendeth the ſickneſſe of Horſes,
and that is Coſtiueneſſe, or Belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binding,
which maketh an Horſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23895:30"/>
that he cannot Dung, or auoyd his
Ordure. This accident when at any
time it hapneth, it ſhall be good
for you firſt to rake him, that is, you
ſhall annoynt your hand all ouer
with ſweet Butter, or clarified
Hogges greaſe: Some vſe Oyle of
Bays, but it is too ſharpe, and too
hot, and many times (if the action
be vſed too roughly, or vnaduiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
it breedeth exulceration and
ſoreneſſe in the Tuell, and inward
parts. Therefore, as before I ſaid,
take either Butter, or Hogs greaſe,
and your hand being all beſmeared
therewith, thruſt it vp into his Tuell
till you feele his Ordure, and then
drawing out as much thereof (if it
be blacke and hard) as conueniently
you can, without doing iniury to
the Horſe, or ſtriuing with your
hand to goe too farre: And if you
finde it to be very ſore baked with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
then after you haue raked &amp; got
what you can, you ſhall take a great
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:23895:31"/>
Candle or Percher of three or foure
in the pound at the moſt, and cutting
off an inch or two of the vpper or
ſmaller end, with your hand annoint
as before, thruſting the great end
forward, put it vp into his Tuell ſo
farre as you can get it, then ſuddenly
drawing out your hand, and leauing
the Candle behind you, clap downe
his Tayle cloſe to his Tuell, and
drawing it vp betweene his Legges,
hold it with both your hands hard
and conſtantly for the ſpace of an
houre, or more, in which time the
Candle will diſſolue in the Horſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

body, and ſo ſeparate and breake
his Ordure, that vpon the letting
looſe of your hands, he will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dung.</p>
            <p>This you may doe in euery caſe
of extremity, but not otherwiſe:
and beleeue it, you will finde this
the moſt excellenteſt Suppoſitorie
of all other, and that there is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is another accident which
attendeth the ſickneſſe of Horſes,
and that is quite contrarie to this
before rehearſed, and is called Lax,
atiueneſſe or Looſeneſſe of Body,
which is expreſſed by a vehement
and violent ſcowring: This, if at
any time it ſhall happen, you ſhall
at firſt note the violence therof, and
the continuance thereof.</p>
            <p>The violence is knowne by the
thinneſſe, the ſharpneſſe, and the oft
and ſpeedy auoyding of the Excr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The continuance is knowne by
the vnchangeableneſſe of the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
and by the proceſſe and long
continuance of time, contrarie to
all naturall and wholſome cuſtome,
for you are to obſerue that an horſe
may haue a ſcowring for a day, or
two, or a little more, and this is not
vnwholſome, but natural and good,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:23895:32"/>
and if after it ſtay of it ſelfe, then
it worketh no euill effect, but if it
continue longer, and bring the

this doe one morning, or two, or
three if need require. For mine own

good effect, and ſo I hope all men
ſhall find that approue it.</p>
            <p>Now whereas in all my Cures
heretofore in this Booke for Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of what extremitie ſoeuer, I
make you onely rely vpon <hi>Diapente,</hi>

obſeruations and conſiderations.</p>
            <p>The firſt, is to preuent it before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>

               </gap>
all.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, is to take it at the
rſt appearance, and ſo preuent it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:23895:33"/>
that it ariſe not to any great danger
or hazard.</p>
            <p>To preuent ſickneſs that it offend
not your Horſe at all, it is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
courſe when you put your
Horſe to graſſe, euer three or four<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
dayes before you turne him out, to
take Blood from his Necke veine;
then the next day after to giue him
a pint and an halfe of <hi>Muskadine,</hi>
and halfe an ounce of the Powder,
of <hi>Diapente,</hi> or three quarters of an
ounce of the Horſe <hi>Mithridate,</hi> or
<hi>Treakle,</hi> before rehearſed; and then
by degree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to abate his Cloathes,
if he haue been vſed to any, and to
make his body familiar with cold.
Alſo you ſhall obſerue when you
let your Horſe blood, to proportion
the quantitie which you take from
him, according to the goodneſſe or
badneſſe of the blood when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it, for the loſſe of good blood
is vnholſome, and doth hurt, and
to preſerue ill blood, is both dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23895:34"/>
and noyſom. Alſo if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue,
when you take blood from
your Horſe, to rcceiue it into a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
and by ſtirring it about conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
as the Horſe bleedeth, to
keepe it from clotting, then hauing
bled, to take the blood, aud to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeere
it all ouer the Horſes backe
and body, you ſhall find it wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
wholſome, for it comforteth
the body, cleareth the skin, and
breedeth a reioycing in all the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
vitall parts.</p>
            <p>Now if you haue no determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to put your horſe to graſſe, and
yet you wold preuent inward ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
then you ſhall obſerue, once
in two or three moneths, when you
haue the beſt leaſure to reſt your
Horſe after it, not to fayle to giue
your Horſe <hi>Muskadine</hi> &amp; <hi>Diapente,</hi>
or <hi>Muskadine</hi> &amp; horſe <hi>Methridate,</hi>
as was before ſhewed, and not to let
blood at all, for this verie Potion is
the greateſt purger and purifier of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23895:34"/>
the blood that can be, and auoideth
all that yellow cholericke matter,
and other euill and vndigeſted hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
whrch corrupt the blood.</p>
            <p>Now you are to obſerue here,
that although I only preſcribe <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kadine</hi>
wherein you ſhall diſſolue
your Powder, or <hi>Methridate,</hi> yet
know that when you cannot get
<hi>Muskadine,</hi> or other ſweet Wine,
that then you may take ſtrong Ale,
or Beere, but in greater quantitie,
for as you take but a pint &amp; an halfe
of Wine, you ſhall take of Beere or
Ale a full Ale quart; as for the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or <hi>Methridate</hi> you ſhal keep the
firſt quantitie already preſcribed,
and if you warme your Beere or
Ale a little on the fire, it will not be
amiſſe, but better, yet that I referre
to your owne diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Now to take ſickneſſe at the firſt
approach, and to preuent it, that it
ariſe not to any great danger, you
ſhall by all meanes obſerue to looke
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23895:35"/>
well into the occaſions of ſickneſſes
which are already ſhewed, and into
the ſignes of thoſe occaſions, and if
you finde your ſelfe guilty of any of
thoſe occaſions, or that the Horſe
diſcouereth any of the former ſigns,
then preſently let the Horſe blood,
and three ſeuerall mornings after
giue him the Drinke or Potion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
preſcribed, and vndoubtedly it
will preuent all the force of ſicknes,
and reſtore the Horſe to his former
