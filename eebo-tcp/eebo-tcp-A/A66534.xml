            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho the Author of this Hiſtory of Birds was, and why after ſo many Books of this Subject already publiſhed we ſhould attempt to ſet it forth, the Reader may perchance deſire ſome information and account, which we ſhall endeavour briefly to give him. As for the Author the Title-page preſents him with his Name and Country. He was the only Son of Sir <hi>Francis Willughby</hi> Knight, deſcended of two very ancient Families, both <hi>Willugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byes,</hi> the one Honourable, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Eresby</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> by the Fathers ſide; the other Worſhipful, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Willughby</hi> on the <hi>Woulds</hi> in <hi>Notinghamſhire,</hi> by the Mothers. His Mother was the Lady <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> Daughter to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>London-Derry.</hi> He was moreover endowed with excellent gifts and abilities both of body and mind, and bleſſed with a fair Eſtate. Howbeit, as he did duly prize theſe advantages of Birth, Eſtate, and Parts, ſo did he not content himſelf therewith, or value himſelf thereby, but laboured after what might render him more deſervedly honourable, and more truly be called his own, as being obtained by the concurrence at leaſt of his endeavours. Firſt then, as God had given him a quick Apprehenſion, piercing Wit, and ſound Judgment, ſo by his great induſtry and conſtant uſe of theſe gifts he did highly improve and advance them. He was from his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood addicted to ſtudy, and ever ſince he came to the uſe of Reaſon ſo great a husband of his time, as not willingly to loſe or let ſlip unoccupied the leaſt fragment of it, deteſting no Vice more than Idleneſs, which he look'd upon as the Parent and Nurſe of almoſt all others. Nay, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive was he in the proſecution of his ſtudies and other employments without any intermiſſion or diverſion, that moſt of his Friends were of opinion he did much weaken his body and impair his health by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant labours and perpetual intention of mind upon buſineſs. However that be, hence it came to paſs that he attained very good skill in all parts of learning, and particularly got a deep inſight into thoſe Sciences which are moſt abſtruſe and impervious to Vulgar Capacities, I mean the moſt ſubtil parts of the Mathematicks. Of his skill in Natural Philoſophy, chiefly the Hiſtory of Animals, [Birds, Beaſts, Fiſhes, and Inſects,] I ſhall ſay no more at preſent, but that it hath not yet been my hap to meet with any man either in <hi>England</hi> or beyond Seas of ſo general and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive knowledge therein.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, what rendred him moſt commendable was his eminent Vertue and Goodneſs. I cannot ſay that ever I obſerved ſuch a confluence of excellent qualities in one Perſon. For 1. Notwithſtanding the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned advantages, which are wont to puff up mens minds with pride, he was ſo truly humble, that I have not known any man of the meaneſt fortune or birth exceed him in that vertue. He deſpiſed no man
<pb facs="tcp:63869:3"/>
for his Poverty or mean Parentage; honoured all men, was affable to the meaneſt, not preferring himſelf before others, but condeſcending to them of low degree. 2. He was ſo reſolutely ſober and temperate, that neither the importunity of company or pleaſure of ſenſe could ever tempt him to exceſs. 3. Of that exemplary chaſtity and purity, that his life condemns the diſſoluteneſs and corrupt practices of the preſent Age, and demonſtrates the poſſibility of reſtraining and regulating thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and deſires, which of all others are wont to be moſt violent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate. 4. So ſcrupulouſly juſt and righteous, that he had rather a great deal ſuffer wrong than do any. 5. So true to his word and promiſe, that a man might ſafely venture his Eſtate and Life too upon it: His word being, as an honeſt mans is ſaid to be, as good as his Bond. 6. So faithful and conſtant to his Friend in all conditions, as well adverſe as proſperous, that one might be ſecure of him, and confident of his help and aſſiſtance, whatever diſtreſs or calamity might befall one: He never deſerting any man only becauſe fortune frown'd upon him, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of Friends are wont to do. 7. He was of ſo diffuſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Charity, that he could heartily affect and embrace good men of all perſuaſions; Good men, I ſay, to exclude ſuch opinions as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of, or inconſiſtent with true goodneſs.</p>
            <p>To theſe I might add his Patience and Submiſſion to the Divine Will, which did eminently appear in the time of his ſickneſs, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf contented to leave the world, if it pleaſed God to have it ſo, though then in the height of his ſtrength and parts, and in the hot purſuit of uſeful ſtudies and deſigns, and in ſuch circumſtances, as to his private affairs and concerns in the world, as rendred ſome continuance of life very deſirable to him, and would have tempted a man of ordinary vertue to expreſs ſome anger and diſcontent at the ſentence and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of death. And laſtly, his due fear and reverence of the Deity, deep ſenſe of his goodneſs, and thankfulneſs for the ſame, ſincere Piety in all his carriage toward him, and great abhorrency of whatever tended to his diſhonour.</p>
            <p>Thus much, though leſs pertinent to the Argument of this preſent Work, I thought fit to premiſe concerning his Vertues, partly to do him right by procuring him the honour due to his memory: And partly to provoke young Gentlemen of this Nation, by the propoſal of ſo illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an example of their own Rank, to proſecute the ſtudy of ingenuous Literature, and aſpire to true honour by the conſtant exerciſe of Vertue.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to give an account of this Work, and acquaint the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with the occaſion of his attempting it, and what progreſs he made in it. Obſerving in this buſie and inquiſitive Age the Hiſtory of Animals alone to have been in a great meaſure neglected by <hi>Engliſh</hi> men (for that ſince <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Mouffet</hi> none that I know of hath performed any thing therein worthy of commendation) he made the ſtudy thereof his Province, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelf with all diligence to the cultivating and illuſtrating of it. Which that he might the more effectually do, he not only read what had been written by others, but did himſelf accurately deſcribe all the Animals he could find or procure either in <hi>England</hi> or beyond the Seas, making a Voyage into forein Countries chiefly for that purpoſe, to ſearch out, view and deſcribe the ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> of Nature. And though he was not
<pb facs="tcp:63869:3"/>
long abroad, yet travelled he over a great part of <hi>France, Spain, Italy, Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries.</hi> In all which places he was ſo inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſucceſsful, that not many ſorts of Animals deſcribed by others eſcaped his diligence. For my part I know no man who hath ſeen more Species, been more exact in noting their differences, and inventing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic Marks whereby they may be certainly diſtinguiſhed; or more curious in diſſecting them, and obſerving the make and conſtitution of their parts as well internal as external. Howbeit I do not deny but ſome have been more accurate in anatomizing one or two particular Animals. The reaſon of this his diligence was, becauſe he obſerved that ſome of the deſcriptions of former Writers of this kind, either by reaſon of their brevity, or becauſe they contained only general notes, were very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and gave occaſion to many errours and miſtakes, but chiefly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary multiplications of <hi>Species;</hi> the Readers often miſtaking ſeveral deſcriptions of the ſame Animal, which they meet with in divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, by reaſon of their generality and obſcurity, for ſo many deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſeveral Animals. Now that he might clear up all theſe obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and render the knowledge and diſtinction of Species facile to all that ſhould come after, he bent his endeavours mainly to find out (as I before intimated) certain Characteriſtic notes of each kind. But if in any kind no ſingular mark occurred whereby it might be certainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from all others, he did minutely and exactly deſcribe all its parts, that at leaſt a Collection of many accidents, which all together could not be found in any <hi>Species</hi> elſe of the ſame kind, might ſerve for a Characteriſtic: That the Reader ſhould not by a general and ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſcription be left in ſuſpenſe, or incur the danger of error. But becauſe a prolix and operoſe deſcription is tedious to moſt Readers, and to the unattentive ſeems rather to obſcure than illuſtrate the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, to relieve and gratifie ſuch, beſides the deſcription he often adds ſome ſhort notes, by which the Animal deſcribed may be diſtinguiſhed from others of the ſame kind like to it, and wherewith it is in danger to be confounded. Now though I cannot but commend his diligence, yet I muſt confeſs that in deſcribing the colours of each ſingle feather he ſometimes ſeems to me to be too ſcrupulous and particular, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Nature doth not in all Individuals, (perhaps not in any two) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve exactly the ſame ſpots or ſtrokes, partly becauſe it is very difficult ſo to word deſcriptions of this ſort as to render them intelligible: Yet da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I not to omit or alter any thing.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, our Author having made ſo good progreſs in this Work, that few of our <hi>Europaean</hi> Animals deſcribed by others had eſcaped his view; that he might (as far as in him lay) perfect the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> he deſigned a Voyage into the <hi>New World,</hi> but lived not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it. For about the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> in the year 1672, being ſeized with a Pleuriſie, which terminated in that kind of Fever Phyſicians call <hi>Catarrhalis</hi> within leſs than a month after he took his bed, on the third of <hi>July</hi> in the thirty ſeventh year of his Age he departed this life to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe grief of his Friends and all good men that knew him, and the great loſs of the Common-wealth in general.</p>
            <p>Viewing his Manuſcripts after his Death, I found the ſeveral Animals in every kind both Birds, Beaſts, Fiſhes, and Inſects digeſted into a
<pb facs="tcp:63869:4"/>
Method of his own contriving, but few of their Deſcriptions and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſo full and perfect as he intended them; Which he was ſo ſenſible of, that when I asked him upon his death-bed, whether it was his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they ſhould be publiſhed, he anſwered, that he did not deſire it, nor thought them ſo conſiderable as to deſerve it, or ſomewhat to that purpoſe, for the very words I do not well remember, though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt there were in them ſome new and pretty obſervations about Inſects. But, conſidering that the publication of them might conduce ſomewhat 1. To the illuſtration of Gods glory, by exciting men to take notice of, and admire his infinite power and wiſdom diſplaying themſelves in the Creation of ſo many <hi>Species</hi> of Animals; And 2. To the aſſiſtance and eaſe of thoſe who addict themſelves to this moſt pleaſant, and no leſs uſeful part of Philoſophy; And 3. Alſo to the honour of our Nation, in making it appear that no part of real knowledge is wholly balked and neglected by us, (he not contradicting) I reſolved to publiſh them, and firſt took in hand the <hi>Ornithology.</hi>

            <p>As for the ſcope and deſign of this undertaking, it was neither the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, nor is it my intention to write Pandects of Birds, which ſhould compriſe whatever had been before written of them by others, whether true, falſe or dubious, that having already been abundantly performed by <hi>Geſner</hi> and <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> nor to contract and Epitomize their large and bulky Volumes; leſt we ſhould tempt Students to gratifie their ſloth ſo far as to take up with ſuch Epitomes, and neglect the reading of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors themſelves at large, which would be much more ſatisfactory and improving: and beſides, this were but <hi>actum agere,</hi> ſuch Epitomes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already made by <hi>Johnſton:</hi> But our main deſign was to illuſtrate the Hiſtory of Birds, which is (as we ſaid before of Animals in general) in many particulars confuſed and obſcrue, by ſo accutately deſcribing each kind, and obſerving their Characteriſtic and diſtinctive notes, that the Reader might be ſure of our meaning, and upon comparing and Bird with our deſcription not fail of diſcerning whether it be the deſcribed or no. Nor will it be difficult to find out any unknown Bird that ſhall be offered: For comparing it with the Tables firſt, the Characteriſtic notes of the <hi>genus's</hi> from the higheſt or firſt downward will eaſily guide him to the loweſt <hi>genus;</hi> among the <hi>Species</hi> whereof, being not many, by comparing it alſo with the ſeveral deſcriptions the Bird may ſoon be found. This then being our deſign, that we might ſurely effect it, we did not as ſome before us have done, only tranſcribe other mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, but we our ſelves did carefully deſcribe each Bird from the view and inſpection of it lying before us. That this diligence was not ſuperfluous or without effect will appear in that we have thereby cleared many difficulties, and rectified many miſtakes in the Writings of <hi>Geſner</hi> and <hi>Aldrovandus.</hi> If it be asked, what cauſed theſe great Authors to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake? I anſwer, ſhort and general deſcriptions of Birds of the ſame Species under different Titles, either ſent them by their Correſpondents in ſeveral parts, or found in Books. Hence their miſtakes are eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the multiplying of Species, and making two or three ſorts of one. This is eaſie to obſerve in reading of their Works. For their own deſcriptions of ſuch Birds as themſelves ſaw, are for the moſt very accurate and full, but thoſe communicated by others are of a different
<pb facs="tcp:63869:4"/>
ſtamp, as being compoſed by men not well verſed in deſcribing of Animals, containing only a few general and ambiguous notes, ſo that one deſcription will fit divers Species, or two or three deſcriptions ſute one and the ſame; which muſt needs occaſion ſuch miſtakes as we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of repeating the ſame Bird two or three times for different kinds, under divers Titles. Many ſuch errors occur in <hi>Aldrovand,</hi> which the Reader ſhall find noted in this Work, and ſome alſo in <hi>Geſner,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his great skill and circumſpection. Yet do we not pretend to have diſcovered and rectified all the miſtakes and errors in theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: There remain yet ſundry deſcriptions of this nature, which we are doubtful of whether they be of Birds ſpecifically diſtinct or no: Nor do we ſee any means left to reſolve our ſelves, unleſs perchance by travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to thoſe places whence ſuch deſcriptions and titles were ſent, where we might probably learn what Birds the Inhabitants underſtand by thoſe names.</p>
            <p>Having acquainted the Reader with our principal aim in this Work, which was to give certain Characteriſtic notes of the ſeveral kinds, accurately to deſcribe each <hi>Species,</hi> and to reduce all to their proper <hi>Claſſes</hi> or <hi>Genera:</hi> We ſhall further add, that we have wholly omitted what we find in other Authors concerning <hi>Homonymous</hi> and <hi>Synonymous</hi> words, or the divers names of Birds, <hi>Hieroglyphics, Emblems, Morals, Fables, Preſages,</hi> or ought elſe appertaining to <hi>Divinity, Ethics, Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> or any ſort of Humane Learning: And preſent him only with what properly relates to their Natural Hiſtory. Neither have we ſcraped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether whatever of this nature is any where extant, but have uſed choice, and inſerted only ſuch particulars as our ſelves can warrant upon our own knowledge and experience, or whereof we have aſſurance by the teſtimony of good Authors, or ſufficient Witneſſes. And, becauſe what is ſtreight doth both manifeſt it ſelf, and alſo diſcover what is croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, we contented our ſelves to put down only what we approve, not thinking it neceſſary to ſpend time in confuting the contrary error.</p>
            <p>Concerning the names of Birds we did not much trouble our ſelves, there having been diſputing enough about them long ago; but have for the moſt part followed <hi>Geſner</hi> and <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> being unwilling to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb what is ſetled, or diſpoſſeſs Names, that may for their uſe now plead preſcription. For to what purpoſe is it eternally to wrangle about things, which certainly to determine is either abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, or next door to it? Eſpecially ſeeing if by immenſe labour it might at laſt be found out, by what Names every Species was known to the Ancients, the advantage that would thence accrue would not countervail the pains. About the Phraſe and Style we were not very ſolicitous, taking greater care to render the Senſe perſpicuous than the Language ornate.</p>
            <p>But becauſe Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> (though ſparing neither pains nor coſt) could not procure, and conſequently did not deſcribe all ſorts of Birds; to perfect the Work, I have added the Deſcriptions and Hiſtories of thoſe that were wanting, out of <hi>Geſner, Aldrovandus, Bellonius, Marggravius, Cluſius, Hernandez, Bontius, Wormius,</hi> and <hi>Piſo;</hi> diſpoſing each kind, as near as I could, in its proper place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63869:5"/>
Now becauſe elegant and accurate Figures do much illuſtrate and facilitate the underſtanding of Deſcriptions, in order to the Engraving ſuch Figures for this Work, Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> made a Collection of as many Pictures drawn in colours by the life as he could procure. Firſt, He purchaſed of one <hi>Leonard Baltner,</hi> a Fiſherman of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> a Volume containing the Pictures of all the Water-fowl frequenting the <hi>Rhene</hi> near that City, as alſo all the Fiſh and Water-Inſects found there, drawn with great curioſity and exactneſs by an excellent hand. The which Fowl, Fiſhes, and Inſects the ſaid <hi>Baltner</hi> had himſelf taken, deſcribed, and at his own proper coſts and charges cauſed to be drawn. Which curioſity is much to be admired and commended in a Perſon of his Condition and Education. For my part, I muſt needs acknowledge that I have received much light and information from the Work of this poor man, and have been thereby inabled to clear many difficulties, and rectifie ſome miſtakes in <hi>Geſner.</hi> Secondly, At <hi>Nurenberg</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> he bought a large Volume of Pictures of Birds drawn in colours. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, He cauſed divers Species, as well ſeen in <hi>England</hi> as beyond the Seas, to be drawn by good Artiſts. Beſides what he left, the deſervedly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Sir <hi>Thomas Brown,</hi> Profeſſor of Phyſick in the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> frankly communicated the Draughts of ſeveral rare Birds, with ſome brief notes and deſcriptions of them. Out of theſe, and the Printed Figures of <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> and <hi>Pet. Olina,</hi> an Italian Author, we culled out thoſe we thought moſt natural, and reſembling the life, for the Gravers to imitate, adding alſo all but one or two of <hi>Marggravius's,</hi> and ſome out of <hi>Cluſius</hi> his Exotics, <hi>Piſo</hi> his Natural Hiſtory of the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and <hi>Bontius</hi> his of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gravers we employed, though they were very good Workmen, yet in many Sculps they have not ſatisfied me. For I being at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from <hi>London,</hi> and all advices and directions neceſſarily paſſing by Letter, ſometimes through haſte miſtook in my directions, ſometimes through wearineſs and impatience of long Writing ſent not ſo clear and full inſtructions as was requiſite; and they as often neglected their inſtructions, or miſtook my meaning. Notwithſtanding the Figures, ſuch as they are, take them all together, they are the beſt and trueſt, that is, moſt like the live Birds, of any hitherto engraven in Braſs.</p>
            <p>It is requiſite now that we inform the Reader what compendious ways we ſought to avoid unneceſſary expences in graving of Figures. 1. Of the ſame Species of Bird when more Figures than one occurred either in divers Authors, or our own Papers, or both, we cauſed only one, which we judged to be the beſt to be engraven. 2. We have for the moſt part contented our ſelves with the figure of one Sex only, and that the Male. 3. We have omitted all ſuch dubious <hi>Icons</hi> as we knew not whether they were of true birds or not, or could not certainly determine of what <hi>Species</hi> they were. 4. Of ſuch as differ only in bigneſs, or if otherwiſe in ſuch accidents as cannot be expreſſed in Sculpture, we have given only the Figure of the greater. Of this kind are the greater and leſſer <hi>Curlew,</hi> the common <hi>Snipe,</hi> and <hi>Jack-Snipe,</hi> or <hi>Judcock.</hi> And yet ſome Birds we have cauſed to be graven twice when the firſt time the Gravers miſt their aim, and ſhot too wide of their mark: Such are the <hi>red-leg'd Partridge,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:63869:5"/>
The common <hi>Swallow,</hi> the <hi>Swift,</hi> the common <hi>Blackbird,</hi> the <hi>Houſe-Dove,</hi> the <hi>Royſton Crow,</hi> the <hi>Witwall,</hi> and the <hi>Dottrel.</hi> I might add hereto the <hi>Canada Gooſe</hi> in the ſeventieth Plate, for I now perſuade my ſelf that the Bird graven in Plate 71. is the ſame with it. The <hi>Sheldrake</hi> was through miſtake twice figured in Plates 70. and 71. ſo was the <hi>Auk</hi> or <hi>Rozor-bill</hi> in Plates 64. and 65. The figures of the <hi>Rock Ouzel, Bittern,</hi> and <hi>Stone-Curlew</hi> firſt graven, though they were paſſable enough, yet having afterwards gotten very exact Figures of thoſe Birds, we cauſed them alſo to be Engraven.</p>
            <p>The whole Work we have divided into three Books. In the firſt we treat of <hi>Birds</hi> in general; in the ſecond of <hi>Land-fowl;</hi> in the third of <hi>Water-Fowl.</hi> The ſecond Book we have divided into two parts: The firſt whereof contains Birds of <hi>crooked</hi> Beak and Talons; The ſecond, ſuch whoſe Bills and Claws are more <hi>ſtreight.</hi> The third Book is tripartite: The firſt part takes in all Birds that <hi>wade</hi> in the waters, or frequent watery places, but ſwim not; The ſecond, ſuch as are of a <hi>middle</hi> nature between ſwimmers and waders, or rather that partake of both kinds, ſome whereof are cloven-footed, and yet ſwim; others whole-footed, but yet very long-leg'd like the waders: The third is of whole-footed, or fin-toed Birds, that <hi>ſwim</hi> in the water.</p>
            <p>As for fabulous Birds, ſuch as are confeſſedly ſo, <hi>viz. Phenixes, Griffins, Harpyes, Ruk,</hi> and the like, I have omitted them, as being no part of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and all that can be ſaid of them having been more than once written already. I have alſo omitted ſome that I only ſuſpected for fictitious, as the <hi>Scythian Bird,</hi> the <hi>Aquila Heteropus,</hi> &amp;c. Yet becauſe I would not rely too much upon my own judgment, I have put in the <hi>Appendix</hi> the deſcriptions of ſome of that nature out of <hi>Hernandez,</hi> which I refer to the Readers cenſure.</p>
            <p>It remains that I make a grateful mention of ſuch of our learned and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friends, as have given us any conſiderable information or aſſiſtance; as well to do them right, as to acquaint the Reader whom we mean by ſome names recorded in this Work. Thoſe were Sir <hi>Thomas Brown</hi> of <hi>Norwich</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remembred: <hi>Francis Jeſſop</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Broom-hall</hi> in <hi>Sheffield</hi> Pariſh, <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> who ſent us the Deſcriptions and Caſes of many rare Birds, and diſcovered and gave us notice of many Species thereabout, which we knew not before to be native of <hi>England:</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Skippon</hi> of <hi>Wrentham</hi> near <hi>Bliborough</hi> in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> Knight, who communicated the Pictures of ſeveral Birds we wanted: And Mr. <hi>Ralph Johnſon</hi> of <hi>Brignal</hi> near <hi>Greta Bridge</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> a Perſon of ſingular skill in <hi>Zoology,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Birds,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Deſcriptions and Pictures of divers uncommon, and ſome unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed both Land and Water-fowl, communicated to us his Method of Birds, whereby we were in ſome particulars informed, in many others confirmed, his judgment concurring with ours in the diviſions and Characteriſtic notes of the <hi>Genera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much may ſuffice to have ſpoken by way of Preface of the Work in general.</p>
            <p>It may now be expected that I give ſome account of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But I have not much to ſay concerning it; I ſhall only acquaint the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what I have therein amended, and what I have thereto added.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The errors and miſtakes which ſince this Work was publiſhed I have diſcovered, and in the Tranſlation noted or corrected are theſe. The firſt miſtake is in the placing of the <hi>Toucan,</hi> falſly called the <hi>Braſilian Pie,</hi> among the Birds of the <hi>Pie-kind:</hi> It properly belonging to the <hi>Woodpecker</hi> Tribe, as
<pb facs="tcp:63869:6"/>
having a like diſpoſition of Toes, two ſtanding forward, and two backward, and in like manner hewing a hole in a Tree to build its Neſt in. This I did before ſuſpect, but am now aſſured of by an exact deſcription of this Bird I met with in <hi>Jo. Faber</hi> his Explications of ſome <hi>American</hi> Animals of <hi>Recchus.</hi> 2. In making <hi>Bellonius</hi> his greater <hi>red-leg'd Partridge</hi> or <hi>Greek Partridge</hi> to be a different kind from the common <hi>red-leg'd Partridge,</hi> which upon diligent comparing the Deſcriptions and Hiſtories, I find to be the ſame with it. 3. In putting down the <hi>Fringilla ſpuria cum calcari Alaudae,</hi> Pag. 188. for a diſtinct <hi>Species</hi> from the precedent Bird, entitled <hi>Montifringilla ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> or the great <hi>Brambling.</hi> This miſtake was committed by meer acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and forgetfulneſs. 4. In the conjecture that the <hi>Larus Maximus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed pag. 261. was the <hi>Skua</hi> of <hi>Hoierus,</hi> whereas I find that our <hi>Catarractes,</hi> deſcribed pag. 265. is his <hi>Skua,</hi> the deſcriptions exactly agreeing. 5. In put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the Bird entitled, <hi>Anas fera capite ſubruffo minor</hi> for a diſtinct <hi>Species,</hi> whereas I am now aſſured by our Fowlers, that it is the Hen <hi>Golden-eye.</hi> I do alſo ſuſpect the <hi>Anas fera capite ſubruffo major,</hi> deſcribed for a diſtinct kind in pag. 282. to have been no other than a Young Cock<hi>-Golden-eye,</hi> that had not moulted his Chicken-feathers. 6. In placing the <hi>Anas fera fuſca</hi> or <hi>Pochard.</hi> And 7. the <hi>Havelda</hi> of <hi>Wormius</hi> among the <hi>River</hi> or <hi>Plaſh-</hi>Ducks, whereas they belong to the <hi>Sea-</hi>kind. 8. In making the Bird deſcribed, pag. 289. under the title of <hi>Phaſcas fortaſſe Geſnero,</hi> to be a diſtinct <hi>Species,</hi> which I find by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Birds themſelves to be a <hi>Hen-Wigeon.</hi> Beſides theſe, I find remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill to be corrected, 1. A miſtake about the ſituation of the <hi>blind-guts</hi> in Birds: For they do not deſcend from the ſtomach downwards, but aſcend from the <hi>inteſtinum rectum</hi> upwards, being as it were two branches of the <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinum rectum,</hi> and ſo in that reſpect differ not from the Blind-guts of Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds, as is affirmed pag. 7. 2. Among the Birds that want the back-toe, enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, pag. 3. the <hi>Dottrel</hi> is omitted. 3. I am now perſuaded that the <hi>Stella Avis</hi> of <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> is a different kind from the <hi>Buſtard,</hi> and that the Bird we ſaw in the Market at <hi>Modena</hi> was this <hi>Stella,</hi> for to my beſt remembrance it was much leſs than a <hi>Buſtard,</hi> and therefore I revoke what was ſaid in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> his affirmation, that the <hi>Buſtard</hi> is a ſtranger to <hi>Italy:</hi> But it is very likely that this <hi>Stella Avis</hi> is the ſame with the <hi>Anas Campeſtris</hi> of <hi>Bellonius.</hi> Beſides theſe the Reader ſhall find corrected thoſe overſights and errors noted in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Latine, and others which I cannot now call to mind.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For additions there are ſo many throughout the whole Work that it would be too tedious to enumerate them, I ſhall only mention the three principal and moſt conſiderable, which might paſs for juſt Tractates on thoſe Subjects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An <hi>Epitome</hi> of the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Fowling,</hi> collected partly out of <hi>Olina's Uccelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> written in <hi>Italian,</hi> but chiefly out of <hi>Gervaſe Markham</hi>'s Book, entitled, <hi>Hungers prevention,</hi> or the <hi>Art of Fowling;</hi> ſomething alſo being added out of a late <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book, entituled, <hi>An Epitome of the Art of Husbandry,</hi> the Author whereof was pleaſed to conceal his name.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Falconry,</hi> being an abridgement of the Authors long ſince Engliſhed and put together by <hi>Turbervile;</hi> and of our own late and beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Writer <hi>Latham,</hi> with ſomething out of <hi>Aldrovandus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Directions for the ordering of Singing Birds contracted, out of the forementioned <hi>Epitome</hi> of the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Husbandry, Olina's Uccelleria,</hi> and <hi>Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus.</hi> In all which Diſcourſes I have corrected ſome miſtakes in my
<pb facs="tcp:63869:6"/>
Authors, illuſtrated what was obſcure, and intermingled ſome obſervations of my own. Here by the by I cannot but reflect upon the Author of a late <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book, entituled, <hi>The Gentlemans Recreation.</hi> For having had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to examine and compare Books upon theſe Subjects, I find that all that he hath conſiderable concerning <hi>Fowling</hi> is taken out of the forementioned Book of <hi>Markham,</hi> and yet hath he not to my remembrance made any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Author: What he hath of <hi>Hawking</hi> is likewiſe an Epitome of <hi>Turberviles</hi> Collections, with ſome addition out of <hi>Lathams Falconry,</hi> without acknowledgment that all was borrowed. I doubt not but I could have traced him in his other Diſcourſes of <hi>Hunting</hi> and <hi>Fiſhing,</hi> had I had leiſure or will to compare his Book with <hi>Turberviles, Waltons,</hi> and other Treatiſes of thoſe Subjects. I do not blame him for Epitomizing, but for ſuppreſſing his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors names, and publiſhing their Works as his own, inſomuch that not only the Vulgar, but even Learned men have been deceived by him, ſo that they have looked upon him as a conſiderable Writer, of extraordinary skill in ſuch Arts and Exerciſes, and one that had advanced and improved them. By the way therefore it may not be amiſs to caution Learned men that they be not too haſty nor laviſh in their public commendations of new Books before they have taken the pains to compare them with former Treatiſes on thoſe Subjects, leſt they render themſelves ridiculous by publiſhing thoſe for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancers of knowledge, who are indeed meer Plagiaries and Compilers of other mens Works.</p>
            <p>I might have added a cenſure of the fleſh of Birds in reference to wholſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Diet, but that is done in the particular Species, and by many Authors in the Dietical part of their Inſtitutions of Phyſic; only in general we have taken notice, 1. In Land-fowl, that the fleſh of no Carnivorous Bird is good meat, neither of the <hi>Rapacious</hi> kind that touch no Vegetables; nor yet of the <hi>Crow-kind,</hi> which feed promiſcuouſly upon Fleſh, and Fruits, or Seeds. 2. That the fleſh of ſuch birds as feed only upon Inſects is not approved good meat, for example, <hi>Woodpeckers</hi> and <hi>Swallows.</hi> As for ſmall Birds of ſlender Bills that are reputed good, they feed as well upon Fruits and Berries as upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, though it may be chiefly upon Inſects; but they are beſt when they feed upon Fruits, as the <hi>Beccafigo</hi> in Fig-time, 3. The Birds that feed upon Gram and Seeds only, (if any ſuch) or upon Fruits, or Seeds, and Inſects, as the <hi>Poultry-kind,</hi> are the beſt of all. 4. Of Water-fowl, ſuch as feed only or chiefly upon Fiſh are not good meat; Yet the Young of ſome of theſe are approved as a delicacy, though I ſcarce think very wholſom: Such are young <hi>Soland-Geeſe, Puffins, Pewets,</hi> and <hi>Herons.</hi> Beſides theſe, all Water-fowl, though feeding only upon Inſects, are eſteemed good to eat, and admitted to our Tables: The moſt delicate of theſe are thoſe we have termed <hi>Mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckers,</hi> that with their long Nebs thruſt into the Earth ſuck out of the Mud or Ouze a fatty juyce, by which they are nouriſhed.</p>
            <p>Two or three Obſervations communicated by Mr. <hi>Martin Liſter</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> my honoured Friend, being through forgetfulneſs omitted in their proper places in the Book, I ſhall thruſt into this Preface. 1. The <hi>Curruca</hi> or <hi>Hedg-Sparrow</hi> lays Sea-green or pale-blue Eggs, which neatly emptied and wired I have ſeen fair Ladies wear at their Ears for Pendants. 2. One and the ſame <hi>Swallow</hi> I have known by the ſubtracting daily of her Eggs to have laid nineteen ſucceſſively, and then to have given over. 3. The <hi>Bunting</hi> breaks not Oats, but hulls them moſt dexterouſly, as I obſerve, having of them by
<pb facs="tcp:63869:7"/>
me at this preſent in Cages. 4. The <hi>Robin-red-breaſt</hi> will not touch a hairy Caterpillar, but will gladly eat any ſmooth one that I have given him; and there is no better way ſpeedily to tame and make wild Birds ſing than to give them a pleaſing Inſect or two daily. 5. Neither ſlender nor thick-bill'd Birds but will gladly eat Spiders, as I have experienced in ſome.</p>
            <p>I have no more to add, but only to advertiſe the Reader, that by the breadth of a Bird we underſtand the diſtance between the tips of the Wings extended; by the <hi>flag-feathers,</hi> or <hi>beam-feathers,</hi> or <hi>quil-feathers,</hi> or <hi>prime</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or <hi>ſails</hi> of the Wing, we mean thoſe of the firſt row. That when we ſay from Bill to Tail, we mean from Bill-point to Tail-end: That for brevities ſake, and want of Engliſh words, I was in this Tranſlation often forced to uſe Latine, as for the circle about the Pupil of the Eye, <hi>Iris,</hi> and in the Plural, <hi>Irides;</hi> for the liminary ſtomach deſcribed page 8. <hi>Echinus,</hi> and ſome others: And ſo I bid him</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E do not intend to treat of all the parts of Birds, but of thoſe only which are either proper to this kind, or if common to other Animals, have in Birds ſomething peculiar in their ſhape, ſize, temper, uſe, or ſome other remarkable accident.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All Birds in general, without exception of any, want Teeth, in ſtead whereof they are furniſhed with a Bill of a <note place="margin">The Bill and its uſes.</note> horny ſubſtance. By Teeth we underſtand Teeth properly ſo called, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are diſtinct and ſeparable from the Mandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. For in ſome Birds, as for example <hi>Divers,</hi> the Bills them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are toothed or indented after the manner of a Saw. The Bill in Birds hath two principal uſes; the one as an inſtrument to gather and receive their food; the other as a weapon to fight with, either by aſſaulting others, or defending and revenging themſelves. Theſe, I ſay, are the principal uſes, beſides which it ſerves them alſo for other purpoſes, to wit, building their Neſts, feeding their Young, preening their Feathers, and ſome for climbing, as the <hi>Parrot</hi> and <hi>Shell-apple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In all Birds, except Nocturnal ones, the head is ſmaller and bears leſs proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">The Head.</note> to the body than in Quadrupeds, that it may more readily divide the Air in flying, and making way for the body render its paſſage more eaſie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In Birds and Fiſhes the eyes are more flat and depreſſed than in Quadrupeds. <note place="margin">The Eyes.</note> A circle of ſmall plates of bone placed ſcalewiſe under the outward coat <hi>[tunica ſclerodes]</hi> where the <hi>proceſſus ciliares</hi> are, encompaſſes the pupil of each eye in Birds, to ſtrengthen the eyes, and defend them from injuries. Moreover moſt, if not all Birds, have a Membrane for Nictation, called in Latine <hi>Periophthalmium,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal <note place="margin">Membrane for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nictation.</note> they can at their pleaſure cover their Eyes, though their eye-lids be open. This hath its riſe from the greater or more obtuſe corner of the Eye, and ſerves to wipe, cleanſe, and perchance moiſten the <hi>Superſicies</hi> of it. This Membrane is not proper to Birds only, but common with them to many Quadrupeds. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals Exer.</hi> 18.</note> Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> treating of the Eyes of Birds hath this obſervation: <hi>The Eyes of Birds</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contract themſelves to that proportion which is between the eye and head of a viviparous Animal. For if in Hens or other Birds you take off the skin covering the eyes, you ſhall find that either of them will at leaſt equal the whole bulk of the brain: But in a Woodcock, and the like, either eye is greater than all the reſt of the head, ſetting aſide the Bill. In general the orbit or cavity containing the eye in all Birds exceeds the brain it ſelf, as may be ſeen in their skull. Their eyes indeed outwardly appear but ſmall, becauſe excepting the pupils they are wholly covered with skin and feathers.</hi> In our obſervation the cavity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the brain is greater than the orbit of either eye in many, not to ſay all, Birds.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:63869:8"/>
4. All Birds want the external ear, ſtanding out from the head. For though there <note place="margin">The Ear.</note> is a ſort of Owl called in Latine <hi>Noctua aurita,</hi> or the eared Owl, yet hath it not ears properly ſo called, but only feathers ſticking out on each ſide the head, ſomewhat reſembling Ears or Horns, and is therefore called alſo the <hi>Horn-Owl.</hi> I ſuppoſe the feathers encompaſſing the Ear-holes in Birds ſupply the defect of the exterior Ear. In moſt ſorts the Ear-holes are open and uncovered; but in all nocturnal, and ſome diurnal rapacious Birds provided with covers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Bridle of the mouth, or the Membrane connecting the Mandibles at each <note place="margin">The Bridle of the mouth.</note> corner, either falls inward when the mouth is ſhut, as in moſt Birds, or outward, as in <hi>Larks.</hi> By the ſoftneſs, colour, and thickneſs of this part young birds may be diſtinguiſhed from old ones.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All Birds want the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>i. e:</hi> The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Windpipe.</note> 
                  <hi>Epiglottis;</hi> whence it is manifeſt, that part is not at all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <note place="margin">The Epiglot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> to the modulation or articulation of the voice; ſeeing many Birds can tune and modulate their voice moſt melodiouſly, and ſome alſo ſpeak articulately, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they want it.

                  <hi>Larynx,</hi> through which the Air paſſes to and fro in reſpiration, lies directly under the fiſſure or cleft of the Palate, or the hole which leads to the Noſthrils.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Such Birds as have long Legs, have alſo a long Neck; for that otherwiſe they <note place="margin">The Neck.</note> could not commodiouſly gather up their food, either on Land, or in the water. But on the other ſide, thoſe which have long Necks have not always long Legs, as appears in <hi>Swans, Geeſe,</hi> and other Water-fowl; whoſe Necks ſerve them to reach to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of Rivers, Lakes, and Pools of water, to fetch up thence, Snails, Whilks, Inſects, Seeds, and Herbs, while their bodies ſwim on the Surface of the water.</p>
               <p n="8">8. All Birds, inſtead of Channel-bones <hi>[Claviculae]</hi> wherewith many Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds are furniſhed, have a bone which we in Engliſh commonly call the <hi>Merry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought</hi>

                  <hi>[furcula.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. All Birds whatſoever have Wings, or rudiments of Wings; which anſwer to the fore-legs in Quadrupeds. Among Land-fowl the <hi>Oſtrich, Caſſowary,</hi> and <hi>Dodo;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Wings.</note> among Water-fowl the <hi>Penguin</hi> have wings altogether uſeleſs and unfit for flight. Thoſe eſpecially of the <hi>Caſſowary</hi> are ſo very little and next to none, that I cannot imagine what uſe they ſhould be of to her. As for the <hi>Oſtrich,</hi> her Wings extended and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated aſſiſt her in running, being like Sails to a Ship. Inſects indeed have Wings, and ſo have Bats, but of a different kind from thoſe of Birds; the former Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naceous, the latter Cutaneous: Only Birds have Wings made up of Feathers. All Birds toward the extremity of their Wings have a certain finger-like <hi>Appendix,</hi> which weare wont to call the <hi>Secundary</hi> or <hi>Baſtard Wing:</hi> It is made up of four or five ſmall feathers. Beſides this under the wing, or on the inſide of the Wing, ſome Birds, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <note place="margin">The exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Baſtard Wing.</note> Water-fowl, have a row of feathers growing, which we call the <hi>Interiour ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard wing;</hi> which in moſt Birds is white of colour. <note place="margin">The interiour Baſtard wing.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. All Birds are two-leg'd, which is common to them with man; who is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore defined by <hi>Plato, Animal implume bipes, a two-legg'd Animal without feathers,</hi> to <note place="margin">The Legs and Feet.</note> diſtinguiſh him from Birds. But this definition being rendred ridiculous by <hi>Diogenes,</hi> turning looſe a Cock with his feathers plucked off, and crying <hi>Ecce hominem Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum,</hi> See <hi>Plato's</hi> man: To mend the matter and ſecure the definition from cavil and deriſion, they added to it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>with broad nails,</hi> thinking that thereby they had perfectly excluded all Birds; whereas had <hi>Diogenes</hi> been well skilled in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Birds, he might have ſoon fitted himſelf with a Bird to pluck, that ſhould have anſwered their reformed definition, as well as a Cock did their original, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Didap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> or <hi>Loon,</hi> and alſo a <hi>Stork,</hi> that having broad nails as well as man. But to leave that, and return to the matter in hand; ſome <hi>Swallows</hi> indeed are called <note n="*" place="margin">Footleſs.</note> 
                  <hi>Apodes,</hi> not becauſe they do altogether want feet and legs, but becauſe they have very ſhort, little, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm ones. Theſe by reaſon of the length of their wings and ſhortneſs of their legs, if they happen to fall on the ground, can hardly raiſe themſelves again. But that the <hi>Birds</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> ſo called, ſhould want feet, as was not long ſince generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, <note place="margin">Birds of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</note> not only by the Vulgar, but alſo by the greateſt Naturaliſts themſelves, even ſuch as were moſt converſant in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> becauſe thoſe brought out of the <hi>Indies</hi> were wont to be mutilated and bereaved of their feet, is now ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently convinced to be falſe by the teſtimony of eye-witneſſes, and by the Birds themſelves brought overintire, ſo that no man in his right wits can any longer doubt of that matter.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Moſt Birds have four Toes in each foot, three ſtanding forwards, and one <note place="margin">The Toes.</note> backwards. Some few have only three, all ſtanding forwards, for theſe want the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63869:8"/>
back-toe. Such are among the Birds hitherto known, 1. The <hi>Caſſowary</hi> or <hi>Emeu;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What Birds want the back-toe.</note> 2. The <hi>Buſtard;</hi> 3. The <hi>Stone Curlew</hi> or <hi>Oedicnemus</hi> of <hi>Bellonius;</hi> 4. If it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the precedent, the Bird called <hi>Stella</hi> by <hi>Aldrovandus;</hi> 5. The <hi>Anas Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtris</hi> of <hi>Bellonius;</hi> 6. The <hi>Sea-Pie</hi> or <hi>Haematopus</hi> of <hi>Bellonius;</hi> 7. The <hi>Himanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> of <hi>Pliny;</hi> 8. The <hi>Green Plover;</hi> 9. The <hi>Sea-Lark,</hi> called <hi>Charadrius</hi> by <hi>Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus;</hi> 10. The <hi>Sanderling.</hi> And of whole-footed Fowl, 11. The <hi>Penguin;</hi> 12. The <hi>Coulterneb, Pope</hi> or <hi>Mullet,</hi> i. e. <hi>Anas Arctica Cluſ.</hi> 13. The <hi>Auk,</hi> or <hi>Razor-bill;</hi> 14. The <hi>Guillemot</hi> or <hi>Sea-hen;</hi> 15. The <hi>Mergus</hi> of <hi>Bellonius,</hi> if it be a different Bird from the <hi>Auk,</hi> which we doubt of; And laſtly, The <hi>Greenland Dove.</hi> The <hi>Oſtrich</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath but two Toes: Yet <hi>Marggravius</hi> gives three to the <hi>Braſilian Oſtrich.</hi> More than four toes in each foot (whatever the Ancients report of the <hi>Porphyrio)</hi> Nature hath beſtowed on no ſort of Bird, unleſs you take the Spur in the <hi>Poultry kind</hi> for a Toe. Of thoſe which have four Toes, the moſt have them ſtanding three forward, <note place="margin">The ſituation of the Toes.</note> and one backward; ſome have two forward, and two backward, as the <hi>Cuckow,</hi> all ſorts of <note n="*" place="margin">Parrots are rather of the third ſort, that can move one Toe either way.</note> 
                  <hi>Parrots</hi> and <hi>Wood-peckers,</hi> &amp;c. Some have two forward, one backward, and a fourth movable outward, ſo far as to make a right Angle with the middle Toe, as the <hi>bald Buzzard,</hi> and perchance ſome other Birds of prey, and all <hi>Owls.</hi> And laſtly, ſome have all four ſtanding forward, as the <hi>Swift.</hi> Thoſe which want the back-toe never ſit upon Trees. The middle-toe and Leg-bone in moſt Birds are of equal length. In ſome whole-footed Birds the inmoſt Toe hath an external welt or bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of skin all along the length of it, of a good breadth; but never the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
               <p n="12">12. In all Birds that have four Toes, excepting only the <hi>black Martin</hi> or <hi>Swift;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The bones of the Toes.</note> the back-toe hath but one bone, the outmoſt of the fore-toes two, the middlemoſt three, and the inmoſt four. Which order, ſo conſtantly obſerved by Nature, hath not as yet been taken notice of by any Naturaliſt, that I know. Of all the Birds (as I ſaid) that we have as yet taken notice of, the <hi>Black Martin</hi> is only to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, whoſe feet are of a ſingular make, and different from thoſe of other Birds as ſhall be ſhewn in its Hiſtory. The hinder-toe, in thoſe Birds which have it, is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate on the inner ſide of the foot, ſupplying the place and uſe of a Thumb. The Claw or Talon of the hind-toe, at leaſt in Land-fowl, is the greateſt and ſtrongeſt of all. In thoſe Birds that have but one back-toe, the outmoſt of the fore-toes for ſome ſpace from the bottom is joyned to the middle toe, that it may not fall backward, nor ſo much as run outward, [in moſt Birds, not in all.] This conjunction is either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate by cohaeſion, or mediate by an intervening Membrane.</p>
               <p n="13">13. All Birds that we have yet ſeen and examined, even ſuch as want a Tail, have <note place="margin">The Rump and its Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules.</note> a Rump. Upon the Rump grow two Glandules, deſigned for the preparation and ſecretion of a certain unctuous humour, and furniſhed with a hole or excretory Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. About this hole grows a tuft of ſmall feathers or hairs, ſomewhat like to a Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Pencil. When therefore the parts of the feathers are ſhattered, ruffled, or any way diſcompoſed, the Bird, turning her head backward to her rump, with her Bill catches hold of the forenamed tuft, and preſſing the Glandules, forces out the oyly pap, and therewithall anointing the disjoyned parts of the feathers, and drawing them out with her bill, recompoſes and places them in due order, and cauſes them to ſtick faſter together. But here we are to take notice, that the Glandules of the Rump are leſſer in thoſe Birds that want Tails, as <hi>Colymbi,</hi> and the like, than in thoſe that have them.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>The Orifices of Excrements and that of the Womb have a contrary ſite in all fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Harvy</hi> of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat. Exer. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Fowl to what they have in other Animals: For in theſe, that of the Excrements is placed immediately under the Tail, and beneath it that of the Womb: In thoſe, the vent or Orifice of Excrements is ſituate lowermoſt, the aperture of the Womb between that and the Rump.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ornithol.</hi> lib. 14. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> thinks the convenience of coition is the cauſe of this poſition of parts: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in theſe Animals engendring, the Male getting upon or treading the Female, the Inſtruments of generation ought to be near one another, that they may more eaſily and readily couple together.</hi> Which reaſon is not to us ſatisfactory, for that Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds which mingle alſo by ſupergreſſion or leaping, though they have not their Genitals ſo ſituate, experience from thence no difficulty or inconvenience in their Coition.</p>
               <p n="15">15. It is common to all Birds to have their whole body, or at leaſt the greateſt part <note place="margin">All Birds fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</note> of it, covered with feathers growing thereon. By the word body in this place I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand only the Trunk of the body: For in moſt Birds the legs and feet, and in ſome alſo the head is uncovered. I add [the greateſt part] for the <hi>Oſtrich</hi> ſake. For
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63869:9"/>
though the legs and feet (as I ſaid) in moſt Birds, and in ſome alſo the heads are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as for example in the <hi>Turkey,</hi> the <hi>Crane,</hi> the <hi>Emen,</hi> &amp;c. yet beſides the <hi>Oſtrich</hi> we know no Bird that hath any other part of its body bare of feathers. What is reported of a kind of Hens, that bear wool inſtead of feathers we take to be falſe and fabulous. Now though the words <hi>Penna</hi> and <hi>Pluma,</hi> which we may Engliſh <hi>Quill</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How <hi>Penna</hi> and <hi>Pluma</hi> differ.</note> and <hi>Feather,</hi> or hard and ſoft feather, be ſometimes promiſcuouſly uſed, at leaſt <hi>Penna</hi> in good Authors contains under it <hi>Pluma,</hi> yet we in this work for greater perſpicuity diſtinguiſh theſe names, with our excellent <hi>Harvey,</hi> in this manner: Pennae <hi>differ from</hi> Plumae <hi>in their ſhape, uſe, place, and order of growth. Chickens are firſt plumigerous before pennigerous.</hi> [Herein I muſt crave leave to diſſent from him, unleſs he comprehends the firſt <hi>Lanugo</hi> or Down upon Chickens under the name of <hi>Pluma,</hi> for I think the Quils begin to ſpring as ſoon as the reſt of the Feathers.] <hi>For the</hi> Pennae <hi>or Quils are found only in the Wings and Rump, and ſpring deeper from the lower part of the skin, or the very</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The skin inveſting the bone.</note> Perioſteum, <hi>and ſerve for motion and ſlight; the</hi> Plumae <hi>or feathers ſpring from the upper part of the skin, and are found every where in the body for defence and ornament.</hi> The Down, wherewith Birds newly hatch'd are covered, ſticks, for the moſt part, to the tips of the primigenial feathers. In very many Birds the middle parts of the feathers are black.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The Tails of Birds are made up of feathers. Moſt Birds have this part, ſome <note place="margin">The Tail and its uſes.</note> few want it, as the <hi>Doucker</hi> or <hi>Loon,</hi> and a ſort of <hi>Hen.</hi> The Tail ſerves them for ſteering their courſe, and turning in the Air, as it were a Rudder. This is chiefly ſeen in <hi>Kites,</hi> of which <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>This kind ſeems to have taught men the Art of governing a Ship by the flexures of their Tails, Nature ſhewing in the Air what was needful to be done in the deep.</hi> Hence thoſe Birds that have but a ſhort Tail and long legs, ſtretch out their Legs backward in flying, to ſupply the defect of the Tail; whereas other Birds, which have long or indifferent Tailsfly moſt with their Legs drawn up to their body, ſome few with them hanging down, as <hi>Water-Hens.</hi> Beſides, the Tail doth not only ſerve for directing and governing the flight, but likewiſe for ſupporting and keeping even the body. Hence the <note n="†" place="margin">Douckers or Loons.</note> 
                  <hi>Colymbi,</hi> which have no Tails, fly very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently, as it were erect in the Air, with their heads ſtraight upward, and their Tail almoſt perpendicularly downward. In many Birds the outmoſt feathers of the Tail are whiter than the middle ones. The two middle feathers are not ſituate in the ſame right lines with the reſt on each ſide, but a little higher or more forward. The number of Tail-feathers in no ſort of Bird is odd. We have not as yet obſerved in the Tail of any Bird fewer than ten feathers; though <hi>Marggravius</hi> mentions ſome <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilian</hi> Birds that have but eight feathers in their Tails: And it hath been told us, that the <hi>Tropic-bird</hi> hath only two, but thoſe very long ones.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the inward parts of Birds.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe learned Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of the <hi>Brain,</hi> Chap. 5. doth largely treat of the Brains of Birds, where he accurately deſcribes their Teguments, Parts, and Ventricles, in theſe words: </p>
               <q>
                  <p>The upper part of the <note place="margin">Dura mater.</note> Skull covering the Brain being taken up, the thicker Membrane or Tegument, called, <hi>Dura Menynx,</hi> ſtraitly embraces the whole bulk within contained. In the middle of this Membrane, where the Brain is divided into two Hemiſpheres, there is a <hi>Sinus</hi> [a hollow Cavity or Veſſel] extended long-ways; which (no Sithe-like proceſs being there let down between the Hemiſpheres, as in Men and Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds) is not very deeply inſerted into the Brain: In that part of this Membrane which interpoſing it ſelf divides between the Brain and the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> there are formed two lateral <hi>Sinuſes.</hi> There is moreover in Birds the fourth <hi>Sinus,</hi> but ſituate ſomething more backward than in Man or Quadrupeds. For a little below the <hi>Conarion</hi> or Pine-like Glandule a round hollow proceſs is let down from the <note n="*" place="margin">The exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and thicker Coat or Tegument of the Brain.</note> 
                     <hi>Dura Mater</hi> upon the legs of the ſpinal marrow [pith of the back-bone] produced, where it is ſtraightway divided into two branches, of which it ſendeth on each ſide one upwards into the Cavity ſituate in the hinder part of the Brain between the ſtriate Membrane and the Hemiſphere of the Brain.</p>
                  <p>This uppermoſt Membrane, called <hi>Dura Menynx,</hi> being cut off round about, and laid aſide, the very thin Membrane immediately inveſting the Brain, called <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> comes in view: Which is not adorned with ſuch a thick contexture of Veſſels as in Man and other perfect Animals; but conſiſting of a very ſubtil web of Fibres, doth only wholly inveſt and cloſely embrace the plain and even Surface of the Brain, devoid of all windings or plaits <hi>[Gyris &amp; anſractibus.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fabric of the brain in Birds, is unlike to that of Men and Quadrupeds: For beſides that it hath no windings <hi>[anfract us]</hi> or inequalities in its exterior part, inwardly alſo the callous body, the <hi>Fornix</hi> or arched Roof, and alſo the ſtriate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſuch as we have before deſcribed; moreover, the whole frame of the Brain is otherwiſe contrived and figured. That theſe things may be the more clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, take for diſſection the Brain of a <hi>Gooſe</hi> or <hi>Turkey,</hi> and having cut open the Teguments, preſſing gently where the ſiſſure of the Brain is, ſeparate by degrees the one half from the other, till you come to the very bottom, in which are two pithy bodies, which being ſtretched out tranſverſly like Nerves, connect the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſpheres of the Brain together. Both ſides of the Interſtice are inveſted with a whitiſh Membrane, marked with ſtrakes as it were rays, drawn from the whole compaſs or Circumference thereof toward the inferior Angle: Which ſtrakes are concentred about the inſertions of the medullary bodies. This Membrane being cut there will appear underneath it in each Hemiſphere of the Brain a Cavity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it ſelf over the whole ſpace on that ſide the Interſtice, and alſo covering the hinder Region of the Brain, the Roof whereof is the ſaid Membrane. Both Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about the bottom open into an intermediate common paſſage or channel going out into the <note n="*" place="margin">The funnel or hole lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitaria Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>infundibulum,</hi> and from both ſides of that paſſage are ſtretched forth the legs of the produced ſpinal marrow <hi>[Medulla oblongata]</hi> on which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſpheres of the Brain on each ſide are hung by the two medullary bodies; to wit, from the main bulk of the Brain lying under the Ventricle the one half of the ſpinal marrow proceeds, and from the ſtriate Membrane covering the Ventricle the other half. From both theſe placed in both ſides certain medullary bodies, already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſhooting forth tranſverſly like Nerves do connect the two Hemiſpheres of the Brain. Moreover, theſe two uniting and growing together on both ſides, do faſten both Hemiſpheres of the Brain to the legs of the ſpinal pith produced, <hi>[Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dullae oblongatae.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the figure of the Brain in Birds, compared with the Brains of Men and the more perfect Quadrupeds, ſeems to be as it were inverted. For as in theſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63869:10"/>
the cortical part is exteriour and uppermoſt, and the medullary ſpread under it; ſo in Birds the lower part, conſiſting of a thicker and more bulky body, anſwers to, or is in ſtead of the bark; the external and ſuperiour Membrane covering the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle being above any part the moſt pith-like. Furthermore, the Ventricles in the Brains of Men and Quadrupeds are ſituate beneath, near the baſe or bottom of the Brain; in Birds uppermoſt, and near the outſide. The reaſon of this difference ſeems to be, becauſe in a more perfect Brain, ſuch as are thoſe of Men and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds, the Animal Spirits have both their original and exerciſe therein; <hi>viz.</hi> they are generated in the cortical part, and in the Medullary (ſpread copiouſly under the cortical) circulated and variouſly expanded for the actions of the ſeveral faculties. But in the Brain of Birds there is indeed ſpace ſufficient for the generation of Spirits, but ſcarce any room aflorded for their circulation. For the Brains of Birds ſeem not to be much employed in the functions of Fancy or Memory. Yea, moreover it is to be thought, that the Spirits produced in the Brain are exerciſed for performing the animal function chiefly in the <hi>ſpinal pith produced, [medullâ oblongatâ]</hi> for there (as we ſhall ſhew anon) the Medullary ſubſtance, which is in ſtead of the <note n="*" place="margin">Corpus callo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum.</note> 
                     <hi>Callous body,</hi> is placed: And to the <note n="†" place="margin">Corpora ſtriata.</note> 
                     <hi>ſtriate bodies</hi> in others, anſwer the <hi>ſtriate Membranes</hi> in theſe; by which the Spirits procreated in the Brain, without any marſhalling or ordering there, are forthwith carried into the <hi>prolonged pith.</hi> But becauſe the Spirits genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Brain muſt ſomewhere depoſe their ſerous Excrements, therefore from the complicature of the <hi>ſtriate Membranes</hi> over the hind-part of the Brain and the legs of the prolonged pith, do reſult Ventricles fit enough for that purpoſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in the brains of Birds, the <note n="*" place="margin">The vaulted roof.</note> 
                     <hi>Fornix</hi> being wholly wanting, there are only the two anteriour Ventricles; within which the <hi>Plexus Choroides</hi> is ſpread out; the Venoſe portion whereof (as was juſt now ſaid) hath its riſe a little lower from the fourth <hi>Sinus,</hi> but the Arteries come from both ſides the prolonged pith.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth the Heterogeneity, or conformation different from that in Men and Quadrupeds, appear more in the Brain of Birds than in the <hi>Spinal pith produced:</hi> for in the firſt <note n="*" place="margin">Branching or diviſion.</note> Section thereof, whence the Optic Nerves ariſe, two eminent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberances or bunches grow to each ſide. Theſe are in proportion much greater than the Orbicular Prominencies in more perfect Brains, ſo that they ſeem to be a ſecundary or ſubordinate Brain: Both are of a whitiſh colour, and purely Medulla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with an internal Cavity: So that in this ſort of Animals are found two Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles in the Brain, and as many in the <hi>prolonged pith.</hi> And whereas in theſe, as in all other Animals, there is alſo a Cavity under the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> the Ventricles in the whole Brain differ as well in Number as in Figure and Poſition.</p>
                  <p>In the middle of the <note n="*" place="margin">The body of the pith of the pith of the back-bone.</note> Medullary Trunk, to wit, where thoſe prominencies grow to its ſides, is a cranny or inciſure leading to the funnel <hi>[infundibulum]</hi> into which both Ventricles have their outlets or apertures; ſo that there is no doubt, but the <note n="†" place="margin">Watry Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</note> Seroſities there collected are that way avoided. Moreover, it is very likely, that theſe hollowed and medullary prominencies in Birds do ſupply the place and uſe of the <hi>Callous body;</hi> the Animal Spirits being in them circulated for the exerciſe of their Faculties. For the room in the Brain is but ſtrait, ſo that within its limits the Spirits cannot be both produced and circulated. Furthermore, whereas in Birds there is more uſe of Animal Spirits for the actions of the loco-motive faculty, than thoſe of the Fancy or Memory, conſequently their chief place or rendezvouz, where they both convene and are exerciſed, ought to be ſituate in the prolonged pith, rather than in the Brain.</p>
                  <p>The <note n="*" place="margin">Arteriae Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotides.</note> 
                     <hi>Carotide Arteries,</hi> which bring bloud to the Brains of greater Birds, are ſo ſmall that they bear no proportion to the ſame in Man and Quadrupeds. Their trunks being entred, the Skull without any divarication into the <hi>Net-like</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Textures or complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of veſſels</note> 
                     <hi>plexus,</hi> after the ſame manner as in other Animals, aſcend by the <hi>Pituitary Glandule,</hi> and proceed ſtrait to the Brain, and ſo diſtribute certain ſlender twigs both to its exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our circuit, and through its interiour receſſes. For indeed the Brains of Birds are irrigated with a very ſmall portion of bloud in reſpect of other Animals; becauſe not much bloud is required to the refection of the Animal Spirits, where the fancy and imagination are not much exerciſed.</p>
                  <p>Birds (contrary to what ſome aſſert) have both the <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Sieve-like bone:</hi> for the anteriour productions of the Brain very much extenuated and involved in the harder Tegument or Membrane, <hi>[Dura Menynx]</hi> running for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward almoſt to the middle part of the Bill, are inſerted into a Triangular bone, wherein is a double <hi>Sinus</hi> or Cavity, divided by a thin partition <hi>[Septo.]</hi> Theſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63869:10"/>
proceſſes of the brain being brought into the <hi>Sinus</hi> or Cavities of the foreſaid bone, end in bladders full of a limpid water, which do plainly reſemble the <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millary proceſſes</hi> in a Calf, replete with the like fair water. Moreover, ſeeing that from the fifth pair of Nerves a remarkable branch in each ſide paſſing through the orbit of the eye, enters the Cavern of the Noſthril, a branch ſent forth from its trunk is beſtowed upon the very Orifice of the Noſthril; in the mean time both the greater trunks being compaſſed about by the Cribroſe bone, meet together, and by and by again ſeparating or receding from each other, and being brought to the end of the Bill are diſtributed through the palate. After this manner Birds as well as men and Quadrupeds are furniſhed with a peculiar Organ of ſmelling, <hi>viz.</hi> a double mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millary proceſs, and have moreover within their Noſthrils acceſſary Nerves from the fifth pair; by whoſe action, and the communication of their branches to other parts, there is even in them contracted ſo near an affinity between the ſenſes of ſmelling and taſting. The other pairs of Nerves agree moſt-what with thoſe of man and Quadrupeds. We have likewiſe obſerved, that as to the little Brain <hi>[Cerebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum]</hi> and the remaining portion of the prolonged Pith, there is no great difference between Birds and thoſe other Animals we have before conſidered: Save that the <hi>Orbicular Prominencies</hi> before the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> and thoſe other annulary ones under it, which occur in thoſe, are both wanting in Birds. Indeed, theſe latter ſeem not at all needful, and as for the former, thoſe <hi>medullary hollow prominencies,</hi> which we have ſhewn to be in Birds, ſupply their rooms, and make amends for their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Thus far D. <hi>Willis:</hi> All which things we have by experience found to be juſt ſo as he hath delivered; though perchance the Reader that is not well skilled in Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my may experience ſome difficulty in underſtanding them, eſpecially not being illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by figures, to aſſiſt his fancy.</p>
               <p>The Lungs in all birds that we have diſſected, and without doubt in all others what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <note place="margin">The Lungs.</note> ſtick ſo faſt to the ſides, ribs, and back, that they can be but very little dilated or contracted. <hi>Moreover (which yet,</hi> ſaith <note n="*" place="margin">

The perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lungs.</note> Dr. <hi>Harvey, I do not remember to have been hitherto obſerved by any man) the ends of the branches of the wind-pipe are in them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated into the cavity of the belly, and do convey the air drawn in by breathing into certain membranes ſtretched out along the length thereof. So that in Birds the Lungs ſeem rather to be a way or paſſage to reſpiration, than the adequate organ thereof. But thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes now mentioned (at leaſt with the aſſiſtance of the Muſcles of the belly) ſerve for reſpiration, and perform the office of the Midriff. This perforation of the Lungs is not obſcure or hardly diſcernable, but ſo open and conſpicuous, that in thoſe of an</hi> Oſtrich <hi>I have found many holes, that would eaſily admit the tips of my fingers. In a</hi> Turkey, <hi>and even the common</hi> Dunghil-cock, <hi>and almoſt all Birds, thruſting a Probe into the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, you may find open paſſages out of the Lungs into the hollow of the belly. Air blown into their Lungs by bellows paſſes forcibly into the lower belly.</hi> Now Birds have either no Midriff, or at leaſt not ſuch a muſculous one as men and Quadrupeds; the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned membranes, ſupplying (as we ſaid) the defect, and performing the office of a Midriff.</p>
               <p>No Birds have more ſtomachs than one, unleſs you will take the <hi>Craw</hi> for a ſtomach: <note place="margin">The Craw, and its uſe.</note> 
                  <hi>which for the moſt part hangs without the trunk of the body, at the lower part of the neck before the breaſt, by the bone called the</hi> Merry-thought. The uſe thereof ſeems to be to moiſten and ſo to mollifie, macerate, and prepare the meat for the ſtomach. <hi>Hence ſome Birds</hi> (ſaith <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Generat. Animal. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit.</hi> 7.</note> D. <hi>Harvey) do caſt up the meat ſo macerated into the mouths of their young, and feed them therewith, (after the ſame manner as Quadrupeds nouriſh theirs with milk) as may be ſeen in the</hi> Pigeon-kind, <hi>and in Rooks.</hi> Perchance alſo becauſe the ſtomach, in ſuch birds as have a muſculous one, is not of capacity enough to receive and contain ſo much food as may ſuffice for the uſes of the body; either in Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights or long faſting, which for want of food by various accidents Birds are not rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſitated to undergo, the <hi>Craw</hi> is given them by nature for a Satchel wherein to ſtore up plenty of food, when it is afforded, which afterwards it may little by little deliver over to the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Gizzard</hi> or ſtomach furniſhed with thick and ſtrong muſcles is proper to Birds, <note place="margin">The Stomach or Gizzard, and its uſe.</note> but not common to all ſorts of them, for Rapacious and ſome piſcivorous Birds have a membranous one. The uſe of the <hi>Gizzard</hi> ſeems to be for the grinding of hard meat, for example, <hi>Wheat, Barley, Peaſe,</hi> and other ſorts of Corn and Pulſe, which birds ſwallow whole; and ſo in granivorous birds to ſupply the defect of teeth. Which that it may the more effectually perform, theſe birds do now and then ſwallow
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63869:11"/>
ſmall pebble ſtones and ſand or gravel, which together with their meat, they keep in <note place="margin">Why Birds ſwallow ſtones</note> their ſtomachs (no ſuch thing mean time being found in their crops) by the help whereof the foreſaid Muſcles, as it were two mill-ſtones, bound faſt together by their two hinges, do grind and levigate the groſſer and harder meat, and ſo promote the digeſtion of it. <hi>That this is ſo</hi> (ſaith <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Generat. Animal. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit.</hi> 7.</note> Dr. <hi>Harvey) appears in many ſorts of birds: in whoſe Gizzards, if the ſmall ſtones or other hard and rough things remain long, by their continual attrition they become ſo worn and ſmooth, that they are rendred unfit for the comminution of their meat, and are therefore caſt out of the ſtomach as uſeleſs. Hence birds when they chuſe out ſtones, they try them with their tongues, and if they find them not to be rough, they reject them. So have I found in the ſtomach of an</hi> Oſtrich, <hi>and alſo of a</hi> Caſſoware <hi>Iron, Silver, and ſtones much worn and almoſt conſumed. Whereupon it is commonly reported and believed, that they concoct Iron, and are nouriſhed therewith. If you lay your ear cloſe to the bodies of</hi> Falcons, Eagles, <hi>and other</hi> Birds of prey, <hi>while their ſtomachs are empty you may perceive the manifeſt noiſe of the ſtones thereinto ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtriking one againſt another. For neither do</hi> Hawks <hi>for cooling their Bodies (as is the common error of Falconers) ſwallow ſtones, but for the comminution of their meat. In like manner other Birds, (eſpecially ſuch as have a fleſhy ſtomach or gizzard for the grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their food) do for the ſame purpoſe ſwallow ſtones, gravel, or ſome ſuch like thing, as we ſaid before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In terreſtrial Birds of prey, and ſome piſcivorous fowl, becauſe they feed upon <note place="margin">Birds of prey have a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</note> fleſh, which eaſily melts and diſſolves in the ſtomach (being ſofter than grain, and needing little grinding) at leaſt is quickly macerated by its acid ferment, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is rather membranous than muſculous. For Birds of prey tear the fleſh with their beaks, which diſpoſes it to concoction. Whence alſo carnivorous Quadrupeds have ſerrate teeth, for tearing the fleſh of their prey from the bones; neither do they chew their meat much, as do tame beaſts, and other herbivorous and granivorous Animals. It ſuffices them to tear it to ſmall pieces, and by a chop or two of their teeth ſtrongly to pinch, cruſh, or bruiſe it. For this kind of contuſion diſpoſes it to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and perchance a more quick and ſpeedy one, than if it were ground ſmall by a long maſtication.</p>
               <p>In many Birds the Gullet immediately above the ſtomach is dilated into a certain <note place="margin">The <hi>Echinus</hi> or Ante-ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</note> bag, as it were a liminary Ventricle, which they call <hi>Echinus,</hi> becauſe in ſome birds it hath its inward Superficies rough with many excreſcences; in others it is only thick ſet, or as it were granulated with very many papillary glandules, out of which a muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous juice is eaſily preſſed: This juice being by theſe glandules excerned into the ſtomach, and there mingled with the meat, ſerves for a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> to macerate, diſſolve, and change it into Chyle.</p>
               <p>Moſt Birds have two blind guts or <hi>Appendices,</hi> as they call them: the <hi>Heron-kind</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Appendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> or blind guts.</note> have but one; and the <hi>Woodpecker-kind</hi> none. Among ſuch as have two, all carnivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fowl, and all that we call <hi>ſmall birds,</hi> have very ſmall and ſhort ones; cloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed Water-fowl, of a mean length; whole-footed Water-fowl, long ones; and Poultry-kind, the longeſt of all. The <hi>Appendices</hi> in Birds have a contrary ſite to the blind guts in Quadrupeds. For in Quadrupeds the blind gut ſeems to be nothing eſſe but the <note n="*" place="margin">The Colic gut.</note> 
                  <hi>Colon,</hi> continued or produced from the fundament upward, making acute Angles with the gut called <hi>Ileum;</hi> but in Birds the <hi>Appendices</hi> deſcend from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach downwards toward the Fundament, making acute Angles with the gut called <hi>Rectum.</hi> What the uſe of theſe <hi>Appendices</hi> or blind guts in Birds and beaſts may be, I confeſs my ſelf not clearly as yet to underſtand.</p>
               <p>In moſt Birds we have about the middle of the guts obſerved a certain ſmall <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The ſingle blind gut, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>ductus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinalis.</hi>
                  </note> or blind gut, like a little Worm, which is nothing elſe but the remainder of that paſſage by which the Yolk is conveyed into the guts of the young chicken. In ſome birds this is very conſpicuous, being of half an Inch, or almoſt an Inches length: In others it is much ſhorter and ſmaller, and in ſome again it is wholly obliterated and diſappears. The uſe of this paſſage Mr. <hi>Nicolas Steno</hi> did firſt find out, or at leaſt firſt publiſh to the world the invention of. It is true indeed it was known to us before we ſaw his Book, I think we had the firſt notice of it from Dr. <hi>Walter Needham.</hi> However the glory of the Invention is of right due to him, who firſt communicated it to the world. <hi>Ariſtotle, Fabricius ab Aquapendente,</hi> Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> and others, have obſerved a great part of the Yolk to remain in the Chickens belly after excluſion, yet did they <note place="margin">The Yolk how convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the guts.</note> not know that it was by this paſſage as it were by a funnel conveyed into the guts, but thought that by the mediation of capillary veins diſperſed through it, it was by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees liquefied, and received immediately into the bloud.</p>

The outlet of the channel from the Gaul to the guts in moſt Birds is a great way <note place="margin">The paſſage of the Gaul to the guts The uſe of the Gaul.</note> diſtant from the ſtomach: becauſe (ſay ſome) they do not make water, and ſo there is more fluid matter mingled with their Excrements.

But upon this account there ſhould rather be leſs need of Gaul, Birds therefore being now known to have large reins, and to avoid Urine with their harder Excrements; their Excrements alſo, excepting thoſe of the carni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorous kind, being not very fluid, conſidering the quantity of Urine mingled with them, perchance the Gaul-channel may enter the gut at ſuch diſtance from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, for no other reaſon than leſt the Gaul ſhould regurgitate into it.

This Urine of Birds differs from that of other Animals: for whereas there are in Urine two parts, one more ſerous and liquid, the other more thick and groſs, which</hi>

                  <hi>is called the ſediment</hi> [hypoſtaſis] <hi>and ſubſides or ſettles to the bottom, when the Urine is cool. Birds (contrary to viviparous Animals) have the greateſt quantity of this thick part, which is diſtinguiſhed from the other by its white or ſilver colour, and found not only in the common ſink (where it abounds) and daubs or ſinears over the exrements of the belly, but in the whole channel of the Ureters, which may be diſtinguiſhed from the coats of the Kidneys by this whiteneſs. Neither is this groſſer matter deſcending from the reins to be ſeen in Birds alone, but alſo in Serpents, and other oviparous Animals; eſpecially thoſe whoſe Egg is covered with a hard ſhell. They have alſo greater plenty of this than of the more ſerous and thin part; which is of a middle conſiſtence between thick urine and dung; ſo that paſſing through the Ureters it reſembles milk curdled or lightly condenſed; and being caſt forth eaſily congeales into a friable cruſt.</hi> See more of this matter in <hi>Harvey, De Generat.

               <p>ALL Birds are oviparous, that is bring forth Eggs, and not live Young. This <note place="margin">The Eggs of Birds.</note> though it be common to Serpents, Fiſhes, and Inſects; yet in Birds the figure of the Eggs, and the brittleneſs of the Shell, and the diſtinction of White and Yolk, and the manner of Incubation are peculiar. The Eggs of all Birds, if the exteriour bark be pilled off, are white.</p>
               <p>It is moſt probable, that Hen-birds have within them from their firſt formation all <note place="margin">Hen-birds have from the beginning all the Eggs they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards lay.</note> the Eggs, they ſhall afterward lay throughout their whole lifes time; ſo that when their cluſter of Eggs is wholly ſpent, they ceaſe breeding, and become effete: as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus Abbatius</hi> hath obſerved of Vipers. For we our ſelves have found in Birds that breed only once, or at moſt but twice in a year, a lump of ſeed-eggs (as I may call them) enough to ſerve them for many years productions. Seeing then it is certain that ſome birds do become <note n="†" place="margin">Paſt bearing</note> effete with age, and that all of them have at all times of the year a conſiderable maſs of Eggs within their bodies, I think we do not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon thence infer, that all the Eggs they ſhall ever lay are connate with them. I am not ignorant that <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Generat. Animal. Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit.</hi> 29.</note> Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> doth aſſert, that though a Hen hath no ſeed-eggs within her, yet after coition ſhe will breed new ones. But I think that Great Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt did not ſufficiently conſider or examine this matter, and therefore he doth only touch it obliquely, and by the by. For he together with <hi>Fabricius</hi> doth confeſs that there are in the <note n="†" place="margin">Egg cluſters or knots of Eggs.</note> 
                  <hi>Ovaria</hi> of Hens, and almoſt all other oviparous Animals an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable multitude of Eggs of divers growths from an almoſt inviſible quantity to the conſummate magnitude. Now why ſhould Nature prepare ſo great a ſtock of Yolks (which as we ſaid would ſuffice for many years births) if ſhe had given to females a faculty of generating new ones. Neither is it true only of Birds, but alſo of all female Quadrupeds, yea, and of women themſelves, that they have in them from the beginning the Eggs or ſeeds of all the conceptions, they ſhall afterwards bring forth through their whole lives. For thoſe two bodies in Females that are wont to be called Teſticles, are nothing elſe but two <note n="*" place="margin">Cluſters or knots of Eggs.</note> 
                  <hi>Ovaria,</hi> as will manifeſtly appear to any one that <note place="margin">Teſtes faemineos Ovaria eſſe.</note> will but take the pains to diſſect them, made up of very many Eggs of different magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, all which being either brought forth, or by any means marred and corrupted, that female ceaſes to bear, neither doth there remain to her any further hope of generation.</p>
               <p>The parts of an Egg are, 1. The <hi>Shell;</hi> which hardens in the very womb, before the Egg be laid; contrary to what <hi>Ariſtotle, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Fabricius ab Aquapendente</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The parts of an Egg.</note> following them, have delivered. And this any one may with his fingers eaſily try in <note place="margin">1. The Shell.</note> a Hen with egg ready to lay; or if he dare not truſt his fingers, let him but open the Hens belly, and his eyes will convince him of the truth of what we ſay. But if any one wants either opportunity or will to make trial, let him conſult the eleventh <hi>Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Dr. <hi>Harveys</hi> Book of the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> and he will there find it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrated. <q>2. <hi>Four membranes,</hi> two exteriour, which begirt and embrace <note place="margin">2. Four Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes.</note> the outer White, one interiour which contains the Yolk, and a fourth middlemoſt, which encompaſſes the inner White. 3. <hi>A twofold White,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <note place="margin">3. A double White.</note> in a Hens Egg, both involved in their proper membranes, the one thinner and more liquid, the other thicker and more clammy, and a little more inclining to whiteneſs; in ſtaler Eggs after ſome days incubation growing yellowiſh. As this ſecond White covers the Yolk round, ſo that exteriour liquor encompaſſes it. That both theſe Whites are diſtinct is even from hence manifeſt: The outward bark or ſhell being taken away, if you pierce both the ſubjacent membranes you ſhall ſee the exteriour liquid White forthwith flow out. Then turning back the ſaid mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes this way and that way into the Platter (in which the Egg is ſuppoſed to lie) the interiour and thicker White will ſtill retain its place and globoſe figure, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terminated by its proper membrane, which is ſo thin that it is altogether invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the eye. This if you cut, the ſecond White will ſtraitway run out, and diffuſe it ſelf this way and that way, and loſe its round figure, juſt as any liquor runs out of a bladder containing it, when it is cut. Then the proper membrane of the Yolk broken, the Saffron-coloured liquor flows out, and the former globoſity ſubſides [or ſinks.] 4. <hi>The Yolk,</hi> of which ſee Dr. <hi>Harveys</hi> Book of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>

They are oblong bodies, more concrete than the White, and alſo whiter, knotty, and not without ſome bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherein they reſemble Hail, whence they took their name <hi>[Chalazae.]</hi> For each Treddle conſiſts as it were of many hail-ſtones joyned together by the White. The one of theſe is greater, and ſtretched out further from the Yolk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the obtuſe end of the Egg: The other is leſs, extended from the Yolk down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards toward the acute part. The greater is made up of two or three knots, as it were hailſtones, ſtanding at a moderate diſtance one from the other, the leſſer in order ſucceeding the greater. Theſe Treddles are found in all the Eggs of all birds, as well <note n="*" place="margin">Wind-eggs.</note> ſubventaneous as fecund. Whence appears the common miſtake of our Houſewives, who think that the <hi>Treddles [Grandines]</hi> are the Cocks Sperm, and that the Chicken is formed of them.</q> [This is a miſtake not of old Women or common People only, but alſo of great Phyſicians and Naturaliſts, as <hi>Hieronymus Fabricius ab Aquapendente,</hi> in his book of the <hi>Formation of the Egg and Chicken,</hi> and <hi>Joannes Faber</hi> in his excellent Expoſitions of ſome Pictures of <hi>Mexican Animals</hi> of <hi>Recchus.</hi> His words are theſe: <hi>Which I long ago moſt diligently obſerved before I heard of</hi> Aquapendentes <hi>work, to wit, that the Chicken hath its firſt riſe or original from the Treddle, which the</hi> Italians <hi>call</hi> La Galladura; <hi>the</hi> Germans <hi>moſt fitly</hi> Den vogel, <hi>that is,</hi> the bird, <hi>becauſe the bird is bred or formed of it. This part is ſituate between the Yolk and the White in the likeneſs of a hailſtone or pretty great oblong Pearl, and is of a ſubſtance ſomewhat different from the White,</hi> viz. <hi>more hard and tough, which therefore our Cooks and Houſewives, when they mingle Eggs with Broths, Cawdles, or any other liquid meat, are wont to ſeparate and take carefully away, as which with much beating can hardly be diſſolved, unleſs you put Salt, or Sugar, or Vinegar to it.]</hi>

               <p>The ſtalks of Eggs, whereby they grow to the <hi>Ovarium,</hi> are not ſolid after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">The ſtalk of the Egg.</note> of the footſtalks of fruits, but hollow and fiſtulous.</p>
               <p>Eggs, if you preſs them between your hands longways, are very hardly and not without much force broken.</p>
               <p>Eggs violently ſhaken, till the Yolk and White be mingled, the containing mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes being broken, may be ſet upright upon the blunt end, which otherwiſe the <note place="margin">Eggs how to ſet on end.</note> Yolk and White remaining entire can very hardly be ſo erected. For the Yolk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuſpended between the Treddles, hangs quavering, and by the leaſt motion or inclination vibrates to and fro within the Egg,, and changing the center of gravity, hinders its erection.</p>
               <p>Eggs being macerated in Vinegar their Shels will be diſſolved, ſo that they may be <note place="margin">Egg-ſhels diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Vinegar. The Chicken is formed of the White of the Egg.</note> thruſt into a narrow-mouthed Veſſel, or drawn through a Ring.</p>
               <p>Whereas there is in Eggs a double liquor, <hi>Yolk</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> the Chicken is formed out of, and nouriſhed by the White alone, till it be grown great. The Yolk ſerves for the Chickens nouriſhment after it is well grown, and partly alſo after it is hatched. For a good part of the Yolk remains after excluſion, being received into the Chickens belly; and being there reſerved as in a ſtore-houſe, is by the formerly mentioned channel, as it were by a funnel, conveyed into the guts, and ſerves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of milk. For whereas viviparous Animals are furniſhed with milk, wherewith to nouriſh their tender young, till by degrees they are accuſtomed to and grow able <note place="margin">The Yolk ſupplies the room of milk;</note> to bear firmer and harder meat; in birds, which want Paps and milk, Nature, Gods handmaid, hath provided and laid up in the middle of the Egg the Yolk for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of their newly hatched young. Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> confirms this in <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 53. of his book of the <hi>Generation of Animals. The White</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is firſt ſpent, the Yolk comes not for food till late, and is to Chickens newly hatcht what milk is to vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Animals newly brought forth: that what kind of nouriſhment Nature affords by the Paps in viviparous Animals, the like in oviparous ſhe may confer by the Yolk. Whence it comes to paſs, that all the White being conſumed, the Yolk remains almoſt entire in the Egg,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:63869:13"/>
                  <hi>when the Chicken is now perfect and conſummate, and part of it a long time after its exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: for even after ſix weeks we have ſeen ſomewhat of it remaining in the belly of the Chicken, ſticking to the guts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas we ſaid the <hi>foetus</hi> is formed of the <hi>White,</hi> by <hi>White</hi> we do not mean any <note place="margin">The young is in the <hi>cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricala</hi> before incubation.</note> part of the <hi>White</hi> indifferently, but the purer and more lucid part, contained in the little bubble or bladder, called the <hi>Cicatricula,</hi> in which the Chick is originally formed. Yea, the deſervedly famous, and moſt ſagacious ſearcher out of the ſecrets of Nature, <note n="*" place="margin">Tractatu de Ovo.</note> 
                  <hi>Marcellus Malpighius,</hi> hath obſerved the firſt ſtrokes or rude draught of the <hi>Embryon</hi> in the <hi>Cicatricula,</hi> even before incubation, as the young plant in the Seed, which is the Egg of the Plant. And which is yet more, he hath obſerved even in ſubventaneous Eggs ſomething in the <hi>Cicatricula</hi> like to a <hi>Mola</hi> or falſe Conception. Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> ſeems not to be conſtant in his opinion about the formation and nutrition of the Chicken in the Egg. For in ſome places he aſſerts, that it is both originally formed of, and alſo nouriſhed by both liquors, I mean, the Yolk and White; as for example, in the 36. <hi>Exercitation,</hi> where he hath theſe words: <hi>Indeed from the courſe of the umbilical veins, and the diſtribution of their branches, which without doubt ſerve for drawing in nouriſhment, it doth manifeſtly appear, that the conſtitutive matter and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the Embryon-chicken is ſupplied as well from the Yolk as from the White, and that liquor called by us the</hi> Colliquamentum <hi>ſeems to be made up no leſs of the Yolk than the White: for ſomething of both humours doth melt or diſſolve into that liquor. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the ſpeckout of which dilated the</hi> Colliquamentum <hi>is firſt made, and which is called by us the</hi> eye <hi>of the</hi> Egg, <hi>is impreſſed on, or ſticks to the Tunicle of the Yolk.</hi> Elſewhere he affirms that the Chicken is firſt nouriſhed by the liquor of the <hi>Colliquamentum,</hi> than by that of the thinner White, afterward that of the thicker, and laſt of all of the Yolk. <hi>Exercit.</hi> 21. <hi>After the tenth day the greateſt part of the White is ſpent upon the</hi> Colliquamentum, <hi>and thence upon the</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryon bird.</note> foetus, <hi>to wit, the whole thin White, and the greater part of the thicker. But the Yolk appears larger than it was at firſt. Whence it is evident, that the Yolk doth not as yet ſerve for nutrition, but is afterwards deputed to that office. And as far as I could gather from the progreſs</hi> [ductu] <hi>and diſtribution of the veins, the</hi> foetus <hi>from the very beginning is nouriſhed by the</hi> Colliquamentum, <hi>for that the veins are at firſt diſſeminated in that only, then ſpread into the membrane of the thinner White, and afterward into the thicker White and the Yolk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All Animals come of Eggs,</hi> as well thoſe called <hi>viviparous</hi> as <hi>oviparous:</hi> For the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males <note place="margin">Viviparous Animals bred of Eggs.</note> of the viviparous have Eggs within them, though they do not bring them forth. To wit, thoſe two bodies, commonly called <hi>female teſticles,</hi> are nothing elſe (as we ſaid before) but knots or maſſes of very ſmall Eggs, as will manifeſtly appear to <note place="margin">The ſuppoſed Teſticles of Females are maſſes of Eggs.</note> any one that ſhall diſſect them; ſo that we cannot but wonder that a thing ſo plain and evident ſhould ſo long eſcape the obſervation of the curious and inquiſitive eyes of ancient and modern Anatomiſts. This difference there is between the Eggs of ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous and viviparous Animals (underſtand it of terreſtrial) that theſe ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of one liquor, <hi>viz.</hi> the White only, whereas thoſe contain two or three ſeveral ones. Yea, if we conſider the matter more exactly, we ſhall I think find, that the Seeds or Eggs of viviparous Creatures do indeed anſwer to the <hi>Cicatriculae</hi> of Eggs, in which from the beginning the young <hi>[foetus]</hi> is included. For the Yolk (as we ſaid) is given to birds inſtead of milk: and the Egg of a viviparous Creature im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibes out of the womb a liquor Analogous to the White of Eggs. For the Egg after coition being made fecund, falls down into the womb, in like manner as the ripe fruit or Seed falls from the tree or herb upon the earth, and there ſemblably imbibes the humour, wherewith the encloſed <hi>foetus</hi> is nouriſhed. Then after a certain ſpace of time it faſtens it ſelf to the womb, and after the manner of Seed fallen upon the ground, doth as it were ſtrike root into it.</p>
               <p>The <note n="*" place="margin">Sitting upon Eggs.</note> 
                  <hi>Incubation</hi> of <hi>oviparous</hi> Creatures is equivalent to the <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Going with young.</hi> Incubation anſwers to Geſtation.</note> 
                  <hi>geſtation</hi> of <hi>viviparous,</hi> for in both the Eggs are alike kept warm, in this inwardly in the womb, in that outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the wings, to the time of birth or excluſion; when the young being now grown great, and deſiring the free air, breaks the involving Teguments, and comes forth into the light. Now an Egg is not unfitly called an <hi>expoſed womb,</hi> for that it doth after the ſame manner adminiſter nouriſhment to the <hi>foetus</hi> in oviparous Animals, as the womb doth in viviparous.</p>
               <p>As other Creatures, ſo it is not to be doubted but Birds alſo of divers kinds do <note place="margin">Spurious Birds bred by anomalous mixtures.</note> ſometimes couple together, and mingle their Seed, from whence proceeds a third and ſpurious production, which partakes of both kinds; which yet I ſuppoſe doth not generate its like: For otherwiſe the number of Species in Birds would have been ere

now almoſt infinitely increaſed. So although in the <hi>Genus</hi> of Quadrupeds a Mule be engendred by the coupling of an Aſs and a Mare; yet for a Mule to bring forth young was wont to be counted a Prodigy. This anomalous coition is exerciſed between Birds like to one another, as being of the ſame Tribe, eſpecially between Hawks and other Birds of prey of different <hi>Species;</hi> partly becauſe theſe <hi>Species</hi> are very like one to another, partly becauſe they are all very ſalacious.</p>
               <p>It is wonderful which we dayly experience in <hi>Hens, viz.</hi> that they will breed and <note place="margin">Hens will breed and lay Eggs without being ever trodden by the Cock.</note> lay Eggs without ever being trodden by the Cock, which Eggs though they ſeem to be every way perfect yet are they inſoecund, called by the Greeks, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is, ſubventaneous or wind-eggs, or if the Hens were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated therewith by the wind. Neither do Hens only, but other Birds alſo, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as are ſalacious, in the Spring time when they are full of luſt, if they be gently ſtroked on the back, or their Genitals handled, ſometimes lay Eggs without the Cock. <hi>They are</hi> (ſaith D. <hi>Harvey) ſometimes ſo libidinous, that if you do but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch their backs with your hand, they preſently lie down, and denude the Orifice of the Womb, which if you gently ſtroke with your finger, by an incondite murmur, and the geſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of their wings, they expreſs their grateful ſenſe of the pleaſure they take therein. Moreover, that Hen-birds will thence conceive Eggs both</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>affirms, and my ſelf have experienced in a Thruſh, a Blackbird, and other birds, and did a great while ſince at firſt find out accidentally, and by my own loſs.</hi> 
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>My Wife did for a long time keep a notable Parrot that had learned to ſpeak very prettily, wherein ſhe took great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. This bird was ſo tame and familiar, that it went freely up and down the houſe whither ſoever it liſted; it would ſearch out its Miſtreſs when ſhe was abſent, and when it had found her, with a chearful voice it would as it were ſalute her, and ſignifie its joy: When ſhe called, it would anſwer her, and fly to her, and taking hold of her Garment with its beak and feet alternately, it would climb up to the top of her ſhoulder, and thence deſcending down her arm, it would at laſt ſettle it ſelf upon her hand. Bidden to ſpeak or ſing, though it were by night, or in the dark, it would obey. Many times it would ſportingly and wantonly come up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her lap as ſhe ſate, and was much pleaſed to have its head rubb'd, and its back ſtroked; and by ſhaking its wings, and its flattering note, teſtified the great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it took in thoſe careſſes and touches. I interpreted all theſe things to proceed from its wonted familiarity and obſequiouſneſs: for by reaſon of the excellency of its ſpeaking and ſinging, I took it to be a Cock. For among birds females ſeldom uſe to ſing or ſpeak much: but we have obſerved, that generally the Cocks do by the <note place="margin">Cock-birds ſing and not Hens.</note> ſweet modulation of their voice and harmonious accents endeavour to delight the Hens, and allure them to ſubmit to their embraces.</p>
                  <p>Not long after theſe grateful contrectations, the Parrot (which for many years had lived healthfully) fell ſick, and after many convulſions at laſt expired in the Lap of its Miſtreſs, in which it had ſo often ſported. Cutting up its Carcaſs (that I might ſearch out the cauſe of its death) I found an Egg almoſt perfect in the womb, but for want of a Cock, corrupted, as it happens often to ſmall birds ſhut up in Cages, which want the company of the Cock.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many birds then by how much the more ſalacious they are, by ſo much the more fruitful be they, and do ſometimes without the Male (by reaſon of high-feeding, or ſome other cauſe) conceive Eggs, but ſeldom without his concurrence either perfect them, or bring them forth; but do rather thereupon fall into grievous diſeaſes, and at laſt die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perchance it may ſeem to ſome not leſs wonderful, that by once treading of the Cock, all the Eggs which a Hen ſhall lay for a whole year after will be rendred proli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. <note place="margin">Hens by being once trodden will lay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lific Eggs for a year after.</note>

And I</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Harvey) (that I might defend</hi> Fabricius, <hi>and find out ſomething certain concerning the time and neceſſity of this prolific coition) did once in the Spring time keep two Hens for three days ſhut up from the Cock, each of which did in the mean time lay three Eggs, no leſs prolific than any others: And again another Hen, which laid one Egg the tenth day after ſhe was ſhut up, and another the twentieth, and both fecund. So that it ſeems one or two Coits may make the whole cluſter of Eggs, at leaſt as many as ſhall be laid for a whole year fruitful.</hi> What follows I ſuppoſe he wrote upon preſumption, and not from experience, viz. <hi>That though a Hen hath no Seed-eggs</hi>

For I do not ſee how he could make any experiment hereof: Seeing that if he had opened a ſitting Hen, and had found no Eggs within her, how could he certainly know that ſhe would have bred new ones had ſhe lived? If he thought that all Clock-hens do lay all their Eggs, and quite em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty the <hi>Vitellarium,</hi> before they begin to clock and betake themſelves to ſitting; he was therein ſurely miſtaken. For I ſee no reaſon why that ſhould be true in Hens, which I have by experience found falſe in other birds; eſpecially ſeeing himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, that there are in Hens as well as other Birds an almoſt infinite number of Yolks in the <hi>Ovarium</hi> of divers growths, from an almoſt inviſible quantity to the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate magnitude.</p>

               <p>OF all ſanguineous and hot Animals Birds are the longeſt lived, for the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Birds are lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger lived than Quadrupeds.</note> of their bodies much more vivacious than Quadrupeds. <hi>Swans</hi> are ſaid to attain to the age even of three hundred years. We have been aſſured by a friend of ours, a perſon of very good credit, that his Father kept a <hi>Gooſe</hi> known to <note place="margin">A Gooſe 80 years old.</note> be fourſcore years of age, and as yet ſound and luſty, and like enough to have lived many years longer, had he not been forced to kill her for her miſchievouſneſs, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying and deſtroying the young Geeſe and Goſlings. Moreover, the <hi>Pelican</hi> that <note place="margin">A Pelican of the ſame age.</note> was kept at <hi>Mechlin</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> in the Emperour <hi>Maximilians</hi> time, was certainly believed to be fourſcore years old. What is reported of the age of <hi>Eagles</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> although it exceeds all belief, yet doth it evince that thoſe birds are very long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived. Our people (ſaith <hi>Albertus</hi> as he is quoted by <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ornithol. tom.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 370.</note>

And as for tame Pigeons (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus) a certain Perſon, worthy to be believed, and not unskilful in Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, related to me, that he had been told by his Father, who was much delighted in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obſerving Pigeons and other birds: That he had kept a Pigeon two and twenty years, and that it bred all the while, except the laſt ſix months, in which leaving its Mate, it made choice of a ſingle life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to let paſs great birds, even the very ſmalleſt birds live a great while. We our ſelves knew a <hi>Linnet</hi> kept at leaſt fourteen years in a Cage, which as yet ſhewed no <note place="margin">A Linnet of 14 years.</note> ſigns of decay or old age. <hi>Geſner</hi> tells us, that a certain Kinſman of his wrote to him concerning a <hi>Goldfinch</hi> to this purpoſe: <hi>The</hi> Goldfinch <hi>lives above twenty years.

the open air, and uſing their natural and proper food, in gathering of which they alſo exerciſe their bodies, live much longer than thoſe that are impriſoned in houſes and Cages.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Pliny</hi> obſerves of Animals, to wit, that thoſe that live longeſt are born <note place="margin">How far it holds true, that thoſe are longeſt lived which are longeſt in the womb.</note> longeſt in the womb, is to be underſtood of Animals of the ſame kind. For if Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of different kinds be compared together, as for example Birds with Beaſts, thoſe will ſometimes be found to be moſt vivacious which are born the leaſt while in the womb. If it be objected, that Birds and Beaſts cannot in this reſpect be compared together, becauſe Birds are not at all born in the womb. We anſwer, that incubation in Birds is equivalent to geſtation in Quadrupeds: For in both the Eggs are cheriſhed alike, in this inwardly in the Womb, in that outwardly under the Wings, as we have formerly ſhewn.</p>

For the moſt part, I ſay, this holds true in wild Birds, yet ſome few there be of theſe that vary much in their colours, as for example, <hi>Ruſſes,</hi> of which it is reported there cannot be found two alike, and the <hi>Scaup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duck.</hi>

               <p>Some Birds live a Conjugal life, one Cock and one Hen pairing together, and <note place="margin">Birds pair together, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal life.</note> both concurring and aſſiſting each other in ſitting and feeding their young.

               <p>That there are in Animals thoſe they call natural inſtincts, the manner of building their Neſts in Birds is alone ſufficient to evince. For whereas thoſe of the ſame <hi>Species</hi> in Countries moſt remote and diſtant from each other do make their Neſts always of the ſame materials, and conſtantly obſerve the ſame ſhape or form of them, as if they made them by the ſame pattern, they muſt neceſſarily either learn ſo to do by inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or imitation of their Parents, or elſe have the knowledge or ability ſo to do by natural inſtinct: but neither by inſtitution, for who ever ſaw the old or the young teaching or learning of one another? Nor by imitation, for the young forſake the Neſts ſo ſoon as they are fledg'd; when as they are very ſimple and witleſs, and neither regard nor heed almoſt any thing but their food: and themſelves next Spring building they could neither ſee their Parents making their Neſts, nor any other birds of their kind, whom they might imitate. It remains therefore that they act by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And here we cannot but admire, with</hi> Harvey, <hi>ſome of theſe natural inſtincts in Birds,</hi>

                  <hi>cover up their Eggs with ſtraw. With what courage and magnanimity do even the moſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly birds defend their Eggs, which ſometimes are ſubventaneous and addle, or not their own, or even artificial ones? Stupendious in truth is the love of birds to a dull and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Egg, and which is not likely with the leaſt profit or pleaſure to recompenſe ſo great pains and care. Who can but admire that paſſionate affection or rather fury of a clocking Hen, which cannot be extinguiſhed unleſs ſhe be drencht in cold water? During this</hi> impetus <hi>of mind, ſhe neglects all things, and as if ſhe were in a frenzy, lets down her Wings, and briſtles up her Feathers, and walks up and down reſtleſs and querulous, puts other Hens off their Neſts, ſearching every where for Eggs to ſit upon; neither doth ſhe give over till ſhe hath either found Eggs to ſit, or Chickens to bring up: which ſhe doth with wonderful zeal and paſſion, call together, cheriſh, feed, and defend. What a pretty ridiculous ſpectacle is it, to ſee a Hen following a baſtard brood of young Ducklings (which ſhe hath hatched for her own) ſwimming in the water? How ſhe often compaſſes the place, ſometimes venturing in, not without danger, as far as ſhe can wade, and calls upon them, uſing all her art and induſtry to allure them to her.</hi>

               <p>All Birds in coupling and breeding time are moſt loquacious and canorous.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of ſome remarkable Iſles, Cliffs, and Rocks about</hi> England, <hi>where Sea-fowl do yearly build and breed in great numbers.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MAny Water but eſpecially Sea-fowl do yearly breed and bring forth young in great companies, either in high Rocks, or Deſart, and leſs inhabited Iſlands in the Sea, or on high and ſteep Cliffs by the Sea-ſide. The more noted and famous places of this kind about <hi>England</hi> are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Baſſe</hi> Iſland in the great Bay called <hi>Edinburgh-Frith</hi> or <hi>Forth,</hi> not far from <note place="margin">The Eaſſe.</note> the ſhore: which Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> doth not leſs truly than elegantly deſcribe in theſe words: <hi>There is a little Iſland, the</hi> Scots <hi>call it</hi> Baſſe, <hi>ſtanding very high, environed with ſteep and craggy Cliffs (one might more truly and properly call it a huge Rock than an Iſland) not much more than a mile in compaſs. In the months of</hi> May <hi>and</hi> June <hi>the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of this Iſland is almoſt wholly covered with Neſts, Eggs, and young Birds; ſo that for the multitude of them one can ſcarce any where freely ſet ones foot: and ſuch a number of Birds there is flying over ones head, that like Clouds they cover the Skie, and take away the ſight of the Sun: making ſuch a noiſe and din with their cries that people talking together near hand can ſearce hear one another. If from thence as from a lofty Tower, or high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice you look down upon the Sea underneath, you ſhall ſee it every way covered with an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Birds of divers ſorts ſwimming up and down, intent upon their prey: In like manner as Pools of water in ſome places in the Spring time are ſeen, over-ſpread with Frogs: or the open hills and ſteep mountains are beheld at a diſtance, thick ſet, and as it were cloathed with flocks of Sheep and Goats. If you liſt to ſail about the Iſland, and from below look up the Cliffs as it were over-hanging your head, you might ſee on all the ſhelves and ledges of the Rocks and craggy Cliffs innumerable rows of birds of all ſorts and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, more in number than the Stars that appear in a clear and Moonleſs night. If you look at them that are coming to the Iſland, or flying away at a diſtance, you would take them to be huge ſwarms of Bees.</hi> Thus far Dr. <hi>Harvey.</hi> But I ſuppoſe he was miſtaken
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63869:16"/>
in that he writes that the Lord of the Iſland makes ſome profit yearly of the reliques of the Neſts uſeful for fewel. For theſe kinds of Birds do not make their Neſts of ſtraws, ſticks, or ſuch like combuſtible matter, good for fewel; but either lay their Eggs on the naked rocks, or ſpread under them very few ſtraws, bents, or ſuch like inconſiderable ſtuff.</p>
               <p>The Birds that chiefly frequent this Iſland that they may breed there are 1. <hi>Soland</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Soland Geeſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Geeſe,</hi> which are proper to the <hi>Baſſe,</hi> not breeding elſewhere about <hi>Britain,</hi> that we know of. When we were there near Mid<hi>-Auguſt,</hi> all the other Birds were departed, only the <hi>Soland Geeſe</hi> remained upon the Iſland, their young being not yet fully grown and fledg'd. The manner of getting them is by letting down a man in a basket by a rope from the top of the Cliff, who gathers the young off the ledges of the Rocks, as they let him down or draw him up. 2. The <hi>Turtle-Dove,</hi> or <hi>Sea-Turtle,</hi> ſo called here (as I ſuppoſe) from ſome ſimilitude it hath to the <hi>Turtle-dove.</hi> It is a whole-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bird, and, I ſuſpect, the ſame that we have deſcribed under the title of the <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-dove.</hi> This alſo is a bird peculiar to this Iſland. 3. The <hi>Scout,</hi> which is either the <hi>Lomwia,</hi> or the <hi>Alka</hi> of <hi>Hoierus:</hi> though we believe that both theſe Species breed here. Theſe are found alſo in many other places about <hi>England.</hi> 4. The <hi>Scarf,</hi> which from the agreement of the name with the Dutch <hi>Scharpff,</hi> I take to be the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant.</hi> 5. The <hi>Cattiwick,</hi> a ſort of ſmall <hi>Sea-gull,</hi> beſides many other <hi>Species</hi> of Gulls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Farn Iſlands</hi> near a Village in the Coaſt of <hi>Northumberland</hi> called <hi>Bambergh,</hi> famous for an ancient Caſtle built on a Rock, now almoſt ruined. The Birds which chiefly frequent and build upon theſe Iſlands in Summer time are 1. S. <hi>Cutberts Duck,</hi> called by <hi>Wormius,</hi> as I ſuppoſe, <hi>Eider.</hi> This is never ſeen but in breeding time, and as ſoon as her young ones are hatcht takes them to Sea, and never looks at land till breeding time next. It is proper to theſe Iſlands, and breeds no where elſe about <hi>England,</hi> that we know of. 2. <hi>Guillemots</hi> or <hi>Sea-hens,</hi> i. e. <hi>Lomwiae Hoieri.</hi> 3. The <hi>Skout,</hi> i. e. <hi>Alka ejuſdem.</hi> 4. <hi>Counter-nebs</hi> or <hi>Coulter-nebs, hîc dictae,</hi> i. e. <hi>Anates Arcticae Cluſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Scarfs,</hi> i. e. <hi>Cormorants,</hi> or perhaps <hi>Shags.</hi> 6. <hi>Puffinets,</hi> which the name ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues to be <hi>Puffins:</hi> but the deſcription here given us of them (for we ſaw not the bird) agrees rather to the <hi>Baſſe-Turtle.</hi> 7. Several ſorts of Gulls, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Mire-crows,</hi> all white-bodied, only having black heads, and ſomewhat bigger than Pigeons; by which deſcription we conclude them to be <hi>Pewits.</hi> 2. <hi>Annets,</hi> ſmall white Gulls, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only the tips of their Wings black; and the Bill yellow, perhaps <hi>the black-footed Gull.</hi> 3. <hi>Pickmires,</hi> or Sea-Swallows. 5. <hi>Terns,</hi> the leaſt ſort of Gull, having a forked tail. 8. <hi>Sea-Piots,</hi> i. e. Sea-pies, <hi>Haematopus Bellonii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Sea-cliffs about <hi>Scarborough,</hi> from which were ſent us, the <hi>Anates Arcticae</hi> of <hi>Cluſius,</hi> called here <hi>Mullets.</hi> 2. The <hi>Alkae</hi> of <hi>Hoierus,</hi> known here by the ſame name of <hi>Auks.</hi> 3. The <hi>Lomwiae</hi> of the ſame <hi>Hoierus,</hi> named <hi>Skouts.</hi> Beſides doubtleſs there breed many Gulls among theſe fowl.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A noted Iſland not far from <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> called the <hi>Pile of Foudres:</hi> which great flocks of divers ſorts of Sea-fowl do yearly frequent, and breed there.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are either <hi>Rapacious</hi> and carnivorous, ſuch as we call <hi>Birds of prey,</hi> or more <hi>gentle</hi> and frugivorous, as <hi>Parrots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rapacious</hi> and carnivorous are either <hi>Diurnal,</hi> ſuch as prey by day-light, or <hi>Noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> ſuch as prey by night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rapacious diurnal</hi> Birds are uſually divided according to their magnitude into the <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>leſſer</hi> kind.</p>
               <p>The <hi>greater</hi> kind are either the <hi>more generous,</hi> which have their Beaks hooked al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt from the root, and are called <hi>Eagles,</hi> or the <hi>ſluggiſh</hi> and <hi>leſs generous,</hi> having their Beaks ſtreight for a good ſpace from the root, and hooked only toward the point, called <hi>Vultures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>leſſer</hi> kind, called in Latine <hi>Accipitres,</hi> may be again ſubdivided into the <hi>more generous,</hi> which are uſually reclaimed and trained up for fowling, properly called <hi>Hawks;</hi> and the <hi>more cowardly</hi> or <hi>leſs generous,</hi> ſuch as are neglected by <hi>Falconers,</hi> as being of no uſe for fowling; and therefore permitted to live at large, which may be called <hi>wild Hawks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hawks</hi> properly ſo called are divided by Falconers into <hi>long-winged</hi> and <hi>ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Long-winged</hi> Hawks are ſuch the tips of whoſe wings when cloſed reach almoſt to the end of the train: <hi>Short-winged</hi> are ſuch the tips of whoſe wings when ſhut or withdrawn fall much ſhort of the end of the train.</p>
               <p>Birds that have <hi>more ſtreight</hi> bills and claws are either the <hi>greater</hi> or the <hi>leſſer,</hi> which we call <hi>ſmall birds.</hi> Under the title of <hi>greater</hi> we comprehend all that do exceed or equal the common <hi>Thruſh</hi> or <hi>Mavis</hi> in bigneſs. Yet to ſome kinds of bigger Birds (as for example <hi>Woodpeckers)</hi> by reaſon of the agreement of the characteriſtic notes we are forced to add one or two Birds leſſer than <hi>Thruſhes. The greater</hi> are either ſuch as have <hi>large, ſtrong, ſtreight, and long Bills,</hi> or <hi>leſſer and ſhorter ones.</hi> The firſt are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch as feed promiſcuouſly upon Fleſh, Inſects and fruit (or grain) or at leaſt Inſects and fruit; or ſuch as feed upon Inſects only. Thoſe in reſpect of colour may be divided into two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>The Crow-kind,</hi> whoſe body is for the moſt part of one colour and black: 2. <hi>The Pie-kind,</hi> whoſe body is covered with party-coloured feathers. Of theſe, [that feed only on Inſects] there is but one kind, v. g. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peckers.</hi> Such as have <hi>leſſer</hi> and <hi>ſhorter bills</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed by the colour of their fleſh, into ſuch as have <hi>white fleſh,</hi> and ſuch as have <hi>black fleſh.</hi> Thoſe that have <hi>white fleſh</hi> are the Poultry kind, <hi>Hens, Peacocks, Turkeys,</hi> &amp;c.

In having a ſlenderer and weaker bill: So that it hews not for it ſelf a hole in the ſolid Wood, but builds in rotten and hollow trees. 2. In having its tail not ſo ſtiff.</p>
                  <p>The NUTHATCH, or <hi>Nut-jobber. Picus cinereus.</hi> She hath not a long tongue as the other, becauſe ſhe feeds not on <hi>Coſſi</hi> as they do, but on other Inſects, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on Nut-kernels. It is a pretty ſight to ſee her fetch a Nut out of her hoard, place it in a chink, and then ſtand over it with her head downward, ſtrike it with all her might, and breaking the ſhell catch up the Kernel. The feathers of her tail are not ſtiff and pointed, becauſe her motion is rather down than up trees: nor hath ſhe two hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes: but the inner toe is ſeparated a little from the middle, and falls ſomewhat acroſs (as in the <hi>Owl-kind)</hi> whereby ſhe can ſupport her ſelf in any motion.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N delivering the Art of Fowling, or taking of Birds, there are two methods that might be obſerved.</p>
            <p>The firſt proceeding according to the Engines and devices that are made uſe of fortaking them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond according to the ſeveral ſorts of Birds to be taken.</p>
            <p>In the firſt method might be firſt an enumeration made of the ſeveral Engines and Inſtruments, as Nets, Springes, and Snares, Traps and Pit-falls, Guns and Croſs-bows, Bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, Baits, and Animals, <hi>viz.</hi> Hawks, and Dogs. Then, going particularly over each Inſtrument or Engine, might be ſhewed, 1. The ſeveral ſorts and faſhions of each. 2. The various ways of uſing each ſort. 3. What kind of birds are to be taken each way.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall chuſe rather to uſe the ſecond method, following therein <hi>Markham</hi> in his Treatiſe on this Subject, intituled <hi>Hungers prevention, or the Art of Fowling,</hi> to whom I muſt profeſs my ſelf beholden for the greater part of this Diſcourſe, which I ſhall divide into two Sections; in the firſt treating concerning the taking of <hi>Water-fowl,</hi> in the ſecond concerning the taking of <hi>Land-fowl:</hi> To which laſt I ſhall annex three Chapters: The firſt, concerning the making of Birdlime; The ſecond, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the election and training up of a Setting-Dog; The third, containing an Abridgment of ſome Statutes relating to the preſervation of Fowl.</p>

                     <p>MAke your Net of the ſtrongeſt and beſt-twined Pack-thread, with large maſhes, at leaſt two Inches from knot to knot: For the bigger the maſh, ſo the birds cannot creep through, the better. The Net muſt not be above two fathoms deep, and ſix long at the moſt: A Net of that ſize being as great as a man is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63869:22"/>
well able to throw over. It muſt be verged with a ſtrong cord on each ſide, and extended ſtiff upon a long Pole at each end: Then having obſerved the Morning and Evening-feeding of the Fowl (which is ſeldom in one and the ſame place) be ſure to come two hours before thoſe feeding times (which are twilight in the Morning, and after Sun-ſet at Night) and upon theſe haunts ſpread your Nets ſmooth and flat, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king down the two lower ends firm on the ground, ſo that they may only come and go, and no more. The upper verge of the Net muſt ſtand extended on the long Cord, the further end whereof muſt be ſtaked down to the earth, two or three fathoms from the Net, (the Stake ſtanding in a right line with the lower edge of the Net) the Fowler holding in his hand the other end (which ſhould be at leaſt ten or twelve fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom long) at its diſtance: where he ſhall make ſome artificial ſhelter of graſs, ſods, earth, or ſuch like matter, where he may lie out of ſight of the Fowl. Be ſure that the Net lie ſo tickle, that upon the leaſt twitch it will riſe from the earth, and fly over. Strow over the Net ſhort dead fog and other graſs to hide it as much as may be from the view of the Fowl. It would be of advantage, cloſe to your Net to ſtake down a live <hi>Heron,</hi> or other Fowl you ſpread for, formerly taken, for a ſtale, making her now and then flutter her wings. When you ſee a competent number of Fowl with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the danger of your Net, draw your Cord ſuddenly and cover them. This you may do till the Sun be almoſt half an hour high, but no longer, for after that time no more Fowl will come to feed; and at Evening from Sun-ſet till the Stars begin to appear. Thus you may take not only the greater Water-fowl, but <hi>Plover</hi> and others.</p>

                     <p>MAke your Nets of the ſmalleſt and ſtrongeſt Pack-thread; the Maſhes of leſs compaſs than the forementioned; let them be 2½ or 3 foot deep; for length according to the Rivers and Waters they are to be pitched over. Let them be lined on both ſides with falſe Nets of ſtrong Packthread, every Maſh being 1½ foot ſquare, that as the Fowl ſtriketh either through or againſt them, the ſmaller Net may paſs through the great Maſhes, and ſo entangle them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Nets you ſhall pitch for the Evening-flight of Fowl before Sun-ſet, and ſtake them faſt down on each ſide the River, the lower ſide of the Nets about half a foot within the water, the upper ſide ſhoaling ſlantwiſe againſt the water, yet not touching it by a foot and half at leaſt. The ſtrings that ſupport this upper ſide muſt be faſtned to ſmall yielding ſticks prickt in the bark, which as the Fowl ſtriketh may give liberty to the Net to run and entangle them: Yet one end ever made ſo faſt that the Net may by no means be carried away. You may thus place divers of theſe Nets over the River about twelve ſcore one from another.</p>
                     <p>If there be any Fens, Plaſhes, or Pits at a good diſtance from the River, go to them, and ſhooting off a piece twice or thrice, raiſe the Fowl from thence, which will preſently pack to the River, then plant your Nets of the middle ſize upon the ſmall Plaſhes and Pits, and the longeſt of all upon the Fens: In like manner if there be any covert of Sedge, Reeds, Ruſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the water, pitch Nets about them alſo.</p>
                     <p>In the Morning go firſt to the River about an hour or two before day, and ſee what your Nets have taken, and unlade them: Then if you find there be many Fowls upon the River, ſhoot off your Gun in one or two places, and that will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſend them to the Fens, Plaſhes, and blank waters, wither you may repair about Sun-riſing, and ſee what your Nets have taken there.</p>

                     <p>AFter you have found and obſerved the haunts of the Fowl, provide a long line made of ſmall cord, knotted here and there, and well limed over; and a burthen of little ſticks, ſharp at the nether end, and with a little fork at the upper. If it be for the Evening-flight, come to the place an hour before Sun-ſet;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63869:22"/>
if for the Morning, at leaſt two hours before day [obſerve the ſame times in going to prick down Lime-rods,] and prick them down a little ſlanting, ſo as they may be within a foot and half of the ground at the uttermoſt, in even rows all over the place of haunt, one row diſtant from another a yard or two, and one ſtick from the next in the ſame row four or five yards. Then lay the limed ſtrings on the forks ſome rows higher than others, like waves. Faſten the ends with a ſlipping loop, ſo that upon any violent ſtrain the limed ſtring may looſen and lap about any thing that toucheth it. And ſo you ſhall take a great number of Plover of other Fowl that fly in a broad ſquadron, and ſwoop cloſe by the ground a good diſtance before they light.</p>
                     <p>In like manner you may take whole-footed Water-fowl, liming your ſtrings with ſtrong and water-tried Lime, placing the ſtrings over the Water as you did over the Land, only making your forked ſticks ſo much the longer, obſerving never to lay them in the Moon-ſhine, but either in dark nights, or ſhady places. They may be placed either ſo near the water as almoſt to touch it, or higher, not exceeding a foot and half. Theſe birds, though many times they fly in ſingle files, yet when they come down, ſpread themſelves ſo, as to alight all as it were together upon the water: And ſo by this Artifice they may be taken many together.</p>

                     <head>§. II. <hi>How to take Water-fowl with Lime-twigs.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>YOu muſt provide good ſtore of rods; the beſt are ſmall, long, ſtreight twigs of Willow, cut of even length, leſs for ſmall fowl, and greater for greater, yet all ſo light and ſlender, as to be apt to play and wind about any thing. The length muſt be ſuited to the place where they are to be uſed. Smear above half their upper ends with Birdlime, and holding them to the fire make the Bird-lime melt and run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that the Rod may not be diſcerned from the Lime.</p>
                     <p>Then at the times before directed go to the haunts: And firſt in the very middle of the place pin down for a ſtale a live-fowl of the ſame kind you lay for, yet ſo that ſhe may have liberty of wing to flutter up and down at pleaſure. Round the Stale every way, all the place over, prick down your Lime-rods in rows, at about a foot diſtance from each other, aſlope, with their points bending to the wind, or croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, one to the wind, and one againſt it alternately, their tops being a foot from the ground or better. This done, place a Stale or two more aloof from the Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods; and having found a ſit place for your ſelf to lie conceal'd in; with a ſmall, long ſtring faſtned to each Stale, and running along the ground to you, when you ſee or hear any Fowl coming, ſtir the Stales, and make them flutter: and upon ſight of them the Fowl will preſently ſtrike and ſwoop in among them, and ſo be entangled by the Rods.</p>
                     <p>You muſt have a well-taught Water-Spaniel to find and fetch ſuch as flutter away and hide themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Whole-footed Water-fowl may in like manner be taken with rods ſmeared over with ſtrong Water-lime, which no moiſture or froſt can injure. Prick theſe Rods in the water, the limed part being above water, [and amongſt them ſtake down here and there a Stale,] all over any Fen or wadeable River, and alſo upon the dry banks and borders ſurrounding ſuch Waters, ſo thick that a Fowl may not creep between them, fixing alſo a Stale or two there.</p>
                     <p>You need not wait continually on your Rods; only come firſt early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſecondly at Noon, thirdly, late at Night, alway attended with your Spaniel, and take what you find: If any of your Rods be miſſing, employ your Spaniel for finding out the Fowl that carried them away, whether fluttered into the River, or crept into any holes of the Bank, Ruſhes, Sedge, or other Covert.</p>
                     <p>When your ſport begins to decay, and the Game leaves the haunt, immediately find out a new haunt that is untroubled, and do as before directed; and after about a months reſt the firſt haunt will become as good as before.</p>
                     <p>For Wild-gooſe or Bernacle ſet of your greateſt Rods upon green Winter corn, either Wheat or Rie, but eſpecially Wheat, on which this ſort of Fowl feed moſt earneſtly. [The browneſt Rods, and neareſt the colour of the earth are beſt] Set your Rods eſpecially about and in the middle of the water-furrows. Theſe are very ſhie Fowl, and therefore you muſt ſtand at a good diſtance upon ſome knob or higher
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63869:23"/>
ground; and when by fluttering of the Fowl touch'd, and ſudden riſing of the reſt you perceive any are taken, make in and take them up; and if any half limed be flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away, let your Dog fetch them.</p>
                     <p>It will not be amiſs, if when you have placed your Rods, you beat the Fowl off from all other haunts, which will make them come the ſooner to that where your Rods are placed.</p>

                     <p>Take two or three hundred Birch-twigs, and lime forty or fifty of them together very well: Then finding out the haunt of <hi>Snipes,</hi> which you ſhall perceive by their Dung, and in very hard weather where the water lies open they will lie very thick. Then obſerving the place where they moſt feed, ſet two or three hundred of your twigs at a yard diſtance, and ſloping ſome one way, ſome another. Retire two or three hundred paces from the place, and you ſhall find, that there ſhall not one Snipe in ten miſs your twigs, by reaſon they ſpread their wings, and fetch a round cloſe to the ground before they alight. When you ſee any taken, ſtir not at firſt, for he will feed with the twigs under his wings, and as others come over the place he will be a cauſe to entice them. But when you ſee the coaſt clear, and but few that be not taken, go and take up your Birds, and faſten one or two, that the other flying over may come to the ſame place. If there be any other open places there by, put them off thoſe haunts. They will lie where it is open and a Spring very much; for they can feed in no hard place by reaſon of their Bills. In a Snow you ſhall have them extraordinary thick upon ſuch a place.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>HAving found the haunts where theſe fowl do uſually feed, and noted well the furrows and water-tracks where they commonly ſtalk and paddle to find worms, flote-graſs, roots and other ſuch like things on which they feed, you ſhall mark where many furrows meet in one, and break out as it were in one narrow ſtream or paſſage, and ſo deſcending afterwards divide into other parts and branches, this middle part or core being the deepeſt, and as it were feeding the reſt; then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting how every furrow breaketh and cometh in this Center or little Pit, you ſhall mark which is moſt padled with the Fowl: which found out and noted; you ſhall acroſs all the other paſſages make as it were a Fence of ſmall ſhort ſticks prickt down into the ground, at half an Inch diſtance, ſtanding about an handful or ſomewhat more above water. The Fowl (ſuch is their nature) will not preſsover theſe Fences, but ſtray about till they find the open way, wherein they will run up ſwiftly, pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up and down for their victuals. This done, take a good ſtiff ſtick, cut flat on one ſide, and prick both ends down into the water or earth on one ſide the track, the bow running parallel to, and not croſſing the track. Then you ſhall make a bow of ſmall Hazle or Willow in the faſhion of a Pear, [rather narrower] the one end run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out as it were in a foot-ſtalk, longer or ſhorter, greater or ſmaller, according to the bigneſs of the Fowl you ſet for, This is to anſwer the bridge in a Mouſe-trap, and therefore we will call it the Bridge. Then take a good ſtiff young Plant of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel or Elm, ruſhy grown, and clean without knot, and having made the bottom end ſharp, at the top you ſhall faſten a very ſtrong Loop or Swickel of horſe-hair. [This Loop is alſo to be made greater or leſſer, of more or fewer horſe-hairs, according to the bigneſs of the birds you ſet for] tied very faſt together with ſtrong Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thread, and made ſo ſmooth and yare that it will ſlip and run at pleaſure. Hard by this Loop or Swickel ſhall there alſo be faſtned, within an Inch and half of the end of the Plant a little broad thin Tricker, ſuch as they uſe to ſet up Mouſe-traps with.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things thus prepared, take your Loop of Hazel or Withy made Pear-wiſe, and laying it croſs the track, hang the bowed end of it on a little Peg or Hook driven down into the ground on one ſide the track, the other end or ſtalk of it muſt be put underneath the bout of the firſt-mentioned bowed ſtick, and near the end of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63869:23"/>
ſtalk of it muſt be a nick cut in. Then having thruſt down the ſharpned end of the Hazel-plant faſt into the ground on the bank or ſide of the track, bring the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler end with the Loop and Tricker to the Bridge: Then put one end of the Tricker under the bout of the firſt mentioned ſtick, and the other end in the nick made in the ſtalk or end of the Bridge; this will keep the Hazel-plant bent down. Then lay the Loop of horſe-hair upon the Bridge ſo conveniently wide, as that the Bird may tread in the middle of it upon the Bridge, which ſhe ſhall no ſooner do, but up will fly the end of the Hazel-plant, and the birds foot be caught in the nooſe or ſlipping Loop of horſe-hair. This is ſomewhat difficult ſo clearly to expreſs in words as that any man may readily underſtand and conceive it. <hi>Markham's</hi> deſcription is ſo imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and obſcure, that I could make nothing of it.</p>

                  <p>A Heron being as great a devourer of Fiſh as any is, I will affirm ten times as much as the <hi>Otter,</hi> and ſhall deſtroy a Pond more in one Week than an <hi>Otter</hi> ſhall do in three Months: For I have ſeen a <hi>Heron</hi> that hath been ſhot at a Pond to have ſeventeen Carps at once in his belly, which he will digeſt in ſix or ſeven hours, and to fiſhing again. I have ſeen a Carp taken out of a Herons belly nine Inches and an half long: Several Gentlemen that have kept them tame, have put fiſh in a Tub, and tried the Heron how many ſmall Roches and Dace he would eat in a day, and they have found him to eat above fifty a day, one day with another. One Heron that haunts a Pond in a year ſhall deſtroy one thouſand ſtore-carps; nay, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred in half a year. Now the beſt way to take this great enemy of Fiſh is this: Having found his haunt, get three or four ſmall Roches or Daces and having a ſtrong Hook with a Wire to it, draw the Wire juſt withinſide the skin of the fiſh, beginning without ſide of the Gills, and running it to the tail, and then the fiſh will lie five or ſix days alive: For if the fiſh be dead, the Heron will not touch him. Let not your Hook be too rank. Then having a ſtrong Line made of Silk and Wire, about two yards and half long (if you twiſt not Wire with your Silk his ſharp Bill will bite it in two immediately) and tie a round ſtone of about a pound weight to the Line, and lay three or four Hooks, and in two or three nights you ſhall not fail to have him if he comes to your Ponds. Lay not your Hooks in the deep water, where the Heron cannot wade to them; for if you do, they may lie long enough before you ſee any effect of your pains. Colour your Line of a dark green, for a Heron is a very ſubtle bird.</p>

                  <p>THe beſt Fowling-pieces are the long-barrelled [of five and a half or ſix foot] of an indifferent bore [ſomewhat under Harquebuſe] for they hold the beſt charges, and carry the furtheſt level; and ſuch as have Fire-locks.</p>
                  <p>The charge muſt be round hail-ſhot, of bigneſs according to the Game you ſhoot at.</p>
                  <p>As near as you can ſhoot with the wind, and ſideways of, or behind the Fowl: And if poſſible under the ſhelter of ſome hedge, bank, or tree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſometimes (if need be) creeping on your hands and knees. Chuſe rather to ſhoot at a rank or file than a ſingle fowl; and then ſend your Dog for what you have ſtrucken. You muſt have your Dog in ſuch true obedience as not to ſtir from your heels till you bid him go.</p>
                  <p>Where you have no ſhelter uſe a Stalking-horſe, which is any old Jade trained up for that purpoſe; which being ſtript naked, and having nothing but a ſtring about the nether Chap, of two or three yards long, will gently, and as you have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to urge him, walk on the banks of Brooks and Rivers, or Meadows and Moors, or up and down in the water, which way you pleaſe, flodding, and eating on the graſs and weeds that grow therein; and ſo hardy as not to take any affright at the report of your Piece. You ſhall ſhelter your ſelf and your Piece behind his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoulder, bending your body down low by his ſide, and keeping his body ſtill full between you and the Fowl. Then having choſen your mark, take your level from before the forepart of the Horſe, ſhooting as it were between the horſes neck and the water, which is more ſafe than taking the level under the horſes belly, and much leſs to be perceived; the ſhoulder of the horſe covering the body of the man, and his legs alſo the mans legs. Whiles you are ſtalking you may leave your Dog with your Bags, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he may lie cloſe, and never ſtir till you have ſhot, and then upon the leaſt call (but not before) come to you, and fetch forth what you have killed.</p>
                  <p>For want of a live-horſe you may make an artificial ſtalking-horſe of Canvas, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtuft, or hollow, and ſtretcht upon ſplints of wood or ſtrong Wires, with his head bending down, as if he grazed, of due ſhape, ſtature, and bigneſs, painted of the colour of a horſe [the darker the leſs apt to be diſcovered.] Let it be fixt in the middle to a ſtaff with a pick of Iron, to ſtick it in the ground while you ſhoot.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of a horſe you may make and uſe the ſhape of an Oxe, Stag, or any other horned beaſt, painted of the uſual colour of beaſts in that Country, and having the natural horn or head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N.</hi> Theſe Engines are to be employed in thoſe places where the birds are uſed to ſee, and be acquainted with the beaſts they repreſent.</p>

                     <hi>N.</hi> 2. Theſe Engines are fitter for Water than Land, the water hiding their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections.</p>
                  <p>When you have ſo much beaten the fowl with the Stalking horſe that they begin to find your deceit, and will not ſit: Then you may otherwhiles uſe your Oxe-engine, till the Horſe be forgotten, and ſo by change of your Engines make your ſport laſt. The ſhape of a Stag may be uſeful in ſuch places where Stags commonly feed, and are familiar with the Fowl, but they are ſubject to quicker diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>Some ſtalk with dead Engines, as an artificial Tree, Shrub, or Buſh, or a dead Hedge. But theſe are not ſo uſeful for the ſtalk as the ſtand: It being unnatural for dead things to move, and the Fowl will not only apprehend, but eſchew it.

                     </head>
                     <p>THis is of uſe chiefly in Champain Countries, and that from the end of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> till the end of <hi>March</hi> following.</p>
                     <p>About eight of the clock at night, the Air being mild, and the Moon not ſhining, take your Low-bell, of ſuch ſize as a man may well carry it in one hand, having a deep, hollow, and ſad ſound; and with it a Net of ſmall Maſh, at leaſt twenty yards deep, and ſo broad as to cover five or ſix ordinary Lands, or more, according as you have company to carry it: and go into a Stubble-field [a Wheat ſtubble is the beſt.] He that carries the Bell muſt go foremoſt, and toll it as he goeth along as ſolemnly as may be, letting it but now and then knock on both ſides. Then ſhall follow the Net born up at each corner, and on each ſide. Another muſt carry a pan of live coals, but not blazing. At theſe, having pitcht your Nets where you think any Game is, you muſt light bundles of Hay, Straw, or Stubble, or elſe Links and Torches, and with noiſes and poles beat up all the Birds under the Net, that they may riſe, and entangle themſelves in it, and you take them at pleaſure. Which done extinguiſh your Lights, and proceeding to another place, do as before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>N.</hi> The ſound of the <hi>Low-bell</hi> aſtonies the Birds, and makes them lie cloſe; and the blaze of light dazling their eyes affrights them, and cauſes them to riſe and make to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>N.</hi> 2. In this paſtime all muſt be done with great ſilence, no noiſe being heard but the <hi>Low-bell</hi> only, till the Nets be placed, and the Lights blazing, and then you may uſe your pleaſure: Which once extinguiſhed, a general ſilence muſt be again made.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe Trammel is much like the Lowbelling Net, only it may be made ſomewhat longer, but not much broader. This Net, when you come to a fit place, ſpread on the ground, and let the hinder end thereof, being plummed with lead lie looſe on the ground, but the foremoſt end at the two corners be born up by the ſtrength of men, a full yard or more from the ground, and ſo trail the Net along the ground. On each ſide the Net ſome muſt carry great blazing Lights of fire, and by the Lights others muſt march with long Poles, to beat up the Birds as you go, and as they riſe ſo take them. In this ſort you may go over a whole field, or any other champain ground.</p>

                     <head>§. III. <hi>How they take Birds in</hi> Italy <hi>by night with a Light and a Net called</hi> Lanciotoia.</head>
                     <p>THis ſport is moſt uſed in the Champain of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Net is of the Maſh of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Lark-net. It is faſtned to two green ſticks of pliant wood, twice ſo big as ones greateſt finger, and <note n="*" place="margin">About a yard, or yard and half Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</note> two or three [Roman] yards long. Theſe ſticks muſt be faſtned to the end of a ſquare baſton of two yards and half long in two holes, a little diſtant the one from the other, and covered with the ſame Net. [This Baſton ſerves for a handle to carry and mannage the Net with, and may be as well round as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63869:25"/>
ſquare, and then the whole Inſtrument will ſomewhat reſemble a Racket, ſuch as they play at Tennis with.] Theſe two ſticks ſerve to extend the Net at top to about four yards breadth. This Net the Fowler carries on his ſhoulder, holding the handle of it in one hand, and a Lanthorn called <hi>Frugnuolo,</hi> with a Lamp burning in it in the other; and when by the light he diſcovers any Bird within his reach, he claps his Net upon it, and covers it. Beſides the Lanthorn the Fowler carries a Bell either at his Girdle, or his Knee, (like our Low-bell) the better to ſecure the birds to himſelf. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe cannot be uſed at all times, but only in Autumn or Winter, not beginning before one hour of the night. Whether the weather be cloudy or clear it is all one, ſo the Moon ſhine not.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Frugnuolo</hi> is a ſort of Lanthorn made of Latten (commonly, but falſly, called Tin) all cloſe but the fore-ſide. Its Baſe about a <hi>Roman</hi> Palm and half long, and at the aperture about a Palm broad, or a little more; likewiſe a Palm high: The Cover (which goes ſhelving) two Palms long: In the midſt thereof above is a handle, and within ſide a thin plate of Iron three fingers diſtant from the beginning of the Cover, to preſerve the Tin from being burnt and marred by the flame of the Lamp. Below is another empty handle to put in a ſtick to hold it up on high. Within, in a Circle made on purpoſe in the bottom, is put an earthen Lamp with a great Week, and Oyl. With this kind of Lamp they alſo ſearch buſhes, hedges, and low trees, where they think Thruſhes and other Birds pearch, and having diſcovered them, ſtrike them down with an Inſtrument called <hi>Ramata,</hi> made like a Racket with a long handle, or if they be out of reach of that, ſhoot them with a Croſs-bow.</p>

                     <p>BAt-fowling is a taking by night of great and ſmall Birds, that reſt not on the ground, but pearch on ſhrubs; buſhes, trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is proper to woody and rough Countries.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, one muſt carry a Veſſel with fire (as in Low-belling) then others muſt have Poles bound with dry Wiſps of Hay, Straw, pieces of Links, pitcht Hurds, or any other combuſtible matter that will make a blaze. Others muſt bear long Poles with rough and buſhy tops. When you are come to the Birds haunts, kindle ſome of your fires, and with your Poles beat the buſhes and trees: Which done the Birds (if any be) will riſe, and fly to, and play about the Lights: It being their nature not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them, but almoſt ſcorch their Wings in the ſame, ſo that they who have the buſhy Poles may at their pleaſure ſtrike them down and take them.</p>
                     <p>Others carry with them a great Lime-buſh made of the head of a Birch or Willow Tree, and pitching it down make their blazes cloſe by it; and the birds will come and light upon it, and ſo be entangled.</p>
                     <p>In this Sport you muſt obſerve the directions given in Low-belling as to the choice of the night, and eſpecially keeping ſilence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>THE Crow-net is the ſame in all reſpects with that deſcribed <hi>Chap.</hi> I. This Net may be placed near any Barn-door where Corn is winnowed, or in a Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtubble, or on the Greenſword in the Morning and Evening haunts of any Birds where they gather Worms. Where-ever placed it muſt be carefully hid and concealed, as much as may be, from the view of the Birds, as if near a Barn-door by caſting Chaff upon it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Obſerve alſo, firſt to have ſome Covert to hide your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in, where you may ſee, and not be ſeen.

                     <head>§. II. <hi>Of taking Birds with Day-nets.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE time of the Year for theſe Nets is from <hi>Auguſt</hi> till <hi>November:</hi> Of the Day a little before Sun-riſe, ſo as your Nets may be laid, and all your Implements in readineſs to begin your work by peep of Sun. The milder the Air, and the clearer and brighter the Morning, the fitter is the ſeaſon for this exerciſe. The beſt place is in Champain Countries, remote from any Town, Village, or common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people, on ſhort Barley ſtubbles, ſmooth green Layes, or level Meadows; if the place be not naturally even and plain where you pitch your Nets, you muſt make it ſo: That both lying and falling over they may couch ſo cloſe to the ground that the ſhorteſt graſs or ſtubble appearing through them, they may as it were lie hid and unperceived by the Birds, and that being covered they may not creep or flicker from under them.</p>
                     <p>Let your Nets be made of very fine Packthread, knit ſure, the Maſh not above an Inch ſquare. Let them be about three fathoms long, and not above one deep, verged on each ſide with ſtrong ſmall Cords, the ends extended upon two ſmall Poles as long as the Net is broad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all things like the Net deſcribed §. I. ſave that that was to be but one ſingle Net, but here you muſt have two exactly of the ſame ſize and faſhion, and placed at that diſtance, that when they are drawn the ſides may juſt meet and touch one another. Your Nets being ſtaked down with ſtrong ſtakes, ſo that with any nimble twitch you may caſt them to and fro at pleaſure; ſome twenty or thirty paces from the Nets place your Giggs on the tops of long Poles, turned into the wind, ſo as they may play and make a noiſe therein. Theſe Giggs are made of long Gooſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers in the manner of Shuttle-cocks, and with little turnels of wood running in broad and flat Swan-quills, made round like a ſmall hoop, and ſo with longer ſtrings faſtned to the Pole, will with any ſmall wind twirl and flicker in the Air after ſuch a wanton manner that the Birds will come in great flocks to wonder and play about the ſame. After the placing of your Giggs, you ſhall then place your Stale, which is a ſmall ſtake of wood to prick down faſt in the earth, having in it a Morteiſe hole, in which a long ſlender piece of wood, of about two foot, is ſo faſtned that it may move up and down at pleaſure, and to this longer ſtick you ſhall faſten a ſmall Line, which running through a hole in the ſtake aforeſaid, and ſo coming up to the place where you ſit, you may by drawing the Line up and down to you (with your right hand) raiſe and mount the longer ſtick from the ground, as oft as you ſhall find oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                     <p>Now to this longer ſtick you ſhall faſten a live Lark, or Bunting, (for you muſt be ſure ever to preſerve ſome alive for that purpoſe) or for want of ſuch, any other ſmall Bird, which the Line making to flicker up and down by your pulling, will entice the Larks to play about it, and ſwoop ſo near the ground, that drawing your hand, you may cover them with your Nets at pleaſure: Alſo it will entice Hawks and any other Birds of prey to ſtoop and ſtrike at the ſame, ſo as you may with eaſe take them.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another Stale, called the Looking-glaſs; and this is a round ſtake of wood as big as a mans Arm, and made very ſharp at the nether end, ſo as you may thruſt and faſten it into the earth at your pleaſure. This Stake is made very hollow in the upper part, above five fingers deep at the leaſt; into this hollowneſs is placed a three-ſquare piece of wood, about twelve Inches long, and each ſquare two Inches broad, lying upon the top of the Stake, and going with a foot into the hollowneſs, which foot muſt have a great knob at the top, and another at the bottom, with a deep ſlenderneſs between them, to which ſlenderneſs muſt be faſtned a ſmall Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thread, which running through a hole in the ſide of the Stake, muſt come up to the ſeat where you ſit. Now the three-ſquare piece of wood, which lies on the top of the Stake, muſt be made of ſuch a true poiſe and evenneſs, and the foot in the Socket ſo round and ſmooth, that upon the leaſt touch it will twirl and turn round like a Scoperil, winding the Packthread ſo many times about it, which being ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly drawn, and as ſuddenly let go again, will keep the Engine in a perpetual round motion, like a Childs Mill, made of a Nut, a ſtick, and an Apple. This done, you ſhall with Glue or other ſtrong Cement faſten upon the uppermoſt ſquares of the three-ſquare piece about twenty ſmall pieces of Looking-glaſs, and paint all the ſpare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63869:26"/>
between them of a very bright red colour, which in the continual motion and turning about will give ſuch a glorious reflection, that the wanton Birds cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, but will play about it with admiration till they be taken.</p>
                     <p>Now both theſe Stales are to be placed in the very midſt between the two Nets, and about two or three foot diſtant one from another, ſo that in the falling of the Nets the Cords may by no means touch or annoy them. Neither muſt they ſtand one before or after another, but in a direct Line one over againſt another, the glaſs being kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually moving, and the Bird very oft flickering. When you have thus placed your nets, Giggs, and Stales, you ſhall then go to the further end of your long drawing Lines, and Stale-lines, and having a little Haſſock made of Sedge, about a foot or better high, you ſhall place it within a yard or little more of the end of the ſame: And then ſitting down upon the Haſſock lay the main drawing Line (with a ſtrong button of wood made faſt in the ſame) upon your thigh, and with your right hand continually draw the graſs-Line, and with your left the Stale-line, and when you ſhall perceive the Larks or other birds to play near and about your Nets and Stales, ſwooping near and to the ground, you ſhall then with both hands pull the Net over, and cover and take your prey. If the weather be good be not too haſty to pluck at a ſingle bird, but ſtay till you ſee many playing about your Nets.</p>
                     <p>Behind the Seat you ſit on lay your ſpare Inſtruments and Implements which you are to uſe about the whole Work, as Spare-ſtakes, Poles, Lines, Packthread, Knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-pin and Needle, your Bag with Stales, a Mallet to knock in your Stakes with, and a nimble little Hatchet to make new Stakes with, or ſharpen them,</p>

Having obſerved (ſaith he) where thoſe birds haunt moſt, provide your Nets ſix paces long, and eight Roman Palms deep, of a ſmall Maſh, having their drawing Line of fifteen paces, Moreover, you muſt get a Cage of five Palms high, with a middle floor; in the upper Story whereof you ſhall put about one hundred live Stares, and in the lower others which are to ſerve for Stales. Thoſe in the upper room are to call the wild Stares; and they muſt have their meat put all in one Veſſel, and their water in one Cup, and that ſo ſtrait, that they can drink but one at a time; likewiſe the day before they are to be uſed they ſhould have no meat of two hours before night, that ſo being hungry, and ſtriving to get to the meat and drink, they may make the greater ſcreaming noiſe and cry. The live Stales (four in number) muſt be tied by the tails, each with a ſtring, and by that ſtring faſtned one by one to a couple of ſticks joyned together acroſs between the Nets, to which croſs a Cord is faſtned that reaches to the Fowler, by the plucking whereof he may at pleaſure move the Stales. In this manner of fowling are alſo to be uſed about twenty or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five Jackdaws, or ſuch like birds-caſes ſtuft, and ſet out like live birds, and theſe placed in order between the Nets for dead-ſtales, the four live-ſtales being next the Fowlers Cabbin. Let the dead ſtales be placed with their heads to the wind, that it do not ruffle and diſcompoſe their feathers.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Author gives us alſo an account of the manner how they take <hi>Lapwings</hi> with the Day-nets.</p>
                     <p>The Nets for this uſe are to be of ten paces length, of a large Maſh, having a drawing Line fifteen paces long. Between the Nets are to be placed fifteen or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dead Stales, that is <hi>Lapwings</hi> dried, or the Caſes of <hi>Lapwings</hi> ſtuft, and ſet out as if they were alive: And beſides thoſe two live-ſtales, which muſt be uſed and ſet as the <hi>Starling-</hi>ſtales, and have meat given them to eat.

                     <p>THeſe Nets are about four [Roman] yards deep, or a little more, of the ſame Maſh with the ordinary Day-nets, ſtrung on the upper ſide on a Cord, upon which they run with a row of little Rings, whereby they may be drawn out, or run up together as one pleaſes. Theſe Nets are ſupported by two or three Stakes, or more, according to the wideneſs of the place where they are ſet. They are to be put in order two hours before Sun-ſet, for the Evening-driving; and for the Morning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driving, before break of day; in ſtubble-fields. About Musket-ſhot from the Nets two men on foot holding a rope of twenty or twenty five yards long, one at one end, the other at the other, muſt begin and walk towards the Nets, drawing the Rope over the ſtubble, and ſo raiſing the Larks that lie ſcattered up and down the field: the which will not take wing, but run forward before the rope, till at laſt they come within the Nets, which being not ſtretcht out ſtreight, but eaſily running up, the more they ſtruggle and fly about, the more they are entangled.</p>

                     <head>§. IV. <hi>How the Italians take ſmall Birds with a Net called</hi> Ragna.</head>
                     <p>THe place for uſing theſe Nets is a Grove, (called from the Nets <hi>Ragnaia)</hi> which ought to be remote from high ways, and defended from the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind; which is very diſagreeable and diſtaſteful to the Birds, eſpecially <hi>Thruſhes</hi> and <hi>Beccafigos,</hi> beſides the danger of the Woods being wholly or in part blaſted by it. Wherefore it ſhould be ſituate inſome Valley, or on the ſide of a little Hill expoſed to the South. Through it, or beſide it ſhould run ſome River, Brook, or other ſtream of water iſſuing from a quick Spring, that fails not in Summer. If it be ſo ſituate as to be encompaſſed on all ſides with cultivated fields, in which grow ſome ſcattering Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, it will be the better. This Grove is wont to be made ſix, eight, ten, or twelve times ſo long as it is broad, according as the place will permit: In it long-ways muſt be drawn three, five, or ſeven walks, as it is broader or narrower. In caſe it hath not a natural fence or hedge you muſt make an artificial one, which muſt be tall and thick to keep beaſts out, and birds in, and even on the top.</p>
                     <p>The Grove within muſt be planted with Juniper, Bays, Maſtic-tree, Lime-trees, Oaks, Elms, and many other trees but eſpecially Fig-trees. At the roots of ſuch trees as caſt their leaves plant Vines. Many other inſtructions and directions he hath about the Plantation, which who ſo pleaſes may ſee in him.</p>
                     <p>The Nets are exactly like thoſe deſcribed, Section I. <hi>Chap.</hi> I. §. II. only the Maſh ſomewhat leſs, they being for ſmall birds. The two out-ſide Nets or falſe Nets along their upper edge muſt have Iron or Horn-rings, and by them be put upon a ſtrong Cord. The middle or true Net muſt alſo be verged with a Cord. Theſe Nets, one, two, or more of them, muſt be placed in the middle of the Grove, and croſſing it; faſtned by the top-cords to two great Poles or Pillars, made with winding ſteps round to mount up them; and on their tops having little rundles to draw the Lines nimbly, and ſtretch out the Nets. The bottom of the Nets, or that ſide next the ground muſt have many ſtrings hanging down from it, two or three Palms diſtant one from another, which are to be tied down to certain Pegs faſtned in the earth. The middle Net, which muſt be the deeper, will fall down ſufficiently in a lump or furl between the two ſide-ones, therefore with a Cane you muſt draw it gently through the Maſhes of the falſe Nets, eſpecially about the middle of the Nets, making in each Maſh a kind of purſe or pouch, that when any Bird ſtrikes againſt it, it may more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run through the Maſhes of the falſe net, and ſo catch the Bird as it were in a Bag.</p>
                     <p>The time for catching is either in the Morning early, before the Birds are gone out to feed, or at Even when they come to rooſt. At each end of the Grove in every walk one perſon muſt march forward toward the Net, making a noiſe as he goes with a Cane or Saff, and throwing ſtones or clods of earth, if it be for <hi>Beccafigos:</hi> But if it be for <hi>Thruſhes,</hi> at firſt he muſt walk quietly and leiſurely, without making much noiſe; and as he comes nearer the Nets, ſo make greater haſt and more noiſe. Whence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63869:27"/>
it is wont to be ſaid: <hi>For Thruſhes a wiſe man, and for Beccaſigos, a fool or mad man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To hinder the Birds from mounting and flying away, ſome are wont to turn off a Sparhawk, or other little Hawk with Bells at her heels to ſoar aloft and hover over the Grove. Others are wont to do the ſame only with a pair of wings, and a Bell on the top of a Pole. When you ſee no more birds ſtirring, looſening the top-cords let down and furl up your Nets, with the birds in them; and either carry them home in the Net, or take them out at pleaſure.</p>

The form of this Net you may ſee expreſſed in which AFB repreſents the longer croſs-ſtaff, whoſe direct piece muſt be of the bigneſs of a handſom Hawks Pole; its tranſverſe piece AB like the head of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary hay-rake, but bigger and longer: CED the ſhorter croſs-ſtaff, joyned to the longer at E, ſo looſely as to fall to and fro at pleaſure, of ſuch due height and length, that when the croſs pieces meet they may joyn even and juſt. CAEBD is a Purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, faſtned to both croſs-ſtaves all along, and having that liberty at top, that the croſs-ſtaves may fall and part one from another at a pretty diſtance; its bottom being faſtned to the longer ſtaff at E. CAE, DBE are two ſmall cords faſtned to the two ends of the ſhorter croſs-ſtaff, and paſſing through two holes in the ends of the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger croſs-ſtaff, tied together at E, at ſuch diſtance that the ſhorter ſtaff may fall from the longer as far as you ſee meet, or the wideneſs of the Net will give leave. To the knot of the two Cords muſt be made faſt a ſingle Cord EG, which you muſt carry in your right hand, that you may at pleaſure draw the croſs-ſtaves cloſe together, and let them open as need ſhall require.</p>
                     <p>This Net is to be uſed late in the Evening, or early in the Morning, by ſetting it againſt the Eves of thatcht Houſes, Stacks, Hovels, Barns, Stables, Dove-coats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and being ſo ſet knocking and thruſting the croſs-ſtaves cloſe againſt the ſame, making ſuch a noiſe as may inforce the Birds to fly out of their holes or haunts into the Net; and then preſently drawing the Line EG, and ſo ſhutting up the croſs-ſtaves encloſe them, and letting down your Net, open it, and take them out.</p>
                     <p>The chief benefit of taking Birds in this manner is for the mewing of Hawks, or getting into luſt and ſtrength ſick and weak Hawks: Becauſe with this Engine you may take Evening and Morning ſo many birds as you pleaſe, and give them warm to your Hawk, which is the greateſt nouriſhment that can be, raiſing a Hawk ſoon, and making her mew faſt.</p>

                     <head>§. I. <hi>Of taking ſmall Birds with the Lime-buſh, and Lime-twigs.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>YOur Lime-buſh muſt be a main bough of any buſhy tree, as Birch or Willow, or for want of them, Sallow, Poplar, or Aſpen; whoſe twigs are long, ſmooth, and ſtreight, without pricks, knots, or any other roughneſs or crookedneſs; having pickt and trim'd it (yet not taking away any of the little bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knots) lime every twig and branch from the top down within four fingers or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about of the bottom. The body and main branches muſt not be touched with any Lime at all. Dabble not on your Lime too thick, nor yet let any part be left bare, or want its proportion, that ought to be limed.</p>
                     <p>Your Buſh thus prepared, carry it forth into the fields where the haunts of the ſmall birds are, and place it as near as you can to any of theſe haunts, if it be a hedge
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63869:27"/>
or tree cloſe to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> provided that where-ever you pitch it down, you may very near it have ſome cloſe Covert to lie concealed in, and there chirp like a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or call with a note like the Linnet or Bull-finch [as the Cocks uſe to do when they miſs the Hens, or the Hens the Cocks] altering your note according to your fancy, but continually calling in one note or other. This Art and Ability is gotten by diligent obſerving the Birds notes abroad, and by practice. But if you cannot frame your mouth to theſe ſounds, get you a Bird-call; and having learnt how to uſe it Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially, you ſhall ſit in your Covert, and call the Birds to you: And when you ſee any of them light upon your Buſh let them alone, and move not till you ſee them ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entangled, which their own skipping up and down, and ſtrugling when they find themſelves ſnared, will do better than any affright from you whatſoever: Neither ſhall you ſtir for a ſingle Bird or two, but ſtay till many be entangled: For the firſt that are taken will with their ſtriving and fluttering in the buſh be as good as Stales; and make a world of others repair to them, which you may then take: And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe you may continue from before Sun-riſe till ten of of the Clock in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and from one in the Afternoon till almoſt Sun-ſet in the Evening.</p>
                     <p>If you want a Call you may make uſe of a Stale; as of a Bat or two, placed next to your Lime-buſh in ſuch apparent manner that no bird thereabouts but may behold them; which will no ſooner be perceived, but every bird will come to gaze and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at them: Then having no other convenient lighting place but the Lime-buſh, they will flock as thick into the ſame as may be, and ſo you may take them at pleaſure. So the Owl may in like manner be employed, which by reaſon ſhe is more melancholy and leſs ſtirring than the Bat, and alſo of greater bulk, and ſooner perceived, is a better Stale than the Bat. For want of a live Owl or Bat the skin of either ſtuft, or an artificial Owl made of wood and painted may ſerve the turn.</p>
                     <p>Others take theſe ſmall birds with Lime-twigs only, by riſing early in the Morning before break of day, and going to the haunts, and there watching when the Birds go forth to ſeek their food (which is ever at the ſpring of the day) and then finding that they have forſaken the hedges, they place their Lime-twigs all along thoſe hedges, ſome upright, ſome ſlope-wiſe, and ſome acroſs; and withal ſo thick, that the Birds can come no way into the hedge, but of force they muſt be entangled. This done they go into the Corn-fields, Meadows, or Grounds adjoyning, where the Birds feed, and there beating them up and ſcaring them, make them retire to the hedges in great flocks, where they are preſently entangled among the Lime-twigs, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in abundance. But this manner of taking is only for the Spring and Fall of the Leaf; and only for one certain time of the day, <hi>viz.</hi> an hour before and after Sun-riſe.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THis is beſt done in a Snow. When you ſee the Birds flock together about your houſe or fields; chuſe out one hundred large Wheat-ears; cut the ſtraw about a foot long beſides the ears; From the bottom of the Ears to the middle lime the ſtraw for about ſix or ſeven Inches; let your Lime be warm, that ſo it may run thin upon the ſtraw, and be leſs diſcernable to the Birds. Go then to the place, and carry a little bag of Chaff and threſhed Ears, and ſcatter theſe fourteen or fifteen yards wide. Then take the limed Ears, and ſtick them up and down in the Snow, with the Ears leaning, or with the end touching the ground. Then retire from the place, and drive the Birds from any other haunt, and you will ſee preſently great flocks repair thither, and begin to peck the Ears of Corn, and fly away with them, which as ſoon as any of them ſhall do, the ſtraw that is limed laps under his Wing, and down he falls, not perceiving himſelf to be entangled: For I have ſeen many eat their Ears when they have been faſt limed under the Wing. In the field you will take moſt Larks. For Sparrows ſtick your Ears upon the houſe-tops, though you never get the Birds. Every dozen of Sparrows you take in Winter ſhall ſave you a quarter of Wheat before Harveſt.</p>
                     <p>Take away all your limed Ears, and in the Afternoon bait the place with a bag or two more of Ears and Chaff, and let them reſt till Morning, that the birds may feed boldly, and not be affrighted; then take ſome freſh Ears, and ſtick them up as you did before.</p>

Let this bough be ſet near where they come in a morning to feed, (for they keep a conſtant place till their food is gone) that ſo flying near they may eſpy the top-bird: which as ſoon as they do, they will fall down in whole flocks to him.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of taking Birds with Baits.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis way is not for taking birds to eat, but for deſtroying noiſom and ravenous Fowl, as Crows, Ravens, Kites, Buzzards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the effecting whereof, 1. Obſerve their haunts. 2. Remember the hours or times of day when they are moſt ſharp-ſet and greedy, as early in the Morning, ſo ſoon as they unpearch themſelves; and again at Even a little before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, eſpecially at that time of the year when they have young ones; for then they will with greedineſs ſeize any bait, as faſt as you caſt it out. 3. Take a pretty quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Nux Vomica,</hi> and diſſolve it in Wine Vinegar, or Wine-Lees, [thoſe of ſweet Wine are the beſt.] Then take the garbage of any Fowl, and all-beſmear them over with your Solution of <hi>Nux Vomica,</hi> and caſt them forth where ſuch noiſom birds haunt: and watching the birds in a convenient place, you ſhall ſee that after ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a bit or two, any ſuch Fowl will preſently grow dizzy, reeling and tumbling up and down, till at laſt it fall into a dead ſwoon.</p>
                  <p>Others take pretty big gobbets of raw lean fleſh, as Beef, Mutton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king therein ſecret little holes, put in them ſmall pieces of <hi>Nux Vomica,</hi> and cloſe them up again.</p>
                  <p>You may alſo inſtead of either make uſe of Carrion, and either ſmear it with your Confection, or ſtop into the fleſhy part of it ſmall pieces of <hi>Nux Vomica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is beſt to let theſe baits lie looſe, and not faſten them to the ground, as ſome practiſe.</p>
                  <p>To take granivorous birds of the greater kind, as Doves, Rooks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> boil good ſtore of <hi>Nux Vomica</hi> together with Wheat, Barley, Peaſe, or any other Pulſe very well in ordinary running water, till the Grain be ready to burſt, then take it from the fire, and cover it till it be throughly cold. The Grain thus boiled and ſteept ſcatter thick where theſe Fowl frequent, and it will have the like effect upon them, as the Garbage or Carrion had upon the carnivorous.</p>
                  <p>For ſmall birds boil your <hi>Nux Vomica</hi> with ſuch ſeeds as they moſt delight in, <hi>viz.</hi> Hemp-ſeed, Rape-ſeed, Lin-ſeed, and above all Muſtard-ſeed; and they will be in like manner entoxicated.</p>
                  <p>Some inſtead of <hi>Nux Vomica</hi> take only the Lees of Wine (which the ſharper they are, the better) and in them boil and ſteep, or only ſteep (which is as availeable if continued a ſufficient while) their Grain or Seeds, and ſcatter them as above di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
                  <p>Others take the juyce of Hemlock, and ſteep in it their Grain or Seeds, mixing therewith a pretty ſprinkling of Henbane and Poppy ſeeds, letting all ſtand in ſteep two or three days at leaſt, and then drain it, and ſcatter it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which will have the like effect with the <hi>Nux Vomica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To recover any Fowl of theſe baits, take a little quantity of Sallet-oyl (according to the ſtrength and bigneſs of the Fowl) and drop it down its throat; then chafe the head well with Vinegar, and the Fowl will preſently recover again, and be as healthful and able as ever it was.</p>

                     <head>§. 4. <hi>How to take Partridges and other Birds with a Setting-dog.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>A Setting-dog ſhould be a luſty Land-Spaniel, that will range well, and yet at ſuch abſolute command, that when he is in his full career one hem of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhall make him ſtand ſtill, gaze about him, and look in his Maſters face, as it were expecting directions from him, whether to proceed, ſtand ſtill, or retire: but the main thing he is to be taught is, when he ſees and is near his Prey of a ſudden to ſtand ſtill, or fall down flat on his belly, without making any noiſe or motion till his Maſter come to him.</p>
                     <p>For taking <hi>Partridge</hi> with him; when you come into the fields where Partridges frequent, caſt off your Dog, and let him range or hunt, taking care that he range not too far from you, but beat his ground juſtly and even, without caſting about and flying now here and now there, and skipping many places (which the mettle of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny even good dogs will make them apt to do.) If he do ſo, call him in with a hem, and threaten him with a ſtern countenance; and when he doth well encourage him. When you ſee him make a ſudden ſtop or ſtand ſtill, be ſure he hath ſet the Fowl; therefore preſently make in to him, and bid him go nearer; if he refuſes, but either lies ſtill or ſtands ſhaking of his tail, and withal now and then looks back upon you, he is near enough: Then begin your range or circumference about both the Dog and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, not ceaſing, but walking about with a good round pace, looking ſtill before the Dogs noſe, to ſee how the Covey lies, whether cloſe together in a heap, or ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering. Then charging the Dog to lie ſtill, draw forth your Net, and opening of it, take you one end of the top-cord, and your Companion the other, and holding it ſtretcht, run with the Net againſt the Dog, and clap it down over the Birds, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dog and all with it: then make a noiſe to ſpring the Partridge, that they may riſe, and be entangled in the Net: Some obſerve to run with their Net againſt the wind, to keep it fully extended. One man may make a ſhift to do all: But then he muſt peg down one end of his Net to the ground, and taking the other end ſpread it over the Birds.</p>
                     <p>The Italians (as <hi>Olina</hi> tells us) are wont to purge their Dog before they go a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with him: giving him a morſel made up of half an ounce of <hi>Agarick,</hi> and two drachms of <hi>Sal gemmae,</hi> mingled with honey of Roſes, covered over with Butter, or ſome other unctuous matter, that he may the more readily ſwallow it: And the day following a broth made of a Weathers head, boild ſo, as with the fleſh of it, bread, and a little Brimſton pounded, to make a ſup. He bids you alſo obſerve, 1. Not to hunt your Dog (eſpecially after he hath been new purged) till the Sun hath dried up the dew; becauſe elſe he will be apt to loſe the ſent, and alſo hurt his feet. 2. To begin to ſet on your Dog under the wind, that he may take the ſent the better. The Net (he ſaith) ought to be a little longer than it is broad or deep; <hi>viz.</hi> between ſeven and eight yards over, and between eight and nine deep.</p>
                     <p>In this manner may be taken, not only Partridges, but Pheaſants, Moor-pouts and Quails.</p>

                     <head>§. I. <hi>Of the haunts of Partridges, and how to find Partridges.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THe haunts wherein Partridges moſt delight, and moſt conſtantly abide, are Corn-fields, eſpecially during the time the Corn is ſtanding, under the Covert whereof they meet and breed. After the Corn is cut down they ſtill remain in the Stubbles, eſpecially Wheat-Stubbles, both becauſe they love to feed on that grain before all others, and alſo for the height of the Stubble, which affords them ſafer co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert. When the Wheat-ſtubble is either too ſcanty, or too much ſoyled and trodden with Men and Cattel, they leave it and go to the Barley-ſtubbles, which though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in both reſpects, yet being freſh, and not ſo uſually trodden and beaten, they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63869:29"/>
take great delight therein. In Winter when theſe ſtubbles are either plowed up, or over-ſoyled with Cattel, manure, or the like, then they reſort to the encloſed grounds, or upland-Meadows, and lodge in the dead graſs or fog, under hedges, among Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills, and under banks, or at the roots of trees. You may alſo find haunts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges in ſmall Coppices or Underwoods, in Buſhy Cloſes, or where there grows Broom, Brakes, Furze, or Ling, or any other Covert: Provided always, that there be ſome Corn-fields adjoyning, elſe they will rather avoid ſuch places. In Harveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time when they can have no quiet lodging in the Corn-fields, you may find them in the day-time in the Fallows adjoyning, where they will lie lurking among the great clods and weeds; and only early in the Morning, and late at Evening fetch their food from the corn-ſheaves next adjoyning.</p>
                     <p>Now for finding them, ſome will do it by the eye, like hare-finders, <hi>viz.</hi> In taking their ranges over the ſtubble fields, or other haunts, caſting their eyes on each hand, they will eſpy them out though never ſo cloſe couched; which ability partly depends upon the goodneſs of the eye, partly is acquired by practice and exerciſe, by diligently obſerving the true colour of the Partridge, how it differeth from the ground, and alſo the manner of their lying. This is the eaſier done, becauſe when you have once (as you think) apprehended them with your eye, you may walk nearer and nearer till you are abſolutely ſure you ſee them, provided you be ever moving, and ſtand not ſtill or gaze at them (for that they will not abide) elſe they are ſoſlothful and unwilling to take wing, that till you be ready to ſet your foot upon them, they will not ſtir.</p>
                     <p>Others find them by the haunts and places where they laſt coucht: which they know partly by their dung there left, which if new will be ſoft, and the white part of it colour their fingers; and partly by their padlings or treadings, which if new will be ſoft and dirty, and the earth new broken of a darker colour than the mould about it; and being very new indeed, the place where they ſate will be warm, and the ground ſmooth and flat with ſome ſmall feathers or down ſcattered upon it. If you find ſuch a haunt, you may be confident the birds are not far off. Therefore look carefully about you, eſpecially down the Lands, walking leiſurely; and in a ſhort time you will eſpy them: which as ſoon as you do, you ſhall preſently wind off from them, and by no means look towards them, and ſo fetch a large circumference round about them, keeping an ordinary round march, making your compaſs leſs and leſs, till you have diſcovered the whole Covey.</p>
                     <p>Others find them by going early in the Morning, or at the cloſe of the Even, (which are called <hi>Juking</hi> times) into their haunts, and there liſtning for the calling of the Cock-Partridge, which will be very loud and earneſt, to which after ſome few calls the Hen will make anſwer; which as ſoon as they hear they liſten till they meet, which they ſhall very well perceive by their chattering and rejoycing one with another. Then they take their range about them, drawing nearer and nearer as before, till they diſcover the whole Covey.</p>
                     <p>But the beſt, ſafeſt, eaſieſt, and moſt pleaſant way of finding them is by the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge-</hi>call. Having learnt the true and natural notes of the <hi>Partridge,</hi> and being able to tune every note in its proper key, and knowing the due times and ſeaſons for every note, ſo as fitly to accommodate them, go forth either Morning or Evening to their haunts, and having conveyed your ſelf into ſome cloſe place, ſo as to ſee and not be ſeen, liſten a while if you can hear the <hi>Partridge</hi> call. If you do, anſwer them again in the ſame note, and ever as they change, or double, or treble their note, ſo ſhall you likewiſe, plying ſtill your Call till you find them draw near to you. For this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is ſo natural and delightful to them that they will purſue it as far as they can hear it. Having drawn them within your view, caſt your ſelf flat upon your back, and lie without moving as if you were dead, and you ſhall then ſee them running and pecking about you without any fear, ſo as you may take a full view of them, and if you pleaſe count their number.</p>

Then having covered your face with ſome hood of green or dark blew ſtuff, ſtalk with your Horſe or Engine toward the Birds by gentle and ſlow ſteps, and ſo raiſe them, and drive them before you (for it is their nature to run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Horſe or Beaſt out of fear leſt it tread on them.)

                     <head>§. I. <hi>With Nets.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>PHeaſants delight moſt in thick, young, well-grown Coppice Woods, unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented and free from the footſteps and tracings of Men and Cattel: not in tall high woods of timber-trees.</p>
                     <p>Having found their haunts and breeding places, you may find their Eye or brood ſeveral ways: as firſt, by the eye, ſearching up and down the haunts, and buſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, By coming early in the Morning, or late in the Evening, and obſerving the old Cock and Hens calling, and the young birds anſwering them, and by that ſound guiding your ſelf, till you come as near as you can to the place where they meet, lying down there ſo cloſe that you may not be diſcerned, and yet may exactly obſerve where they lodge, and accordingly where and in what manner to pitch your Nets. Thirdly, Which is the moſt ſure and eaſie way, by an exact and natural Pheaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: wherewith you muſt learn to imitate all the Pheaſants ſeveral notes and tunes, applying each to the right time and purpoſe, when and for which ſhe uſes it, whether it be to cluck the young ones together to brood them, to call them to meat when ſhe hath found it, to chide them for ſtragling, to call them together to rejoyce and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton about her, for all which ſhe hath a ſeveral note. The moſt convenient hours for the uſe of the Call are before or about Sun-riſing, and ſomewhat before Sun-ſet, at which times they ſtraggle abroad to ſeek their food, and then your note is to call them to their food, or give them liberty to range. But if you will call them after Sun-riſe or before Sun-ſet, your notes muſt be to cluck them together to brood, as alſo to chide them for ſtragling, and put them in fear of danger. The notes of rejoycing or playing are rather for finding the old Couples when they are ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>Being come to the haunts you ſhall lodge your ſelf in the moſt likely place for your purpoſe, as cloſe as poſſible, and then begin to call, firſt in a very low note, (leſt the Pheaſants be lodg'd near you, and then a ſudden loud note may affright them) but if nothing reply, raiſe your note by degrees to the higheſt pitch, yet by no means over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining it, or making it ſpeak untunably; and if there be a Pheaſant in the Wood within hearing of it ſhe will preſently anſwer, and that in your own note and key. If this call back be but from one ſingle bird, and come from far, then you ſhall as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly as you can creep nearer to it, ſtill plying your call; and you ſhall find that the Pheaſant that anſwereth will alſo come nearer to you. The nearer you come, the lower obſerve to make your Call ſpeak, as the Pheaſant her ſelf will do, and her in all points you muſt imitate as near as you can; and in the end you will get a ſight of her, either on the ground, or on the boughs of ſome low tree, as it were prying to find you: Then ceaſing your Call a while, ſpread your Net as ſecretly and ſpeedily as may be, in the convenienteſt place between you and the Pheaſant, upon the loweſt ſhrubs and buſhes, making one end faſt to the ground, and holding the other end by a long Line in your hand, by which when any thing ſtraineth it you may draw the Net cloſe together, or at leaſt into a hollow compaſs. Which done, you ſhall call again; and then as ſoon as you ſhall perceive the Pheaſant to come juſt under your Net, you ſhall riſe and ſhew your ſelf, that by giving him an affright, he may offer to mount, and ſo be entangled in your Net.</p>
                     <p>If many anſwer your Call from ſeveral quarters of the Wood, ſtir not at all, but ply your Call, and as they come nearer to you, ſpread your Nets in the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient places round about you; and when they are come under the Nets, boldly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your ſelf, to give the affright, and make them mount.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IT is only Pheaſant-Pouts that can be thus taken. Having found the eye of Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants by any the forementioned means, you muſt then (taking the wind with you, for they will naturally run down the wind.) In the little pads and ways, which you ſee they have made, (for they will make little tracks almoſt like ſheeps tracks) and as near as you can to ſome ſpecial haunt of theirs, (which you ſhall know by the barrenneſs of the ground, mutings, and looſe feathers you ſhall find there) place your Nets hollow, looſe and circular wiſe, their nether part being faſtned to the ground, and upper lying hollow, looſe, and bending, ſo that when any thing ruſheth to it, it may fall and entangle it. Which done, you muſt go where before you found the haunt, and there with your Call, if the Eye be ſcattered, call them together; then taking your Inſtrument called a <hi>Driver,</hi> made of good ſtrong white Wands or Oſiers, ſet faſt in a handle, and in two or three places bound with croſs Wands; of the ſhape of thoſe Wand-dreſſers (which Cloth-workers uſe in dreſſing of Cloth) therewith make a gentle noiſe upon the boughs and buſhes, which the Pouts hearing will preſently run on a heap together from it a little way, and then ſtand ſtill and liſten. Give then another rack or two, at which they will run again as before, and thus by racking and ſtriking you may drive them like ſo many ſheep which way you pleaſe, (croſſing them, and racking as it were in their faces, if they chance to go a wrong way) till you have brought them all into your Nets.</p>
                     <p>In this driving be ſure, 1. To conceal your ſelf from the ſight of the Pheaſants, For if they perceive you, they will inſtantly ſcatter and run one from another, and hide themſelves in holes, and bottoms of buſhes, and not ſtir from thence upon any occaſion as long as any day endureth. And therefore it were not amiſs to wear over your face a green hood, and a Wreath of green leaves about your head, and trim your Garments with branches and leaves of trees. 2. To take time and leiſure, and not do any thing raſhly. For any thing done ſuddenly or raſhly to theſe fearful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures breeds offence and amazement: And a ſcare being taken, though but by one bird, their fear will not ſuffer them to argue or diſpute the object, or ſtay till every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one have beheld the thing ſuddenly affrighting them; but away they all fly at the very firſt apprehenſion, in an inſtant. And therefore if you find any ſtaggering or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may among them, preſently ceaſe and lie ſtill as though you were dead, till the fear be over, and they gaze no more about them, but gathering themſelves together do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to peep and cluck one to another, and rejoyce among themſelves, and then you may fall to your work again.</p>

                     <head>§. III. <hi>Of taking Pheaſants with the Lime-buſh, or Lime-rods.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>YOur Rods muſt be twelve, or at leaſt ten Inches long, well limed down to the middle, and no further. Your Lime-buſh muſt contain not above eight twigs at moſt, being the top-branch of ſome young Willow; with a handle about a ſhaft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment long, ſharpned ſo as either you may ſtick it gently into the ground, or prick it into any ſhrub or buſh, where-through the Peaſants uſually trace, or on any ſmall tree where they uſe to pearch, [Place two or three of theſe buſhes there.] Then make uſe of your Call, and you will quickly have all the Pheaſants within hearing about you; and it is a chance but ſome of them will be toucht, and if but one be limed ſhe will go near to lime all her fellows; for what by her ſtrugling amongſt them, and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to gaze, ſome will be ſmeared by her, and ſome will light on other buſhes: And if ſome one or two eſcape by mounting, and get to the Pearch, and there (as is the natural quality of them) ſit prying to ſee what becomes of their fellows, it is ten to one but they will be taken by the Lime-buſhes placed on the Pearch. Old Pheaſants when you call, oftentimes will not come on the ground, eſpecially in Winter, but mount and come flying from Pearch to Pearch, till they come to that next you, ever prying and peeping to find him out that calleth, where they will probably be taken.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:63869:31"/>
It very requiſite to keep an exact account of all your Lime-buſhes and Rods, and when you have gathered up your Pheaſants, ſee what buſhes or rods you have miſſing; for if you miſs but one of them, you may be aſſured that there are ſome limed which you have not found: And therefore never be without a Spaniel that will lie cloſe at your foot, and that will fetch and carry, and neither break nor bruiſe fleſh nor feather, to hunt out and bring you all the birds that ſhall ſo lie hid.</p>
                     <p>The Lime-rods may be placed not only upon buſhes and ſhrubs by Pheaſants tracks, but alſo upon the ground in open places between thicks in ſuch order as is directed above, neither too thick and apparent ſo as to breed affright, nor ſo thin as to let any eſcape, leaving about the length of a Rod or leſs between Lime-rod and Lime-rod.</p>
                     <p>The Seaſon for uſing of Lime is from the beginning of <hi>November</hi> till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>May,</hi> for during that time the twigs of trees (on which Birds pearch) are void of leaves, and like to Lime-twigs. The time for the uſe of Nets is from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>May</hi> till the latter end of <hi>October:</hi> during which time the trees are covered with leaves.</p>
                     <p>The Pheaſant-net would be made of the beſt twined double Houſewives thread, died green or blue, the Maſh almoſt an Inch between knot and knot: It would be in length at leaſt three fathoms, in breadth ſeven foot or better, verged on each ſide with a ſtrong ſmall Cord, and as it were ſurfled thereon; the Net being placed not ſtreight, but thick and large, that at any time when it is extended it may lie compaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and hollow: The two ends likewiſe ſhould be verged with ſmall Cord, yet that more for ſtrength than any particular uſe. The great Nets (which ſome uſe) are cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſom and hardly manageable, and therefore if occaſion be, it is better take and uſe a couple of ordinary ſize.</p>

Which done, take it out of the Morter, and carry it to a ſwift running ſtream, and there waſh it exceedingly, not leaving any mote or filth in it, Then put it up in a cloſe earthen pot, and let it ſtand and purge for divers days together, (three or four at leaſt) not omitting to skum it as any foulneſs ariſes, and when no more will riſe, put it into a clean Veſſel, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it cloſe, and keep it for uſe.</p>
                     <p>Now when you have occaſion to uſe it, take thereof what quantity you ſhall think ſit, and putting it into an earthen Pipkin with a third part of Hogs greaſe, or (which is better) Capons greaſe, or Gooſe greaſe, ſet it on a very gentle fire, and there let them melt together, and ſtir them continually till they be both incorporated together, and become one entire ſubſtance: Then take it from the fire and cool it, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it till it be cold.</p>
                     <p>When it is well cooled, take your Rods, and warming them a little over the fire, wind about the tops of them ſome of it ſo prepared, then draw the Rods one from another, cloſing them again, do this ſeveral times, continually plying and working them together, till by ſmearing one upon another, you have beſtowed upon every Rod a like quantity of Lime, keeping the full breadth of your hand at leaſt free and without any Lime at all, ever and anon warming the Rods before the fire, to make the Lime ſpread on them the better, and to make it lie ſmoother and plainer, that the Fowl may not perceive it, and take affright at it.</p>

                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:63869:32"/>
As for the liming of ſtraws, it muſt be done when the Lime is very hot, and in ſuch manner as the Rods are done, before the fire, only you muſt not do a few, but a great heap together, as big as you can well gripe in your hands, for ſo they are the ſtronger, and not ſo apt to bruiſe or break in pieces, and therefore in this opening and working of them, you ſhall not do it with a few together, but as many as you can well gripe, toſſing, and turning, and working them before the fire, till they be all beſmeared equally.</p>
                     <p>Now to preſerve your Lime from freezing even in the ſharpeſt weather, take a quarter ſo much of the Oyl called <hi>Petroleum</hi> as you do of Capons greaſe, and mixing them together well, work it upon the Rods, and it will ever keep your Lime gentle, ſupple, and tough, ſo that no froſt, how violent ſoever, can hurt it.</p>

Put it up in a Pot, and keep it in a moiſt place well covered with Parchment.</p>
                     <p>When you would make uſe of it, put it in a Pan, and to every pound of Lime add an ounce of Oyl Olive, mingling and incorporating of them well at the fire, and when you ſee that they are well mixt and united, and become like an Ointment, take it from the fire, and put thereto half an ounce of Turpentine, and incorporate them well together: and ſo you may employ it to take what you pleaſe. It ſerves alſo for the water. The ſame Author mentions other ſorts of Birdlime brought out of Forein Countries, with which I think it needleſs to trouble the Reader.

Of what colour he be it matters not much.</p>
                  <p>Having gotten you a Whelp of ſuch a Breed, begin to handle and inſtruct him at four or ſix months old at the furtheſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You muſt make him very loving to, and familiar with you, and fond of you, ſo as to follow you up and down without taking notice of any man elſe, by ſuffering no man to feed or cheriſh him but yourſelf. You muſt alſo make him ſtand in aw of, and fear you as well as love you, and that rather by a ſtern countenance and ſharp words than blows.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:63869:32"/>
2. Then you muſt teach him to couch and lie down cloſe to the ground, firſt by laying him down on the ground, and ſaying to him, <hi>Lie cloſe,</hi> or the like, terrifying him with rough language when he doth any thing againſt your command, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing him, and giving him food when he doth as you bid him. And thus by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual uſe and practiſing the ſame thing, in a few days you ſhall bring him readily and preſently to lie cloſe on the ground, when ever you ſhall but ſay, <hi>Couch, down, lie cloſe,</hi> or the like.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Next you ſhall teach him, being couched, to come creeping to you with his head and belly cloſe to the ground ſo far, or ſo little way as you ſhall think good, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Come nearer,</hi> or the like: Firſt, till he underſtand your meaning by ſhewing him a piece of bread, or ſome other food to entice him. And if when he offers to come he either raiſe from the ground his fore or hinder parts, or ſo much as lift up his head, then you ſhall not only with your hand thruſt down his body in ſuch ſort as you would have him keep it, but alſo chide and rate him ſo as to make him ſtrive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your pleaſure: And if that will not quicken him ſufficiently, to the terrour of your voice add a ſharp jerk or two with a Whip-cord laſh. When he does your will either fully or in part according to his apprehenſion chearfully, then you muſt be ſure to cheriſh him, and to feed him: And then renew his leſſon again till he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in it. In like manner you muſt make him ſtop and pauſe when you bid him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then you ſhall teach him to lead in a ſtring, and follow you at your heels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtraining his Collar, which you may eaſily do by practice, not ſtriving too rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When he is thus far taught, you may out into the field with him, and ſuffer him to range and hunt, yet at ſuch command, that upon the firſt hem or warning of your voice he ſtop and look back upon you, and upon the ſecond, that he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with either forbear to hunt further,, or elſe come in to your foot, and walk by you. If in ranging you find he opens, you ſhall firſt chide him therefore, and if that prevail not, either bite him hard at the roots of his ears, or laſh him with a ſharp Whip-cord laſh, till you have made him ſo ſtaunch, that he will hunt cloſe and warily without once opening, either through wantonneſs, or the riſing up of any ſmall birds before him.</p>
                  <p>When you find that he is come upon the haunt of any Partridge, (which you ſhall know by his eagerneſs in hunting, and by a kind of whimpering and whining, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly deſirous to open, but for fear not daring) you ſhall then warn him to take heed by ſaying, <hi>be wiſe,</hi> or the like. But if notwithſtanding he either ruſh in and ſo ſpring them, or elſe open or uſe any means by which the Partridge eſcapeth, you ſhall then correct him ſoundly, and caſt him off again in another place where you are ſure a Covey lies, and then as before give him warning. And if you ſee that through fear he ſtandeth ſtill and waveth his tail, looking forward as if he pointed at ſomewhat, be ſure the Partridge is before him: Then make him lie cloſe, and taking a large ring about him, look for the Partridge. When you have found them, if you ſee he hath ſet them too far off, you ſhall make him creep on his belly nearer, elſe let him lie cloſe without ſtirring, and then drawing your Net take the <hi>Partridge.</hi> Encourage your Dog by giving him the heads, necks, and pinions of the Partridge, and alſo bread or other food. But if he chance by any rudeneſs or want of taking heed to ſpring them again, you ſhall correct him as before, and lead him home in your ſtring, and tie him up that night, giving him nothing but a bit of bread and water, and the next day take him out, and do as before, but with ſomewhat more terrour and harſhneſs, and doubtleſs the Dog will do according to your will: Which if he doth, you muſt by no means forget to beſtow upon him all the cheriſhings of voice, hand, and foot.</p>
                  <p>It is a fault in a Dog to ſtand upright as it were looking over the Partridge when he ſets them, and therefore you muſt chide him for it, not giving over till you make him lie cloſe.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo a fault for him when you go in to the Covey, to ſpring up the Partridge into your Nets, to ruſh haſtily after you, or ſpring them before you, for which you muſt correct him; and your ſelf proceeding leiſurely the next time, ever as you go ſpeak to the Dog to lie cloſe.</p>

                  <p>NOw leſt any one, either not legally qualified or licenſed, or by taking Fowl at prohibited times, or by prohibited Engines, or by deſtroying of their Eggs, ſhould through ignorance incur the danger of the Law, I have thought fit to ſubjoyn an Abridgement of ſuch Statutes as relate to the preſervation of Fowl, collected and ſent me by my worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Walter Aſhmore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>None to deſtroy or take away the Eggs of any Wild Fowl on pain of one years <note place="margin">25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 11. confirmed 3 &amp; 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. c. 7.</note> impriſonment; and to forfeit for every Egg of a Crane or Buſtard ſo taken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed 20 <hi>d.</hi> Of a Bittern, Heron, or Shoveler 8 <hi>d.</hi> Of a Mallard, Teal, or other Wild-fowl 1 <hi>d.</hi> to be divided between the King and the Proſecutor.

Yet this act not to extend to ſuch as kill Crows, Choughs, Ravens, and Buzzards.</p>
                  <p>A Hawk taken up ſhall be delivered to the Sheriff, who after Proclamation made <note place="margin">34 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 22.</note> in ſeveral Towns, (if challenged) ſhall deliver her to the right Owner. And if the Hawk were taken up by a mean man, and be not challenged in four months, the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff to have her, ſatisfying the Party for taking her: But if by a man of eſtate, who may conveniently keep a Hawk, the Sheriff ſhall reſtore her to him again, he paying for the charge of keeping.</p>
                  <p>If any take away or conceal a Hawk he ſhall anſwer the value thereof to the Owner, and ſuffer two years impriſonment, and in caſe he be not able to anſwer the value, he ſhall remain in priſon a longer time.</p>

                  <p>None ſhall bear any Hawk of Engliſh breed called a Nyeſſe, (Goſhawk, Tarcel, Lanner, Lanneret, or Falcon) in pain to forfeit the ſame to the King.</p>
                  <p>He that brings a Nyeſſe Hawk from beyond the Seas ſhall have a Certificate under the Cuſtomers Seal where he lands, or if out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> then under the Seal of the Lord Warden or his Lieutenant, teſtifying ſhe is a Forein Hawk, upon the like pain of forfeiting the Hawk.</p>
                  <p>None ſhall take, kill, or fearaway any of the ſaid Hawks from their Coverts where they uſe to breed, in pain of ten pounds.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Characteriſtic notes of Rapacious Birds in general are theſe: <hi>To have a great head; a ſhort neck; hooked, ſtrong and ſharp-pointed Beak and Talons,</hi> fitted for ravine and tearing of fleſh: <hi>Strong and brawny thighs,</hi> for ſtriking down their prey: <hi>a broad, thick, fleſhy tongue, like a mans; twelve feathers in their train: four and twenty flag feathers</hi> [remiges pennae] <hi>in each wing;</hi> [The number of theſe feathers can hardly be counted exactly, and doth (I believe) vary in theſe Birds, the greater kinds having more, the leſſer fewer.] <hi>The two</hi> Appendices <hi>or blind guts very ſhort,</hi> ſo that they ſeem to be of no uſe to them, at leaſt when grown up: <hi>A membranous ſtomach, not a muſculous one, or</hi> Gizzard, like granivorous Birds: <hi>To be very ſharp-ſighted,</hi> for ſpying out their prey at a diſtance, <hi>to be ſolitary, not gregarious,</hi> by a ſingular providence of nature: For ſhould they, coming in flocks, joyntly ſet upon Cattel, the flocks and herds of ſheep and beaſts would ſcarce be ſecure from their violence and injuries. This note is not common to all Rapacious birds in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath delivered for an univerſal obſervation, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, i. e. <hi>No Birds of prey are gregarious.</hi> For <hi>Vultures,</hi> (as <hi>Bellonius</hi> hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) fly in company fifty or ſixty together: <hi>To be deep-feathered.</hi> The feathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting their bodies if they be not thicker ſet, are at leaſt taller or longer than in other birds, ſo that their bodies ſeem to be much greater than indeed they are. This note is common to all Rapacious birds, but not proper to them alone. <hi>To be long-lived,</hi> and as is commonly thought, more than other birds, whereof being not yet fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, I will not raſhly affirm any thing, but leave the matter to be determined by experience and diligent obſervation. But certain it is, (as we have before demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated) that all Birds in general, account being had of their bigneſs, are very long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived. <hi>To endure hunger</hi> (or <hi>abide without food) a long time,</hi> which conſidering their food and manner of living is almoſt neceſſary; ſeeing their prey is not always ready for them. <hi>The Females are of greater ſize, more beautiful and lovely for ſhape and</hi>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:63869:35"/>
                        <hi>colours, ſtronger, more fierce and generous than the Males.</hi> For this cauſe ſome will have the Males called <hi>Tarcels,</hi> that is, <hi>Thirds,</hi> becauſe they are leſſer by one third part than the Females. The reaſon of this inequality and exceſs of magnitude in the Females ſome do aſſign, becauſe it lies upon the Females to prey not only for themſelves, but for their Young, therefore it is requiſite they be more ſtrong and generous. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over (that we may note that by the by) among the Females themſelves the tokens of goodneſs are taken from their greatneſs; for by how much a <hi>Hawk</hi> is bigger and more weighty, ſo much better is it accounted. So that (as <hi>Tardivus</hi> witneſſeth) in <hi>Syria</hi> Birds employed for Fowling are all bought by weight; and ſo much the dearer by how much they weigh more. Howbeit the <hi>Aſtures [Goſhawks]</hi> (if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb) <hi>[Aſtore piccolo &amp; Terzuolo grande]</hi> by how much the leſs they are, by ſo much the more are they eſteemed. Here again <hi>Vultures</hi> are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, of which the Males are ſaid to equal or exceed the Females in bigneſs. <hi>The Baſis of the Beak is covered with a naked skin or membrane,</hi> which our Falconers call <hi>the Sear.</hi> This note is proper to Rapacious Birds that prey by day; for the night-birds have no ſuch Membrane. <hi>The outmoſt toe is connected with the middlemoſt by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Membrane, as far as the firſt joynt.</hi> This note is common to all <hi>Rapacious Diurnal</hi> Birds, but not proper to them alone, agreeing to many other birds beſides. <hi>The breaſt in moſt Rapacious birds is party-coloured or ſpotted:</hi> In moſt I ſay, not in all; for, the <hi>Vultur Boeticus, Milvus Aeruginoſus,</hi> and ſome few others are to be excepted. Some others alſo of the forementioned notes are not proper and peculiar to this kind, as for example, <hi>To have twelve feathers in the tail, and to have very ſhort Appendices or blind guts,</hi> which are common alſo to the Crow-kind, and moſt ſmall birds.</p>
                     <p>Add to theſe, that in Birds of prey the Hook of the upper chap is produced by Age to that length ſometimes, that it hinders their feeding: That the Claw of the outmoſt Toe is the leaſt: That the fleſh of carnivorous birds doth ſooner corrupt and putrefie than of any other: That the interior ſides of their Claws are ſharp-edged: That their Excrements are for the moſt part fluid like milk: That the interior Vanes of the prime feathers of their Wings and Tails have white or pale-coloured croſs bars: That the colour of the back and upper part is for the moſt part brown.</p>

                     <p>THe Eagle in general may be thus defined, <hi>Adiurnal Rapacious Bird of the biggeſt ſort, the moſt generous of all, having its Beak hooked almoſt from the very root.</hi> By its bigneſs it is diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Hawk,</hi> by its courage and ſpirit and by the kookedneſs of its Bill from the <hi>Vulture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are many things delivered by the Ancients and Moderns concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conditions of the <hi>Eagle</hi> in general; which are partly falſe or uncertain, partly common to other Birds of prey.</p>
                     <p>Of the firſt ſort I take the following to be.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That its feet are not equal, but the right bigger than the left.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That its feathers being mixt with the feathers of other birds, eſpecially <hi>Geeſe</hi> and <hi>Pigeons,</hi> do waſte and conſume them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That whereas ſhe excels in quick-ſightedneſs, in trying her Young whether they be genuine or ſpurious, ſhe makes uſe of an argument taken from the ſight. For hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up by the Claw, ſhe expoſes them to the Sun-beams, and thoſe that ſhe ſees look ſtedfaſtly on the Sun, ſhe keeps and brings up as right-bred, and her genuine Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, but ſuch as turn away their eyes, as not being able to behold it, ſhe caſts away as degenerous.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the <hi>Eagle</hi> as long as ſhe lives changes not her Neſt or Haunt, but returns yearly to the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That after Noon ſhe flies abroad and preys, but all the Forenoon before dinner ſhe ſits idle.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That ſhe touches not Carrion or dead Carcaſſes; feeding only upon the fleſh of ſuch Animals as ſhe kills her ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That whereas for the moſt part ſhe hatches two young ones, ſhe brings up but one, caſting out the other, to eaſe her ſelf of the toil of nurſing and feeding it.</p>
                     <p n="8">
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:63869:35"/>
8. That ſhe would not at all hatch her Young, did ſhe not bring the <hi>Eagles ſtone [Aëtites]</hi> into her Neſt, which is of wonderful vertue in promoting excluſion.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. That when the Young are ſick, and cannot concoct more ſolid food, by reaſon of the weakneſs of their ſtomachs, the old ones ſuck the bloud out of their prey, and feed them therewith.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. That in extreme old age, when their Beaks by reaſon of their drineſs are grown ſo crooked that they cannot feed, they ſuſtain themſelves for ſome time by drinking.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. That the old ones when they ſee their young fledged and ready to fly, do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them up a height, and then let them go, admoniſhing them as it were by their own peril to make uſe of their Wings, and by flying through the Air to ſave themſelves from falling. If after they have let them go they fall down to the ground, up they take them again, often repeating this kind of exerciſe.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. That ſhe hath an extraordinary care of her Talons, leſt by any means they ſhould be blunted. Hereupon in walking ſhe always draws them up, and turns them inwards, refuſes to walk in ſtony places, leſt perchance ſhe ſhould wear their points. And if ſhe happens to ſit or walk upon Rocks, ſhe ſpreads under her feet the skins of ſuch Animals as ſhe hath kill'd, leſt her Talons ſhould be hurt. Yea ſo careful is ſhe of them, that where ever ſhe ſits, unleſs ſhe eyes the Sun or her prey, ſhe is always look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at them; fearing leſt they ſhould grow too crooked. And if by chance they be blunted, ſhe ſharpens them with her Bill, or whets them upon ſtones, to render them fitter for preying.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. That when ſhe is enfeebled with old age, ſhe flies as high as ever ſhe can above the Clouds, till the dimneſs of her eye-ſight be conſumed by the heat of the Sun; then preſently deſcending with all her force, while ſhe is yet in the extremity of heat, ſhe drenches her ſelf three times in the coldeſt water ſhe can find, and riſing up thence ſtreightway betakes her ſelf to her Neſt, where among her young now fit for prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, falling into a kind of Fever, with a ſweat ſhe caſts her feathers; and is by them carefully nurſed up and fed, till ſhe recover her plumage again.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Whereas the greateſt part of Birds either of fear or wonder, fly after the <hi>Owl,</hi> ſhe not thinking ſuch carriage to become a Kingly bird, is nothing moved with that ſpectacle.</p>
                     <p>Of the latter kind are theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That ſhe doth ſo excel in quick-ſightedneſs, that ſoaring ſo high in the air, that ſhe can very hardly be diſcerned by us in all that light, yet ſhe can eſpy a Hare lying under a buſh, or a little Fiſh ſwimming in the water. <hi>Though I grant that both the Eagle and other Rapacious birds are very ſharp-ſighted, yet do I not think that, their eyes can reach objects at ſuch diſtances.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That ſhe is indocile and uncapable of Diſcipline, and not to be tamed by any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane endeavour: But is only carried on headlong by her natural inclination and <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. This is not univerſally true. For we have heard of Eagles that have been reclaimed and trained up for fowling. Though it he rarely done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That her breath ſmells very ill, ſo that by reaſon of the peſtiferous ſtench thereof, the bodies that are blown upon by her do eaſily putrefic and corrupt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That ſhe is very greedy and almoſt unſatiable: and therefore if at any time ſhe endures hunger, (of which ſhe is moſt patient) ſhe recompenſes her long faſting by abundant eating and gorging her ſelf. And if her prey be ſo great and copious that any thing remains when ſhe is ſatiated, ſhe leaves that to the other birds, which uſe to follow her in expectation thereof.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That almoſt all Birds of prey live without ever drinking; yet is their belly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways looſe, and their Excrements fluid. For the bloud of the Animals they kill affords them liquor enough for the concoction and digeſtion of their meat.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That it is very venereous. For the Female being trodden thirteen times a day, yet if the Male doth but call, runs to him again. Now whereas all ſalacious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are thought to be ſhort-lived, one may juſtly wonder, that the <hi>Eagle</hi> ſhould be the moſt luſtful, and yet withal the moſt vivacious of Birds.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When their young ones are grown up, and come to that age and ſtrength, that that they can without the help of their Parents get themſelves meat, they drive them far away from their Neſts; nay, they will not ſuffer them to abide ſo much as in the ſame Country.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Nature hath given the <hi>Eagle</hi> very thick, hard, and almoſt ſolid bones, and in which there is but very little marrow.</p>

The breadth from tip to tip of the Wings extended eight ſpans. The Beak was one Palm [hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth] and one inch long. For the hooked part alone hung down beyond the lower Chap a full Inch. The breadth of the Bill, eſpecially about the middle was more than two Inches. The hooked part or point was blacker; the reſt of the Bill of a horn-colour, inclining to a pale blue, and ſpotted with dusky. The wideneſs of the Mouth gaping <hi>[rictus]</hi> was one Palm and an Inch. The Tongue was like a <note place="margin">The Mouth. The Tongue.</note> Mans, broad, round, and blunt at the tip, toward the root on both ſides armed with two hooked, horny <hi>Appendices,</hi> tied down in the middle to the lower mandible by a thin Membrane. The Palate perforate in the middle. The lower Chap of the <note place="margin">The Palate.</note> Bill channelled, the edges whereof ſtanding up on both ſides are received in the upper. The Membrane which ariſing from the Forehead is extended beyond the Noſthrils, <note place="margin">The Sear.</note> and likewiſe the borders of the bridle or corners of the mouth are yellow. The fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">The neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers.</note> of the neck are rigid and <note n="*" place="margin">Of a raſty colour.</note> ferrugineous. A certain thick Tunicle ſtretched forth from below upwards covered the eye in nictation. This Membrane is called in Latine <hi>Periophthalmium.</hi> Two Eye-lids, one above, the other beneath, covered the <note place="margin">The Eye-lids.</note> Eye, although the lower alone extended upward was ſufficient to cover the whole Eye. The region of the Eye-brows was very eminent, like that prominent part of <note place="margin">The Eye-brows.</note> the roofs of houſes called the Eaves; under which the Eyes lay hid, as it were ſunk in a deep cavity. The Eyes were of the colour called <hi>Charopus,</hi> of a fiery ſplendor, <note place="margin">The Eyes.</note> ſhining forth in a pale blew. The Pupil was of a deep black. It is very admirable to obſerve what care Nature hath taken, and what proviſion ſhe hath made for the conſervation of the Eyes, than which there is no part in this Animal more excellent. For not being content with one Tegument, as is uſual in other Animals, ſhe ſeemeth to have framed four ſeveral lids or covers for them. The <hi>Periophthalmium,</hi> or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane for Nictation, is the ſame thing, and affords the ſame uſe to them that the Eye-lids do to a man. Beſides which Nature hath ſuperadded two other Eye-lids, and of theſe the lower ſo large, that they alone ſuffice to cover and preſerve the Eyes. The colour of the Wings and Tail is dusky, and ſo much the darker by how much the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">The Wings. The Train. The colour of the whole body.

Six of the prime feathers on each ſide were twenty two Inches long apiece, having very firm and hard quills, but ſhorter than thoſe of <hi>Geeſe,</hi> and very good to make Writing Pens.

ſo great was the difference between them; which I ſuppoſe not to have been natural, but induced by force, for this ſeemed to be maimed. The Talon of the foremoſt of the fore-toes of the left foot was five Inches in length, that of the middle three and an half, the leaſt two. The Talons of the fore toes of the right foot were bigger, in proportion to the back-claw, than thoſe of the left. Four Semicircular Tables co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered each toe near the Talons, excepting the greateſt of the fore toes, which had only three <note n="*" place="margin">Rings or annular Scales</note>

                        <p>I ſuſpect this to be the ſame bird with that hereafter deſcribed by us under the title of <hi>Pygargus.</hi> The chief difference is, that half the Tail in that is white, whereas in this the whole is of one [dusky] colour.</p>
                        <p>This with great fierceneſs flew upon any thing that came in its way: and would <note place="margin">The fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Golden Eagle.</note> with its Beak and Talons aſſault and ſtrike at Dogs, Cata, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and even man himſelf, if they did, before they were aware, approach too near the Cage in which it was ſhut up.

Moreover <hi>Leonard Baltner,</hi> a Fiſherman of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> who himſelf deſcribed and cauſed to be painted by the life all Water-fowl that frequent the River <hi>Rhine</hi> thereabouts, ſets forth the <hi>Bald Buzzard</hi> under the title of <hi>Fiſch-Adler, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Fiſh-Eagle.</hi> But ſeeing that our <hi>Bald Buzzard</hi> is a leſſer Bird than that it may merit the name of an <hi>Eagle,</hi> and is alſo very like to, and not much bigger than the <hi>Common Buzzard,</hi> we will treat thereof in a more commodious place, among its fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>viz.</hi> the leſſer ſort of wild birds of prey. And in this place for the <hi>Haliaeetus</hi> or <hi>Sea-Eagle</hi> we will preſent the Reader with the <hi>Oſſifrage</hi> of <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> ſeeing <note place="margin">That the <hi>Oſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandus</hi> is the Sea-Eagle.</note> that for its bigneſs may juſtly challenge a place among <hi>Eagles</hi> and is alſo a fierce and generous Bird, preying upon Fiſh, and frequenting not only Pools and Rivers, but alſo the Sea. I am not ignorant that <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> will by no means admit this Bird to be the <hi>Sea-Eagle:</hi> 1. Becauſe it anſwers not to the deſcription of the <hi>Sea-Eagle</hi> left us by the Ancients, which makes it to be not much bigger than the <hi>Kite,</hi> whereas this Bird for bigneſs falls not much ſhort of the <hi>Chryſaëtos</hi> it ſelf. 2.

the <hi>Ancients,</hi> who in delivering the notes of Animals are wont to be leſs curious and exact.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63869:37"/>
Error was (I ſuppoſe) a preſumption of the neceſſity of ſuch a ſtructure of the feet. For whereas the Mariners and Fiſhermen did ſee and obſerve this Bird much to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Sea and great Lakes of water, and to prey upon Fiſh; yea, ſometimes to fly forth very far from Land, ſo that it hath been often ſeen out at Sea, a hundred Leagues diſtant from ſhore, flying up and down over the water, and intent upon fiſhing; they imagined it altogether neceſſary that it ſhould be furniſhed with one flat foot for ſwimming, and another cloven for ſtriking, catching, and carrying away of Fiſh. It being, one would think, impoſſible, that a bird ſhould abide upon the Wing ſo long without reſt. But that even ſmall birds, ſhort-winged, and leſs fit by far for flight than <hi>Eagles</hi> will venture to fly over wide Seas is evident in thoſe we call birds of paſſage. And who knows but where thoſe Fowl are uſually ſeen, there may be ſome Rocks in the Sea not far off, on which they may reſt themſelves. But for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon this conceit was firſt ſtarted, it was readily entertained, and without examination greedily believed.</p>
                        <p>Not leſs fabulous is that which is reported of the oyl or fat which this bird hath in <note place="margin">The Oyl of <hi>Oſprey.</hi>

Doubtleſs he that can get the Oyl of ſuch an <hi>Oſprey</hi> as they talk of may work wonders with it.</p>

The mouth within-ſide <hi>[Oris rictus]</hi> of a Cheſnut-colour. <note place="margin">Mouth, Eyes, Head.</note> The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes not, as in other Eagles, of a fiery colour, but whitiſh; the Pupil black. The whole Head whitiſh, inclining to dusky <hi>[fuſcum.]</hi> The upper part of the Neck, about half way down, almoſt bald, beſet with very few, and thoſe <note place="margin">The Neck bare of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Staring hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like feathers.</note> ſmall feathers, of a white colour. At the end of this bald part, almoſt in the middle of the Neck, grew ſmall feathers like certain rough curled hairs, ſtanding up above the reſt of the Plumage, as it were very fine ſlender, long briſtles; the like whereto it had in the beginning of the back and breaſt, in places juſt oppoſite to one another, and alſo on the Rump below. On the Back was as it were a kind of hood, reaching to <note place="margin">The back,</note> the middle thereof, ending in a ſharp peak, and reſembling a Triangle. The colour <note place="margin">Colour of the body, Tail, Feet.</note> of the whole body was a dark Cheſnut inclining to black. The Tail long; the Feet and Legs white; the Claws dusky.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond was of one taken by Country men on the <hi>Alpiſh</hi> Mountains of the Town <hi>Giulia,</hi> as follows. From the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail it was by <note place="margin">Its length. The Bill.</note> meaſure three ſpans long. The Bill was long, but for the moſt part covered with a skin or membrane, ſo that about an inch only of the tip remained bare; the hooked end ſmall and ſlender. The Head was bald or deſtitute of feathers to the hind-part, ſo <note place="margin">The Head.</note> that the feathers ſtanding up behind the crown, reſembled a Monks hood, put back, and leaning on his neck, when he goes with his head uncovered. The colour of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <note place="margin">The Colour.</note> all the feathers of the whole body was dusky, inclining to a dark Cheſnut: Only interrupted by a continued <hi>Series</hi> of whitiſh feathers on the lower part of the neck, making an acute Angle, the point running down the middle of the back, which was as it were the acuminated part of the Monks hood, hanging from the ſhoulders
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63869:39"/>
down the middle of the back. <note n="*" place="margin">It is hard to underſtand clearly the Authors meaning in theſe words. The Tail, Feet, Talons.</note> Alſo another ſeries not unlike this of whitiſh fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, terminating in an acute Angle about the middle of the back, covered all the lower part of the back toward the complications of the Wings, ſomewhat reſembling a Clock. The Tail was broad, and of a mean ſize. The Feet dusky, and all over covered with Scales. The Beak and Talons were of one and the ſame dusky horn-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The feathers on the thighs reached not lower than the knees. It would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty ſuffer it ſelf to be touched or handled, whence you may note its ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs and cowardiſe. Being angred it cried like a <hi>Kite.</hi>

For in Beak it <note place="margin">Its Beak. Colour.</note> reſembles a <hi>Vulture,</hi> in colour a <hi>Stork,</hi> being ignoble and ſluggiſh. It was unknown to our Fowlers, being never, that I know of, taken with us. But in the year of our <hi>Lord,</hi> 1551. on <hi>Septemb.</hi> 29. there falling an extraordinary Snow, a Bird of this kind, her Wings being wet and heavy, fell down into a narrow place in the open Air ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to one of our Citizens houſes. It did for ſhape and colour wholly reſemble a <hi>Stork.</hi> It was Carnivorous, yet would not touch Fiſh; impatient of cold: The <note place="margin">Its Food.</note> body intenſely hot, ſo that the cold hands of them that touched it were preſently <note place="margin">Temperature.</note> warmed thereby. It would ſit ſtark ſtill in the ſame place for four or five hours; and <note place="margin">Nature and qualities.</note> ſometimes look upon the Sun when it ſhone out. <hi>Hens</hi> and other birds ſcorned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and neglected it as harmleſs and innoxious. I kept it at my houſe above a month, and gave it meat with my hand, the ſmaller gobbets whereof it would ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the greater pieces it tore aſunder with its Claws. Though it drank not, yet from its Beak drops of water diſtilled.</p>
                        <p>In the Year 1664. we ſaw at <hi>Venice</hi> in the Palace of a certain Nobleman of the City ſtanding upon the <hi>Grand Channel,</hi> a bird of this kind, which we thus deſcribed.</p>
                        <p>For bigneſs it equalled or exceeded any <hi>Eagle</hi> we have ſeen. The Head and Neck <note place="margin">Its bigneſs, Head and Neck bare, of feathers.</note> were deſtitute of feathers, only covered with a white down. From the Bill to the Eyes the skin was bare, and of a blue colour. Almoſt all the feathers of the body were of a pale ferrugineous colour. On the lower part of the Neck below the Down there was as it were a kind of Collar or Ruff of long white feathers. The prime fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Colour.</note> of the Wings and Tail were black. The Bill was large, more like a <hi>Gulls</hi> than an <note place="margin">Beak.</note> 
                           <hi>Eagles,</hi> the tip of it white. The Noſthrils were covered with a black membrane: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes of a reddiſh hazel colour. The Noſthrils turned directly <note place="margin">Eyes, Its noſe drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</note> downward, and from them conſtantly dropped a liquid humour or water. It was feathered down a little below the knee. The Feet were of a Lead colour, the Claws black, leſſer, and not ſo crooked as an <hi>Eagles.</hi> The middle Toe much longer than <note place="margin">Its Feet and Claws.</note> the reſt: The outmoſt joyned to the middle by a membrane as far as the firſt joynt, or further: The inſide of the Legs white. The Craw hung down from the body before like a bag. It ſtood almoſt always with the Wings ſtretcht out like the figure of the <note place="margin">The Craw.</note> 
                           <hi>Vultur Leporarius</hi> of <hi>Geſner.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe three deſcriptions I ſuſpect to be of one and the ſame Bird, differing only in Age or Sex. For the firſt of <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> in moſt notes agrees with ours; excepting the Triangular ſpot in the back, which either was not in ours, or not obſerved by us, (which yet I ſcarcely believe) and that he makes no mention of any humour dropping from the noſe of his, perchance becauſe it was ſeen and deſcribed after it was dead. <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> confeſſes his ſecond to be in many things not unlike to <hi>Geſners:</hi> But that <hi>Geſners</hi> and ours are the ſame Bird, that one note of the water diſtilling from the Noſthrils is ſufficient to evince, notwithſtanding the difference of colour. I judge the firſt of <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> and ours deſcribed at <hi>Venice,</hi> to be of the ſame Sex; likewiſe the ſecond of <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> and that ſeen and deſcribed by <hi>Geſner</hi> to be of the ſame Sex, but different from that of the other two. But herein I dare not be very poſitive and confident.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THe Characteriſtic notes of <hi>Vultures</hi> are, 1. That for bigneſs they are equal to, or exceed <hi>Eagles.</hi> 2. That their Beaks are not preſently from their firſt riſe from the Forehead crooked and bending, but after about two Inches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtreightneſs; which <hi>Geſner</hi> ſaith, he himſelf hath obſerved in many ſorts of <hi>Vultures.</hi> 3. That they have an excellent ſagacity of ſmelling above all other Birds, ſo that they can perceive the ſavour of dead Carcaſſes from far, [many miles off they ſay.] 4. The Ancients have delivered, that they are content only with dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes, abſtaining from the ravine and ſlaughter of living Animals. But <hi>Bellonius, Geſner,</hi> and others of the Moderns affirm, that they purſue live Birds, and prey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on living Fawns, Hares, Kids, Lambs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. That they have the neck for the moſt part bare of feathers. 6. <hi>Bellonius</hi> aſſerts, that among all Rapacious and hook-bill'd birds <hi>Vultures</hi> only aſſemble and fly together in flocks; and that himſelf ſaw great flights of them, of not fewer than fifty in each, when he travelled from <hi>Cairo</hi> to Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Hence that obſervation of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, is proved not to hold generally true in all Rapacious Birds. 7. That their Legs are feathered down to the Feet: By which note <hi>Bellonius</hi> thinks they are to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from other Birds of prey. But neither is this note common to all <hi>Vultures, Bellonius</hi> himſelf repreſenting ſome with naked legs; nor proper to the <hi>Vulturine</hi> kind; but alſo common to ſome <hi>Eagles,</hi> as appears by their figures and deſcriptions. 8. That under their throats they have a ſpace of about an hand-breadth, clothed rather with hairs, like to thoſe of a Calf, than with feathers. Which note we found to be true in the <hi>Vulture</hi> kept in the Royal Aviary in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park <hi>London.</hi> 9. That the Craw hangs down like a bag before the ſtomach or breaſt, which we obſerved in the <hi>Venetian Vulture</hi> or <hi>Gypaëtos,</hi> deſcribed in the precedent Chapter. 10. That the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, contrary to the manner of other Birds of prey, doth not exceed the Male in bigneſs. 11. That all the inſide of the Wings is covered with a ſoft fleece of Down; which is peculiar to the <hi>Vulture</hi> alone among Rapacious Birds. What is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of the generation of <hi>Vultures, viz.</hi> That there are no Males found among them: That the Females are impregnated by the Wind; that they bring not forth Eggs, but live Young, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is altogether falſe and frivolous, ſcarce worth the mentioning, much leſs the refuting. Among the marks hitherto reckoned up, the moſt proper Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteriſtic of a <hi>Vulture</hi> ſeems to me to be that of <hi>having its neck bare of deſtitute of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and only covered with a Down. Thoſe two, I am ſure, which alone we have hapned to ſee, had not only their necks, but their heads alſo bare, covered only with a ſhort white Down.</p>

                           <hi>ALdrovandus</hi> out of <hi>Bellonius</hi> and <hi>Geſner</hi> ſets forth ſix ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>cinereous</hi> or aſh-coloured <hi>Vulture.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The cinereous Vulture. The blac Vulture.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>black Vulture.</hi> Of which he ſaith, he wonders, why <hi>Bellonius</hi> (who boaſts that he had ſo great opportunity and facility of ſeeing and getting divers ſorts) ſhould give no perfect deſcription, neither of the one, nor the other, but only ſet forth a figure: which yet doth not agree to what he writes of <hi>Vultures</hi> in general, <hi>viz. That they all have rough legs, wholly feathered down to the foot, and do by this mark differ from Eagles,</hi> it being repreſented with naked legs.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Cheſnut-coloured Vulture [Boeticus]</hi> which <hi>Bellonius</hi> thus deſcribes: It is <note place="margin">The <hi>Boetic</hi> or Cheſnut co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> ſomewhat leſs than an <hi>Eagle,</hi> hath the feathers of its Neck, Back, Belly, and whole body of a Cheſnut-colour, wherein it differs from the black <hi>Vulture.</hi> The greater feathers of the Wings and Train are of the ſame colour with thoſe of the Black. Both [this and the black] have ſhort tails in reſpect of their very long Wings. Theſe do not, as in other Rapacious Fowl, follow the nature and conſtitution of the Wings,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63869:40"/>
but rather, as in <hi>Woodpeckers,</hi> are found for the moſt part with their points broken and ſhattered: Which is a ſign they wear and break them by rubbing againſt the Rocks, where they harbour and build their Neſts. The <hi>Cheſnut</hi> or <hi>white Vultures</hi> are more rare to be ſeen than the <hi>black;</hi> and have this peculiar to them, that the feathers of the Crowns of their heads are very ſhort if compared to <hi>Eagles:</hi> Which is the reaſon why ſome have thought them bald. They have ſhort legs, covered all over with feathers down to the beginning of the toes. Which note is peculiar to them, not agreeing to any other Rapacious hook-bill'd Bird, beſides the Nocturnal ones. The feathers of the Neck in theſe <hi>Baetic Vultures</hi> are very narrow and long (like thoſe that hang down about the necks of <hi>Dunghil-Cocks</hi> and <hi>Stares)</hi> if compared with the reſt, which cover the back, wings, and ſides, which are ſmall and broad like Scales. But thoſe which cover the back, ſtomach, belly, and bottom of the rump in the <hi>Baetic Vulture</hi> are red, in the black one black, but in both pretty broad.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The <hi>Hare-Vulture, [Leporarium]</hi> ſo called from preying upon <hi>Hares;</hi> of which <note place="margin">The Hare-Vulture.</note> 
                           <hi>Geſner</hi> writes after this manner. It hath not ſo <note n="*" place="margin">A deep Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or Lion-colour.</note> fulvous a breaſt as our <hi>Golden Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and is inferiour to it in magnitude. <hi>George Fabricius,</hi> the ornament of <hi>Germany,</hi> ſent me its figure, with this deſcription added. The <hi>Vulture,</hi> which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Ein Haſengyr,</hi> hath a hooked, black Bill; foul Eyes; a firm, great Body; broad Wings; a long, ſtreight Train; a dark red Colour; and yellow Feet. Standing or ſitting it rears up a Creſt upon its head, as if it were horned, which appears not in flying. The Wings extended exceeded the meaſure of a fathom <hi>[Orgyiae.]</hi> In walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſteps or paces two Palms [hand-breadths.] It purſues all ſorts of Birds; of Beaſts it catches and preys upon Hares, Conies, Foxes, Fawns; it alſo lies in wait for Fiſhes, It will not be made tame. It purſues its prey not only by flying, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by running. It flies with a great force and noiſe. It builds in thick and deſart Woods upon the higheſt trees, It feeds upon the fleſh and entrails of Animals, not abſtaining from dead Carcaſſes. It can endure hunger, or abide without meat four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days, although it be moſt voracious.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The <hi>Golden Vulture,</hi> of which <hi>Geſner</hi> thus: Viewing the skin of the <hi>Golden</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The Golden Vulture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> 
                           <hi>Vulture,</hi> ſent me once out of the <hi>Alpine</hi> Country of the <hi>Griſons, [Rhaetia,]</hi> the beak and legs yet ſticking to it, I thus deſcribed it. This <hi>Vulture</hi> hath many things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with that kind of <hi>Alpine Eagle,</hi> (whoſe figure and deſcription we placed firſt in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Eagle)</hi> but is every way, or in all parts greater. From the Bill to the end of the Tail it was ſomewhat more than four feet and an half long, to the end of the Claws three feet and nine Inches, or ſomewhat leſs. The length of the upper Chap of the Bill, as far as the opening of the mouth, was almoſt ſeven Inches. The length of the Tail was about two feet and three inches. All the lower part, that is to ſay, the lower part of the neck, the breaſt, the belly and the feet were of a red colour, more dilute towards the tail, more intenſe towards the head. The Toes of a dusky or horn colour. The longeſt feather of the Wings was almoſt a yard long: They are all blackiſh or dusky, of near one and the ſame colour: Yet the ſmall fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that are higheſt toward the ridge of the wing are blacker, and ſome of them marked with tranſverſe reddiſh ſpots croſs the middle, others with whitiſh ones about the bottom. So much the blacker are they by how much nearer to the back, where they ſhine again for blackneſs. The feathers on the middle of the back are black and ſhining, their ſhafts in the middle are white, eſpecially of thoſe which are about the middle of the back, and in half the neck; for the remaining part of the neck hath pale red <hi>[ruffas ex albido]</hi> feathers. The tail feathers are of the ſame colour with thoſe of the wings, <hi>viz.</hi> dusky.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The <hi>white Vulture,</hi> which he makes the ſame with the cinereous Vulture of <note place="margin">The white Vulture.</note>

The head and neck as far as the breaſt, and the middle part of the breaſt void of feathers, covered over with a ſhort, ſoft, thick white Down. The Eyes were fierce-looked, with Saffron-coloured, or deep-yellow <hi>Irides.</hi> In the lower part of the neck was as it were a Ruff of thick-ſet, narrow feathers much longer than the reſt, as in the <hi>Peronopteros</hi> of <hi>Aldrovandus.</hi>

                        <p>IT is a rapacious Bird of the bigneſs of a <hi>Kite</hi> according to <hi>Marggravius;</hi> of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-ſized <hi>Eagle</hi> or <hi>Raven</hi> according to <hi>Ximenes:</hi> Having whitiſh feet like a Hens, a long tail, and wings longer than it. The feathers of the whole body are black, with a little <note n="*" place="margin">Ravi.</note> tauny colour here and there mingled. It hath a ſmall head, almoſt of the ſhape of a <hi>Turkeys,</hi> covered with a ſomewhat rugged or wrinkled skin. In the top of the head the skin is as it were divided long-ways, and on the left ſide of the head beneath the Eye is of a Saffron colour, above the Eye of a blew, alſo in the top; elſewhere of a reddiſh brown. In the right ſide of the head about the Eye above and beneath it is of a Saffron colour, as alſo in the top: Elſewhere of a delayed yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or whitiſh. It hath a pretty long Bill, hooked at the end, ſharp, and covered over from the head half way with a skin from Saffron-colour tending to blue. In the middle of the Bill above is <note n="*" place="margin">I ſuppoſe he means one common hole for both Noſthrils: or a hole through the Bill from ſide to ſide.</note> one hole of the Noſthrils, large, and ſituate tranſverſly. The end of the Bill, that is bare and wants the skin, is white. It hath elegant Eyes almoſt of the colour of a <hi>Ruby,</hi> with a round black Pupil: The Eye-lids of a Saffron-colour. The Tongue carinated, and indented round with ſharp teeth. Its fleſh ſtinks like Carrion. For they feed upon dead Carcaſſes; and in the <hi>Capitania [Chieftainſhip]</hi> of <hi>Sirigippo,</hi> and River of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> when any one kills a beaſt, they come flying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently in great numbers. It is an ill-looked bird, always lean, and never ſatisfied, <hi>Ximenes</hi> makes it to be a kind of <hi>Raven,</hi> but the <hi>Sear</hi> or skin covering the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Bill, argues it to belong to the Rapacious kind, the bare head, and tip of the Bill on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hooked, determine it to the family of <hi>Vultures.</hi> It feeds (ſaith <hi>Ximenes)</hi> upon dead fleſh and mans dung. They pearch at night on Trees and Rocks, in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they reſort to the Cities, ſit viewing and watching the ſtreets on high places, and when they ſpy any ſilth, garbidge, or dead thing, they catch it up, and devour it. Where they build or hatch their Young is hitherto unknown; although they be moſt frequent in almoſt every corner of <hi>New Spain.</hi> Yet <hi>Acoſta</hi> ſaith, that their young ones are white, and that growing up they change and come to be as black as <hi>Ravens.</hi> They fly always very high, and caſt a horrible ſtink from them like <hi>Ravens.</hi> They fly conſtantly in flocks, and ſit upon trees, and feed joyntly in company upon dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes without any ſtrife, or quarrelling, and when the reſt ſee any one not able to move or help her ſelf, they help her as much as they can, and bring her to the water: For being waſhed they recover ſtrength to fly. If any one purſues them they empty themſelves preſently, that they may be the more light to fly away; with like haſte caſting up what ever they had ſwallowed. The aſhes of their feathers burnt take away hairs, ſo that they come not again; which faculty is alſo attributed to the dung of <hi>Piſmires,</hi> and the bloud of <hi>Bats.</hi> Their skin half-burnt heals wounds if it be applied, and the fleſh withal eaten; which is wont alſo to help thoſe that are ſick of the French Pox. The heart dried in the Sun ſmells like Musks The Dung dried, and taken in any convenient Vehicle to the weight of a Drachm is profitable to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy perſons. The Barbarous people ſay, that where they lay their Eggs, they compaſs their Neſts with certain Pebble-ſtones, which promote tranſpiration: But the more probable opinion is, that they exclude their Young under ground, and take them out when they feed them, and again cover them in the earth.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the leſſer ſort of Rapacious Birds that prey by day, called</hi> Hawks.</head>
                     <p>IT follows now that we treat of the leſſer ſort of Rapacious Birds that prey by day, called <hi>Hawks.</hi> Theſe we have before diſtinguiſhed into the <hi>more generous,</hi> which are wont to be reclaimed and trained up for Hawking, And the <hi>more ſluggiſh</hi> and cowardly, which becauſe they are either indocile, or unfit for Hawking, are neglected by men.</p>

                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:63869:41"/>
The former called <hi>Hawks</hi> are wont to be divided by Falconers into <hi>Long-winged</hi> and <hi>Short-winged.</hi> Thoſe they call <hi>Long-winged</hi> whoſe Wings when cloſed reach al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the end of the tail: Thoſe they call <hi>Short-winged</hi> whoſe Wings when clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fall much ſhort of the end of the tail; of which ſort we have ſeen two greater, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Goſhawk</hi> and <hi>Sparrowhawk;</hi> and three leſſer, <hi>viz.</hi> the three ſorts of <hi>Butcher-birds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But becauſe that diſtinction of <hi>Hawks</hi> into <hi>tame</hi> and <hi>wild</hi> is arbitrarious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon inſtitution; but the other into <hi>Long-winged</hi> and <hi>Short-winged</hi> hath its foundation in nature, and may be accommodated to all <hi>Hawks</hi> in general; we will prefer it before that, firſt treating of the <hi>Long-winged</hi> Hawks.</p>
                     <p>Hawks in reſpect of their age are divided by Falconers into 1. <hi>Nyas</hi> or <hi>Eiaſſe-Hawks,</hi> which being taken out of the Neſt, or brought away in the Neſt before they can fly, are brought up by hand. 2. <hi>Ramage-Hawks</hi> or Branchers, which are taken when they are fledg'd and got out of the Neſt, but depart not far from it, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only from bough to bough, and following their Dams, not being able yet to prey for themſelves: from <hi>Ramus</hi> ſignifying a bough. However they be taken, after they have preyed for themſelves the firſt year, while they retain their Chicken-feathers, they are called <hi>Sore-hawks,</hi> from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Soret,</hi> ſignifying a dusky colour. The ſecond year, when they have changed their feathers, they are called <hi>Entermewers,</hi> from the word <hi>muto</hi> to change. The third year they are called <hi>White Hawks,</hi> for what reaſon I know not. The fourth year, when they are come to their full growth and perfection, they are called <hi>Hawks of the firſt coat;</hi> the fifth year, <hi>Hawks of the ſecond coat;</hi> the ſixth year, <hi>Hawks of the third coat;</hi> and ſo on as long as they live. Some of them, if they be well tended and favoured while they are young, will hold out twenty years. The feathers of all by age gradually grow whiter, as mens hairs grow grey, ſo that by how much the older they are, by ſo much the whiter are they. The outmoſt feather of the Wing is by our Falconers called the <hi>Sarcel,</hi> by the number of the dents whereof they pretend to know the age of the <hi>Hawk,</hi> as by the number of croſs bars in the tail, the age of a <hi>Pheaſaant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But of the manner of feeding, training up, reclaiming, and curing the diſeaſes of <hi>Hawks,</hi> thoſe that have written of <hi>Falconry</hi> are to be conſulted.</p>

The Tongue broad, ſoft, and like a mans. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes yellow; the Pupils <note place="margin">Eyes.</note> great. It hath both an upper and lower Eye-lid, but the lower much greater. The Eyes are not ſo ſunk in the head, or withdrawn under prominent brows, as in the <hi>Common Buzzard,</hi> but more extant.</p>
                        <p>The Bird itſelf ſeems to be much ſtronger and more valiant than the <hi>Buzzard,</hi> with which it agrees in the colour of the upper part being black and ferrugineous. The <note place="margin">Colour of the upper ſide,</note> feathers on the crown of the head are white, whence it took the name of <hi>Bald Buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard:</hi> The throat, breaſt and belly white, but above the Crop the feathers are ferru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineous. <note place="margin">Lower ſide.</note> The Legs are cloathed with white and ſoft feathers. The prime or flag-feathers <note place="margin">The Flag-Feathers.</note> in each Wing are about twenty eight; from the ſeventeenth they end in ſharper points: The greater are the blacker. The four outmoſt have the lower half of their interiour Vanes twice as broad as the upper: The interiour Vanes of all are variegated with white and black alternately, indented like the teeth of a Saw. The feathers under the ſhoulders are white, marked with black ſpots toward the tips. The third and fourth row of thoſe that cover the roots of the flag-feathers underneath <note place="margin">The covert feathers.</note> are elegantly marked toward the tips with dusky ſpots, having their edges ferrugineous. The leſſer feathers above theſe are white, the greater beneath them dusky or brown. The Train is made up of twelve feathers of equal length, having their borders party<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured <note place="margin">The Train.</note> of white and ferrugineous, indented as in the Wings.</p>
                        <p>The Legs are long: The Feet thick and ſtrong, of a pale blue or Verdigreaſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. <note place="margin">The Feet, Toes, and Talons.</note> The middle Toe the biggeſt; the outermoſt ſomewhat bigger than the inner; the back-toe, as in all, the leaſt; all armed with great, ſemicircular, black, round Talons.

                        </p>
                        <p>The Liver, Heart, and Gall are large: The Spleen round, and of a black or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did colour. In the Stomach and Craw opened we found many fiſh-bones and ſcales. The Surface of the <hi>Echinus</hi> or ante-ſtomach, was full of many carneous Globules. The Guts were long, ſlender, or ſmall, having many revolutions.</p>
                        <p>It haunts Rivers, Lakes, and great Pools of water, as alſo the Sea-ſhores. At <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans</hi>

                        <p>It builds upon the ground among Reeds, and lays three or four large white Eggs, of <note place="margin">Its Neſt.</note> a figure exactly Elliptical: leſſer yet than Hens Eggs.</p>
                        <p>It caſts an ill ſtrong ſent, and is much infeſted with Lice.</p>
                        <p>It differs from the <hi>Sea-Eagle</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in that the neck is not thick and big, but for the bulk of the body ſlender and ſmall.</p>
                        <p>What <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> hath delivered of Eagles, <hi>viz.</hi> that the right foot is bigger than the left, doth not agree to this, for its feet are equal.</p>
                        <p>It is diſtinguiſhed from the common <hi>Buzzard.</hi> 1.

The Bridle of the mouth, or the skin of the corners, is alſo yellow. The Noſthrils are round, <note place="margin">Sear, Nares,</note> [yet in one Bird of this kind we obſerved them long and bending.] It gaped wide.

The lower Eye-lid downy. The Membrane for Nictation blue.</p>
                        <p>The colour of all the upper part a dark fulvous approaching to black, or a ferru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineous <note place="margin">The Colour of the upper ſide.</note> black. In ſome birds of this kind we obſerved many white ſpots in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert feathers of the Wings; which in the Wings ſpread made a kind of white line: The like white ſpots it had in the long feathers ſpringing from the ſhoulders, which cover the whole back. The edges of theſe feathers were of a dirty yellow. The lower ſide of the body was of a dilute yellow, or yellowiſh white; the breaſt ſtained <note place="margin">Colour of the lower ſide.</note> with oblong ferrugineous ſpots, not tranſverſely placed, but tending downwards, in each feather drawn according to the length of the ſhaft. The Chin is of a ferrugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous colour, the ſhafts of the feathers being black. Between the Eyes and Noſthrils grow long black briſtles. On the middle of the back grow no feathers, but only down; for the ſcapular feathers cover the whole back.</p>
                        <p>The flag-feathers in each Wing are about twenty four in number: The outmoſt <note place="margin">The Flag-Feathers of the Wings.</note> of which is ſhorteſt, the third and fourth (counting from it) longeſt. The tips of the four outmoſt are blacker and narrower than thoſe of the reſt: For the tips of the reſt are white. The interiour webs of all are variegated with broad, tranſverſe, dusky, and whitiſh ſtrakes or bars, after the manner of thoſe of a <hi>Woodpecker</hi> or <hi>Woodcock.</hi> The under-ſide of the Wings, excepting the tips of all the flags, and the third part of the five outmoſt feathers, is white varied with tranſverſe parallel lines. The Wings cloſed reach almoſt to the end of the Train. The Train is nine or ten inches long, made up of twelve feathers, not forked, but when ſpread term inating <note place="margin">The Tail.</note> in a circular circumference. The utmoſt tips of its feathers are of an aſh-colour; then follows a tranſverſe black line of an inch breadth, the remaining part being varie gated with black and cinereous tranſverſe ſpaces or bars, only the bottoms of the feathers white.</p>
                        <p>The Thighs are long, ſtrong, and fleſhy: The Legs ſhort, thick, and ſtrong, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <note place="margin">The Legs, Feet,</note> down a little below the Knees.

The Talons ſtrong, long, and black; that of the outmoſt fore-toe the leaſt, that of the back-toe the biggeſt.</p>
                        <p>The Liver is divided into two lobes, having a large Gall: The Spleen of an Oval <note place="margin">The entrails.</note> figure. It hath but two Teſticles.

                        <p>It feeds not only upon Mice and Moles, but alſo upon Birds: For out of the ſtomach <note place="margin">Its Food.</note> of one that we opened we took a ſmall Bird entire, and out of the ſtomach of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even a <hi>Thruſh.</hi> It is a great deſtroyer of <hi>Conies:</hi> Yet for want of better food it will feed upon Beetles, Earth-worms, and other Inſects.</p>
                        <p>The heads of theſe Birds are ſaid to grow <note n="*" place="margin">Aſh-colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

But whether it come to paſs by reaſon of Sex, or Age, or other accident, certain it is they differ very much one from another in this reſpect: For whereas ſome have no white feathers neither in head, back, nor wings; others have very many.</p>

The middle of the throat of a dusky or dark ferrugineous colour, the edges of the feathers being red.

                        <p>The number of flag-feathers in each wing was twenty four, the exteriour webs <note place="margin">The <hi>Remges,</hi> or prime Wing-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> whereof were of the ſame colour with the back, the interiour being variegated with tranſverſe black and white ſtroaks alternately ſituate.

The covert feathers of the upper ſide of the Wings cinereous, of the nether ſide white; the ſhafts of the interiour being black. The firſt row of the covert feathers of the inſide of the Wing have tranſverſe dusky ſpots.

The Wings were like thoſe of other the moſt beautiful Hawks, but purely white, and without ſpots. The Tail had twelve feathers alike white, and ſpotted with yellow; the ſight <note place="margin">Train,</note> whereof the uppermoſt feather (which was wholly white, and covered the reſt, hiding them as it were in a ſheath) took away. The Beak alſo was rather white than <note place="margin">Beak,</note> blue. The Feet, after the manner of other Hawks, yellow. The Eyes yellow and <note place="margin">Feet, Eyes.</note> black: And that yellow nothing deeper than in a Hawk not yet mew'd, which we commonly call a <hi>Sore;</hi> although I cannot believe that this was a <hi>Sore.</hi> For it might ſo come to paſs, that it might retain that yellowneſs from a certain temper of body peculiar to this kind: Otherwiſe it would, after it was mewed, neceſſarily incline to whiteneſs. It was of a tall ſtature, a great and ſtately bird: It eat not but with its Eyes uſually ſhut, and that with great greedineſs. It killed <hi>Pullets.</hi>

                           <hi>Bellonius</hi> acquaints us with a common and familiar way of taking this kind of <note place="margin">The manner of catching Sparrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks near <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                           </note> Hawks about the Streight of <hi>Propontis,</hi> in theſe words. Not far diſtant (ſaith he) from the outlet of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, at the entrance of the Streight leading to the <hi>Propontis,</hi> having climbed up a very high Hill that is there, by chance we found a Fowler on the top intent upon the catching of <hi>Sparrow-hawks.</hi> Whereas it was now paſt <hi>mid-April,</hi> at which time all ſorts of birds are wont to be very buſie in breeding or building their Neſts, it ſeemed to us wonderful ſtrange and unuſual, to ſee ſuch a multitude of <hi>Kites</hi> and <hi>Hawks</hi> coming flying from the right ſide of the Sea. This Fowler did with ſuch induſtry and dexterity lay wait for them, that not ſo much as one eſcaped him. He took at leaſt twelve Hawks every hour, The manner thus: He himſelf lay hid behind a little buſhet, before which he had levelled a ſquare plat or floor, about two paces long and broad, being two or three paces diſtant from the buſhet. In the borders of this floor he had pitcht down [or thruſt into the ground] ſix ſtakes, at due diſtances, of about the thickneſs of ones thumb [the word is <hi>Pollicis,</hi> and may poſſibly ſignifie an inch-thick] of a mans height, two on each ſide: On the top of each, on that ſide
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63869:50"/>
which reſpected the floor was a nick cut in, upon which was hung a Net made of fine green thread. In the middle of the floor ſtood a Stake a Cubit high, to the top of which a Cord was bound, which reached as fas as the Fowler, who lay behind the buſhet. To this ſame Line, lying looſe, were many little Birds faſtned, which picked up grains of Corn on the floor. Now, when the Fowler ſaw a Hawk coming afar off from the Sea-coaſt, ſhaking the Line, he made theſe birds to flicker up and down. Which the <hi>Sparrow-hawks</hi> (as they are notably ſharp-ſighted) eſpying at leaſt half a League off, came flying full ſpeed, and ruſh'd upon the Nets with that force, to ſtrike at the birds, that being entangled therein they were taken. The Hawks being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured into the Nets, and caught by this Artifice, the Fowler thruſt their whole wings up to the ſhoulders into certain linnen clothes, ſown up for that purpoſe, <hi>which our Falconers call, mayling or truſſing of Hawks.</hi> Thus mayld or truſt up he left them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, ſo unable to help themſelves, that they could not ſtir, nor ſtruggle, much leſs diſengage or deliver themſelves. No man could eaſily imagine, whence ſuch a multitude of <hi>Sparrow-hawks</hi> ſhould come. For in two hours time that we were ſpectators of that ſport, we ſaw more than thirty taken by this deceit, whence one may conjecture, that one Fowler in the ſpace of one day might take more than an hundred. Theſe Hawks do not uſually ſtay ſo long in one place as <hi>Falcons,</hi> but are often changing place, whence it is more difficult to take them with a Net. For they will not readily give a Fowler time to ſpread a Net over them; unleſs they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in that manner <hi>Bellonius</hi> hath ſet down.</p>

Our Falconers call it the <hi>Mattageſs,</hi> a name borrowed from the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> which is by <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> interpreted a <hi>murthering Pie.</hi>
                        </p>

In them alſo they build, making their Neſts of Moſs, Wool, and certain downy herbs: But the bottoms thereof of Heath, upon which they lay withinſide the ſoft and tender ſtalks of hay, <hi>Doggs-tooth,</hi> and other like herbs. In this Neſt in ſummer time are to be found ſix Young, ſo unlike to the old ones, that they ſcarce reſemble them in one mark, their Bills, Legs, and Feet only excepted; yea, rather on the contrary the bottoms of all their downy feathers, (which are as yet nothing elſe but certain rudiments of their future Plumage) incline ſomewhat to green.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THat Birds of Paradiſe want feet is not only a popular perſuaſion, but a thing not long ſince believed by learned men and great Naturaliſts, and among the reſt by <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> himſelf, deceived by the birds dried or their caſes, brought over into <hi>Europe</hi> out of the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> diſmembred, and bereaved of their Feet. Yea, <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> and others do not ſtick to charge <hi>Antonius Pigafeta,</hi> (who gave the firſt notice of this Bird to the <hi>Europaeans)</hi> with falſhood and lying, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the contrary. This errour once admitted, the other fictions of idle brains, which ſeemed thence to follow, did without difficulty obtain belief; <hi>viz.</hi> that they lived upon the coeleſtial dew; that they flew perpetually without any intermiſſion, and took no reſt but on high in the Air, their Wings being ſpread; that they were never taken alive, but only when they fell down dead upon the ground: That there is in the back of the Male a certain cavity, in which the Female, whoſe belly is alſo hollow, lays her Eggs, and ſo by the help of both cavities they are ſitten upon and hatched. All which things are now ſufficiently refuted, and proved to be falſe and fabulous, both by eye-witneſſes, and by the birds themſelves brought over entire. I my ſelf (ſaith <note n="*" place="margin">In his notes upon <hi>Marggr.</hi> lib. 5. cap. ult.</note> 
                        <hi>Joannes de Laet)</hi> have two <hi>Birds</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of different kinds, and have ſeen many others, all which had feet, and thoſe truly for the bulk of their bodies ſufficiently great, and very ſtrong Legs. The ſame is confirmed by * <hi>Marggravius, Cluſius</hi> in his Exotics, <hi>Wormius</hi> in his <hi>Muſeum,</hi> page 295. and eſpecially <hi>Bontius</hi> in the fifth Book and twelfth Chapter of his <hi>natural and medic Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where we have to this purpoſe; <hi>It is ſo far from being true that theſe birds of Paradiſe are nouriſhed by the Air, or want Feet, that with their crooked and very ſharp Claws they catch ſmall birds, as</hi> Green Linnets, Chaffinches, <hi>and the like, and preſently tear and devour them like other birds of prey: No leſs untrue is it, that they are not found but only dead, whereas they ſit upon trees, and are ſhot with Arrows by the</hi> Tarnacenſes; <hi>whence alſo, and from their ſwift</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">To and fro, or backward and forward.</note> 
                        <hi>reciprocal flying, they are by the Indians called</hi> Tarnacenſian Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. We truly, before we had read theſe things in <hi>Bontius,</hi> had ſubjoyned theſe birds to the <hi>Rapacious</hi> kind, becauſe they did ſeem to us in their Bill and crooked Claws very nearly to reſemble them, and conſequently in all likelihood to prey upon littlebirds. Hence alſo it appears how raſhly ſome have believed, that they took their reſt hanging by thoſe two <note n="*" place="margin">Shafts of feathers.</note> 
                        <hi>cirri,</hi> which run out, as it were two long ſtrings, beyond the reſt of the feathers, twined about the boughs of trees: For thoſe <hi>Cirri</hi> are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the naked ſhafts of feathers, having neither the ſtructure nor uſe of Muſcles. It were to be wiſhed, that thoſe who travel to thoſe parts of the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> where theſe Birds are found, would diligently enquire of the Inhabitants, where and how they build: And what thoſe long feathers ſerve for, which ſpringing in great numbers from both ſides of the breaſt do both run out in length beyond the Tail, and alſo are ſpread out far in breadth; and eſpecially what may be the uſe of theſe two long naked ſhafts of feathers before mentioned, which (to ſay the truth) is to us as yet unknown.</p>
                     <p>Theſe moſt beautiful birds (as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> reports) are called by the inhabitants of the <hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands <hi>Manucodiatae,</hi> that is, <hi>Gods birds,</hi> and had in great eſteem and veneration. They are called <hi>Birds of Paradiſe,</hi> both for the excellent ſhape and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their bodies, and alſo becauſe where they are bred, whence they come, and whither they betake themſelves is altogether unknown, ſith they are found only dead upon the earth, ſo that the Vulgar imagine them to drop out of Heaven or Paradiſe. But this miſtake we have before out of <hi>Bontius</hi> rectified.</p>

The Head like that of a <hi>Swallow,</hi> and great for the ſmalneſs of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; the feathers covering its upper part from the firſt Vertebre of the Neck to the beginning of the Bill were ſhort, thick, hard, cloſe-ſet, of a bright, gliſtering, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour, ſhining like burniſhed Gold, or the Sun-beams: The reſt which covered the Chin were of an admirable bluiſh green, ſuch as we ſee in the heads of <hi>Mallards,</hi> when expoſed to the Sunſhine. The Bill was longer than that of a <hi>Swallow:</hi> The <note place="margin">Its Bill, Wings:</note> Wing-feathers for ſhape like thoſe of <hi>Herons,</hi> only ſlenderer and longer, of a ſhining dusky colour between black and red: which together with the Tail being ſpread round repreſent the likeneſs of a Wheel: For they are abſolutely immovable, ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the skin like ſo many darts. Beſides which there are alſo other ſmall feathers, and thoſe verily not a few, which ſpring up juſt by the originals of the greater fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that make up the Wings, and cover the lower parts of them. Theſe are half red or Scarlet-coloured, half of a ſhining, Saffron, or Gold colour; and by reaſon of that remarkable and ſingular diſparity of colours contribute much to the beauty and elegancy of this bird. All the reſt of the body was covered with <note n="*" place="margin">Of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of gold.

For thoſe on the Breaſt and Belly, which ſtood thicker, and were likewiſe broader (being of two or three inches breadth) were of a fulvous or rather liver colour, and that very bright and reſplendent. Thoſe on the Back ſtood thinner, and were fewer, gaping moreover with large diviſions, after the manner exactly of thoſe growing on the backs of Herons. [I ſuppoſe he means the ſeveral threads or filaments which compoſe the web of the feather ſtood thinner or at greater diſtances, as in thoſe of a <hi>Peacocks</hi> Tail.] Neither do they attain that eminent breadth, or match them in that excellent liver-colour; but are rather of a purple, reſembling fleſh or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more obſcure.

                        <p>THis differed from the reſt, eſpecially in that it had in its Rump two very long feathers, exceeding the reſt about two palms length: The Head was almoſt <note place="margin">Colour of the Head,</note> white, beſprinkled with yellow and golden ſpots: The eyes likewiſe yellow, the hairs of the Eye-lids red: The Bill of a middle colour between yellow and green, two inches long; the upper part a little crooked: The Tongue red, long, ſharp, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <note place="margin">Bill,</note> that of <hi>Woodpeckers,</hi> very fit to ſtrike Inſects. The Breaſt was ſomewhat red: <note place="margin">Tongue,</note> The Belly, Back and Wings were white: Yet were their upper ſides all over, and <note place="margin">Breaſt, Wings,</note> their ends ferrugineous.

In the length of the Wings, which equalled five Palms, it exceeded the firſt ſpecies. The Tail feathers at their <note place="margin">The Tail;</note> inſertion into the back were white, elſe ferrugineous, longer than in the firſt Species.</p>
                        <p>This Bird wanted thoſe two threads, which (as I ſaid before) grow out of the backs of all this kind. Wherefore it is to be thought that either by reaſon of the length of the journey, or continuance of time, they fell away and were loſt; not that it is therefore to be called a Female, as the Vulgar have been hitherto falſly perſwaded. The uſe of the two forementioned long feathers may perchance be for ſwifter flight.</p>

The Neck was an inch long: The length of the Body from the Head to the riſe of the Tail ſcarce three inches and an half. The Wings were above ſeven inches long: The Tail broad, and ſix inches long. It had two Legs, the lower part of each two inches long: Four Toes in the Feet, three ſtanding forwards, and one backward, after the uſnal manner; the middle Foretoe was a little longer than the reſt: The back-toe was alſo of a good length; all armed with ſtrong, crooked, Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Claws. Both Legs and Feet are thick and ſtrong, made for rapine and preying. The Wings and Tail have broad and ſtrong feathers, an inch wide. The whole back, tbe lower Belly, the Wings and Tail are of an elegant brown colour <hi>[Brunni.]</hi> Above next the Bill it hath feathers reſembling Velvet, mingled of green and dusky:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63869:53"/>
Beneath next the Bill it hath like feathers of a black colour. The Neck above is of a yellow or gold colour; beneath of a green, with a gold-colour as it were ſhining through it. The Breaſt is of a deep brown. Under the Wings, in the ſides between the Wings and the Legs grow many feathers, a foot long more or leſs, of a curious ſtructure, which run forth a great way upon the Tail: Towards their riſe they are of a deep yellow or gold colour, elſe of a whitiſh yellow, ſhadowed or daſhed with brown. Among theſe feathers are extended two as it were threads or ſtrings, each more than two feet long, near their riſe of a yellow or gold colour, crooked towards their ends, and of a dark brown. Their Legs are dusky, their Talons being whiter. The Bill is of a colour mixt of green and blue, yet whitiſh toward the point.</p>

                        <p>IN bigneſs it exceeded a <hi>Swallow.</hi> It hath a ſmall Head, a little compreſſed or flat above, two thirds of an inch long, in thickneſs or compaſs two inches: very lit-Eyes, about the bigneſs of a grain of <hi>Millet</hi> or <hi>Muſtard</hi> Seed. The Bill ſtrong, above an inch long, ſtreight, (yet upwards towards its Baſe ſomewhat riſing) ſharp, of a colour mingled of blue and green, with an oblong white ſpot in the upper Chap to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the point: wide, open Noſthrils. The Neck a little more than two thirds of an inch long, ſtreight, and of equal thickneſs with the head. The body from the end of the Neck to the beginning of the Tail was ſcarce four inches long, the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs almoſt three; but it was covered with many feathers, which I do not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. The length of the Wings was five inches. Above on the head, at the riſe of the Bill, it was adorned with very black, ſmall, downy feathers, exactly reſembling Velvet; and in like manner near the riſe of the lower Bill, the black here being broader than above. In the whole throat or lower ſide of the Neck, and as far as the Cheeks and alſo to the Eyes, it was covered with ſilken feathers, a little harder to the touch than thoſe black ones, of a moſt elegant golden green, ſuch as is wont to be ſeen in the necks of <hi>Peacocks</hi> and <hi>Mallards.</hi> The whole upper part of the Head as far as that ſilken clothing, was alſo covered with ſilken feathers, but hard to the touch, of a dark yellow colour. The whole Neck encompaſſed with ſhort feathers reſembling Pluſh, of a ſhining yellow colour like Gold. The back was all covered with feathers of the like ſhining golden yellow, to the touch reſembling hairs, lying many one upon another, which below were of a pale brown colour. The Wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers are all one longer than another. The Tail conſiſts of a few the like brown feathers, extended a little beyond the ends of the Wings, and is above three inches and an half long. At the very riſe of the Wings, and without the Wings in each ſide grow many very elegant feathers, ſupported by ſmall white ones: Some of theſe are ſix inches long, ſome a foot; but the middlemoſt and longeſt are a foot and half long, and white. All theſe feathers are moſt elegant, of a fine, thin, rare, or ſubtile texture. The number of feathers ſpringing out of both ſides amounts to about fifty in each; among which there are forty, a foot and half long apiece. Cluſius <hi>and others, who take theſe long feathers to belong to the Wings, are miſtaken; for they are not the Wing-feathers, but, as</hi> Marggravius <hi>truly hath delivered, ſpring out of each ſide under the Wings.</hi>

                        <p>I See that he <hi>[Aldrovandus</hi> he means] and all the reſt who have treated of this bird, agree in this, that they judge it to want feet, becauſe they had ſeen none but ſuch as were bereaved of their feet. Hereupon they did not ſtick to charge <hi>Antonius Pigafeta</hi> (who accompanying <hi>Magellane</hi> in the Ship <hi>Victoria,</hi> firſt ſailed round the World) with falſhood and lying, becauſe after his return from that long Voyage, giving the firſt notice of this Bird to the <hi>Europaeans</hi> in the Diary of his travel, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to it ſlender Legs a <note n="*" place="margin">An hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth.</note> Palm long. For my part, though hitherto, I confeſs, I have been in the ſame erroneous opinion with them, in thinking theſe birds to be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63869:54"/>
footleſs (contrary to the ſentence and judgment of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who affirms that no bird wants feet) becauſe thoſe which I hapned to ſee, both in my <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Voyage, ſtopping two months at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and alſo in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> in the Cabinets of ſundry perſons delighted in ſuch exotic things, were all without feet, and exentera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet at that time, to ſay the truth, I was not at all curious in obſerving, whether there were any difference between them. But the laſt Voyages of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>India</hi> have made me without difficulty to change my opinion; it being certain that there have been ſome brought over entire, and retaining ſtill their legs and feet: And by thoſe who ſaw them I underſtood, that their Legs were very like thoſe of a <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,</hi> but weaker, and not ſo thick, differing alſo in colour, as not being black, but tending to a Cheſnut. Notwithſtanding I had a great deſire my ſelf to ſee them, and if I could have got but one, preſently to have taken a draught thereof, that I might expoſe it to the view of the Reader, and confirm the truth and faithfulneſs of <hi>Piga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feta.</hi> But they having been for their rarity preſently bought up, and carried away to <hi>Francfurt</hi> on the <hi>Main,</hi> and one of them thence to the Emperour <hi>Rudolphus</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of that name (his Majeſty being, as I hear, greatly delighted in theſe kind of ſtrange forein things, and in the knowledge of all the wonders of nature) I was fruſtrated of my hope. But if it happens that there be any entire ones brought over, and that I get ſeaſonable notice of it, I will do my endeavour to procure one, at leaſt to borrow it, that I may ſet forth its figure, to confute and extirpate the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received opinion or conceit, that theſe birds want feet. Howbeit the Mariners that brought theſe Birds, though they went not to thoſe Iſlands where the birds them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves breed and live, yet were informed (as I was aſſured) by thoſe of whom they bought them, that they were all furniſhed with Feet, and did both walk and fly like other Birds: But that the Inhabitants ſo ſoon as they take them, do exenterate them, and cut off and caſt away their Legs, and then expoſe them to the Sun, that they may dry the more readily, and ſo dried, either keep them to ſell, or faſten them to their Helmets inſtead of Plumes of feathers. They added moreover, that thoſe birds lived in Woods, and were wont to fly thirty or forty together in flocks, accompanied with their King or Captain, who always flies high above the reſt; and (which ſeems to be fabulous) if they be thirſty, uſe to ſend out one of their company firſt to the water, to make trial of it, which if it receives no harm from drinking it, then the whole flock fly thither and drink: But if it returns ſick or indiſpoſed, the reſt avoid that water, and fly away to ſeek out ſome other. They further added, that the Iſlanders were wont to taint and infect this water, for to catch theſe Birds, after this manner. When they eſpy a flock of Birds, they mark diligently whither they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves, and as ſoon as they ſee the bird that was ſent out, after it hath drank flown back again, they preſently caſt poyſon into that water, which the whole flock coming to drink of, is infected, and becomes their prey. Beſides, that theſe Birds were wont ſometimes to be ſhot with Arrows: And if their <hi>King</hi> happens to be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and fall down, the reſt that are in that flock fall together with him, and yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be taken, as refuſing to live after they have loſt their <hi>King.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, they made two kinds of thoſe Birds: The one of the <hi>Greater,</hi> which were more beautiful, and the other of the <hi>Leſſer,</hi> which wereleſs beautiful: Affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that both kinds have their peculiar <hi>King,</hi> and different in colour. That the birds of the <hi>greater</hi> kind (whoſe <hi>King</hi> is of an elegant and beautiful colour) were found only in the Iſle <hi>Aru</hi> or <hi>Arou</hi> (for ſo that Vowel <hi>u</hi> is to be pronounced:) But that the Iſles called <hi>Papuas,</hi> nigh to the Iſland <hi>Gilolo,</hi> did produce the birds of the <hi>leſſer</hi> kind; and that their <hi>King</hi> was leſs handſom, covered with black feathers, for bigneſs equal to a <hi>Starling,</hi> and having ſome feathers like horſe-hairs. Perchance this black <hi>King</hi> may be the fourth <hi>Species</hi> ſet forth by <hi>Aldrovandus.</hi> Thoſe that ſold theſe Birds, being asked by the Mariners how they were called by the Inhabitants, anſwered <hi>Boëres,</hi> that is, Birds: For ſo they called all Birds, neither did they know how to diſtinguiſh them by peculiar names.</p>
                        <p>Now having ſeen a very elegant Bird of the greater ſort, and bigger alſo than the reſt of this kind, in the houſe of the famous <hi>Peter Paroias,</hi> Doctor of Phyſick, and primary Profeſſor in the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi> I took care to get the figure thereof cut, that I might ſet it forth, ſubjoyning a ſhort Hiſtory, as faithfully taken as I could; which ſhould by right have taken up the firſt place in the fifth Book of <hi>Exotics:</hi> But ſeeing the ſix firſt Books are already printed off, I thought fit to inſert it, with ſome other things I afterward got, into this <hi>Auctarium.</hi>

                        <head>§. IX. * <hi>A Bird of Paradiſe of the greater ſort.</hi> Cluſ.</head>
                        <p>THe bulk of the body of this bird came near for bigneſs to that of a <hi>Swallow.</hi> From the top of the Head to the Rump it ſcarce exceeded five inches length. The Crown from the Bill to the Eyes and Neck was covered with very thick-ſet, ſhort, little feathers, reſembling filaments or thrums of Silk; their upper parts or ends being of a yellow colour, the lower, where they are inſerted into the skin, duſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky. The under-part of the Head, next to the lower Chap of the Bill, was very thick-ſet with thrums rather than feathers, being very ſhort, and like to Velvet, of a deep black, from the Eyes as far as the Throat. The Throat as low down as the Breaſt was adorned with the like feathers or rather ſilken thrums, and thoſe of a deep green, ſo beautiful and ſhining, that there cannot more elegant ones be ſeen in the Neck of the <hi>wild Drake</hi> or <hi>Mallard.</hi> The feathers covering the Breaſt were alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fine and ſmall, but longer, and very ſoft, of a black colour inclining to red, ſo that they ſeemed to be nothing but ends of Silk. The Bill was but ſmall and ſharp-pointed, an inch and half long, black in the part next the Head, the top being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what whitiſh. In the Head alſo near the Bill appeared very ſmall footſteps of Eyes. The Back, Belly, and Tail-feathers were of a ferrugineous or dusky red colour. The Tail it ſelf conſiſted of ten pretty broad feathers, and was ſix inches and an half long; above which were two long and round feathers, ſomewhat like to Bow-ſtring, or Shoo-makers threads, but ſtiff, and dusky, of two feet and three or four inches length, proceeding from the ſame original [or root or ground, <hi>viz.</hi> the Rump] with the feathers of the Tail, <hi>viz.</hi> being <note n="*" place="margin">Cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> joyntly inſerted into the Rump. Theſe were pretty thick at their riſe, about their Quills or hollow part, from which they were ſet with frequent [thick-ſtanding] hairy or downy thrums <hi>[ſtamina]</hi> ſuch as other feathers are compounded of; for the ſpace of four inches or a little more on the one ſide, and on the other for their third parts: Thence they grew ſlenderer by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to their very ends; and though they were deſtitute of thoſe hairs, yet were they rough, as if they had been cut off. The feathers in the Wings were of various length: For ſome (to wit, the loweſt which ſtood very thick) exceeded not the length of ſix inches, yea, ſome were ſhorter than ſo: Others were eight or nine inches long; others twelve; but the longeſt a foot and half: There is alſo in them great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of colours; for ſome are of a ſhining golden colour, ſome, eſpecially the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower in the ſides of the Wings, were of a dusky red, as it were a black ſanguine, but ſhining: But thoſe that covered the reſt were of a pale aſh-colour, and their ſides thinner-ſet with villoſe or downy threads: In ſhort, they were all very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which if I might I would willingly have got cut and ſet forth in a Table, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they grew ſo thick, it could not conveniently be done without marring the ſhape of the whole Bird.</p>
                        <p>Another of the ſame kind I afterwards ſaw in the hands of that noble and learned Perſon <hi>Joſeph Scaliger,</hi> ſomewhat leſſer in bulk of body, as being but four inches and an half long from Head to Rump, but yet the feathers of the Tail were of the ſame length with thoſe of that next above deſcribed; yet thoſe round and long feathers like to Nerves, joyntly ſpringing out of the Rump, did not exceed the length of one foot and nine Inches, elſe about their Quils ſet with the like hairs and downy thrums, on the one ſide to the length of three inches from the Quill, on the other to almoſt five; and thence they grew ſmaller to the very ends, and were ſomething rough, eſpecially about the ends, but not ſo as thoſe of the precedent. The feathers in the Wings were likewiſe of a different length, as in the former: Neither was the bird very unlike to that, nor the variety of colours diverſe from it; ſo that it ſeemed to differ only in age. The Bill was an inch and half long, in part dusky, the reſt being white.</p>
                        <p>Beſides I ſaw at his houſe another, ſomewhat leſſer in bulk of body, and not ſo flat, having a very little Head, the Bill being of almoſt equal bigneſs with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, but narrower, and of a bluiſh dusky colour, having two holes for reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the upper part next the Head, like the precedent. The Crown of the head was cloathed with very ſhort feathers, or rather hairs, like thrums of ſilk, but not of ſo elegant a colour as in the precedent, but of a kind of ſooty yellow. Beſides, the border of feathers compaſſing the Bill on the upper ſide was not of that breadth as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63869:55"/>
in thoſe, yet in like manner of a black colour: The Plumage alſo wherewith the Throat was covered was of a green ſhining colour as in the precedent, but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the breadth of ones little finger. The Back from the Neck to the Rump was indeed clothed with the like fine ſlender feathers; but of a different colour, <hi>viz.</hi> a yellowiſh aſh-colour: But the Breaſt-feathers were of like colour with thoſe of the precedent: The Plumage alſo of that part next the Rump agreed with theirs. Of what colour the Tail-feathers were I cannot tell, for that it wanted a Rump: For which cauſe I know not whether it had or wanted thoſe long, round Nerves, with which as many Birds of this ſort as I have yet ſeen were furniſhed. The Wing-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were of different length as in the former: Nor were they much unlike to them in colour; but thoſe that were the longeſt had their ſides thinner-ſet with downy fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and were of a much whiter colour than the feathers of the above deſcribed, being a foot and half long. Now whether that colour of the feathers covering the Back differing from the foregoing, makes or ſignifies diverſity of Sex, as ſome think, I cannot ſay; but <hi>John de Weely</hi> told me, that this was of the ſecond kind, <hi>viz.</hi> of thoſe that are bred in the Iſlands <hi>Papuae,</hi> and that ſuch do indeed want thoſe Nerves, but not the Tail, and for that cauſe <note n="*" place="margin">I ſuppoſe he means thoſe two long Nerves or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhafts of feathers.</note> they cannot make the difference of Sex, as the Vulgar think.</p>
                        <p>A certain Citizen of <hi>Leyden</hi> had a bird altogether like to this laſt of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> wanting the Rump and Tail, and alſo thoſe two long Nerves; which note whether it did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh all Birds of that kind from others, was to me unknown (becauſe I had only obſerved theſe two, that had this note, as far as I remember: Or if I did before hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ſee the like, they ſlipt out of my memory, becauſe at that time I was not ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and curious in taking exact notice of the forms of theſe and the like birds) but (as I ſaid a little before) <hi>John de Weely</hi> ſatisfied me and removed all doubt as to that point.</p>
                        <p>Further when I had proceeded thus far in treating of this Bird, the ſame <hi>John de Weely</hi> a Citizen and Merchant of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> a very curteous and obliging perſon, who had ſold the like Bird entire, with its Feet ſtill remaining to it, to the Emperour, informed me this <hi>June, Anno</hi> 1605. (for I had enquired of him the <hi>May</hi> foregoing) that that Bird of Paradiſe was of the greater kind, which have thoſe two Nerves growing out of their Rump, and that they have a flatter body, and not ſo round as thoſe that are brought out of the <hi>Papuae</hi> Iſlands: That its Feet were like a Hawks or a Pullets, very foul and unhandſom, clapped cloſe to the body of the bird, ſo that the Toes only appeared: And that he was of opinion, that all Birds of Paradiſe had the like feet; but that the Inhabitants for their uglineſs and deformity did together with their Legs cut them off and caſt them away. The ſame thing about the end of <hi>June</hi> he confirmed to me being preſent by word of mouth.</p>

                        <p>THat little Bird which I underſtood to be called the <hi>King</hi> of the greater ſort of <hi>Birds of Paradiſe,</hi> was a very rare one. For though (as I ſaid before) I had often ſeen <hi>Birds of Paradiſe</hi> both at <hi>Lisbon</hi> and other places, and the <hi>Holland</hi> Pilots and Ship-maſters, who are now wont to ſail yearly into the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> coming back from their Voyages, do almoſt always bring home ſome of theſe Birds, yet was it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my hap to ſee a <hi>King,</hi> till the year 1603. <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> in the hands of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Merchant, who was wont to buy up ſuch like exotic things among the Mariners returned home, that he might make a great profit by ſelling them again to others. But in the beginning of the following year <hi>Emmanuel Swerts,</hi> a very honeſt man, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of the ſame City, gave me notice that he had the like: Whereupon I prevailed with him to lend me the Bird for a few days, that I might deſcribe it, and get its figure cut in a table. And ſeeing I have mentioned it a little before, and no man hitherto (as far as I know) hath ſet forth the like, I thought my ſelf obliged in this place to propoſe its deſcription, annexing its figure.</p>
                        <p>This Bird was leſs than other <hi>Birds</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and of different feathers: For from the Head to the Tail it ſcarce exceeded two inches length. Its head was very ſmall, which together with its Bill was but an Inch and half long, of which length alſo the Tail was. But the Wings were much larger than the whole body of the bird, as being four Inches and an half long, and reaching two inches beyond the end of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63869:55"/>
Tail. The colour of the Bill was white, the upper parts being an inch long, was covered half way with elegant, ſhort feathers or hairs, of a red colour, like ſilken thrums, as alſo the whole forepart of the head: The lower part of the Bill was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an inch long, yet a thought ſhorter than the upper. The middle part of the Head about the Eyes on each ſide had little black ſpots impreſſed. The Neck and Breaſt were covered with fine ſlender feathers of a deep red or ſanguine colour, ſo that they ſeemed to be no more than certain ſilken thrums or filaments. All the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert-feathers of the Back, Wings, and Tail were almoſt of one and the ſame colour. Each Wing conſiſted of thirteen prime feathers, which were on the upper ſide of a dusky red, on the under ſide of a dusky yellow. The Tail contained ſeven or eight dusky or brown feathers. The lower or under ſide of the body under the Breaſt was adorned with a kind of ring of the breadth almoſt of ones little finger, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of black feathers as it were ſilken thrums. The feathers on the Belly were white, but thoſe next the Wings black; and of thoſe there were four or five in each ſide a little longer than the reſt; <hi>viz.</hi> equal to two inches, and which ended in a broad top of a curious ſhining green, not unlike that of a <hi>Mallards</hi> Neck. Out of the Rump among the feathers of the Tail proceeded two ſtrings as it were horſe-hairs, ſlender, but ſtiff, ſeven or eight inches long, altogether black, only their ends for an inches length were reflected round, and on one ſide ſet with very fine hairs or downy threads, which were on the upper ſide of a deep ſhining green, beautiful to behold, almoſt like the feathers on a wild <hi>Drake</hi> or <hi>Mallards</hi> Neck, adding a great grace to the whole body of the Bird; but the underſide of theſe feathers was of a dusky colour I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood alſo that there were ſome Birds, which had thoſe briſtly ſtrings, croſſing one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other towards their ends.</p>

The ſilly bird returning, ſits on this Egg. hatches it, and with a great deal of care and toil broods, feeds, and cheriſhes the young <hi>Cuckow</hi> for her own, until it be grown up and able to fly and ſhift for it ſelf. Which thing ſeems ſo ſtrange, monſtrous, and abſurd, that for my part I cannot ſufficiently wonder there ſhould be ſuch an example in nature; nor could I have ever been induced to believe that ſuch a thing had been done by Natures inſtinct, had I not with my own eyes ſeen it. For Nature in other things is wont conſtantly to obſerve one and the ſame Law and Order agreeable to the higheſt reaſon and prudence: Which in this caſe is, that the Dams make Neſts for themſelves, if need be, ſit upon their own Eggs, and bring up their Young after they are hatcht.</p>
                     <p>What becomes of the <hi>Cuckow</hi> in the Winter-time, whether hiding her ſelf in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <note place="margin">What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the Cuckow in Winter.</note> Trees, or other holes and Caverns, ſhe lies torpid, and at the return of the Spring revives again; or rather at the approach of Winter, being impatient of cold, ſhifts place and departs into hot Countrys, is not as yet to me certainly known. <hi>Aldrovan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> writes, that it is by long obſervation found, that ſhe doth in the Winter enter into the hollows of trees, or the Caverns of Rocks and the earth, and there lie hid all that ſeaſon. Some (ſaith he) tell a ſtory of a certain Country-man of <hi>Zurich</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> who having laid a Log on the fire in Winter, heard a <hi>Cuckow</hi> cry in it. For being of a very tender nature, and impatient of cold (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> witneſſeth) no wonder, if to avoid the Winter-cold, it hide it ſelf in holes, eſpecially ſeeing at that time it moults its feathers. We alſo have heard of the like ſtories in <hi>England,</hi> and have known ſome who have affirmed themſelves in the middle of Winter, in a more than uſually mild and warm ſeaſon, to have heard the voice of the <hi>Cuckow.</hi> But ſeeing it is moſt certain, that many ſorts of Birds do at certain Seaſons of the year ſhift places, and depart into other Countrys, as for example <hi>Quails, Woodcocks, Fieldfares, Storks,</hi> &amp;c. Why may not <hi>Cuckows</hi> alſo do the ſame? For my part I never yet met with any credible perſon that dared affirm, that himſelf had found or ſeen a <hi>Cuckow</hi> in Winter-time taken out of a hollow tree, or any other lurking-place.</p>
                     <p>Since the writing of this, reading <hi>Jo. Faber</hi> his Expoſitions of the Pictures of ſome <hi>Mexican</hi> Animals of <hi>Nardi Antonio Recchi,</hi> I find alleged the teſtimony of a credible perſon and an eye-witneſs, one <hi>Theophilus Molitor,</hi> a Friend of <hi>Fabers,</hi> for this lurking of <hi>Cuckows</hi> in hollow trees. <hi>Molitor</hi> affirmed this to have hapned at his Fathers houſe. His Grandfathers Servants having ſtocked up in a certain Meadow ſome old, dry, rotten Willows, and brought them home, and caſt the heads of two of them into the Furnace to heat the Stove, heard as they were in the Stove a <hi>Cuckow</hi> ſinging three times. Wondring at this cry of the <hi>Cuckow</hi> in the Winter-time, out they go, and drawing the heads of the Willows out of the Furnace, in the one of them they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſomething move; wherefore taking an Axe they opened the hole, and thruſting in their hands, firſt they pluckt out nothing but meer feathers: Afterward they got hold of a living Animal, that was the very <hi>Cuckow,</hi> and drew it out. It was indeed brisk and lively, but wholly naked and bare of feathers, and without any Winter-proviſion of food, which <hi>Cuckow</hi> the Boys kept two whole years in the Stove.</p>

                        <p>OF this Bird <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> gives us three figures, and three deſcriptions, which I ſuſpect to be all of one and the ſame ſort: The firſt is taken out of <hi>Geſner,</hi> the two laſt were compoſed by himſelf, of his own obſervation. The firſt (they are <hi>Geſners</hi> words) was as big or bigger than a Gooſe; had great Wings, two Feet, and three inches long, when extended in a right line from their beginning to the end of the longeſt feather, from the top of the uppermoſt bone of the Wing, to the loweſt end was in a right line thirteen inches. The Head both for ſhape and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was like a <hi>Cats,</hi> for which reaſon the <hi>French</hi> do not improperly call it <hi>Chat huant</hi> [q. <hi>felis gemebunda.]</hi> Above each Ear ſtuck out black feathers, three inches high. The Eyes were great: The feathers about the Rump thick and very ſoft, of more than a fingers length, or an handful high, if my memory fail me not. From the point of the Bill to the end of the Feet or of the Tail (for they were both equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) it was two foot and ſeven inches long. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes were of a deep ſhining yellow or Saffron-colour. The Bill ſhort, black, and hooked. The feathers being put aſide the Ear-holes came into ſight, which were great and open. On both ſides by the Noſthrils grew hair-like feathers, as it were beards <hi>[barbulae.]</hi> The colour of the feathers all over the body was various, of whitiſh, black, and reddiſh ſpots. The length of the Leg was thirteen inches: The part above the knee thick and brawny: The Claws black, hooked, and very ſharp: The Foot hairy or feathered down to the very Claws, the feathers being of a pale red.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus)</hi> for bigneſs agreed exactly with this, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in many other particulars. For though its Feet were indeed hairy down to the Claws, as in that, yet ſhorter and ſlenderer, neither ſo brawny above the knees, nor ſo thick and ſtrong-ſhanked. The colour of the whole body was fulvous [or of a ruſty aſh-colour] eſpecially of the Breaſt, where it was marked with blackiſh ſpots drawn long-ways, promiſcuouſly here and there in no order. The Back and Wings are of a darker brown or ferrugineous dusky colour. But the main difference is that that of <hi>Geſner</hi> hath all the particular feathers of its whole body more variegated with
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63869:57"/>
certain tranſverſe narrow lines like the feathers of ſome kinds of Ducks, Partridges, and Hawks. Beſides, it differs in that the whole body, but eſpecially the Back and Head are marked with certain black ſtrakes, irregularly drawn, and as it were figured; whereas mine (ſaith he) was not ſo painted, but in the great feathers of the Wings and Tail diſtinguiſhed with broad, tranſverſe, blackiſh lines or bars; which lines are ſo formed, eſpecially in the Tail, that each of the broader are terminated above and below by other narrower ones, like borders or fringes, diſpoſed in a triple order, and at certain intervals diſtant from each other, as in Hawks. This had great and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharp Talons, not black, as in that, but of a horn-colour. The Tail in both was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third was in all things like the ſecond, ſave that the Legs were not hairy, and both Legs and Feet weak.</p>
                        <p>Of this kind of Owl we ſaw one in <hi>France</hi> at the Kings Palace of <hi>Bois de Vincennes:</hi> And two in his Majeſties Park of St. <hi>James</hi> near <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> They were as big as <hi>Eagles:</hi> Their Legs and Feet hairy down to the Claws. They had three fore-toes in each foot; but the outmoſt of them was ſo framed that it could be turned back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and made ſtand like a hind-toe. So that in that reſpect there is no difference between this and other ſorts of <hi>Owls,</hi> but this may as well be ſaid to have two back toes as they; whatever <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> hath delivered to the contrary. Their colour was much like to that of a <hi>Bittour,</hi> the feathers being marked with long black ſtroaks in the middle, the out-ſides of a light bay. About the Belly ſome of the feathers were beautified with tranſverſe lines. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes were of a reddiſh yellow or flame colour, [rather of a golden.]</p>
                        <p>That Owl which <hi>Marggravius</hi> deſcribes under the name of <hi>Jacurutu</hi> of the <hi>Braſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> ſeems to be altogether the ſame with this. It is (ſaith he) for bigneſs equal to a <hi>Gooſe:</hi> Hath a round Head like a Cat; a hooked black Bill, the upper Chap being longer: Great, riſing, round Eyes, ſhining like Cryſtal, compaſſed toward the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide with a Circle of yellow. The Circumference of the Eye ſomething greater than a <hi>Miſnian</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">A piece of money ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, of the bigneſs of a two-pence or three-pence.</note> groſs. Near the Ear-holes it hath feathers two inches long, which ſtick up, and end in a ſharp point like Ears. The Tail is broad; the Wings reach not to the end of it. The Legs are feathered down to the Feet, in which are four Toes, three ſtanding forward, and one backward, and in each a crooked black Talon, above an inch long, and very ſharp. The feathers of the whole body are elegantly variega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with yellow, white, and black.</p>
                        <p>It is ſaid to build on high and inacceſſible Rocks: It preys not only on ſmall birds, but alſo <hi>Conies</hi> and <hi>Hares</hi> like the <hi>Eagle.</hi> Yea, (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus)</hi> there is no Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal gathers ſo much prey by night as this <hi>Owl,</hi> eſpecially when ſhe brings up her Young. For ſhe not only provides ſufficient for her ſelf and hers, but is very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to them that find her Neſt. For while ſhe flies out a pourveying for more, they privily ſteal away that ſhe had before laid up, only leaving ſo much as may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for nouriſhing the Young.</p>

                        <p>THat we deſcribed was a Female: It weighed ten ounces: Its length from the point of the Bill to the end of the Tail was fourteen Inches and an half: Its <note place="margin">Its weight, length, and breadth.</note> breadth, meaſuring from tip to tip of the Wings extended, three foot and four inches. The Bill was black, from the point to the Angles of the Mouth one inch and half quarter: The Tongue fleſhy, and a little divided. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes of a lovely <note place="margin">Its Beak, Tongue, Eyes, Hood of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> yellow: The covers of the Ears large. The ring of feathers, compaſſing the face like a womans hood, conſiſts of a double row, the exteriour variegated with ſmall white, black, and red lines; the interiour under the Eyes red; where they are contiguous both black. The forehead or ends of the two wreaths at the Bill more cinereous.</p>
                        <p>The feathers which cover the lower Belly and Legs are reddiſh; in the Throat and Breaſt the middle parts of the feathers are black, the outer parts partly white, and <note place="margin">Colour of the feathers.</note> partly yellow: Thoſe under the Wings are red. At the bottoms of the foremoſt beam-feathers is a great tranſverſe black ſpot: Higher in the very bending, and under the baſtard-wing a broad bed or border of black: The reſt of the covert-feathers of the Wings are parti-coloured, of a dark cinereous and yellow. The Back was of the

The Horns were above an Inch long, conſiſting of ſix feathers, the middle <note place="margin">The Horns or Ears.</note> parts of which were black, the exteriour edges being red, the interiour white, ſprinked with dusky ſpecks.</p>

                        <p>THe Bird which the <hi>Italians,</hi> eſpecially about <hi>Bononia</hi> call <hi>Chiuuino</hi> is the leaſt ſave one of all Rapacious Nocturnal Birds, bigger than a <hi>Thruſh,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſſer than a <hi>Pigeon,</hi> full nine inches long. It differs from the <hi>Bubo</hi> only in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, and ſomething in colour. Its Head is round like a Ball, covered with ſmall ſoft feathers, all over of a lead-colour. The Bill ſhort, hooked, and black. The Ears or feathers ſtanding up in faſhion of Ears, ſcarce appear in a dead bird, but are more manifeſt in a living, and conſiſt only of one feather apiece. The chief colour of the whole body, as far as appears to ſight, is cinereous, having here and there ſomething of plumbeous mingled with it, curiouſly ſpeckled with many white ſpots, more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly than any other Nocturnal Rapacious bird. In the greater feathers of the Wings and Tail it is marked with tranſverſe white ſpots: All the other feathers beſides theſe tranſverſe marks are diſtinguiſhed long-ways with a black line running through their middles. It is alſo beſprinkled all over with a lovely tincture of red, eſpecially about the Neck and the beginning of the Wings. The feathers on the Belly are whiter than elſewhere, the bottom or lower part of them, as alſo of all the reſt, being black: particularly, theſe are red about the middle, elſe white, powdered with very ſmall black ſpecks. The Eyes like moſt other night-birds of a fiery ſhining Saffron colour: The Legs feathered, and of a reddiſh aſh-colour: The Feet ſmall, naked, ſcaly, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to a dark lead-colour, divided into two fore, and two back-toes, armed with dusky Claws.

                        <head>§. I. <hi>The common brown or Ivy-Owl,</hi> Strix. <hi>Aldrov.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THe Bird we deſcribed was a Cock; It was about the bigneſs of a <hi>Pigeon,</hi> but rounder-bodied, and ſeeming bigger than it was. It weighed twelve ounces and an half. Its length from the tip of the beak to the end of the Tail was fourteen inches: Its breadth, or the diſtance between the extremities of the Wings ſpread, two feet and nine inches.</p>
                        <p>The Bill from the point to the angles of the mouth was an inch long or more, of a horn-colour, or rather a light blue. The mouth was wider, but the Bill ſhorter than in the <hi>Barn-Owl.</hi> The Tongue not very fleſhy, nor broad, a little divided at the tip. <note place="margin">The Tongue, Eyes,</note> In the Palate was a cavity equal to the Tongue. It hath huge Eyes, at leaſt twice ſo big as thoſe of the Barn or white Owl, and protuberant. It had Membranes for Nictation, drawn from above downwards, having black edges. The borders of the Eye-lids were broader than ordinary, and their edges red. The Ear-holes were <note place="margin">Ears,</note> three times as great as in the white Owl, and covered with Valves. A circle of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers encompaſſes the Eyes and Chin, like a womans hood, as in the <hi>Barn-Owl,</hi> but <note place="margin">Circle of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers about the face.</note> not ſtanding up ſo high as in that. This circle or hood conſiſts of a double row of feathers, the exteriour more rigid, variegated with white, black, and red; the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour conſiſting of ſoft feathers, of a white mingled with a flame-colour. The mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle part of the head without the hood is of a dark brown. The exteriour circle of the hood compaſſes the ears; the greateſt part of the interiour feathers of it, where it paſſes the ears, grows out of the covers of the Ears. The Eyes in this Bird are nearer to the Ears than in any other Animal I know. Beyond the Noſthrils and below the Eyes grew briſtly feathers having black ſhafts. The back and upper ſide of the <note place="margin">Colour of the upper ſide,</note> body was particoloured of ferrugineous and dark brown, the black taking up the middle part of each feather, and the ferrugineous the out-ſides. If one curiouſly view and obſerve each ſingle feather, one ſhall find them waved with tranſverſe lines, cinereous and brown alternately ſucceeding each other. The belly and lower ſide of <note place="margin">Underſide.</note> the body is of the ſame colour with the back, but more dilute with a mixture of white. The bottoms of all the feathers are black. In this and other Owls the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inveſting the whole body are longer or taller than in moſt other birds, ſo that the bird ſeems to be much bigger than indeed it is. The feet are covered almoſt down to the Claws with a thick dirty-white Plumage, ſprinkled with ſmall dark ſpecks, [rather waved with dark lines] only two or three of the annulary ſcales bare.</p>
                        <p>The number of flag-feathers in each Wing was twenty four. The exteriour <hi>[pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulae]</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The Wing-feathers.</note> webs of the outmoſt whereof were terminated in ſlender points like briſtles, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from each other, and ſtanding like the teeth of a fine Comb. The Wing and Tail-feathers were marked with ſix or ſeven croſs bars of a dirty white, tincted in ſome with ferrugineous, and in ſome with brown. The Wings complicated fall very much ſhort of the end of the Tail. The covert feathers of the Wings, chiefly thoſe about the middle, and thoſe long ones ſpringing from the ſhoulders were ſpotted with white, eſpecially their interiour Vanes.</p>
                        <p>The Tail was ſix inches and an half long, made up of twelve feathers, the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <note place="margin">The Tail.</note> being the longeſt, the reſt in order ſhorter to the outmoſt: All ending in ſharp points, whereas in thoſe of the Barn-Owl the tops were blunt.</p>
                        <p>The ſoal of the foot was callous, of a horny or blackiſh colour. That of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-toe <note place="margin">The Feet, Toes, and Claws.</note> had not the inner edge ſerrate, as in the <hi>white Owl.</hi> All the toes were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to the very divarication. The outmoſt of the fore-toes is made to turn alſo back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſupply the room of a back-toe, as in the reſt of this kind.</p>
                        <p>The Guts were thirty inches long, and had many revolutions. The blind Guts <note place="margin">The Guts and Entrails.</note> were five inches and an half long, toward their ends tumid and full of excrement: The Liver divided into two Lobes. It had a large Gall; great black Teſticles. The ſtomach ſeemed to be more fleſhy than in other carnivorous birds: and above it a granulated <hi>Echinus</hi> or ante-ſtomach. In the ſtomach we found the fur of Mice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="103" facs="tcp:63869:58"/>
It differs remarkably from the white Owl in that the extreme feather of the Wing <note place="margin">How it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the white Owl.</note> is little, and at leaſt a hand-breadth ſhorter than the third and fourth; the ſecond above an inch ſhorter than the third, and the fourth and fifth the longeſt of all; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in that the ſecond and third feathers are the longeſt, and the extreme or <hi>Sarcel</hi> wants not half an inch of them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> writes, that the Country-people about <hi>Bononia</hi> told him, that his <hi>Strix</hi> or <hi>Screech-Owl</hi> uſed to ſuck their Goats: which ours (as far as I have heard) was never complained of for doing.</p>

                        <p>ANother Bird of this ſort we deſcribed, which we found firſt at <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Its weight, length, and breadth.</note> and afterward in <hi>England</hi> alſo. It weighed eleven ounces and an hlaf. The length from the Bill to end of the Tail or Feet (for they were equally extended) was fourteen inches and an half: The breadth between the tips of the Wings ſpread out two foot and eleven inches. The Bill was an inch and quarter long: The Tongue <note place="margin">Its Bill, Tongue, Noſthrils,</note> a little divided, not ſo fleſhy as in <hi>Hawks.</hi> In the Palate it had a broad open fiſſure or cleft. The Noſthrils were oblong. The Sear or skin covering the Baſe of the Beak in diurnal Rapacious birds, was wanting in this, as in all other <hi>Owls.</hi> It had huge, round Eyes; the <hi>Irides</hi> being of a dark Hazel colour. Both upper and lower Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid <note place="margin">Eyes,</note> terminate in a membrane having black edges. The Ear-holes were great and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <note place="margin">Ears.</note> with Valves.</p>
                        <p>This Bird was for the apparent magnitude very light and full of feathers. A wreath or hood of ſtiffer feathers parti-coloured of white and black, beginning from the Bill <note place="margin">The hood about the face.</note> above, and reaching beyond the Ears, encompaſſes the Face and Eyes; the ends meeting under the Chin like a womans hood. Within this greater hood another circle of feathers of an aſh-colour, conſiſting of thinner and ſhorter hairs encompaſſes the Eyes. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is all over variegated with cinereous and brown. The ſhafts of the feathers in the middle of the back are black. The interiour Vanes of the long ſcapular feathers are white almoſt to the ſhafts. The lower belly is white. On the Breaſt are long black ſpots.</p>
                        <p>The firſt row of Wing-feathers had croſs bars of black and reddiſh aſh-colour. In <note place="margin">The Wing-feathers.</note> In the third row of the covert-feathers of the Wings were one or two white ſpots.</p>
                        <p>The Tail had twelve feathers, ſeven inches and a quarter long, the middlemoſt fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">The Tail.</note> being longeſt, and the reſt in order to the outmoſt ſomewhat ſhorter.</p>
                        <p>The Feet were feathered almoſt down to the Claws, only two or three annulary <note place="margin">The Feet.</note> ſcales naked. The ſole of the foot callous, and of a yellowiſh colour, as it were granulated with little knobs. The Toes, as in other Night-birds, two ſtanding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <note place="margin">Toes,</note> and two backward. The inner ſide of the Claw of the outer fore-toe is flatted <note place="margin">Claws,</note> into an edge.</p>
                        <p>The length of the Guts was twenty two inches, of the blind Guts three and an <note place="margin">Guts.</note> half.</p>
                        <p>The name <hi>Strix</hi> ſome think is taken from the Verb <hi>ſtringere,</hi> becauſe it ſtrangles <note place="margin">Reaſon of the name.</note> people when they are aſleep. <hi>Ovid</hi> will have it ſo called <hi>à ſtridore,</hi> from the ſcreech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noiſe it makes:</p>

                        </q>
                        <p>This is like the precedent, and of equal bigneſs, from which yet it is diſtinguiſhed <note place="margin">How it differs from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.</note> by manifeſt notes, and which argue a ſpecifical difference. The chief of thoſe are: 1. That this is grey, that brown. 2. That this hath long ſpots on the Breaſt, which that wants. 3. That the interiour hood in this is particoloured only of dusky and white.</p>

                        <p>THe Cock (which we deſcribed) was about the bigneſs of a <hi>Pigeon;</hi> weighed <note place="margin">Its bigneſs and meaſures.</note> eleven ounces and an half. Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail was fourteen inches. The diſtance between the extremities of the Wings ſpread out three foot and one inch and half. The Bill white, hooked at the end, <note place="margin">The Bill,</note> more than an inch and half long: The Tongue a little divided at the tip; the Noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrils <note place="margin">Tongue,</note> oblong. A circle or wreath of white, ſoft, downy feathers encompaſſed with <note place="margin">Hood,</note> yellow ones, beginning from the Noſthrils on each ſide, paſſed round the Eyes and under the Chin, ſomewhat reſembling a black hood, ſuch as women uſe to wear: So that the Eyes were ſunk in the middle of theſe feathers, as it were in the bottom of a Pit or Valley. At the interiour angle of each Eye the lower parts of theſe feathers were of a tawny colour. The Ears were covered with a Valve, which ariſes near <note place="margin">Ear-valve.</note> the Eye, and falls backwards. The interiour circle we mentioned of white, downy feathers paſſed juſt over this Valve, ſo that part of them grew out of it.</p>
                        <p>The Breaſt, Belly, and covert-feathers of the inſide of the Wings were white, <note place="margin">Colour of the feathers of the body.</note> marked with a few quadrangular dark ſpots. The Head, Neck, and Back, as far as the prime feathers of the Wings, variouſly and of all Night-birds moſt elegantly colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The feathers toward the tips were waved with ſmall whitiſh and blackiſh lines, reſembling a grey colour; but about the ſhaft of each feather there was as it were a bed or row of black and white ſpots, ſituate long-ways, made up in ſome of two white and two black ſpots, in ſome of three of each colour, in ſome of but one. Elſe the whole Plumage was of a dilute tawny or orange colour; which ſame colour was alſo the field or ground in the Wings and Tail.</p>
                        <p>The maſter-feathers in each Wing were in number twenty four; whereof the <note place="margin">The Wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers.</note> greater have four tranſverſe blackiſh bars. [In theſe bars in the exteriour Vane of the feather there is alſo white mingled with the black, which makes an appearance of a grey ſpot.] The intermediate ſpaces are fulvous, and powdered with ſmall black ſpecks; the tips of theſe feathers incline more to an aſh-colour. The Wings when ſhut up extend full as far or further than the end of the Tail. In the exteriour Vanes of the firſt or outmoſt feather of each Wing the ends of the <note n="*" place="margin">Hair-like bodies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the web of the feather. The Tail.</note> 
                           <hi>Pinnulae</hi> are not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous one to another, but ſtand at diſtance, like the teeth of a fine Comb.</p>
                        <p>The Tail is made up of twelve feathers, of the ſame colour with the Wings, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving four tranſverſe black bars: four inches and half long. The interiour margins of the feathers both of Wings and Tail are white.</p>
                        <p>The Legs are covered with a thick Down to the Feet, but the Toes are only hairy, <note place="margin">The legs, feet, and toes.</note> the hairs alſo thin-ſet The Claw of the middle Toe is ſerrate on the inſide as in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,</hi> but not ſo manifeſtly. It hath but one Toe that ſtands backward; but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fore-toe may be turned ſo as to ſtand a little backward.</p>
                        <p>The Guts were eighteen inches long; the blind Guts but two. It had a large Gall: <note place="margin">The Guts.</note> Its Eggs were white.</p>

                           <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> his deſcription agrees exactly with ours.</p>
                        <p>The Eye in this Bird, and I ſuppoſe in all the reſt of this kind, is of a ſtrange and ſingular ſtructure. That part which appears outwardly, though great, is only the <note place="margin">The ſtrange figure of the Eyes.</note> 
                           <hi>Iris.</hi> For the whole bulb or ball of the Eye when taken out ſomewhat reſembles a hat or Helmet, the <hi>Iris</hi> being the Crown, the part not appearing and extending it ſelf good way further, the brims. The interiour edges of the Eye-lids round about are yellow. The Eyes are altogether fixt and immovable.</p>
                        <p>The Bird is deſcribed by <hi>Marggravius</hi> under the title of <hi>Tuidara</hi> of <hi>Braſil;</hi> ſo that it ſeems it is common with us to the <hi>New World.</hi>

Between the Eyes and the Bill grew certain ſtiff, ſlender feathers, like briſtles or beards. It had more white on the Belly than the other parts. I ſuppoſe it lives and frequents chiefly in Mountainous and Rocky places, and therefore to defend the cold hath its Feet and Toes feathered like the <hi>Lagopus</hi> and <hi>Grygallus.</hi> For the other <hi>Noctuae</hi> have not their Feet rough, neither are they of a reddiſh colour.

                     <p>THe <hi>Parrot</hi> hath a great Head, a hard Beak and Skull. But why Nature gave it a hooked Bill, whereas it is rather a Frugivorous than a Carnivorous or Rapacious Bird, <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> gives this reaſon: Becauſe for the weakneſs of the Feet, deſcending or climbing up boughs or grates, it could not commodiouſly ſuſtain the weight of its body, were not the Bill of that crooked ſemicircular figure, that it can as it were with a hook or grapple catch hold of whatever is near. For the <hi>Parrot</hi> in climbing Walls or Trees firſt catches hold with her Bill, as it were with a Hook, then draws up her body, then faſtens her Feet; then reaching up higher claps on her Beak again, and ſo puts forward her body and feet alternately.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Parrot</hi> alone with the <hi>Crocodile</hi> moves the upper Jaw, as all other Animals do the lower. The Tongue is broad, which is common to it with other Rapacious birds, of the figure of a <hi>Gourd-ſeed,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> notes. Hence it is called in <hi>Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> both becauſe its Tongue reſembles a mans, and alſo becauſe it imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates humane ſpeech. The Feet are of a ſingular faſhion, for they have not three Toes ſtanding forward and one backward, but two each way, like <hi>Woodpeckers. Jo. Faber,</hi> in his Expoſitions of <hi>Nardi Antonio Recchi</hi> his Animals found in <hi>New Spain,</hi> hath noted and obſerved concerning the Toes of <hi>Parrots</hi> ſomething not mentioned by any Author, <hi>viz.</hi> That when they walk, climb up, or deſcend down the ſides of their Cages, they ſtretch two of their Toes forward, and two backward; but when they take their meat, and bring it to their mouths, they make uſe of three Toes to hold it till they have eaten it up. Yea, (which may ſeem wonderful) they do ſo dexterouſly and nimbly turn the greater hind-toe forward and backward, that on ſight of it you would confeſs your ſelf not to know, whether it were given them by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be uſed as a fore-toe in feeding, or a back-toe in walking. <hi>So that it ſeems in this reſpect they reſemble Owls.</hi> It hath crooked Claws, wherewith it holds its meat like Rapacious birds, and brings it to its mouth, after the manner of men. For taking it in its Toes it lifts it up to its mouth, not turning the foot inward, but outward, after a faſhion not only uſual and ridiculous, but one would think alſo incommodious. It doth not only firſt of all with its Bill as it were with Teeth break or divide entire <hi>Almonds,</hi> but rolling them up and down within the Cavity of its Bill, doth as it were champ and chew them, ſoftning them before it ſwallows them. <hi>Parrots</hi> while they are yet wild and at liberty do eat all ſorts of grain and pulſe. And this is peculiarly obſerved of them above other creatures, that as <hi>Swallows</hi> feed upon <hi>Hellebore,</hi> and <hi>Starlings</hi> upon <hi>Hemlock,</hi> ſo do they upon the ſeed of <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Cuicus</hi> or <hi>Carthamus.</hi>

                        <hi>Baſtard Saffron</hi> (which to man is a purgative) not only without receiving harm thereby, but growing fat with it. Moreover, they eat all ſorts of fruits, as well ſuch as are covered with a ſoft rind, as thoſe with a hard ſhell, <hi>viz.</hi> Nuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are greatly delighted in them.</p>
                     <p>They do not only imitate mans voice, but in wit excell all other birds, as <hi>Aldrovan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> proves by many Hiſtories and examples. I ſhall not think much to ſet down one very pleaſant ſtory, which <hi>Geſner</hi> ſaith was told him by a certain friend, of a <hi>Parrot,</hi> which fell out of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. his Palace at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> into the River of <hi>Thames</hi> that runs by, and then very ſeaſonably remembring the words it had often heard ſome whether in danger or in jeſt uſe, cried out amain, <hi>A Boat, a Boat, for twenty pound.</hi> A certain experienced Boatman made thither preſently, took up the Bird, and reſtored it to the King, to whom he knew it belonged, hoping for as great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as the Bird had promiſed. The King agreed with the Boatman that he ſhould have as the Bird being asked anew ſhould ſay: And the Bird anſwers, <hi>Give the Knave a Groat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are very frequent in both <hi>Indies,</hi> as well <hi>Eaſt</hi> as <hi>Weſt.</hi> They breed not in cold Countries; for they are impatient of cold, ſo that they can hardly bear our
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63869:62"/>
Winters, unleſs they be kept in Stoves or hot places: And whereas in their own Country, to wit, the <hi>Indies,</hi> they are much upon the Wing, with us by reaſon of the inclemency and ſharpneſs of the Air they grow torpid and unactive, and leſs fit for flight. They are ſaid to be very long-lived.</p>
                     <p>They breed in hollow trees (witneſs <hi>Marggravius, Lerius,</hi> and <hi>Piſo)</hi> where they make a round hole outwardly, and lay two or three Eggs, like to <hi>Pigeons,</hi> without any made Neſt, as <hi>Marggravius</hi> ſaith: <hi>Lerius</hi> affirms, that they do build Neſts ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently firm and hard, of a round orbicular figure. Whence it is manifeſt that they do not hang their Neſts upon the ſlender twigs of Trees, as <hi>Cadamuſtus</hi> and others have delivered. For that bird which hangs its Neſt on this faſhion, called by the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilians Guira tangeima,</hi> as <hi>Marggravius</hi> writes, is much different from the <hi>Parrot.</hi> Though you touch her Eggs yet will not the <hi>Parrot</hi> forſake them, but hatch them notwithſtanding. <hi>Parrots</hi> are made of ſeveral colours by the <note n="*" place="margin">A people of <hi>Braſil.</hi>

                     <p>In all <hi>Parrots</hi> that I have hitherto obſerved the Noſthrils were round, ſituate in the upper part of the upper Chap, cloſe by the feathers, and very near one to another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parrots</hi> in reſpect of bigneſs may be divided into three kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>greateſt, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſized,</hi> and <hi>leaſt.</hi>

The head and all the body beſides is green; but the neck, breaſt, and whole underſide more dilute or pale: the upper ſide deeper-coloured. From the lower Chap of the Bill under the Chin a black line is drawn downward as far as the beginning of the Breaſt, which then divides, and goes away to each ſide of the neck, till it meet with that red circle or ring, which compaſſeth the backſide of the Neck. This ring is behind of the breadth of ones little finger, but grows narrower by degrees towards the ſides. The belly is of ſo faint a green, that it ſeems almoſt to be yellow. The outmoſt feathers of the Wings next the belly are of a dark dusky green about the middle, in the upper part diſtinguiſhed with a red mark. The Tail, which is about two Palms long, is alſo of a yellowiſh green: The Legs and Feet aſh-coloured. Whence <hi>Solinus</hi> doth not

                        <p>The third, called TUITIRICA, is ſomewhat bigger than thoſe of <hi>Guiny,</hi> of a green colour all over, which for the moſt part is deeper in the Back and Wings, paler in the other parts: The Bill crooked, of a Carnation colour: The Eyes black, the Feet bluiſh. The Tail reaches a little beyond the ends of the Wings. Theſe become very tame, ſo that they will take meat out of ones mouth, and permit one to ſtroke and handle them.

                        <p>The <hi>ſeventh,</hi> called TUIPARA by the <hi>Tupinambi,</hi> is alſo of the bigneſs of a <hi>Lark,</hi> and all over of a pale green.

                     <p>THe Noble <hi>Philip Marnixius</hi> of St. <hi>Aldegond</hi> had a <hi>Parrot,</hi> whom I have oft heard laugh like a man, when he was by the by-ſtanders bidden ſo to do in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, in theſe words: <hi>Riez, Perroquet, riez;</hi> that is, <hi>Laugh, Parrot, laugh.</hi> Yea, which was more wonderful, it would preſently add in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, as if it had been endued with reaſon, but doubtleſs ſo taught, <hi>O le grand ſot, qui me faict rire;</hi> that is, O great fool, who makes me laugh: And was wont to repeat thoſe words twice or thrice. But among others I ſaw one of thoſe great ones in the houſe of the illuſtrious Lady, <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Bremeu,</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Croy</hi> and <hi>Areſchot,</hi> of happy memory, before ſhe went out of <hi>Holland,</hi> the like whereto for variety and elegancy of colours, I do not remember to have ever ſeen. For though almoſt all the feathers covering the body were red, yet the feathers of the Tail (which were very long) were partly red, and partly blue; but thoſe on the Back and Wings parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured of yellow, red, and green, with a mixture alſo of blue. Its Head about the Eyes was white and varied with waved black lines, like the Head of the <hi>Canida.</hi> I do not remember the like Parrot deſcribed in any Author. Moreover, this Bird was ſo in love with <hi>Anna</hi> the Dutcheſſes Neece, now Counteſs of <hi>Meghen,</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">The Latine word is <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> Lady.</note> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs of <hi>Grosbeke,</hi> that where ever ſhe walked about the Room it would follow her, and if it ſaw any one touch her cloaths, would ſtrike at him with its Bill; ſo that it ſeemed to be poſſeſſed with a ſpirit of jealouſie. That <hi>Parrot</hi> of the greater kind,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63869:66"/>
called by the <hi>Braſilians Arat,</hi> as <hi>Lerius</hi> writes, muſt needs alſo be a very handſom one. For he ſaith, that the prime feathers of the Wings and Tail (which are a foot and half long) are half Scarlet-coloured, half of an elegant blue; the ſhaft or Nerve which cuts the feather through the middle long-ways diſtinguiſhing thoſe colours [that is, each feather being on one ſide the ſhaft blue, on the other ſide red] but that the reſt of the feathers of the whole body are altogether blue. He adds, that both thoſe ſorts of greater <hi>Parrots,</hi> viz. <hi>Arat</hi> and <hi>Canide,</hi> were in great eſteem among the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> becauſe they pluckt their feathers three or four times a year, to make Clothes, Caps, Bucklers, and Curtains: And though they are not kept tame, yet are they wont more to frequent and abide in great trees in the middle of the Villages than in Woods. Beſides, thoſe two huge ones, the ſame <hi>Lerius</hi> reports, that there are found three or four ſorts of <hi>Parrots</hi> among the <hi>Braſilians.</hi> The <hi>firſt,</hi> of thoſe great and thick-bodied ones, which the <hi>Tououpinamboutii,</hi> a people of <hi>Braſil,</hi> call <hi>Aicurous,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its head adorned with feathers particoloured of yellow, red, and violet, the ends of the Wings of a lovely red, and the feathers of the Tail long and yellow; the reſt of the body being wholly green: That this kind is ſeldom tranſported into forein Countries; and yet there is none that may more eaſily and perfectly be taught to ſpeak. He adds further, that a certain <hi>Braſilian</hi> woman, living in a Village two miles diſtant from the Iſland, in which he with other <hi>Frenchmen</hi> dwelt, had a <hi>Parrot</hi> of this kind, which ſhe made much of; which ſeemed to be endued with that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and reaſon, that it could diſcern and comprehend whatever ſhe ſaid who brought it up. For, ſaith he, walking forth ſometimes to refreſh our ſelves as far as that Village, when we paſſed by that womans houſe, ſhe was wont to call upon us in theſe words, <hi>Will you give me a Comb, or a Looking-glaſs, and I will preſently make my Parrot ſing and dance before you?</hi> If we agreed to her requeſt, as ſoon as ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſome words to the Bird, it began not only to leap upon the Perch on which it ſtood, but alſo to talk and whiſtle, and imitate the ſhoutings and exclamations of the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> when they prepare themſelves for the battel. In brief when it came into its Dames mind to bid it ſing, it ſang, to bid it leap, it leapt: But if taking it ill, that ſhe had not obtained what ſhe asked, ſhe ſaid to the bird <hi>Auge,</hi> that is, be ſtill or ſilent: It ſtood ſtill, and held its peace; neither could we by any means provoke it to move either foot or tongue. The ſecond kind is called by the <hi>Braſilians Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganas,</hi> and is like thoſe <hi>Parrots</hi> that are wont to be brought into <hi>Europe;</hi> of no great account among them, by reaſon of their multitude or abundance, they being not leſs frequent there, than <hi>Pigeons</hi> with us. The third ſort of <hi>Parrots,</hi> called by them <hi>Tovis,</hi> are not greater than a <hi>Starling,</hi> and have their whole body covered with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a deep green: But the feathers of the Tail (which are very long) have a mixture of yellow. He added further, that he had obſerved, that the <hi>Parrots</hi> of that Country did not build Neſts hanging down on the boughs or twigs of trees, as ſome by their Topographical Tables would perſuade us; but in the hollows of trees, of an orbicular figure, ſufficiently hard and firm. Then <hi>Cluſius</hi> tells us that he ſaw <hi>Parrots</hi> brought from <hi>Fernambuco</hi> of the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> not exceeding the bigneſs of a <hi>Stare,</hi> covered with feathers wholly of a green colour, but all having a ſhort Tail, and white Bill: and they who brought them over reported, that this kind was very noxious to fruit: That they fed them by the way with grains of <hi>Maiz,</hi> that is, <hi>Indian</hi> Wheat. In the ſecond Voyage the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made into the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> in <hi>Java</hi> and certain neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Iſlands, they obſerved <hi>Parrots</hi> far more elegant than thoſe they were wont to bring out of <hi>Braſil,</hi> and they underſtood that they were called <hi>Noyras</hi> by the <hi>Portugues</hi> that frequented <hi>Java</hi> and the <hi>Moluccas:</hi> That they were not very big-bodied, but of ſo elegant a colour, that they thought more beautiful could not be painted by the hand of Man. For the Breaſt and Belly were covered with feathers of a florid, ſhining red colour; the Back with golden-coloured Plumes; the Wings adorned with feathers particoloured of green and blue: Underneath the Wings the feathers were of a lovely ſhining red. But that the price of thoſe birds there was very great; ſo that they were not rated at leſs than eight or ten <hi>German</hi> Dollars. <hi>Linſcotius</hi> writes, that the <hi>Portugues</hi> had often made trial to bring over of them to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> but could never effect it, becauſe they were too tender and delicate. But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> with a great deal of care and induſtry brought one alive as far as <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which though it were not of the choiceſt, yet might have been ſold for one hundred and ſeventy Florens or Gilders of that Province, that is ſomewhat more than ſeventy Dollars, as I find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Diary of that Voyage. That bird by the way had learned to pronounce many <hi>Holland</hi> words, which it had heard of the Mariners, and its Maſter had made it
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63869:66"/>
ſo tame, that it would put its Bill into his Mouth and Ears without doing him any harm, and would put in order the hairs of his beard if diſcompoſed: And if any one elſe offered to touch him, it would preſently ſnap or peck at him, as if it had been ſome Dog. Furthermore (ſaith he) in the year of Chriſt 1605. <hi>Jacob Plateau</hi> ſent me the figure of a certain <hi>Parrot,</hi> drawn to the life in colours, the like whereto ſeeing I have not as yet ſeen, nor remember to have met with any where deſcribed, I thought fit to ſubjoyn the figure of it Printed, in this <hi>Auctarium</hi> to my Hiſtory of Exotics. He wrote that he had kept it above two years, that it was of the bigneſs of a <hi>Pigeon:</hi> That it had a Head almoſt like a <hi>Hawks,</hi> to wit, covered with ſuch co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured feathers: Sparkling Eyes. The Neck and Breaſt were beſet with particoloured feathers; which when it was angry, or any one moleſted it, by bringing any Animal near to the Cage in which it was ſhut up, it would ſet an end, ſo that it ſeemed to be in a manner creſted. Thoſe feathers were of a reddiſh colour, and in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part, [I ſuppoſe he means round the borders or edges] of a moſt elegant blue. The feathers of the Belly were almoſt of like colour, yet moreover clouded with dusky. The feathers of the Back were green, and the maſter-feathers of the Wings bluiſh. The Tail was compoſed of many green feathers, but not long. I could not neglect to propoſe to the Readers view a ſmall ſort of <hi>Parrot,</hi> brought theſe laſt years from <hi>Aethiopia</hi> and the places bordering on <hi>Manicongo,</hi> by the <hi>Holland</hi> Skippers, with the figure of the Male, (but the Female is much more elegant, for there was one brought of both Sexes.) The bulk of the body was equal in bigneſs to a <hi>Chaffinch:</hi> That is, was two inches and an half long from the bottom of the Neck to the Rump. All the feathers covering the body were of a green colour; among which yet there appeared a manifeſt difference: For thoſe on the Back were deeper coloured; thoſe on the Belly paler. The flag-feathers of the Wings were three inches long; and though on the upper ſide; on that ſide the ſhaft which hath the ſhorter <hi>Villi,</hi> as far as they cover one another, they were tinctured with a deep green; yet on the other ſide which hath longer <hi>Villi,</hi> and on all the under-ſide they were dusky or brown. The feathers of the Tail were moſt elegant, well nigh two inches long, little leſs than half an inch broad, on that part next the Rump of a green colour mingled with yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, next of an elegant red, then of a black, and laſt of all of a green. And theſe three laſt colours were diſtinct from one another, as is to be ſeen in the Tail-feathers of ſome green <hi>Parrots,</hi> of the great kind [called <hi>Maccaws,]</hi> But theſe feathers are ſcarcely ſeen unleſs when ſhe ſpreads her Tail, becauſe they are covered with others of the ſame length, which are wholly green. The Neck is ſhort and thick: The fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers covering the Head very ſhort and green; except thoſe on the crown above the Bill, and on the whole throat, for they are of a lovely florid red colour. I ſpeak of the Male, for the feathers of the Female were of a paler red, and did not take up ſo large a ſpace as in the Male. The Eyes were very black, the Bill thick and ſtrong; the upper Chap hooked and ſharp-pointed, as in other ſorts of <hi>Parrots:</hi> Its colour reddiſh. The Legs ſhort, ſcarce attaining the length of half an inch, covered with aſh-coloured ſcales, as the feet of other common <hi>Parrots,</hi> and thoſe divided into four Toes; of which two ſtood forward, and were of unequal length, two backward, and they alſo unequal: The ſhorter, which were the inner, having two joynts, the longer; which were the outer, three. The Claws were white, and of a good length. I obſerved it to have a very ſmall voice, and only to peep like a Chicken. It delights in company. When it eats, it doth not hold its meat in one foot, like other <hi>Parrots,</hi> but picks up its meat with its Bill by jobbing: But its meat for the moſt part is <hi>Canary ſeed;</hi> for I obſerved it to feed more willingly upon that than any other kind of Seed. I ſaw ſome that were ſo taught that they would pick up crums of bread dipt or moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with water. Its drink is water. I obſerved further in this bird, that the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, when they grew old, would ſcarce eat any meat, but what had been pickt up by the Male, and kept a while in his Crop, and there mollified or macerated; the which they received with their Bills, as young Pigeons are wont to be fed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the old ones.</p>

Both the Belly underneath, and alſo the Head, Neck, and Tail above are of a beautiful red colour: But the Breaſt and lower feathers of the Tail are of a pale roſe-colour, which [Tail-feathers] end in a lovely blue, or colour mingled of white and green. The Wings are chiefly green, but interwoven with red feathers, the one half whereof is ſo variegated on each ſide with yellow and roſe colour, that expoſed to the Sun it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents a thouſand varieties of ſhining colours, and can hardly be expreſſed by a Painter: So that this bird deſerves to be highly prized by great perſons.</p>

The <hi>Iris</hi> of the Eye or ring encircling the <note place="margin">Eye.</note> Pupil conſiſts as it were of a double circle, the exteriour being of a light cinereous or aſh-colour, the interiour of a dark cinereous. Black hairs or briſtles bending from the Head downwards cover the Noſthrils. The Plumage is black all over the body, <note place="margin">Noſthrils, Colour of the feathers.</note> having a blue ſplendour or gloſs; which is ſeen eſpecially in the Tail and Wings. The Belly is ſomething paler, inclining to brown. On the middle of the Back grow only downy feathers: For the Back is covered with thoſe long feathers that ſpring from the ſhoulders, as in many other birds. The number of prime feathers in each Wing <note place="margin">The Prime Wing-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or quils.</note> is twenty, of which the firſt is ſhorter than the ſecond, the ſecond than the third, and that than the fourth, which is the longeſt of all. In all from the ſixth to the eighteenth the ſhaft extends further than the Vanes, and ends in a ſharp point.</p>

                           <pb n="122" facs="tcp:63869:68"/>
The Tail is about nine inches long, made up of twelve feathers, the exteriour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The Tail.</note> gradually ſomewhat ſhorter than the interiour.</p>
                        <p>It hath large crooked Claws, eſpecially thoſe of the back-toes. The outmoſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe <note place="margin">The Claws and Toes,</note> is joyned to the middlemoſt from the divarication to the firſt joynt.</p>
                        <p>The Liver is divided into two Lobes. It hath a large Gall ſticking to the Guts. <note place="margin">Entrails.</note> The length of the Guts is forty three inches; of the blind-guts one inch.</p>
                        <p>The Gullet below the Bill is dilated into a kind of bag, wherein ſhe brings meat to feed her Young. The ſtomach within is wrinkled. The <hi>Raven</hi> feeds not only upon <note place="margin">Its Food.</note> Fruits and Inſects, but alſo upon the Carkaſſes of beaſts, birds, and fiſhes; moreover, it ſets upon, kills, and devours living birds, after the manner of <hi>Hawks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We have ſeen one or two milk-white <hi>Ravens: Aldrovandus</hi> mentions divers; and <note place="margin">White Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</note> ſaith that they are often found in <hi>England:</hi> But without doubt he was miſtaken or miſinformed; for they are ſeldom ſeen among us; inſomuch that they are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and down to be ſhewn for money. I rather think, that they are found in thoſe Mountainous or Northern Countries, which are for the greateſt part of the year co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſnow: Where alſo many other Animals change their native colours, and become white, as <hi>Bears, Foxes, Hares, Blackbirds,</hi> &amp;c. whether it proceeds from the force of the imagination heightned by the conſtant intuition of Snow, or from the cold of the Climate, occaſioning ſuch a languiſhing of colour; as we ſee in old Age, when the natural heat decays, the hair grows grey, and at laſt white.</p>
                        <p>They ſay that a <hi>Raven</hi> may be reclaimed and trained up for fowling, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">Ravens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed for fowling. The place.</note> of a Hawk.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ravens</hi> are found not only in one part or Region of the World, but abound in all Countries: Do eaſily bear all changes of weather, fearing neither heat nor cold, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during well to abide and live where-ever there is plenty of meat for them. And though they are ſaid to love ſolitude; yet do they very often live and build in the midſt of the moſt populous Cities, as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> delivers, and experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms. They build in high Trees, or old Towers, in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> with us in <hi>England,</hi> and ſometimes ſooner. They lay four or five, and ſometimes ſix Eggs before they begin to ſit. Their Eggs are of a pale greeniſh blue, full of black ſpots and lines.</p>
                        <p>What is reported by <hi>Heſiod</hi> and others of the Ancients, of the long lives of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Their longe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</note> is without doubt fabulous. But that all Birds in general compared with Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds are long-lived we have already proved by divers examples in ſeveral kinds: And that <hi>Ravens</hi> are in the number of the longeſt lived we will not deny.</p>

This Bird delights to feed upon Carrion, that is the Carkaſſes of dead Animals <note place="margin">Its Food.</note> when they begin to putrefie. Neither doth it feed only upon Carrion, but alſo ſet upon, kill, and devour living birds, in like manner as the <hi>Raven:</hi> Moreover, it eats Grain and all ſorts of Inſects in <hi>England</hi> at leaſt. For beyond Seas they ſay it meddles with no kind of Grain.</p>
                        <p>This kind of Bird abounds with us in <hi>Britain,</hi> as <hi>Cardan</hi> and <hi>Turner</hi> truly obſerve, <note place="margin">Its place.</note> becauſe here is plenty of food for them. They build upon high trees, and lay four or <note place="margin">Where it builds.</note> five Eggs at a time, like <hi>Ravens,</hi> but leſs. They are very noiſom to Lambs new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeaned if they be weak and feeble, firſt picking out their eyes. They are ſaid to have a very ſagacious ſent, ſo that it is difficult to ſhoot them, they ſmelling the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder at a great diſtance.</p>

For we have elſewhere ſhewn, that a good part of the Yolk is received into the cavity of the belly in birds newly hatched, which being by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees conveyed into the Guts by a certain paſſage called by us <hi>ductus inteſtinalis,</hi> ſerves to nouriſh the Young newly excluded.</p>

They build many together upon high trees about Gentlemens houſes, who are <note place="margin">Manner of breeding.</note> much delighted with the noiſe they make in breeding time.

                        <p>I have been told by a worthy Gentleman of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> who himſelf obſerved it, that when <hi>Rooks</hi> build, one of the Pair always ſits by to watch the Neſt, till it be finiſhed, whilſt the other goes about to fetch materials. Elſe if both go, and leave the Neſt unfiniſhed, (as ſometimes they venture to do) their fellow-Rooks ere they return again, will have rob'd and carried away to their ſeveral Neſts all their ſticks, and whatever elſe they had got together. Hence perhaps the word <hi>Rooking</hi> with us is uſed for cheating or abuſing.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Birds are noiſome to Corn and Grain: So that the Husbandmen are forced <note place="margin">How to fright them away.</note> to employ Children with hooting, and Crackers, and Rattles of Metal, and finally, with throwing of ſtones to ſcare them away.

                        <p>I was alſo told by the fore-mentioned Gentleman, that if <hi>Rooks</hi> infeſt your Corn, they will be more terrified by taking a <hi>Rook</hi> and plucking it limb from limb in their ſight, and then caſting the ſeveral limbs about your field, than if you hang up half a dozen dead <hi>Rooks</hi> in it.</p>

The Bill is near two Palms long, and one broad, being meaſured from the beginning of the lower Chap to the end of the upper. The lower Chap where it is thickeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> near the Eyes, is twice as little as the upper, and near the end, where it is crooked, thrice. It is of a very thin ſubſtance like Parchment, but bony, ſhining, very light, hollow, and inwardly capable of a great deal of Air: For which reaſon I think, contrary to the manner of other Birds, its wants Noſthrils: The Bill being ſo thin that the Air <note place="margin">It want; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthrils.</note> can eaſily penetrate it. And if Nature had made any aperture in it, it would have rendred it obnoxious to fracture. Hence alſo perchance it is, that ſhe hath furniſhed it with certain teeth, ſo diſpoſed that the Bill cannot be ſhut exactly cloſe, but eaſily admits the ingreſs of the Air. The Bill, I ſay, is ſerrate, and as it were compoſed of certain little ſcales, which may eaſily by the fingers be plucked off, [or aſunder.] The colour of the Bill is yellowiſh, more in the lower than the upper part [inwardly it is of a pleaſant red] toward the end (ſaith <hi>Nierembergius)</hi> of a Scarlet colour. The Head in proportion to the body is great and thick, as is ſutable and requiſite to ſuſtain <note place="margin">Its Head.</note> a Bill of that length and bigneſs; black; yet the Crown, whole Back, and Wings ſhew ſomething of whiteneſs. The Eyes are great, placed in the middle of the Head: <note place="margin">Eyes.</note> The Pupil very black, encompaſſed with a white circle, and that again with a yellow. The Neck, Back, and Wings are black. The Breaſt ſhines with a moſt bright and <note place="margin">Colour.</note> lovely Gold or Saffron colour, with a certain redneſs near the beginning; the Belly and Thighs with a moſt beautiful Vermilion. The Tail again is black, but in the end of a notable red.</p>
                        <p>It is made ſo tame, as to ſit and hatch its Young in Houſes. <hi>Thevetus</hi> reports, that this bird feeds upon Pepper, which it moſt greedily devours, gorging it ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, <note place="margin">Its food Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> ſo that it voids it again crude and unconcocted; and that the Natives make uſe eſpecially of that Pepper, preferring it before that which is freſh gathered from the <note place="margin">This ſtory <hi>Faber</hi> diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits becauſe none of his <hi>American</hi> friends ſpake a word of it.</note> Plant, becauſe they perſuade themſelves that the ſtrength and heat of the Pepper is qualified and allayed by the Bird, ſo that afterwards it is leſs noxious. All this out of <hi>Aldrovandus. Faber</hi> ſuſpects the ſtory of the Pepper, becauſe his <hi>American</hi> friends, whom he conſulted about this Bird, made no mention of any ſuch thing. I ſuſpect
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63869:71"/>
that the Toes in this Bird are diſpoſed after the manner of the <hi>Woodpeckers, viz.</hi> two forwards, and two backwards. For ſuch is the conformation of the Feet of the <hi>Aracari</hi> of <hi>Marggrave,</hi> a bird near of kin, and very like to this. And <hi>Thevetus</hi> in his figure expreſſes only two foretoes.</p>

For it not only hath a like ſituation of Toes, but alſo in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hews holes in trees to build its Neſt in, as Frier <hi>Peter Alvayſa,</hi> and other <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had long lived in <hi>America,</hi> told <hi>Faber</hi> for a certain truth; and <hi>Ovie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> in the forty third Chapter of his Summary of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> publiſhed in <hi>Italian,</hi> writes; adding, that he thinks there is no bird ſecures her young ones better from the <hi>Monkeys,</hi> which are very noiſom to the Young of moſt Birds. For when ſhe perceives the approach of thoſe Enemies, ſhe ſo ſettles her ſelf in her Neſt as to put her Bill out at the hole, and gives the <hi>Monkeys</hi> ſuch a welcom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that they preſently pack away, and glad they ſcape ſo. From this quality of boring trees this Bird is by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> called <hi>Carpintero,</hi> and by the <hi>Braſilians Taca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taca,</hi> in imitation I ſuppoſe of the ſound it makes.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe the Bird exactly deſcribed by <hi>Dal Pozzo,</hi> ſeems to be ſpecifically different from that of <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> I ſhall here add his deſcription.</p>
                        <p>It was (ſaith he) a little bigger than the common <hi>Magpie. [Lerius</hi> maketh it of the bigneſs of a <hi>Dove; Oviedo,</hi> not bigger, or but little bigger than a <hi>Quail.]</hi> Its Bill, which is very broad, had its upper part [or Chap] whereit grew to the Head, tinctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with green, a line of green being alſo thence produced to the point; but its lower Chap at its ſetting on to the Head a blue colour. All the reſt of the Bill was of a dark red, like Serpentine wood, with many intercurrent black ſpots and lines. <hi>N. B.</hi> Its Bill was empty and hollow, and upon that account very light <hi>[Oviedo</hi> makes it very heavy, and to weigh more than the whole body beſides, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a miſtake] ſo that it had little ſtrength in it, neither could the bird peck or ſtrike ſmartly with it. Its inſide was of a Saffron-colour, but blue toward the tip.</p>
                        <p>It had a very flat thin Tongue, not much unlike thoſe long feathers on the Neck of a <hi>Dunghil-Cock:</hi> This it moved up and down, and ſtretcht out to the length of the Bill. It was of a true fleſh-colour, and which you would wonder at, fringed, as it were, on each ſide with very ſmall filaments, which made it ſhew like a true feather. [This <hi>Oviedus</hi> alſo confirms.]</p>
                        <p>Its feathers on the Neck down to the middle of the Breaſt were whitiſh, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in a ſooty colour; on the Head and Back blackiſh. Round the Eyes was a ſpace bare of feathers, but curled with hair, of a Violet-colour, as is ſeen alſo in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots.</hi> The reſt of the body was covered with feathers of a Weaſel-colour <hi>[muſtelini coloris.]</hi> It had no Tail, [having been, I ſuppoſe, plucked off] but one ready to come; the beginning whereof conſiſted of feathers of a dark white, particoloured with black, weaſel, and Vermilion colour. It alſo frequently flirted up that rudiment of a Tail, as <hi>Wrens</hi> and <hi>Wagtails</hi> are wont to do.</p>
                        <p>Each foot was divided into two Toes ſtanding forward, and two backward; above of a Violet-colour, underneath of an aſh or grey.</p>
                        <p>It often hopped and leapt up and down, and cried with a voice not unlike the chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of a <hi>Magpie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It fed upon almoſt all the ſame things that <hi>Parrots</hi> do, but was moſt greedy of Grapes, which being pluckt off one by one, and toſſed to it, it would moſt dextrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly catch in the Air before they fell to the ground. The fleſh of the whole body was of a deep Violet colour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Faber</hi> doth not undeſervedly enquire how, ſeeing the Bill is ſo light and thin, the Bird can pierce trees with it? Which difficulty he thus ſatisfies; that though it be thin and light, yet is it of a bony ſubſtance, and therefore it is not to be wondred at that, dextrouſly uſed by the living Animal, it ſhould therewith by many repeated ſtrokes pierce a tree, having perchance the inſtinct to chuſe a rotten one, as we ſee drops of rain wear holes in Flints, nay, the very feet of <hi>Piſmires</hi> walking often over them, as <hi>Pliny</hi> obſerves, make impreſſions on them. <note n="*" place="margin">Chap 10. of his Voyage into <hi>Braſil.</hi>

                           <hi>Lerius</hi> writes, that this Bird is of the colour of a <hi>Raven</hi> except the Breaſt, which is of a Saffron-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, compaſſed beneath with a line of Vermilion; the skin of which part pluckt

The covert-feathers of the fifteen exteriour Sails are very beautiful, being variegated or chequered with black, white, and lovely ſhining blue lines: The reſt of the covert-feathers being black.</p>
                        <p>The Tail is ſix inches and a quarter long, conſiſting of twelve feathers, wholly <note place="margin">Its Tail.</note> black, except toward their roots: Under the Rump there is ſomething of blue ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with cinereous.</p>

The Tongue black as in <hi>Jays,</hi> jagged or torn, but not cloven: The roof of the mouth green, and having a double cleft or fiſſure. The bottom of the Palate is rugged or rough with little bunches. At the Baſe of the Tongue there is only a little forked excreſcency on each ſide.

                        <p>The Rump and leſſer rows of covert feathers of the Wings are of a lovely blue or ultramarine colour (as the Painters call it.)

                        <p>The number of Sails in each Wing is twenty, of which the firſt, ſecond, and third <note place="margin">Wing-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> are equal, and from the tenth all the reſt. Almoſt all of them have their lower half blue, and the upper black. The foremoſt are black almoſt down to the bottom, only in their exteriour Webs they have a mixture of blue. The covert feathers of the Wings are of a pale blue, of which colour alſo, but paler are thoſe that inveſt the underſide of the Wing.</p>
                        <p>The Tail conſiſts of twelve feathers, of which the ten intermediate are equal, each <note place="margin">Tail.</note> being four inches three quarters long: The two extreme longer than the reſt by three quarters of an inch. The two middlemoſt are of a dark aſh-colour, the next to them have their tips of a bluiſh white, which colour gradually increaſes in the reſt, till in the outmoſt it takes up half the feather. Below the white the interiour webs of the feathers are black, and the exteriour blue: The tips of the outmoſt feathers are black. The tail-feathers and ſails of the Wings where ever they are blackiſh above, are blue underneath. The outmoſt feather of the <note n="*" place="margin">Baſtard-Wing.</note>

I have learned by inſpection, that the Tail of the Cock conſiſts of ten feathers only, the Tail of the Hen of twelve; which near their roots are of a dark cinereous or Mouſe dun, but above are black. The end of the whole Tail is yellow, but more reſplendent in the Male than in the Female.

                     </head>
                     <p>TO <hi>Woodpeckers,</hi> if under this name we comprehend the <hi>Nuthatch,</hi> the <hi>Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeper,</hi> the great <hi>Reed-Sparrow,</hi> and the <hi>Ox-eye creeper,</hi> there are very few notes common, <hi>viz.</hi> to climb or run up trees, ſticking to their bodies or boughs; and for that purpoſe to have ſtrong and muſculous thighs. But if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exclude the foreſaid Birds, and reſtrain the name to <hi>Woodſpites,</hi> properly ſo called, there are many and remarkable notes whereby they may be diſtinguiſhed from all other kinds of birds: As for example, 1. To have a ſtreight, hard, ſtrong, angular, and ſharp Bill, very fit and proper to pierce and bore holes in trees. 2. A Tongue of a very great length, round, ending in a ſharp, ſtiff, bony thorn, dented on each ſide, to ſtrike Ants, <hi>Coſſi,</hi> and other Inſects withal. This Tongue they can at pleaſure put forth to a great length, thruſting it deep into the crannies, holes, and clefts of trees, to ſtab and draw out Inſects lurking there. 3. Short Legs, but very ſtrong. 4. Toes ſtanding two forwards, and two backwards: Which is common to theſe and <hi>Parrots.</hi> Such a diſpoſition of Toes (as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> rightly notes) Nature, or rather the Wiſdom of the Creator, hath granted to <hi>Woodpeckers,</hi> becauſe it is very convenient for the climbing of trees. Their Toes alſo are cloſe joyned together; that they may more ſtrongly and firmly lay hold on the tree they climb upon. 5. All of them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perchance you except the <hi>Wryneck,</hi> have a hard, ſtiff Tail, bending alſo down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and its feathers ends often broken, and their ſhafts almoſt bare; on which they lean, and ſo bear up themſelves in climbing. Their Tail conſiſts of but ten fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. 6. To feed only upon Inſects. 7. To want the blind Guts, which is peculiar to this kind, agreeing to no other bird or beaſt beſide, that we know. 8. To lay white Eggs.</p>
                     <p>Whether all theſe marks agree to thoſe <hi>American</hi> Birds which we have ranked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this head we know not. We have referred them to this kind, for the like diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Toes, two forward, two backward; eſpecially ſeeing they belong neither to <hi>Parrots</hi> nor <hi>Owls.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Albertus</hi> writes that all <hi>Woodſpites</hi> build in the hollows of trees, which before him <hi>Pliny</hi> alſo hath recorded. They themſelves are ſaid to hew out for themſelves a place to build in; making ſuch an artificial hole, ſo exactly round, that the moſt skilful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Geometrician could not with his Compaſs make a rounder. They hatch and bring up ſix or ſeven Young at once. The Eggs of all kinds of them that we have hitherto ſeen are white. The <hi>Woodſpite</hi> is called by the <hi>Greeks</hi>

                        </gap>, from ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or piercing of trees. The <hi>Latine</hi> name <hi>Picus</hi> ſome think to be derived from the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> word <hi>Becco,</hi> ſignifying a Bill or beak of a bird. <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> thinks that it was rather deduced from the <hi>Flemmiſh</hi> word <hi>Picken,</hi> ſignifying to ſtrike or knock with the Bill. The word <hi>Pick</hi> with us is variouſly applied, but originally ſeems to have the ſame ſignification as in <hi>Flemmiſh, viz.</hi> either to ſtrike with the Bill, or gather up with the Bill. Hence in the North of <hi>England</hi> theſe Birds are called <hi>Pickatrees,</hi> a word exactly of the ſame ſignification with the <hi>Greek</hi>

                     <p>That <hi>Woodpeckers</hi> will learn to ſpeak I can hardly be perſwaded, though <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> and <hi>Scaliger</hi> affirm it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Woodpecker</hi> was not only by the ancient <hi>Latines,</hi> called <hi>Pluviae avis,</hi> the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſowl,</hi> but is ſo alſo by our Country men now adays, becauſe by its voice more loud and frequent than uſual it is thought to preſage rain.</p>

                        <p>THe Cock, which we deſcribed, weighed ten ounces and an half: being in length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail eighteen inches and an half; in breadth between the tips of the Wings ſpread twenty nine inches and an half.</p>
                        <p>Its Bill from the point to the Angles of the mouth was two inches and an half long, ſtrong, hard, triangular, as in the reſt of this kind. Above the Noſthrils a hard wrinkle is produced beyond the middle of the Bill. That part of the Bill which is below the wrinkle is white, the reſt black. The Tongue, when extended, is of a very great length. It can ſhoot it out and draw it back at pleaſure, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to it with the reſt of this kind. Its Noſthrils are round, covered with reflected hairs: Its Head very great. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes are of a pale yellow.</p>
                        <p>The colour of the whole body is black, excepting the crown of the head, which down to the Noſthrils is of a lovely red or Vermilion colour.</p>
                        <p>The number of flag-feathers in each Wing is nineteen, of which the fifth and ſixth are the longeſt; the Sarcel or pinion feather is very ſhort, and not greater than thoſe of the ſecond row.</p>
                        <p>The Tail is made up of ten feathers, of which the outmoſt are the ſhorteſt, the reſt on both ſides gradually longer to the two middlemoſt, which are the longeſt of all. All but the outmoſt (which as we ſaid are the leaſt and ſhorteſt) are ſtiff, ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, bending inward, about ſeven inches long, upon which in climbing trees they lean and ſupport their bodies.</p>
                        <p>The Legs on the forepart are feathered down half way, behind no longer than the knees. The Feet are of a lead colour, It hath two back toes, as the reſt of its kind: The Claws ſtrong and great, except that of the leſſer back-toe, which is very ſmall.</p>
                        <p>The Gall of a dark green: The Teſticles yellowiſh: The Guts ſeventeen inches long, great and lax: The ſtomach alſo lax and membranaceous, full of Hexapods and Ants. It altogether wants the <hi>Appendices</hi> or blind Guts, as the reſt of this Tribe.</p>
                        <p>This Bird we found in the Market at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> to be ſold, killed not far from that City. It is not found in <hi>England</hi> that we know of.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THe Cock weighed ſix ounces three quarters. Its length from the Bill to the Toes was eleven inches, to the end of the Tail thirteen and an half. The Wings extended were equal to twenty one inches and an half. The Bill from the point to the Angles of the mouth was almoſt two inches long, black, hard, ſtrong, triangular, ending in a blunt point. A reddiſh dusky circle immediately encompaſſes the Pupil of the Eye; the reſt of the <hi>Iris</hi> being white. The Tongue when ſtretched out is of a very great length, ending in a ſharp, bony ſubſtance, rough underneath, wherewith, as with a Dart, it ſtrikes Inſects. The top of the Head is of a Crimſon or Vermilion colour, ſpotted with black. The Eyes are encompaſſed with black, under the black on each ſide is another Vermilion ſpot. The Throat, Breaſt and Belly are of a pale green: The Back, Neck, and leſſer rows of covert feathers of the Wings green: The Rump of a pale yellow or ſtraw-colour, as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> rightly expreſſes it. The feathers under the Tail are croſſed with tranſverſe dusky lines.</p>
                        <p>In each Wing are nineteen prime feathers, beſide the outmoſt (which is very ſhort) of a dusky colour, and marked with ſemicircular white ſpots. But more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the outer Webs of the <note n="*" place="margin">Thoſe next the body.</note> interiour flags are green, the inner Webs dusky, with ſemicircular white ſpots: The outer Webs of the exteriour flags dusky, and painted
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63869:75"/>
with white ſpots, the inner Webs of the ſame colour with the precedent. The fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers covering the roots of the flags underneath are of a pale green, with tranſverſe dusky lines. The Tail conſiſts of ten feathers, ſtiff, and bending inwards, which by reaſon the ſhaft reacheth not to the end of the Webs, ſeem to be forked. The two middlemoſt feathers are the longeſt, by meaſure four inches and an half, have their tips black, elſe they are marked with croſs bars, above of a dark green, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath whitiſh, the three next on each ſide differ not from theſe. Of the two out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt (which are blunter than the reſt) the greater are all over varied with tranſverſe bars of black and dark green alternately placed, the leſſer or outmoſt have their tops green, and bottoms black.</p>
                        <p>The Feet and Toes are of a pale green, and ſometimes of a lead colour: The Claws dusky. The Toes placed as in the reſt of this kind, two forward, two backward. The loweſt bones of the fore toes are joyned together.</p>
                        <p>It hath a large Gall, an Inch and half long: The right Teſticle round, the left ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and bent almoſt into a circle, which leſt any one ſhould think accidental, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in three ſeveral birds. It hath no blind Guts, but in their ſtead the ſtreight Gut is dilated in that place. Its Crop was full of Ants and Ants Eggs. It feeds alſo upon Caterpillars and <hi>Coſſi.</hi> It ſits more upon the ground than other <hi>Woodpeckers,</hi> and ſeeks its food there.</p>
                        <p>Its Tongue is round, ending in a ſtiff, ſharp, bony tip, dented on both ſides. This Tongue the Bird can dart out to a great length, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome three or four inches, and draw up again, by the help of two ſmall round Cartilages, faſtned into the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned bony tip, and running along the length of the Tongue: Theſe Cartilages from the root of the Tongue take a circuit beyond the Ears, and being reflected back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the crown of the Head, (where they both meet again, and are kept down down by a Ligament going over them) make a large bow. Below the Ligament they run down the Sagittal Suture, and then declining a little to the right ſide, paſs juſt above the orbit of the right Eye, and along the right ſide of the Bill into a hole excavated there, whence they have their riſe or original. The muſculous ſpongy fleſh of the Tongue encloſes theſe Cartilages like a ſheath, and is ſo made that it may be extended or contracted like a Worm. That part alſo of theſe Cartilages, reaching from the hind part of the Head to the end of the Bill, is covered with the like muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fleſh that may be contracted or extended like the Tongue, only both Cartilages are not encloſed in one muſcle, but have each its ſeveral diſtinct muſculous ſheath, like two ſmall ſtrings or worms. On the ends of theſe Cartilages (for I could without much force draw them out of their ſocket in the Bill) there was a white glutinous or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous matter. On the inſide the flexure of theſe Cartilages reaching from the root of the Tongue to the top of the Head, was a broad thin muſcle, which ſerved to move the Cartilages to and fro. For by contracting it ſelf it ſtreightens the bow of the Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages (almoſt after the manner as the <hi>Tunica Uvea</hi> dilates the Pupil) and ſo neceſſarily forces the Cartilages forward through the Tongue, and thruſts out the Tongue: But we leave theſe things to be more curiouſly weighed and examined by others.</p>
                        <p>The tips of the ſhafts of the Tail-feathers in this and other <hi>Woodpeckers</hi> ſeem to be broken or worn off by their reſting upon them in climbing.</p>
                        <p>This kind lays five or ſix Eggs at once. I have ſeen ſix young ones together in a Neſt.</p>

                        <p>The flag-feathers of the Wing are in number twenty (of which the firſt or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is the ſhorteſt) black, and marked with ſemicircular white ſpots.

                        <p>The Tail is three inches and an half long, made up of ten feathers; of which the two middlemoſt are the longeſt, being ſtrong, ſtiff, ſharp-pointed, and bending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: The ſhaft, as in others, is not produced to the utmoſt tip (perchance worn or broken off with climbing) by reaſon whereof the feathers appear forked.

In the two next the lower part is black, and the reſt white, with two tranſverſe black ſpots or ſtroaks, of which the upper cuts both Webs of the feather, the lower only the interiour. In the third the black reacheth higher, and the white part hath only one tranſverſe black ſtroak. The fourth pair are all black, having only a ſemicircular ſpot of white toward the top, the very tip being of a reddiſh white: The two middlemoſt are wholly black.</p>

In the Bird I deſcribed, the flag-feathers of the Wings were ſpotted on both ſides the ſhaft with white ſpots, which when the Wing was extended ſtood in rows croſſing the feathers: The four middle feathers of the Tail wholly black, the reſt variegated with white and black tranſverſe ſpots. The feathers ſtand ſo that the Tail, when ſhut, ſeems a little forked.</p>
                        <p>The Feet are of a lead colour. It hath the Toes ſo ſituate as the others of this kind, <hi>viz.</hi> two forward, two backward: The two fore-toes likewiſe connected from the divarication place to the firſt joynt.</p>

                        <p>The Tail conſiſted of ten feathers, from the exteriour to the middlemoſt gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally longer each than other, the two middlemoſt being the longeſt. Of theſe the four middlemoſt are wholly black, ſtrong, ſharp, and bending inward, as in the reſt of this kind, ſo made to ſuſtain the body when ſhe climbs trees: The three exteriour are leſs ſharp, of which the outmoſt and leaſt hath the bottom black, and the upper part white, with two tranſverſe black ſpots. In the next the black part is extended in the inner Web as far as the ſecond tranſverſe black ſpot; in the outer the white reacheth lower, yet hath it only one tranſverſe black ſpot toward the top. The third is black, having only the tip white.</p>
                        <p>The Throat, Breaſt, and Belly are of a ſordid white, above the Noſthrils it is of a dusky colour, and on the head it hath a white ſpot. The hinder part of the head is black. From the Eyes to the middle of the Neck two broad lines of white feathers terminated on both ſides with black are produced, concurring about the middle of the Neck [only the feathers that cover the Ears are of the ſame colour with the Breaſt.] The upper part of the Back, and upper covert feathers of the Wings are black. The prime feathers and reſt of the covert feathers are elegantly ſpotted with white ſemicircular ſpots. The middle part of the Back is white with croſs lines of black. The Bill, Tongue, <hi>Irides,</hi> Feet and Toes like thoſe of the laſt deſcribed. The Legs feathered, but not down to the Toes: The Claws black and crooked.

It could ruffle up the feathers of its Head, ſo as to make them appear like a Creſt, as doth the <hi>Jay.</hi> The Plumage is ſo elegantly and curiouſly coloured, that it is very difficult in words to deſcribe it; the upper part of the body being variegated with white, black, reddiſh, dusky, and grey or aſh-colour. From the crown of the Head all along the middle of the Back runs a liſt of black. The Head is cinereous, with tranſverſe white, black, and red lines: The Throat and lower Belly yellow with tranſverſe black lines; the middle of the Breaſt is whiter, with fewer lines. The feathers covering the bottom of the prime Wing-feathers are yellow, with tranſverſe black lines. The Rump is more aſh-coloured than the Head, with white ſpots and tranſverſe black lines.</p>
                        <p>The prime Wing-feathers are in number nineteen, the firſt or outmoſt being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhorter than the ſecond, black, but ſpotted with great red ſpots; which ſpots, eſpecially in the feathers next the body, are powdered with ſmall, black ſpecks. The tips of the ſecond row of Wing-feathers are white. The Tail-feathers are ten, not ſharp-pointed, nor ſtiff, nor bending inwards, as in the above deſcribed <hi>Woodpeckers;</hi> two inches and an half long, of a cinereous colour, croſſed at large intervals with bars of black: To ſpeak exactly, the part next the croſs bars is of a dark aſh-colour, the reſt of the intermediate ſpaces of a paler cinereous, ſprinkled, and as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with black ſpecks.</p>
                        <p>The Toes are ſo diſpoſed as in the reſt of this kind, two forward, two backward: The outmoſt Toes in each Foot are equal, and twice ſo long as the inmoſt.</p>
                        <p>It wants the blind Guts like the reſt of this kind. The length of the Guts was nine inches.</p>

[I have ſeen alſo that were wholly black, with their Backs of a ſanguine colour.] The Tail below from its riſe half way is yellow, the other half being black; above it is wholly black, only it hath on both ſides a feather half yellow. The Legs and Feet are black: The Bill of a Brimſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour. The Eyes of a Sapphire colour, with a black Pupil. It hath a blue Tongue, cleft or doubled at the top. Near the houſe of the Owner of the Engine <hi>Tapucurai</hi> is planted the tree <hi>Uti,</hi> in which hang more thau four hundred Neſts of theſe Birds; of which there are there a very great number, which hatch and bring up three broods of young in a year. Each Neſt is made of dry graſs and horſe-hair, or hogs briſtles mingled, of a dusky colour, of the figure of a narrow Cucurbite with its Alembick, long, in the whole about a foot and half, and from the bottom for one foot upwards hollow like a Purſe, the remaining or upper part of it for half a foot being ſolid, and hanging by its tip on the tip of a little branch of the tree. All theſe Neſts hang down on this faſhion from the tips of the twigs of trees.</p>
                        <p>We have often ſeen the Neſt of this Bird artificially built kept among other rarities in the Cabinets of the curious. I perſuade my ſelf that this was the very Bird, which the Ancients underſtood by the name of <hi>Picus nidum ſuſpendens, i. e.</hi> the Hang-neſt-Woodpecker. I am ſure there is a great deal more reaſon why this ſhould be ſo called, than the <hi>Oriolus,</hi> which <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> takes to be the <hi>Picus nidum ſuſpendens, Antonius Pigafeta</hi> writes, that Parrots do on this faſhion hang their Neſts on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the branches of trees; falſly imagining that the Neſts which he ſaw hanging on the twigs of trees were <hi>Parrots Neſts.</hi>

                        <p>IT is ſomewhat leſs than a <hi>Chaffinch.</hi> The Cock weighed almoſt an ounce. Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail was five inches three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to the end of the Toes ſix inches.</p>
                        <p>The Bill was ſtreight, triangular, black above, underneath toward the Throat white, almoſt an inch long, meaſuring from the tip to the Angles of the ſlit of the mouth. The Tongue broad, not longer than the mouth, horny at the end and jag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: The Noſthrils round, and covered with ſmall briſtles. The Head, Neck, and Back of an aſh-colour: The ſides under the Wings red: The Throat and Breaſt of a pale yellow [or rather Cheſnut-red.] The lower Belly under the Tail hath ſome red feathers with white tips. From the Bill through the Eyes to the Neck is extended a long black ſtroak: The Chin is white.</p>
                        <p>The number of flag-feathers is nineteen, of the which the firſt is very ſhort and little. The interiour, or thoſe next the body, have their Webs cinereous; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour dusky: The ſhafts of all are black. The Wings underneath are marked with a double ſpot, the one white at the roots of the exteriour quils, the other black and larger, beginning at the inſertion of the baſtard-wing.</p>
                        <p>The Tail is ſhort, ſcarce two inches, made up of twelve feathers, all of equal length, unleſs the outmoſt be ſomewhat the ſhorter, not ſharp-pointed, nor ſtiff as in <hi>Woodpeckers,</hi> but flexile and limber: The two middlemoſt cinereous; the two next to them black with cinereous tips; the two ſucceeding have the inſide of their tips white,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63869:78"/>
the outſide cinereous. The outmoſt have their tips of a dark aſh-colour, and under that a tranſverſe whiteſpot, the reſt of the feathers being black.</p>
                        <p>The Legs are ſhort; both Legs and Feet of a dark fleſh-colour. It hath but one back-toe, equal to the middle of the fore-toes. The Claws are great, crooked, and of a dusky colour; that of the back-toe the biggeſt. The outmoſt fore-toe the leaſt: Both outmoſt and inmoſt joyned to the middle toe at the bottom.</p>
                        <p>It had a muſculous Stomach or Gizzard, in which we found Beetles; ſhort blind Guts. The length of the Guts was ſix inches and an half.</p>
                        <p>It builds in the holes of trees, and if the entrance be too big, it doth artificially ſtop up part of it with clay, leaving only a ſmall hole for it ſelf to paſs in and out by.</p>
                        <p>It feeds not only upon Inſects, but alſo upon Nut-kernels. It is a pretty ſpectacle to ſee her fetch a Nut out of her hoard, place it faſt in a chink, and then ſtanding above it, with its head downwards, ſtriking it with all its force, breaks the ſhell, and catches up the Kernel.</p>

The Head, Neck, and Back cinereous: The Breaſt white: The Wings partly cinereous, partly red, <hi>viz.</hi> toward the Belly: The Tail ſhort: The long feathers of the Wings, the lower part of the Back, the Belly, and Legs, (which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of <hi>Woodpeckers,</hi> are ſhort) black: The Toes long, three ſtanding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and one backward, though <hi>Bellonius</hi> attributes to it two fore-toes, and ſo many back ones: Wherefore it is to be ſuſpected, that either he knew not the <hi>Wall-creeper,</hi> or elſe ſet forth one different from ours, which I do not believe, becauſe the reſt of the deſcription he gives of it, agrees exactly to our Bird. Thus far <hi>Aldrovandus;</hi> who writes, that this Bird is frequent and obvious enough in the Territory of <hi>Bologna;</hi> in flying like to the <hi>Hoopoe,</hi> almoſt always ſhaking its Wings like that, never reſting in one place. By later Writers it is called <hi>Picus murarius,</hi> becauſe as <hi>Woodpeckers</hi> cling to trees, and hang on them, ſo this ſticks to all Walls, eſpecially thoſe of Towers, and ſeeks Inſects in their chinks: Whence in Winter-time it is often ſeen in Cities. It is a brisk and chearful bird, and hath a pleaſant note. It flies alone, and ſometimes two in company. It builds its Neſt in the holes of trees. <hi>They ſay it is found in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; <hi>but we have not as yet had the hap to meet with it.</hi>

The Noſthrils are round and great: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes of a red hazel colour. Not far from the Angles of the mouth in the upper Mandible grow four or five black hairs.

                        <p>The number of prime feathers in each Wing is eighteen. The Plumage covering the roots of theſe feathers underneath is yellow. The Tail is three inches and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long: I mean the middle feathers, for the extreme are but two and three quarters; They have a ſtrong ſhaft, and are ſtiff like thoſe of a <hi>Woodpecker.</hi>

The Legs and Feet are great, ſtrong and muſculous, which is eſpecially remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this bird. It hath but one back-toe, which toward the root or riſe of it is broad and toroſe. The outer fore-toe is joyned to the middlemoſt at the bottom.</p>
                        <p>It had a yellow Gall, large Teſticles, a ſhorter Breaſt-bone than <hi>Woodſpites;</hi> ſhort blind Guts: Reed-Beetles in the ſtomach.</p>

The Tongue ſmall, as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> rightly hath it, deep withdrawn in the mouth, trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, being broad at bottom, and ſharp at top, like a perfect equilateral triangle. The ſhape of the body approacheth to that of a <hi>Plover.</hi> The Head is adorned with a moſt beautiful Creſt, two inches high, conſiſting of a double row of feathers, reaching from the Bill to the nape of the Neck, all along the top of the Head: Which it can at pleaſure ſet up, and let fall. It is made up of twenty four or twenty ſix fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſome of which are longer than others; the tips of them are black; under the black they are white, the remaining part under the white being of a Cheſnut, inclining to yellow. The Neck is of a pale red: The Breaſt white, variegated with black ſtrokes tending downward. The older birds had no black ſtrokes in their Breaſts, but only in their ſides. The Tail is four inches and an half long: <hi>[Aldrovan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> ſaith ſix] made up of ten feathers only, black, with a croſs mark or bed of white of the figure of a Creſcent or <hi>Parabola,</hi> the middle being toward the Rump, the horns toward the ends of the feathers.

The Chin is white with a certain mixture of red; the middle alſo of the Breaſt or Belly is of the like colour. The lower Belly under the Tail is of a deep red, as are alſo the ſides and feathers under the Wings. The Breaſt is red, the outmoſt borders of the feathers being of a dirty bluiſh green. From the Neck through the middle of the Back to the Tail it is of a moſt lovely bright, but pale blue, which by its ſplendour is ſaid to hurt their Eyes that look long and intently upon it. If you heed this colour attentively you may obſerve the blue croſſed with obſcure or dark-coloured lines. Between the Noſthrils and the Eyes is a red ſpot, and another beyond the Eyes: to which ſucceeds a white mark, tinctured with red. The crown of the Head is of a black green, with croſs blue lines.</p>
                        <p>In each Wing are twenty three Quils, of which the third is the longeſt; both quil-feathers, and thoſe next to them have their exteriour Webs blue, their interiour dusky. The leſſer rows of Wing-feathers, all excepting thoſe covering the baſe of the Wing, have blue tips. The long-feathers ſpringing from the ſhoulders, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Back, are of a bluiſh green. The Tail is ſhort, about an inch and an half in length, made up of twelve feathers, of a dark blue, with ſomewhat of black.</p>
                        <p>The Legs and Feet are very ſhort and little, black before, red behind, as are alſo the ſoals of the feet and the back-toes. The ſtructure of the Feet in this Bird is ſingular and different from all others, for the three lower joynts of the outmoſt toe are joyned to the middlemoſt; of the inmoſt only one: This inner toe is the leaſt, and ſhorter by half than the middlemoſt, the outer almoſt equal to the middlemoſt: The back-toe is ſomewhat bigger than the inner foretoe. The third or loweſt bone of the Leg is greater than is uſual in other birds. The toes ſeem as it were joynted with many croſs lines. The bones of the Tongue are leſſer and ſhorter than in other birds.</p>
                        <p>The Stomach is great and lax, as in carnivorous birds; in that we diſſected was full of the bones and ſcales of fiſhes. The Guts are ſlenderer toward the vent. <hi>Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> affirms, that the fat of this bird is red; which we found to be true. The ſame Author tells us, that in one Neſt are often found nine young ones: In a Neſt in a hole about half a yard deep in the bank of a River we obſerved but five young ones.</p>
                        <p>It is a Vulgar perſuaſion, that this bird, being hung up on an untwiſted thread by the Bill in any room, will turn its Breaſt to that quarter of the Heaven whence the wind blows: They that doubt of it may try it.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <hi>Charleton,</hi> in his <hi>Onomaſticon,</hi> makes mention of another <hi>Kingfiſher</hi> brought out of <hi>India,</hi> which ſcarce exceeds a <hi>Wren</hi> in bigneſs. We have not as yet hapned to ſee this Bird, neither do we remember to have elſewhere read any thing of it.</p>

                        <p>IT is by the <hi>Portugues</hi> called <hi>Papa peixe,</hi> becauſe it lives upon fiſh.

The Feet have four toes (one ſtanding backward) of unequal length: For the two outer are ſhort and contiguous, but the third or inner is much the ſhorter, and more remote. The Claws are black. The Tail is two inches long, reaching further than the ends of the Wings. The ſuperiour feathers of the whole body, <hi>viz.</hi> the Head, Neck, Wings, and Tail, are of a ruſty, but ſhining, colour. About the Neck it hath a ring of pure white feathers. The Throat, underſide of the Neck, Breaſt, and Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are alſo cloathed with white feathers. Near both the Eyes it hath alſo a ſpot of white. In the Tail ſome of the feathers are ſprinkled with white ſpots, which yet are ſcarce ſeen, unleſs when they ſpread their Wings and fly.</p>

                        <p>The Bill is great, from the tip to the Angles of the Mouth almoſt two inches long, black, and for the proportion of the body very like that of a <hi>Kingfiſher,</hi> ſave only that it is a little more arcuate or bending downward: The Tongue ſlender, deeply cut in or torn at the tip: The <note n="*" place="margin">Circles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing the Pupils.</note> 
                           <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes of a lovely red, and in ſome of a hazel colour.</p>
                        <p>The Head is great and oblong. The colour of the feathers at the Baſe of the upper Chap is a greeniſh blue, but in the middle between the Noſthrils white. The crown of the Head red, but in ſome birds having ſomething of green mixt. From the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the mouth through the Eyes on each ſide is extended a black ſtroak; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous whereto under the Chin are bright, but pale yellow feathers. The Neck and Shoulders are green, with a certain mixture of red. The whole Belly and Breaſt, as far as the Chin, are blue, this colour is deeper near the Chin, fainter on the Breaſt and Belly. In ſome the colour of the underſide inclines more to green: Perchance theſe are Cocks.</p>
                        <p>The number of beam-feathers in each Wing is about twenty one or twenty two; decreaſing by degrees to the tenth. All to the twentieth have black tips. The firſt or outmoſt ten beneath the black are of a bluiſh green: The next nine beneath the black are of a lovely Orange colour, as are alſo the leſſer rows next to them: Thoſe above near the ridge of the Wing are blue. The long feathers ſpringing from the ſhoulders are of a pale yellow.</p>
                        <p>The Tail is near an hand-breadth long, made up of twelve feathers, of a blue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the exteriour Webs having ſomething of green intermixt: The underſide of the Tail was of a dun colour. The two middle feathers run out in length beyond the reſt, and end in ſharp points.</p>
                        <p>The Legs are very ſhort, but thick for the length: Both Legs and Feet exactly like thoſe of the <hi>King-fiſher.</hi> For the fore-toes, as in that, are all joyned together to the firſt joynt, as if they were but one toe, the outmoſt and middle to the ſecond or third. The Claws are black, the Feet and Toes of a dusky red.</p>
                        <p>The Liver was of a pale yellow: The Stomach rather membranous than muſculous, in that we diſſected filled with Beetles and other Inſects. The colours of the Wings varied in ſeveral birds, in ſome was more blue, in ſome more green, in ſome more red, and in ſome leſs.</p>
                        <p>It is ſtrange that <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> ſhould not take any notice of, or not mention at leaſt the connexion of the Toes in this Bird.</p>

                           <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, that it feeds upon <hi>Bees,</hi> whom all other Writers of the Hiſtory of Animals do therein follow.

It flies not ſingly, but in flocks, and eſpecially by the ſides of thoſe Mountains where the true Thyme grows. Its Voice is heard afar off, almoſt like to the whiſtling of a man. Its ſingular elegancy invites the <hi>Candy</hi> Boys to hunt for it with <hi>Cicadae,</hi> as they do alſo for thoſe greater Swallows called <hi>Swifts,</hi> after this manner: bending a Pin like a hook, and tying it by the Head to the end of a thread, they thruſt it through a <hi>Cicada,</hi> (as Boys bait a hook with a fly) holding the other end of the thread in their hand.

                        <p>This Bird is a little longer than the precedent, and (as its picture ſhews) a little groſſer or thicker-bodied: Its Bill is black, long, ſharp-pointed, and approaching ſomewhat more to the figure of a Sithe than in that. The Head, Neck, Breaſt, and almoſt the whole Belly yellow. From the bill it hath a great black ſpot, which is carried on backwards through the Eyes to the beginning of the Neck. The Back is of a Cheſnut colour, but mingled with green and yellow. The Wing-feathers are painted with divers colours: For the firſt [the uppermoſt] are blue, the ſecond mixt of blue and yellow, the third altogether yellow; the fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> the prime or beam-feathers black, with red tips. The upper part of the Tail is of a bright green, the lower of a very fair yellow, ſo that it ſeems to be half green, half yellow. It hath yellow Feet and black Claws.</p>

It hath ſhort Legs, not much exceeding an inch in length, for colour black: Four Toes in each Foot, one ſituate backward, three forwards, as is ordinary: But the firſt or inmoſt foretoe is ſhorter, the middlemoſt longeſt, and the third again ſhort, but not of equal riſe with the reſt: For the riſe of the firſt is from the middle of the foot, and alſo of the ſecond; but the riſe or beginning of the third is near the third joynt of the middlemoſt: The firſt hath three joynts, the ſecond four, the third again three, the back-toe but two.

The whole body is about ſix inches long. The feathers very beautiful: <hi>viz.</hi> on their Head they have as it were a Mitre or Crown of Sapphire-coloured feathers, which near the riſe of the Bill reſemble

                        <p>The Head and upper ſide of the Neck are of a dark, dusky colour, or black with an eye of red.

Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> ſaith, it is either equal or bigger, but I think that, if either have advantage of other in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63869:82"/>
it is the <hi>Oſtrich.</hi> When it holds up its Head it approacheth to the height of two Yards. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, that it exceeds the height of a horſeman ſitting on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back: Which is to be underſtood when it ſtretches its Neck forth, and reaches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as high as it can. The Head is ſmall, depreſſed or flat-crown'd, and (as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> truly) like a <hi>Gooſes:</hi> The Bill alſo is compreſſed, and compared with the body very ſmall, of a triangular figure, and horn colour, the tip being black. The skin at the Noſthrils ends in a ſemicircle. The ſlit of the mouth is large, reaching ſo far that its extremes or Angles lie directly under the Eyes. The Eyes are great, with hazel-coloured <hi>Irides.</hi> Of all great birds this alone hath both Eye-lids [upper and lower] as <hi>Pliny</hi> witneſſeth. Which whether it be true or not we leave to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by others that have opportunity of ſeeing the bird. The Head and Neck, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as far as the Breaſt, are bare of feathers, as are alſo the Thighs. The Head and Neck are covered with a certain Down, or thin-ſet hairs inſtead of feathers. The ſides under the Wings, and the Thighs are abſolutely bare. The lower part of the Neck where the feathers begin is white. The Wings are ſmall, and altogether unuſeful for flying, deſigned by Nature only to aſſiſt the bird in running, being ſpread and moved. The feathers of the Back in the Cock are cole-black, in the Hen only dusky, ſo ſoft that they reſemble a kind of Wool. The Wing-feathers are of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour [with the Back] beneath, but above in their upper part purely white. The Tail is thick, buſhy, and round, not as in other Birds, to be ſpread out in breadth, the component feathers in the Cock being whitiſh, in the Hen duskiſh, with white tops; which feathers are in great requeſt for Souldiers Hats, Helmets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its Neck and Legs are very long: It hath but two toes, wanting the back-toe and inmoſt foretoe. The outer toe in that we deſcribed was five inches and an half long, the other eight: The length of the whole Foot from the end of the heel eleven Inches. The longer Toe was covered with twenty four great, disjoyned, annulary ſcales. This Toe is armed with a great, ſtrong, black Claw; the other or outer Toe had no Claw in the Bird we deſcribed. The Toes are connected with a thick, ſtrong membrane as far as the firſt joynt.</p>
                        <p>It ſwallows Iron, Leather, Graſs, Bread, Hair, and whatever elſe you offer it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly: Howbeit it doth not concoct Iron and other hard things, but avoids them entire by ſiege. That we ſaw at <hi>Bruxels</hi> was uſually fed with bread mixt with hair. <hi>Africa</hi> produces this bird; in the Deſarts whereof are ſometimes ſeen ſuch multitudes of them in company, that to them that behold them afar off they ſeem to be Troops or Armies of horſemen. They are alſo found abundantly in <hi>Arabia;</hi> and not leſs plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully in <hi>America,</hi> but of a different kind; as will appear by and by.</p>
                        <p>They lay very great Eggs, <hi>viz.</hi> ſometimes as big as a young Childs head, and of fifteen pound weight, covered with a very hard and ſtony ſhell, which being buried in the ſand, are cheriſhed only by the heat of the Sun till the Young be excluded. For the Writers of Natural Hiſtory do generally agree, that the old birds after they have layed and covered their Eggs in the ſand forſake them, and take no more care of them.</p>
                        <p>That Oſtrich-feathers were much uſed by the Ancients for the adorning of Caps, Helmets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is manifeſt by the teſtimony of <hi>Pliny:</hi> And that ſtill they retain their eſteem, being alſo uſed now adays for the ſame purpoſes every body knows. They were alſo formerly wont to be employed, not only in <hi>Italy,</hi> but in <hi>England,</hi> for to make Fans for Gentlewomen, to cool themſelves withal in the Summer time.</p>

Their whole body is covered with grey feathers,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63869:82"/>
which are longer and more beautiful on the Back. The body with the feathers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears almoſt round. They have not ſuch a Tail made up of creſted feathers, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented commonly in the Pictures of <hi>Oſtriches;</hi> but the feathers are ſtretched forth along the Back even to the vent. It ſwallows bits of Iron, Braſs-mony, Dice, or any the like things you offer it, but concocts them not, caſting them out again by ſiege. It feeds on fruits and fleſh.

                        <p>WE have ſeen four birds of this kind at <hi>London;</hi> three Males, and one Female: <hi>viz.</hi> one Male among his Majeſties birds kept in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park near <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter;</hi> two Males and a Female at Mr. <hi>Maydſtons,</hi> an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Merchant in <hi>Newgate-Market,</hi> brought out of the <hi>Eaſt Indies.</hi> It hath a horny Crown on the top of the Head. The Head and Neck are bare of feathers, only thin-ſet with a hairy down. The skin is of a purpliſh blue colour, excepting the lower part of the backſide of the Neck, which is red, [or of a Vermilion colour.] In the lower part of the Neck hand down two Wattles or Lobes of fleſh as low as the Breaſt. It hath a very wide mouth. The Bill is near four inches long, of a moderate thickneſs, and ſtreight. The Legs are thick, and ſtrong. It hath three Toes in each foot, all ſtanding forward, for it wants the back-toe. The Claw of the outmoſt Toe is much longer than the reſt. It hath ſome rudiments of Wings rather than Wings, conſiſting of only five naked ſhafts of feathers, ſomewhat like <hi>Porcupines</hi> quils, having either no Webs and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thery parts, or which were in the Bird we deſcribed broken and worn off. It hath no Tail; a great body inveſted with blackiſh or dusky feathers, of a rare texture, which to one that beholds the Bird at a diſtance ſeem rather to be hairs than feathers. It is a gentle-natured bird, and eaſily made tame. We ſhall give the Reader a more full and accurate deſcription of all its parts out of <hi>Cluſius</hi> his Exotics. This Bird (ſaith he) as it walked, holding up its head, exceeded the height of four foot by ſome inches: For the Neck from the top of the Head to the beginning of the Back was almoſt thirteen inches long; the body two foot over; the Thighs with the Legs to the bending of the Feet ſeventeen inches long. The length of the body it ſelf from the Breaſt to the Rump was almoſt three foot. The feathers covering the whole body, with thoſe on the lower part of the Neck next to the Breaſt and Belly, and the Thighs were all double, two coming out of the ſame ſmall ſhort pipe or hoſe, and lying the one upon the other; the upper being ſomewhat the thicker or groſſer, the nether the more fine and delicate: They are alſo of a different length, as I obſerved in the caſe of the like Bird. For thoſe on the lower part of the Neck were ſhorter; thoſe on the middle of the body and ſides longer <hi>(viz.</hi> of ſix or ſeven inches:) But thoſe on the extreme or hind-part of the body about the Rump (for it wanted the Tail) nine inches long, and harder than the reſt. Although they are all hard or ſtiff, yet are they not broad but narrow, with thin-ſet filaments oppoſite one to another on each ſide; of a black colour, but about the Thighs tending to cinereous, the ſhaft only remaining black, as in the reſt. Theſe feathers had that form and ſituation, that to thoſe that behold the Bird afar off, its skin might well be thought to be covered not with feathers, but only with hairs, ſeeming like to a <hi>Bears;</hi> and to want Wings; though indeed it had Wings, lying hid under the feathers covering the ſides, furniſhed with <note n="*" place="margin">We obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved five ſhafts of feathers in each Wing.</note> four greater feathers of a black colour, as I obſerved in the caſe, though they were ſo broken at the tops, that I could determine nothing certainly concerning their length. But their broken ſhafts were pretty thick, hard and ſolid, and ran deep down into the outmoſt part of the Wing. The upper part of the Wing next the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had its covert feathers like thoſe on the Breaſt. For it is to be thought, that this kind of Wings are given to this Bird to aſſiſt her and promote her ſpeed in running: For I believe ſhe cannot fly, nor raiſe her ſelf from the earth: [He might have been more poſitive in this, for it is moſt certain.] The Legs in compaſs exceeded five inches, and were covered with many as it were barks or broad ſcales, eſpecially above the bending of the foot. It had thick, hard Feet, divided into three thick Toes, on the upper part covered with ſcales, underneath altogether callous: The middle (which was longer than the reſt) conſiſted of three joynts, the interiour of one, the exteriour
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63869:83"/>
of two. The Claws of all were very great, almoſt two inches long, thick, hard, and horny. The Head was ſmall for the bigneſs of the bird, and almoſt bald or ſmooth, of a dark Purple colour, together with the upper part of the Neck, in which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared thin-ſet, black hairs. The Eyes a little above the ſlit of the Bill, great, and firy, almoſt like to thoſe of Lions, compaſſed with black hairs, as are alſo thoſe ſmall, open Ear-holes which it had behind the Eyes. The upper Chap of the Bill was as it were arched or bent like a Bow, a little above the point perforate with two holes, ſerving for Noſthrils; from the middle whereof, reaching to the top of the Head, ariſes a kind of towring Diadem or Crown, of a horny ſubſtance, near three inches high, of a dusky yellow colour; which, as I underſtood, falls off at moulting time, and grows up again with the new feathers. The nether Chap of the Bill from the <note n="*" place="margin">I ſuppoſe he means from the corners of the ſlit of the mouth.</note> ſlit to the utmoſt point was five inches long. The fore-part of the Neck, almoſt four inches below the Bill, had as it were two membranous Wattles hanging down like a beard, two inches long, of a red Vermilion colour. The back-part of the Neck was likewiſe deſtitute of feathers, from the Head all along, being alſo of a red Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion colour: The lower part was covered with ſome few red feathers, wherewith black ones were intermingled.</p>
                        <p>This Bird, although it ſeem to have ſome marks common with the <hi>Oſtrich,</hi> as a ſmall Head, almoſt bald; and that without choice it ſwallows whatever you offer it; yet hath it not feet divided into two Toes like them, but into three, wanting the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe, after the manner of the <hi>Buſtards:</hi> And therefore ſo firm and ſtrong, that I have ſeen a tree of the bigneſs of a mans thigh wholly cruſhed, and its bark taken away (as its Maſter told me) by the Feet and Claws of this bird. For it was not wont to aſſault thoſe with whom it fought, with its Bill, running forward; but turning it ſelf obliquely or ſideways, to ſtrike backward with its Feet.</p>
                        <p>But although it devoured indifferently whatever was offered, as <hi>Oranges</hi> entire, and the like, yet its ordinary food was white bread, which it ſwallowed divided into great lumps or morſels. But I was informed, that it was eſpecially delighted with new-laid Hens Eggs, which it ſwallowed whole together with the ſhell. But if it were not in perfect health, it avoided them again entire, and then ſwallowing them anew the ſecond time, it retained and concocted them. Moreover they affirmed to me, that this bird was a Cock, and that it was ſometimes ſeen to put forth a <hi>penis</hi> from behind like a <hi>Camel.</hi> An Egg of this bird, the greateſt and faireſt among many that I ſaw, being meaſured longways was fifteen inches in circuit, croſs-ways but twelve, or a little more: So that for its bigneſs it might be imployed and uſed for a veſſel, as well as an <hi>Oſtriches,</hi> which, (as <hi>Pliny</hi> teſtifies) the Ancients did ſometimes uſe, and our Age alſo ſtill doth for that purpoſe. For I remember that I have more than once ſeen <hi>Oſtriches</hi> Eggs, tipt with, and ſet in Silver, made uſe of for drinking Cups. Howbeit the Shell of this Birds Egg was not very thick nor white, like the Shells of <hi>Oſtriches</hi> Eggs, but in the outſide of a greeniſh aſh-colour, adorned with continuous, at leaſt very thick-ſet ſmall protuberances of a deep green. Of the reſt which I ſaw one was almoſt of the ſame bigneſs, form, and colour with that deſcribed; but ſome were more round, others leſſer; the colour alſo of ſome was more dilute, and leſs elegant. Moreover, it was told me, that this ſort of Bird is not peculiar to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucca</hi> Iſlands, but found alſo in <hi>Sumatra</hi> or <hi>Taprobane,</hi> and the neighbouring Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to thoſe Iſlands. Thus far <hi>Cluſius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Hen is much leſs than the Cock, of a dark Olive or dusky colour. <hi>It ſeems to be a miracle in nature</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> who borrowed his deſcription out of the Journal of a <hi>Holland</hi> Voyage) <hi>that this bird wants a Tongue. Whatever it eats it ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</hi> This is not ſo very wonderful; for we know other Birds beſides this which want the Tongue, as for example, The <hi>Pelican,</hi> &amp;c. Whatever other Authors have concerning the <hi>Emeu,</hi> as far as I have read, is all tranſcribed out of <hi>Cluſius:</hi> Excepting Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> who doth briefly deſcribe this Bird from ocular inſpection; adding, that it ſwallows even live coals: And I have obſerved a Cut of it in the Tables of birds ſet out by <hi>Viſscher,</hi> with this Inſcription, <hi>Avis ignem devorans; i. e.</hi> The bird that eats or devours fire.</p>

                           <hi>Cygnaea</hi> or <hi>Cerne</hi> by the <hi>Portugues, Mauritius</hi> Iſland by the <hi>Low Dutch,</hi> of thirty miles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, famous eſpecially for black Ebony, did equal or exceed a <hi>Swan</hi> in bigneſs, but was of a far different ſhape: For its Head was great, covered as it were with a certain membrane reſembling a hood: Beſide, its Bill was not flat and broad, but thick and long; of a yellowiſh colour next the Head, the point being black: The upper Chap was hooked; in the nether had a bluiſh ſpot in the middle between the yellow and black part. They reported that it is covered with thin and ſhort feathers, and wants Wings, inſtead whereof it hath only four or five long, black feathers; that the hinder part of the body is yery fat and fleſhy, wherein for the Tail were four or five ſmall curled feathers, twirled up together, of an aſh-colour. Its Legs are thick ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than long, whoſe upper part, as far as the knee, is covered with black feathers; the lower part, together with the Feet, of a yellowiſh colour: Its Feet divided into four toes, three (and thoſe the longer) ſtanding forward, the fourth and ſhorteſt backward; all furniſhed with black Claws. After I had compoſed and writ down the Hiſtory of this Bird with as much diligence and faithfulneſs as I could, I hapned to ſee in the houſe of <hi>Peter Pawius,</hi> primary Profeſſor of Phyſic in the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi> a Leg thereof cut off at the knee, lately brought over out of <hi>Mauritius</hi> his Iſland. It was not very long, from the knee to the bending of the foot being but little more than four inches; but of a great thickneſs, ſo that it was almoſt four inches in compaſs, and covered with thick-ſet ſcales, on the upper ſide broader, and of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh colour, on the under [or backſide of the Leg] leſſer and dusky. The upper ſide of the Toes was alſo covered with broad ſcales, the under ſide wholly callous. The Toes were ſhort for ſo thick a Leg: For the length of the greateſt or middlemoſt Toe to the nail did not much exceed two inches, that of the other Toe next to it ſcarce came up to two inches: The back-toe fell ſomething ſhort of an inch and half: But the Claws of all were thick, hard, black, leſs than an inch long; but that of the back-toe longer than the reſt, exceeding an inch. The Mariners in their dialect gave this bird the name of <hi>Walghvogel,</hi> that is, a nauſeous, or yellowiſh bird: Partly becauſe after long boyling its fleſhbecame not tender, but continued hard, and of a difficult concoction; excepting the Breaſt and Gizzard, which they found to be of no bad reliſh; partly becauſe they could eaſily get many <hi>Turtle-Doves,</hi> which were much more delicate and pleaſant to the Palate. Wherefore it was no wonder that in compariſon of thoſe they deſpiſed this, and ſaid they could well be content to be without it. Moreover they ſaid, that they found certain ſtones in its Gizzard: <hi>And no wonder, for all other birds as well as theſe ſwallow ſtones, to aſſiſt them in grinding their meat.</hi> Thus far <hi>Cluſius.</hi>

                           <hi>Bontius</hi> writes, that this Bird is for bigneſs of mean ſize, between an <hi>Oſtrich</hi> and a <hi>Turkey,</hi> from which it partly differs in ſhape, and partly agrees with them, eſpecially with the <hi>African Oſtriches,</hi> if you conſider the Rump, quils, and feathers: So that it ſhews like a Pigmy among them, if you regard the ſhortneſs of its Legs. It hath a great, ill-favoured Head, covered with a kind of membrane reſembling a hood: Great, black Eyes, a bending, prominent, fat Neck: An extraordinary long, ſtrong, bluiſh white Bill, only the ends of each Mandible are of a different colour, that of the upper black, that of the nether yellowiſh, both ſharp-pointed and crooked. It gapes huge wide, as being naturally very voracious. Its body is fat, round, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſoft, grey feathers, after the manner of an <hi>Oſtriches:</hi> In each ſide inſtead of hard Wing-feathers or quils, it is furniſhed with ſmall ſoft-feathered Wings, of a yellowiſh aſh-colour; and behind the Rump, inſtead of a Tail, is adorned with five ſmall curled feathers of the ſame colour. It hath yellow Legs, thick, but very ſhort; four Toes in each foot, ſolid, long, as it were ſcaly, armed with ſtrong, black Claws. It is a ſlow-paced and ſtupid bird, and which eaſily becomes a prey to the Fowlers. The fleſh, eſpecially of the Breaſt, is fat, eſculent, and ſo copious, that three or four <hi>Dodos</hi> will ſometimes ſuffice to fill an hundred Seamens bellies. If they be old, or not well boyled, they are of difficult concoction, and are ſalted and ſtored up for proviſion of victual.

                     <p>THe characteriſtic notes of the Poultry kind are: 1. To have a ſhort, ſtrong, and ſomewhat crooked Bill, very fit to pick up grains of Corn, Pulſe, and other Seeds, on which this kind chiefly feeds: 2. A thick and fleſhy body: 3. Short, hollow Wings; whence this ſort of birds flies not high, and makes but ſhort flights for the moſt part: 4. A Stomach furniſhed with thick muſcles, whoſe uſe is to grind the grains of Corn, and other hard meat ſwallowed whole, which they perform by the help of little ſtones which the birds now and then ſwallow; and ſo ſupply the defect of Teeth: 5. Very long blind guts: 6. White fleſh, eſpecially that of the muſcles of the Breaſt, which colour after boyling diſcovers it ſelf more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly. This note is peculiar to this kind, not agreeing to any other bird that I know. This is a ſign that their fleſh is of all other moſt wholſom, and affords beſt nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: So that it is not undeſervedly had in higheſt eſteem, and ſold deareſt of any other. 7. To breed many young at a time. 8. To build their Neſts upon the ground; the reaſon whereof is becauſe 9. The young ones newly hatched are not fed by their Dams with meat put into their mouths, but are covered with a thick Down, forſake their Neſts, and running up and down follow the old ones, and feed themſelves, pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their meat with their Bills. 10. Becauſe they are (as we ſaid) corpulent, and cannot fly long, they ſeek their food walking up and down upon the earth, and for that reaſon have broad Toes, that they may ſtand firmer and ſurer, and are for the moſt part good runners. 11. The moſt, if not all birds of this kind, duſt themſelves. 12. The Poultry kind only, but not all the ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> of this kind, are armed with Spurs.</p>

By its erect Tail having the component feathers ſo ſituate as to make an Angle or ridge; its fleſhy, naked, ſerrate Comb, and Gills or Wattles hanging down under its Chin, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63869:84"/>
laſtly, by its long Spurs, it is abundantly diſtinguiſhed from all other birds of its kind, and eaſily known at firſt ſight. The <hi>Dunghil Cock</hi> alone of all diurnal Birds (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the <hi>Nightingale)</hi> ſings or crows by night, <hi>viz.</hi> after Midnight two or three times at intervals before break of day. The number of quill-feathers in each Wing, computing all to the very leaſt, is twenty ſeven. The Tail conſiſts of fourteen, which as far as I know, is peculiar to this <hi>Species:</hi> For the reſt of the Poultry kind have eighteen, or at leaſt ſixteen feathers apiece in their Tails. Of theſe the two middlemoſt are in Cocks the longeſt, and elegantly reflected or arcuate; <hi>Sickle feathers</hi> the Vulgar call them.</p>
                        <p>The Cock being a moſt ſalacious bird doth ſuddenly grow old, and becomes leſs fit for generation. For his ſpirits being ſpent, and the radical moiſture, as they call it, conſumed, by the immoderate uſe of Venery, his body muſt neceſſarily wax dry, and his heat of luſt be extinguiſhed. <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> writes, that himſelf hath found by experience, that Cocks when they are above three years old do indeed impregnate Hens, but that they become more impotent and inſufficient for ſuch exerciſes. Hens alſo, ſith they do for the greateſt part of the year daily lay Eggs, cannot long ſuffice for ſo many births, but for the moſt part after three or four years become barren and effete. For when they have ſpent all the Seed-Eggs which from the beginning were in their bodies, they muſt needs ceaſe to lay, there being no new ones generated within.</p>
                        <p>How long theſe Birds would live, were they let alone, I cannot certainly determine, though <hi>Aldrov.</hi> limits their age to ten years. For they being kept only for profit, and within a few years (as we ſaid before) becoming unfit for generation, who is there that without all hope of gain will keep them only to make experiment how long they will live? But that they are in their kind ſhort-lived we may rightly infer from their ſalaciouſneſs and intemperate luſt, which infeebles the body, waſtes the ſpirits, and haſtens the end.</p>
                        <p>Cocks, being very couragious and high ſpirited birds, that will rather die than yield, are wont by our Countrymen to be with great care and exact diet fed and trained up for the combat. For in Cities and great Towns there are frequent Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fightings, yet not upon ſet days, but appointed by the Cock-maſters at their pleaſure, or when they agree among themſelves. Yea, in many places there are Theaters built, (Cock-pits they call them) where ſuch ſhows are exhibited, to which there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a great concourſe of people. There are matches made, and great Wagers laid, beſides bettings on either ſide of great ſums of money, which they carry away whoſe Cocks get the victory. Right and well bred Cocks of the Game, will ſooner die upon the ſpot, than yield and give over the fight, or turn tail and run away.</p>
                        <p>No better fleſh in the world (in my opinion) than that of a year-old Pullet well fed, or a fat Capon; nothing inferiour to, not to ſay better than that of a <hi>Pheaſant</hi> or <hi>Partridge,</hi> Some there are that think, and we alſo incline to their opinion, that the fleſh of thoſe Hens is moſt ſweet and delicate, which are fed at the Barn-door, running about, and exerciſing themſelves in getting their food, by ſcraping with their feet: And that the fleſh of thoſe is leſs pleaſant and wholſom, that are ſhut up in Coops and cram'd. Some are ſo curious that they think thoſe limbs moſt wholſom which are moſt exerciſed, and therefore in Wild-Fowl they prefer the Wings, in Tame the Legs.</p>
                        <p>A particular Anatomical deſcription of the <hi>Cvarium,</hi> or Egg-cluſter, the womb and other parts of generation in a Hen may be ſeen in <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> his <hi>Ornithology,</hi> tom. 2. p. 199, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but a more exact in Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi>'s <hi>Exercitations De Generatione.</hi> Of the Coition of Cock and Hen, laying of Eggs, ſitting, and hatching of Chickens the ſame Authors may be conſulted; as alſo that great Anatomiſt and Naturaliſt <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus Malpighius,</hi> in his little Tractate <hi>de Ovo,</hi> who of all others doth moſt exactly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the proceſs of generation, or of the formation, and growth of the Chicken in the Egg, during the whole time of incubation, and hath alſo illuſtrated his deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Figures. Of the uſe of the fleſh, Eggs, and all other parts of Pullen both in Food and Phyſic, <hi>Geſner</hi> and <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> have writ ſufficiently; to whoſe works we refer thoſe who deſire to know all thoſe particulars.</p>
                        <p>That the <hi>Lion</hi> is afraid of a <hi>Cock,</hi> cannot endure the ſight of him, yea, is terrified by his very crowing, hath been delivered and received by Ancients and Moderns with unanimous conſent and approbation, and divers reaſons ſought and aſſigned for this antipathy: When as the thing it ſelf is by experience found to be falſe.</p>
                        <p>We have beheld more than once, not without pleaſure and admiration, a <hi>Capon</hi> bringing up a brood of <hi>Chickens</hi> like a Hen, clocking of them, feeding of them, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63869:85"/>
brooding them under his Wings, with as much care and tenderneſs as their Dams are wont to do. And we were told, that he was trained and induced to perform this office, almoſt after the ſame manner that <hi>Jo. Baptiſta Porta</hi> preſcribes, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Magiae Nat. cap.</hi> 26. Firſt, they make him very tame, ſo as to take meat out of ones hand, then about Evening-time pluck the feathers off his breaſt, and rub the bare skin with Nettles, and then put the Chickens to him, which preſently run under his breaſt and belly, and (it is likely) rubbing his breaſt gently with their heads allay the ſtinging and it ching of the Nettles; and this they do for two or three nights, till he begin to love and delight in the Chickens. Perchance alſo the querulous voice of the Chickens may be pleaſant to him in miſery, and invite him to ſuccour the miſerable. A Capon once accuſtomed to this ſervice will not give it over, but when one brood is grown up, you may take them away, and put another to him of newly hatcht Chickens, and he ſhall be as kind to them, and take as much care of them as of the former, and ſo others, till all being grown up or removed, he hath been for ſome time idle and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed the employment.</p>
                        <p>I might be infinite ſhould I proſecute at large all that might be ſaid of this bird, or write a full, exact, and particular Hiſtory of it. If any Reader deſires to know more of it, let him conſult <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> whoſe deſign was, to omit nothing in his Hiſtory which was either known to himſelf, or had been before publiſhed by others.</p>
                        <p>This ſame Author in his <hi>Ornithology</hi> gives us many kinds, or rather rarities, of Hens. 1. A common Hen, but white and copped, <hi>lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. 2. A dwarf Hen, or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg'd Hen: Which variety is alſo found in <hi>England,</hi> kept by the curious, and called <hi>Grigs.</hi> 3. A <hi>Padua</hi> Cock and Hen: Which ought rather to be called a <hi>Pulverara</hi> Cock and Hen; from <hi>Pulverara</hi> a Village ſome miles diſtant from <hi>Padua,</hi> where they are found. Theſe are larger and fairer Fowl than the common ſort, elſe differ in no particular: Whence alſo if they be removed into other Countries, they do by degrees degenerate, and in a ſhort time [in ſome few generations] come to be of the ſize and and ſhape of the Natives of ſuch places. 4. A rough-footed Cock and Hen, <hi>lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. 5. A <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cock and Hen, different from ours eſpecially in the variety and beauty of their colours, <hi>cap.</hi> 6. 6. A <hi>Perſian</hi> Cock and Hen, whoſe characteriſtic is the wanting of a Rump or Tail. This kind is alſo kept by ſome among us, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Rumkins.</hi> The firſt five varieties, in my opinion, differ not ſpecifically. For theſe Birds by reaſon of the difference of Climate, ſoil, food, and other accidents, vary infinitely in colours, differ alſo in bigneſs, and in having or wanting tufts on their heads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe birds which he deſcribes and gives figures of in the tenth and eleventh Chapters, under the titles of <hi>Another Indian Cock and Hen,</hi> and in the twelfth Chapter under the title of <hi>two other Indian</hi> Hens, are the ſame with the <hi>Mitu</hi> and <hi>Mituporanga</hi> of <hi>Marggravius,</hi> of which we ſhall give an account §. IV.</p>
                        <p>The Wool-bearing Hen I take to be altogether fabulous, and its figure in <hi>Aldrov. lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. taken out of a certain Map, fictitious. Perchance it was no other than the friſled or <hi>Friſland</hi> Hen, which <hi>Odoricus de Foro Julii</hi> and Sir <hi>John Mandevil</hi> call the Wool-bearing Hen. The birds which <hi>M. Panlus Venetus</hi> makes mention of in theſe words, <hi>In the City</hi> Quelinfu, <hi>in the Kingdom of</hi> Mangi <hi>are found Hens, which inſtead of feathers have hairs like Cats, of ablack colour, and lay very good Eggs,</hi> ſeem to be <hi>Caſſowaries.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beſides thoſe ſet forth by <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> we have often ſeen, and our ſelves alſo have now at <hi>Middleton</hi> another kind or variety of Hen, called in <hi>Engliſh</hi> the <hi>Friſland</hi> Hen, not (as I ſuppoſe) becauſe it was firſt brought to us out of <hi>Friſland,</hi> but becauſe the feathers of the body are curled or friſled: By which Epithete I believe this Bird was at firſt called, the word being afterward by the miſtake of the Vulgar corrupted into <hi>Friſland,</hi> of like ſound. For knowing this to be an outlandiſh Hen, they thought it could not be more fitly denominated than from its Country, and thereupon imagined it to be called a <hi>Friſland</hi> Hen, inſtead of a friſled Hen. Nor did they want a probable argument to induce them to think it to be of a <hi>Friſland</hi> breed or original, <hi>viz.</hi> the curling of the feathers, which one would be apt to attribute to the horror of cold. I ſuppoſe this to be the ſame bird which <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> hath put in the Chapter of monſtrous Hens, in the laſt place, whoſe figure he ſaith was ſent him by <hi>Pompilius Tagliaſerrus</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> with this deſcription. <hi>I would have you to underſtand, that there are two things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially found in this Cock worthy of admiration. The firſt and chief is, that the feathers of its Wings have a contrary ſituation to thoſe of other birds, for that ſide which in others is naturally under moſt or inmoſt, in this is turned outward, ſo that the whole Wing ſeems to be</hi>
                           <pb n="157" facs="tcp:63869:85"/>
                           <hi>inverted: The other is, that the feathers of the Neck are reflected towards the head like a creſt or ruff, which way the whole Tail alſo turns up.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A Hen cut aſunder in the middle (in this caſe they prefer a black one) and applied <note place="margin">The Phyſical uſes of a Hen and its parts.</note> hot to the head, in the phrenſie, headach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> uſually helps, and gives eaſe: They ſay alſo, that uſed in like manner, it heals the bitings of venomous beaſts. Laid upon Carbuncles it draws out the venom; nor muſt we omit, that it ſtanches the bleeding of green wounds. A live Hen [or Cock] pluckt about the Fundament, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Peſtilential ſwellings called <hi>Bubones,</hi> draws out the venom.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The Jelly of an old Hen,</hi> made of a Hen cut with Calves feet, and Sheeps feet, or Beef, boiled ſix or ſeven hours in a cloſe veſſel, to which you may add Spices, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial waters, is a great ſtrengthener and nouriſher.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Cock-Ale</hi> is made of Hensfleſh, boiled till the fleſh falls from the bones, then it is beaten with the bones, and ſtrained for Wine or Ale with Spices. Note. <hi>The fleſh of Hens is better than that of Cocks, except Capons. The fleſh of a black Hen, that hath not laid, is accounted better and lighter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Cock-broth</hi> is thus made: Tire and old Cock till he fall with wearineſs, then kill and pluck him, and gut him, and ſtuff him with proper Phyſic, and boil him till all the fleſh falls off, then ſtrain it. This broth mollifies, and by means of the nitrous parts wherewith that decrepite Animal is endued, and which are exalted by that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him, cuts and cleanſeth, and moves the belly, the rather if you boil therein purging Medicines. It is famous for eaſing the pains of the Colic (boiled with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and diſcutients) good againſt a Cough and Tartar of the Lungs (boiled with breaſt herbs.)</p>

                        <p>THis Bird is ſo well known every where, and ſo ſufficiently characterized by the length and glorious eye-like ſpots of his Tail alone, that it may perchance ſeem ſuperfluous to beſtow many words on deſcribing of it. I ſhall therefore only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Reader with <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> his deſcription.</p>
                        <p>In the Cock (ſaith he) the Head, Neck, and beginning of the Breaſt are of a deep blue. The Head in proportion to the body little, and (as <hi>Albertus</hi> notes) in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Serpentine, adorned with two oblong white ſpots, the one above the Eyes, the other, (which is the leſſer, but much the thicker) under them, which is alſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a black one; elſe, as I ſaid, blue. It hath a tuft on the top of its head, not entire, as in ſome other birds, but conſiſting of a kind of naked, but very tender, green ſtalks or ſhafts of feathers, bearing on their tops as it were Lily-flowers of the ſame colour. Of which moſt beautiful tuft or creſt thus <hi>Pliny, Pavonis apicem crinitae arbuſculae conſtituunt:</hi> And indeed they ſeem not to be feathers, but the tender ſhoots of Plants newly put forth. The Bill is whitiſh and <note n="*" place="margin">The ſlit of the mouth he means.</note> ſlit wide, being a little crooked at the tip, as it is in almoſt all granivorous birds, and in it wide Noſthrils: The Neck long, and for the bigneſs of the Fowl very ſlender. The Back of a pale aſh-colour, beſprinkled with many tranſverſe black ſpots. The Wings cloſed (for ſpred I cannot ſee them, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it painted by the life) above towards the Back are black, lower towards the Belly and withinſide red. The Tail is ſo diſpoſed, that it is as it were divided into two. For when he ſpreads it round, certain leſſer feathers making as it were an entire Tail by themſelves, and being of another, to wit, a dusky colour, do not ſtand up like thoſe long ones, but are ſeen extended as in other birds: So that without doubt the longer muſt needs be inſerted into another muſcle, by help whereof they are ſo erected and ſpread. Theſe long feathers, (as <hi>Bellonius</hi> writes) ſpring out of the upper part of the Back near the vent, that is, out of the Rump: And thoſe other leſſer ones are made by Nature to ſupport the longer. The Rump is of a deep green, which together with the Tail it erects; the feathers whereof are ſhort, and ſo diſpoſed, that they do as it were imitate the ſcales of an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Dragon, and cover and take away the ſight of part of the long feathers of the Tail. The longer feathers are all of a Cheſnut colour, beautified with moſt elegant gold lines tending upward, but ending in tips of a very deep green, and thoſe forked like <hi>Swallows</hi> Tails. The circular ſpots, or (as <hi>Pliny</hi> calls them) the eyes of the feathers, are particoloured of a deep green, ſhining like a Chryſolite, a Gold and Sapphire colour. For thoſe Eyes conſiſt of four circles of different colours, the firſt a golden, the ſecond a cheſnut, the third a green: The fourth or middle place is taken up by a blue or Sapphire coloured ſpot, almoſt of the figure and bigneſs of a Kidney-bean. The Hips, Legs and Feet are of an aſh-colour beſprinkled with black ſpots, and armed with ſpurs after the manner of <hi>Dunghil-Cocks.</hi> The Belly near the Stomach is of a bluiſh green, near the vent it is black, or at leaſt of a dusky colour.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Peahen</hi> there is little variety of colours. The whole Wings, Back, Belly, Thighs and Legs are of a dusky colour, inclining to cinereous. The Crown of the Head and Creſt are of the ſame colour; yet in the top of the Head are ſome ſmall ſpots, as it were points of green diſperſed. Thoſe white ſpots we noted in the Cock are in the Hen far greater. The circle encompaſſing the Pupil of the Eye in the Cock is yellow, in this of a lead-colour. The Chin is wholly white. The fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Neck are waved and green; near the Breaſt they have their extremities white.</p>
                        <p>Their Food is the ſame with that of the common Cock and Hen: But they do eſpecially delight in Barley. <hi>Albertus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Peacocks</hi> eat Serpents, whence it is no wonder that Serpents ſhould be terrified with their voice. That they were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally exotic birds, and of old time brought out of <hi>India</hi> into <hi>Europe</hi> is moſt probable, though now adays they are every where very frequent.</p>
                        <p>It is proper to this Bird only, the <hi>Turkey</hi> excepted, to erect his Tail, and ſpread it round, as if it delighted and took pride to have the gliſtering Eyes thereof beheld: But that he doth it upon being commended, and that ſo ſoon as he caſts down his Eyes and ſees the deformity of his Feet, out of ſhame he preſently lets fall and contracts his Tail, as if he were not altogether devoid of reaſon, is without doubt falſe and fabulous.</p>

Its fleſh is eſteemed harder, colder, drier, and of more difficult concoction than that of Hens. That being boiled or roaſt it will not putrefie, but keep a year or more uncorrupt, is commonly believed, and proved by an experiment made by St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who in his 21. Book of the <hi>City of God,</hi> Chap. 2. writes thus: <hi>Who but God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all things gave to Peacocks fleſh a faculty of not putrefying: Which thing at firſt hearing ſeeming to me incredible, it hapned that at</hi> Carthage <hi>there was ſet before us a roaſted Peacock; of the brawn of whoſe breaſt we cauſed to be kept ſo much as we thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient: Which being produced after ſo many days ſpace as any other roaſted fleſh would cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in, did not at all offend our Noſe. Being laid up again, after more than thirty days it was found the ſame as before, and likewiſe the ſame after a year, ſave that it was ſomewhat drier, and a little contracted or ſhrunk.</hi> To us it ſeems not ſo wonderful that the fleſh of a Peacock, which is of it ſelf ſufficiently hard and ſolid, being rendred harder and drier by roaſting ſhould continue a long time uncorrupted in a hot Country, ſuch as <hi>Africa</hi> is, eſpecially if care be taken, that in moiſt and rainy weather it take no wet, but be kept always dry; and I doubt not but the ſame would happen to <hi>Turkeys</hi> fleſh, or even to <hi>Pullets</hi> fleſh boiled or roaſted. Let them abſtain (ſaith <hi>Aldrov.)</hi> from eating <hi>Peacocks</hi> fleſh who live a ſedentary or idle life, uſing no exerciſe: For it is more agreeable, or at leaſt leſs hurtful to thoſe that exerciſe much, [I mean the fleſh of young <hi>Peacocks</hi> only, as being more tender] but to thoſe that are liver-grown, or troubled with the Spleen, or with the Piles very noxious. But in my opinion, and to my Palate the fleſh of young <hi>Peacocks</hi> is very tender, delicate, and well taſted, purely white, and deſervedly had by the <hi>Romans</hi> of old in high eſteem, and price, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferiour to that of <hi>Hens</hi> or <hi>Partridge.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writes, that <hi>Peacocks</hi> lay twelve Eggs, but with us they ſeldom lay more than five or ſix before they ſit.</p>
                        <p>They are peſtilent things in Gardens, doing a world of miſchief: They alſo throw down the Tiles, and pluck off the Thatch of houſes. The <hi>Peacock</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aldrovan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus)</hi> though he be a moſt beautiful bird to behold, yet that pleaſure of the Eyes is compenſated with many an ungrateful ſtroke upon the Ears, which are often afflicted with the odious noiſe of his horrid, or, as he calls it, <note n="*" place="margin">Tartareous voice.</note> helliſh cry. Whence by the common people in <hi>Italy</hi> it is ſaid to have the feathers of an Angel, but the voice of a Devil, and the guts of a Thief. It is ſaid (and I can eaſily believe it) to produce its life to an hundred years. The <hi>Peacock,</hi> ſaith <hi>Columella,</hi> is no leſs ſalacious than the Dunghil-Cock, and therefore requires five Hens: Yea, if there be no other Female for him to couple withal he will run upon and tread the ſitting Hen, and break her Eggs, whereof ſhe being conſcious, endeavours as much as ſhe can to hide her Neſt from him. This bird is ſaid to love cleanlineſs. It ſometimes varies in colour, being found white, eſpecially in Northern Countries.</p>

                        <p>THe <hi>Turkey</hi> being now ſo well known, and become ſo common every where in <hi>Europe,</hi> needs no very minute and operoſe deſcription, wherefore we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with that of <hi>Peter Gyllius,</hi> ſufficiently exact of it ſelf, and made up and perfected by <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> by the addition of whatſoever worthy the obſervation was by him omitted; which runs thus:</p>
                        <p>It is as tall as a <hi>Peacock.</hi> Its Neck together with its Head is altogether bare of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and only covered with a purpliſh-coloured skin; ſo very thick, that when it cries, or prides it ſelf, it ſo ſtretches, and as it were blows up the skin, that before hung looſe and flaggy, that it approaches to the bigneſs of a mans arm. The Crown of the Head is particoloured of white, blue, and purple. It hath no Creſt or Comb like a Cock, but a certain red, <note n="*" place="margin">Worm-like Caruncle.</note> fleſhy <hi>Appendix,</hi> ariſing above the upper Chap of the Bill, which is ſometimes extended to that length, that it not only reaches all along the declivity of the upper Chap, but hangs down below the tip of the Bill at leaſt an inch, ſo that the Bill is covered with it, that it cannot be ſeen but ſideways. This <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi> when it walks or feeds it contracts to that ſhortneſs, that whereas before it hung down an inch lower than the Bill, now being ſhrunk up it falls ſhort of the length of the Bill it ſelf. The feathers of this bird do ſomewhat reſemble a Hawks, and have their ends white. It hath very long Legs. Its Toes and Claws have the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction and figure with the <hi>Dunghil-Cock.</hi> The body of that I ſaw was round, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63869:87"/>
taller than a <hi>Peacocks.</hi> Round about the Eyes it was of a florid blue and purple co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The Eyes themſelves were indued with a very quick and ſharp ſight, like thoſe of <hi>Hawks.</hi> The Cock when any one came near the Hen, briſtled up his feathers, and by his ſuperb gate, ſtrutting up towards him, endeavoured to drive him away. The Hen was white, and reſembled a <hi>Peacock</hi> when he hath caſt the feathers of his Tail. Thus far <hi>Gyllius:</hi> In which deſcription, ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> are two notes of no ſmall moment wanting: <hi>viz.</hi> That its Legs <note n="*" place="margin">In our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation they want not ſpurs, though they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but ſhort and blunt ones.</note> want Spurs, and that the Cock is differenced from the Hen, when they are come to their full growth and maturity, by a briſtly buſh or beard before his Throat, or in the upper part of his Breaſt: Add hereto, that the worm-like Caruncle on the Head is in the Hen very ſmall. What he ſaith of their feathers being like <hi>Hawks,</hi> is to be underſtood by reaſon of their many ſpots, wherein the likeneſs conſiſts.</p>
                        <p>To this we may further add, that the Tail of a <hi>Turkey</hi> is made up of eighteen fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that each Wing hath twenty eight prime feathers or quils: That the Legs have ſmall Spurs, or rather certain rudiments of Spurs, and thoſe very conſpicuous and plain to be ſeen, however <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> writes that they do altogether want Spurs. Their Eggs are white, but thick-ſpeckled with ſordid yellowiſh red ſpots, much like to the freckles of the face of a man.</p>
                        <p>This ſtately Fowl at firſt ſight from the ſhape of its body, and alſo from its condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, one would take to be rather of the <hi>Hen</hi> than the <hi>Peacock</hi> kind, ſaith <hi>Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus:</hi> To me it ſeems to be more like the <hi>Peacock</hi> than the common <hi>Cock,</hi> in its bigneſs and ſtature or tallneſs, in the manner of carrying its Tail, but eſpecially of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it up and ſpreading it, as if both it ſelf admired it, and took pride in ſhewing it to others.</p>
                        <p>That theſe birds were the <hi>Meleagrides</hi> of the Ancients, as alſo their <hi>Gallinae Africanae &amp; Numidicae guttatae, Aldrovandus</hi> takes much pains to prove. In <hi>Engliſh</hi> they are called <hi>Turkeys,</hi> becauſe they are thought to have been firſt brought to us out of <hi>Turkey.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Turkeys</hi> love hot Countries: yet they can bear cold ones well enough, after they are grown up and have been uſed to them: But their young Chickens are very neſh and tender, and not to be reared without great care and attendance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="margQuotes">Their fleſh is very white and delicate, a diſh becoming a Princes feaſt, ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> if it be well concocted yielding a plentiful and firm nouriſhment; of the ſame taſte and quality with that of a <hi>Peacock,</hi> and as difficult to concoct, unleſs its hardneſs be before by ſome means corrected.</hi> This is to be underſtood of old and well grown <hi>Turkeys,</hi> for <hi>Turkey-</hi>pouts and young <hi>Turkeys</hi> are tender enough, and of eaſie concoction.</p>
                        <p>The antipathy this Fowl hath againſt a red colour, ſo as to be much moved and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked at the ſight thereof, is very ſtrange and admirable.</p>

                           <hi>circularly, think that it ought rather to be ranked with the Peacock and Turkey, to which we have therefore ſubjoyned it.</hi> It is bigger than the common <hi>Cock</hi> or <hi>Hen.</hi> The length of its body from the Neck to the riſe of the Tail is ten inches: The length of the Neck ſix inches. It is all over covered with black feathers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on the Belly and under the Tail, whereit is of a brown colour, almoſt like that of a <hi>Partridge.</hi> The feathers on the Head, Neck, and Breaſt are finer than the reſt, and for ſoftneſs and beauty comparable to black Velvet. On the top of the Head it hath black feathers complicated into a very low and flat cop, which one that careleſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Bird would ſcarce take notice of, but when it is angry, or on other occaſions it can erect them into a conſpicuous creſt. It hath a remarkable Bill, not thick, croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, about an inch and half long: The lower Chap is ſmall, the upper almoſt four times bigger.

                              <hi>Indian</hi> Hen, from a Picture, as I ſuppoſe, in this wiſe. From the Bill to the end of the Tail (which was white, and ſtriped with black lines) it was black, which blackneſs yet did every where incline to blue. The vent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Tail underneath were white. Its Bill was ſtrong, crooked, and red. Its Legs were almoſt of the ſame colour, but much paler, and in their hind part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to blue. The Claws were black. It carried on its forehead a great protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, of the ſhape of a Fig, and of a bluiſh colour. The Tail was long, not erect, as in our common <hi>Cocks</hi> and <hi>Hens,</hi> but extended in length, as in a <hi>Pie.</hi>

Its Bill was of two colours, partly yellow, to wit, toward the Head, partly black. The upper Chap of its Bill hooked. Where in other Cocks the holes of the Noſthrils are, there this Bird had a certain yellow protuberance, of the bigneſs of a Cherry.

The Cheeks beneath the Eyes are blue, and bare of feathers, under which is a red Gill. They ſay, that theſe Birds are gregarious, and feed their Chickens in common. So far Mr. <hi>Willughby.</hi> But becauſe this deſcription is very ſhort and ſuccinct, (though ſufficient for the knowledge of the bird) I ſhall preſent the Reader with a full and exact one out of <hi>Geſner.</hi> The <note n="*" place="margin">So Dr. <hi>Key</hi> called it, who ſent him this deſcription.</note> 
                           <hi>Mauritanian</hi> Cock is a very beautiful bird, in bigneſs and ſhape of body, Bill, and Foot like a <hi>Pheaſant.</hi> [Thoſe that we have ſeen, as alſo thoſe deſcribed by <hi>Bellonius</hi> and <hi>Marggrave</hi> were as big as ordinary Hens,] armed with a horny Crown, riſing up into a point, on the backſide <note n="*" place="margin">Very ſteep behind, and much inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before.</note> perpendicularly, on the foreſide with a gentle aſcent or declivity. Nature ſeems to have intended to faſten and bind it down to the lower part by three as it were <note n="*" place="margin">Laciniae.</note> Labels or ſlips proceeding from it; between the Eye and the Ear on both ſides one; and in the middle of the forehead one, all of the ſame colour with the Crown; ſo that it ſits on the head after the ſame manner as the <hi>Ducal</hi> Cap doth upon the head of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> if that ſide which now ſtands foremoſt were turned back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. This Crown below is wrinkled round about: Where it riſes upright in the top of the Neck, at the hinder part of the head grow certain erect hairs (not feathers) turned the contrary way. The Eyes are wholly black, as alſo the Eye-lids round about, and the Eye-brows, excepting a ſpot in the upper and hinder part of each Eye-brow. The bottom of the Head on both ſides all along is taken up by a kind of callous fleſh of a ſanguine colour, which that it might not hang down like Gills or Wattles, Nature hath taken care to turn backward and fold up, ſo that it ends in two acute proceſſes. From this fleſh ariſe up on both ſides certain Caruncles, wherewith the Noſthrils are inveſted round, and the Head in the forepart ſeparated from the Bill, which is pale-coloured; of theſe alſo at the Bill the lower edges are lightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected back under both Noſthrils. What is between the Crown and this fleſh on the right and left ſide is marked with a double ſcaly inciſure, but behind with none.</p>
                        <p>Its colour under the Jaws or Throat is exactly purple, in the Neck a dark purple: In the reſt of the body ſuch as would ariſe from black and white fine powder, ſprinkled or ſifted thin upon a dusky colour, but not mingled therewith: In this colour are diſperſed and thick-ſet all over the body oval or round white ſpots, above leſſer, below greater, comprehended in the intervals of lines obliquely interſecting one another, as is ſeen in the natural poſition of the feathers; in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the body only, not in the lower. [I ſuppoſe he means, if we ſhould fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy lines to be drawn in the manner of Network all over the back, the ſpots would ſtand in the middle of the Meiſhes of that Network.] This you may find to be ſo, not only from viewing the whole body, but even ſingle feathers plucked off. For the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63869:88"/>
upper feathers, in oblique lines interſecting one another, or if you pleaſe, certain circumferences, made (as I ſaid) of black and white powder, and having their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities joyned together as in Honey-combs or Nets, do comprehend oval or round ſpots in dusky ſpaces; but ſo do not the lower. <note n="*" place="margin">Or the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both obſerves a like rule.</note> Yet both are placed in a like manner. For in ſome feathers they are ſo joyned together in order, that they do almoſt make acute triangles, in others ſo as to repreſent an oval figure. Of this kind there are three or four rows in each ſingle feather, ſo that the leſſer are contained within the greater. In the end of the Wings and in the Tail the ſpots ſtand in equidiſtant right lines, long ways of the feather. Between the Cock and Hen you can ſcarce diſcern, the ſimilitude is ſo great; ſave that the Head of the Hen is all black. Its voice is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided or interrupted whiſtle, not louder, nor greater than that of a <hi>Quail,</hi> but liker to that of a <hi>Partridge,</hi> except that it is <note n="*" place="margin">Sublimior.</note> higher, and not ſo clear.

The upper Legs are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with feathers of the ſame colour with the Belly; the lower, together with the Feet, are blue: The Claws grey. It is a very fleſhy bird, and hath ſo much fleſh as ſcarce two ordinary Hens have, and that alſo well taſted. Under the outer skin, which is thick and fat, it hath another membrane wherewith the fleſh is covered. It lives upon divers fruits that fall from wild trees. I found in its ſtomach wild Beans, the Seeds of <hi>Araticu,</hi> &amp;c. It runs upon the ground; for its Feet are unfit to climb trees. It lays Eggs a little bigger than Hens Eggs, of a bluiſh green colour. This might have been put in the next Chapter among the wild birds.</p>

                        <p>THis Bird is ſuppoſed to be ſo called from <hi>Phaſis</hi> a River in <hi>Colchis,</hi> from whence it was firſt brought ito <hi>Europe. Aldrovandus,</hi> not improbably, takes this word to be rather derived from the <hi>Hebrew</hi>

                           </gap>, of the ſame ſound, and (as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes) ſignification. They differ much in weight, according as they are fatter or leaner. One Cock we made trial in weighed fifty ounces, another but forty five; a Hen thirty three. Its length from the point of the Bill to the end of the Tail was thirty ſix inches, to the end of the Claws twenty four. The diſtance between the tips of the Wings extended thirty three inches. The Bill like to that of other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivorous birds, from the tip to the angles of the mouth an inch three quarters long,

in old birds whitiſh: It hath on both ſides a fleſhy and tuberous membrane, by which it is above joyned to the Head, under which the Noſthrils are as it were hid. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes are yellow. A red or Scarlet colour [according to <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> powdered with black ſpecks] compaſſes the Eye round for a good breadth. In the forepart of the Head, at the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the upper Chap of the Bill, the feathers are black with a kind of purple gloſs. The Crown of the Head and upper part of the Neck are tinctured with a dark green, ſhining like ſilk, which colour yet is more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute on the Crown of the Head. <hi>[Aldrovandus</hi> writes, that the Crown commonly is of a very elegant, ſhining aſh-colour, at the ſides and near the Bill being green, and either in Sun or ſhade very changeable: Which moſt beautiful colour doth alſo take up the <note n="*" place="margin">All the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the Neck.</note> whole Neck above. Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> makes the Crown of the Head to be of a ſhining blue, with a certain mixture of red, and as well the Head as the upper part of the Neck to appear ſometimes blue, ſometimes green.] It hath moreover on both ſides the Head about the Ears feathers ſticking out, which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls horns. There grow alſo to the Ears in their lower angle black feathers longer than the reſt. The ſides of the Neck and the Throat are of a ſhining purple colour, Note, that as well the green as the purple colour inheres only in the exteriour part or borders of the feathers, the reſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> the middle and lower part, of the feather being on the top of the Head dusky, on the Neck black. The feathers under the Chin, and at the angles of the Mouth are black, with green edges or borders.</p>
                        <p>Below the green the reſt of the Neck, the Breaſt, Shoulders, middle of the Back, and ſides under the Wings are clothed with moſt beautiful feathers, having their bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms black, their edges tincted with a moſt beautiful colour, which, as it is diverſly objected to the light, appears either black or purple: Next to the purple in each fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a croſs line or bed of a moſt ſplendid gold colour: Below the gold a fulvous, which reaches as low as the black bottom we mentioned. Howbeit the gold colour is not immediately contiguous to the fulvous, but divided by an intermediate narrow line of a ſhining purpliſh. On the underſide of the Neck the extremities [tops] of the feathers are painted with a black ſpot of the figure of a <hi>Parabola.</hi> The ſhafts of all are fulvous. The feathers themſelves about the ſhaft in the lower part of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſide of the Neck are marked with an Oval white ſpot in the black bottom we ſpoke of. The feathers on the ſhoulders and middle of the Back are variegated with theſe colours: Firſt, their edges are fulvous, next ſucceeds a narrow purpliſh line, then a pretty broad black line running parallel to the edges of the feathers, wherein is included another broad white line: This <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> calls an Oval line. The ſpace comprehended within this line, and the reſt of the feather, to the very bottom, are black. Yet in the middle of the Back the ſpace comprehended is various, of dusky and black. The ſhafts of the feathers are fulvous or yellow. The lower feathers of the Back are almoſt wholly ferrugineous, inclining to a Fox colour, want that white ſpot, are longer than others, and end as it were in ſmall filaments. Yet they have this common with the fore-mentioned, that in the light, about their middles they ſeem to <note n="*" place="margin">Caſt forth ſome ſhew.</note> have an appearance of that green colour, which elſe is not ſeen in them; that their ſhafts approach to a gold colour, and that their bottoms or lower parts are all dusky. The Tail (if you meaſure the middle feathers, which are much longer than the reſt) is full twenty ſix inches long, almoſt of the figure of an Organ; for as in that the Pipes on each ſide are gradually longer and longer, or bigger and bigger, the biggeſt being the middlemoſt, ſo is it in this Tail: Thoſe two middlemoſt feathers (which, as we ſaid, are the longeſt of all) have on each ſide them eight, all of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent magnitude, the exteriour ſhorter and leſſer than the interiour in order to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. They are of an aſh-colour, on the ſides ferrugineous, near the ſhafts adorned with black ſpots, in the longeſt feathers in both Webs, oppoſite one to another, in the leſſer in one Web only, or if there be any mark in the interiour Web it is more obſcure, and ſcarce obſervable. The Wings cloſed are nine inches long, ſpread <note n="*" place="margin">Here is ſome miſtake for the breadth is double of eighteen inches.</note> eighteen inches broad. The Wing-feathers that are next the body are variegated with the ſame colours as thoſe on the middle of the Back: The ſubſequent are liker thoſe on the lower part of the Back: Yet the ridges of the Wings reſemble thoſe of the common <hi>Partridge,</hi> whoſe colour the prime feathers or quils of the Wings do almoſt exactly repreſent, <hi>viz.</hi> being of a dusky aſh-colour, and all over ſpotted with whitiſh ſpots. The Breaſt and Belly whereabout the Gizzard lies, and that part thereof which the Wings cover gliſter with the ſame colours wherewith the Neck is beautified, but more obſcure, and the feathers here are much bigger. Near the vent and on the Thighs it is of a dark ferrugineous. The Legs, Feet, Toes, and Claws
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63869:89"/>
are of a horn colour; yet the Toes and Claws are darker than the Legs. A thick membrane, and perchance not unfit for ſwimming, connects the Toes: The like whereto (that I know of) is not found in any other pulveratricious bird. The Legs are armed with Spurs, ſhorter than in a <hi>Cock,</hi> but ſharp, and of a black colour. The Hen is nothing ſo beautiful as the Cock, almoſt of the colour of a <hi>Quail.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It lives in the Woods; and feeds upon Acorns, Berries, Grain, and Seeds of Plants. It frequents rather Coppice Woods, than where there are only Timber-trees.</p>
                        <p>The Books of all Writers of Animals, Ancient and Modern, celebrate the <hi>Pheaſant,</hi> for the goodneſs of its fleſh, aſſigning to it the firſt place among birds at Table. Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians make it the ſtandard wherewith they compare, and accordingly judge of the temperament and goodneſs of other meats, ſaith <hi>Longolins,</hi> as he is cited by <hi>Aldrov. Aldrovandus</hi> by many arguments proves, that <hi>Pheaſants</hi> are better meat than Pullen; which who deſires to know, may conſult him in the Thirteenth Book, and Fifth Chapter of his <hi>Ornithology:</hi> At laſt he thus concludes, <hi>Pheaſants</hi> therefore, as well becauſe they are rare, as becauſe they are of a moſt delicate taſte, and yield ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a nouriſhment, as we have proved, ſeem to be born only for great mens Tables, and have been always had in higheſt eſteem of all Birds.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pheaſants, Partridges, Quails,</hi> and ſome other Birds, are taken in great numbers with a Net they call commonly <note n="*" place="margin">I know no particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh name for this Net.</note> 
                           <hi>Expegatorium,</hi> by the help of a Setting-dog, trained up for this ſport, who finds out the birds, and when he ſees them, either ſtands ſtill, or lies down on his belly, not going very near them, leaſt he ſhould ſpring them; but looking back on the Fowler his Maſter, wags his Tail, by which the Fowler knows that the Birds are near the Dog; and ſo he and his Companion run with the Net, and cover both Birds and Dog.</p>
                        <p>That all Birds, but particularly <hi>Pheaſants, Partridge,</hi> and <hi>Quails,</hi> are far more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury and delicate, when killed by a <hi>Hawk</hi> than if they be caught in ſnares, or by any other fraud, many have written, and moſt think. And indeed, there is no doubt but by this means their fleſh becomes more ſhort and tender: For that violent motion of the bloud occaſioned by their flight, and its fervent heat conſequent thereupon, macerates the fleſh, and diſpoſes it to corruption, but that it thence becomes more ſavoury and delicate, all men now-adays are not agreed. But the old rule for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids me to diſpute about taſtes. <hi>Boterus</hi> reports, that <hi>Ireland</hi> wants <hi>Pheaſants</hi> and <hi>Partridges.</hi>

                        <p>IT is a ſort of <hi>Pheaſant,</hi> ſomething leſs than a <hi>Pullet.</hi> Its Head is not great, like a Hens, as is alſo the Bill. The Eyes are black; the Neck about ſeven inches long: The length of the body from the bottom of the Neck to the riſe of the Tail about nine inches: Of the Tail (which is broad) a whole foot. The Legs are long [which he divides into upper and lower,] the upper five inches long, the lower three, or a little more. In each Foot four Toes like thoſe of Hens, of which the middle of the three foremoſt is two inches long. The whole bird is clothed with black feathers, with which ſomething of brown is mixed. The feathers of its Head it can erect in form of a Creſt, and thoſe black feathers [I ſuppoſe he means thoſe on the Head which make the Tuft or Creſt] are encompaſſed with other white ones. The Throat under the Head, and for an inch and half down the Neck is bare of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and covered with a red skin. The whole Neck below is variegated with white feathers diſperſed among the black ones; as alſo all the lower Belly, and the hindmoſt half of the Wings. The upper Legs and the Tail are wholly black, without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of any brown. The lower Legs and Feet are of an elegant red colour. They are made tame; and their fleſh is good. This bird took its name from its voice, for it cries, <hi>Jacu, Jacu, Jacu.</hi> This might as well have been ranked among the Domeſtic birds.</p>

                        <head>§. III. <hi>The common Partridge.</hi> Perdix cinerea.</head>
                        <p>THe Cock weighed fourteen ounces and a quarter; the Hen thirteen and an half. The length [of the Cock] from the Bill to the Claws was fourteen inches and a quarter, to the end of the Tail twelve and three quarters. The Bill from the tip to the corners of the aperture of ſlit of the mouth three quarters of an Inch, to the Eyes an inch. The breadth was twenty inches.</p>
                        <p>The Bill in young <hi>Partridges</hi> is of a dusky colour, but in old ones it grows white. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes are a little yellowiſh. Under the Eyes are certain red ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcencies. The Chin and ſides of the Head are of a deep yellow or Saffron-colour. The Cock hath on his Breaſt a red mark of a ſemicircular figure, reſembling a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhooe. The Hen hath not ſo much red on her Breaſt. Below the Chin, as far as the Horſe-ſhooe mark, it is of a blue cinereous, adorned with tranſverſe black lines: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the mark the colour fades into dirty or yellowiſh cinereous. The longer fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on the ſides of the Breaſt and Belly have each of them a great tranſverſe red ſpot, their ſhafts being white. The upper ſide of the body is particoloured of red, cinereous and black. This Naturaliſts call a teſtaceous or potſheard colour.</p>
                        <p>The Prime feathers in each Wing are about twenty three in number, of which the foremoſt are dusky, with tranſverſe yellowiſh white ſpots. The longeſt feather is five inches and a quarter. The interiour covert-feathers of the Wings, and the long feathers ſpringing from the ſhoulders have their ſhafts of a yellowiſh white.</p>
                        <p>The Tail is compoſed of no leſs than eighteen feathers, and is in length three inches and an half: The four middle feathers are of the ſame colour with the reſt of the body; the other ſeven on each ſide of a ſordid yellow, with cinereous tips.</p>
                        <p>The Legs below the Knees are bare; they have no footſtep or appearance of any Spur. Both Legs and Feet are in young ones of a greeniſh colour, but in old ones they grow white. The Toes are joyned together with a membrane as in <hi>Heathcocks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It hath a great Craw, a muſculous Stomach or Gizzard, and a gall-bladder. For the taſte and wholſomneſs of its fleſh it is deſervedly preferred before all other birds. It feeds upon Ants and Ants Eggs, upon the grains of Corn, and alſo upon the green leaves. But in Winter-time, when it feeds upon green Corn, its fleſh is leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, than in Summer and Autumn when it feeds upon the Kernel or grain.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Common Partridge</hi> is a multiparous bird, laying ſixteen or eighteen Eggs ere it ſits. With us in <hi>England</hi> it is moſt frequent. The <hi>Italians</hi> call it <hi>Starna,</hi> as much to ſay as <hi>externa,</hi> or outlandiſh; and in ſome places alſo <hi>Pernice.</hi> It is more rare with them. and ſells dearer than the <hi>red-leg'd Partridge.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Partridge</hi> (underſtand it of all the ſeveral ſorts) by reaſon of the heavineſs of its body, and ſhortneſs of its Wings, can neither fly high, nor long continue its flight, howbeit for thoſe ſhort flights it makes it flies very ſwift and ſtrongly.</p>
                        <p>In Winter-time they fly in company: For they are of that nature, that they breed and bring up fifteen or ſixteen young together, which company all Winter with the old ones. But in the Spring time, when they pair together, they fly by two and two; for then the old ones beat away the Young from them. This out of <hi>Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius:</hi> Which is true, not only of birds of this kind, but alſo of <hi>Pheaſants, Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellonius</hi> ſaith, that the ſinging of <hi>Partridges</hi> is a certain ſign of day approaching. We have often heard them crying and calling one another after Sun-ſet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Partridges</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> when any one comes near their Neſt, caſt themſelves down before his feet that looks for it, running and flying as if they were lame, by that means drawing him away from their Neſts, and enticing him to follow them; which when they have done, themſelves fly away, and afterwards call together their Brood, which ſo ſoon as they hear the voice of their Dams preſently run to them.</p>

                        <p>THe Cock weighed more than thirteen ounces: His length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Claws was eighteen inches: His breadth between the tips of the Wings extended twenty two. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes were red: The Bill almoſt an inch long, and red: The Legs and Feet alſo red: The Claws dusky: The Toes as far as to the firſt joynt connected by a membrane intervening. It had ſmall Spurs [others had none, perhaps theſe were young ones.] The ſoles of the Feet were of a dirty yellow.</p>
                        <p>The Head, Neck, Back, and Rump were aſh-coloured, as alſo the outer part of the Thighs. The lower part of the Neck tinctured with a vinaceous colour. The Cheeks under the Eyes, and the Chin to the middle of the Throat white: Yet in the very angle of the nether Chap was a ſmall black ſpot. A black border beginning from the Noſthrils, and produced above the Eyes encompaſſes this white ſpace. The Craw below the black line is cinereous: The Breaſt of a dilute red, inclining to yellow. The feathers on the ſides are painted with very beautiful colours. For the tips of ſome of them are black; and next the black they have a tranſverſe line, the ſhorter and nearer to the Head of a whitiſh colour, the longer and more remote of a yellow: Below this a black line again. Of others the tips are red, the colours we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in order ſucceeding. The bottoms of all are cinereous.</p>
                        <p>The beam-feathers in each Wing are in number twenty five, the exteriour whereof are dusky, the interiour of a dark cinereous: But yet the outer edges of the third, and ſucceeding to the fifteenth, are of a white, tinctured with red. The Tail is four inches long, the two middle feathers being cinereous, the exteriour five on each ſide having their upper half red, their lower cinereous.</p>
                        <p>It hath a large Craw, a muſculous Stomach, or Gizzard, in which diſſected we found Caterpillars and Snails.</p>
                        <p>The Back of the Hen is not all out ſo cinereous, but rather inclines to red, the middle parts of the feathers being black. The line running above the Eyes is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what red. The Cheeks are of the ſame colour with the Back: Elſe it doth not much differ from the Cock. This kind is a ſtranger to <hi>England:</hi> Howbeit they ſay it is found in the Iſles of <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Guernſey,</hi> which are ſubject to our King. It is of a more gentle nature than our common <hi>Partridge,</hi> and eaſily made and kept tame: Whereas the common <hi>Partridge</hi> can hardly be induced to put off his wild nature, and to go out and return home again like tame fowl: Yet I have been told by perſons of good credit, that a certain <hi>Suſſex</hi> man had by his induſtry and application made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of <hi>Partridges</hi> ſo tame, that he drave them before him upon a wager out of that Country to <hi>London,</hi> though they were abſolutely free, and had their Wings grown, ſo that they might if they would have made uſe of them to fly away.</p>

                           <hi>Partridges,</hi> to ſpeak of them in general, are very ſalacious birds, infamous for maſculine Venery, and other abominable and unnatural conjunctions. The Ancients have left many fabulous things concerning them, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Cocks, if they can find them, break the Eggs, leſt the Hens being detained by ſitting upon them ſhould not be ready or willing to yield themſelves to be trodden; for which cauſe the Hens lay privately, concealing their Neſts, as much as they can, from the Cocks. That the Cocks when they want the Hens, to wit, when they have withdrawn themſelves to ſit, do not only manifeſt their petulancy and ſalacity, by their voices and fighting, but alſo defile one another promiſcuouſly by that nefarious coition, interdicted mankind by no leſs than a capital puniſhment. Which things <hi>Pliny</hi> after his manner hath wittily and elegantly compriſed in a few words. <hi>Illae</hi> [i. e. <hi>foeminae] quidem &amp; maritos ſuos fallunt, quoniam intemperantiâ libidinis ſrangunt earum ova, nè incubando detineantur.

Victum aiunt venerem pati.</hi> That they make two Neſts, wherein they lay their Eggs, half in one, and half in the other; in one whereof the Female ſits, and in the other the Male: and that both do hatch and bring up their part of Young. That the Hens without being ever trodden by the Cocks, if they do only ſtand oppoſite to them, and the wind blow from thence upon them, will conceive Eggs, and thoſe prolific: Of which thing ſome Modern Writers have indiſcreetly indeavoured to give an account, before they had any aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the truth of the matter of fact. That the Hens are ſo intemperately luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that contrary to the manner of other birds, they cannot abſtain from the uſe of Venery ſo much as while they are ſitting: Which particulars alſo <hi>Pliny</hi> briefly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly thus words: <hi>Neque in ullo animali par opus libidinis.

That the <hi>Partridge</hi> when her own Eggs are broken, or any ways marred, or loſt, ſteals another <hi>Partridges</hi> Eggs, ſits upon them, hatches them, broods and brings up the Young, which yet when they are a little grown, hearing their Dams voice, [that is, the voice of that <hi>Partridge</hi> that laid the Eggs,] do by inſtinct pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently know it, and leaving their Foſter Mothers, betake themſelves to their own Dams. That ſhe often turns her upon her back, and ſo, lying with her belly upward, covers her ſelf with clods and ſtraws, and by that means deceives and eſcapes the Fowlers. But it is not worth the while to inſiſt long upon rehearſing or refuting theſe particulars.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Birds (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus)</hi> in the Feaſts and Entertainments of Princes hold the principal place, without which ſuch Feaſts are eſteemed ignoble, vulgar, and of no account. Indeed, the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> do ſo highly value, and are ſo fond of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi> that if they be wanting they utterly ſleight and deſpiſe the beſt ſpread Tables, and moſt plentiful and delicate Treatments; as if there could be no Feaſt without this diſh. As the fleſh of <hi>Partridge</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellonius)</hi> is very delicate and grateful to the Palate, ſo in like manner is it greatly commended, for that it nouriſhes much, is eaſily digeſted, and breeds good bloud in the body. The fleſh of the greater kind is more ſolid and hard, (though hard only comparatively) of the leſſer more tender, and conſequently yields a finer, more diſſipable and ſpirituous nouriſhment, is alſo of eaſier concoction, but yet is not ſo white as that of the greater. Palate-men, and ſuch as have skill in eating, do chiefly commend the <hi>Partridges</hi> Wing, preferring it much before the Leg, as indeed it is much better. Hence that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverbial Rhythm:</p>

                        <p>THe great <hi>Partridge</hi> which the <hi>Grecians,</hi> following the <hi>Italians,</hi> commonly call <hi>Coturno,</hi> ſeems to us to be different from the <hi>Partridges</hi> both of <hi>France</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">Gothia.</note> 
                           <hi>Gothland:</hi> For it is twice as big as our Country <hi>Partridge,</hi> hath red Bill and Legs, is ſpotted on the Breaſt and ſides in like manner as ours, of the bigneſs of a <note n="*" place="margin">Or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſized.</note> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Hen. This kind of <hi>Partridge</hi> is ſo frequent in the Rocks of <hi>Colme,</hi> the <hi>Cyclades</hi> Iſlands, and the Sea-coaſt of <hi>Candy,</hi> that there is not ſuch plenty of any other bird. Their cry is different from that of our <hi>Partridge,</hi> being great and ſonorous, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in breeding and coupling time, when they expreſs and often repeat the ſound of this word <hi>[Cacabis]</hi> whence it ſhould ſeem that the <hi>Latines</hi> were taught by the <hi>Greeks</hi> to expreſs the note of a <hi>Partridge</hi> by the word <hi>Cacabare.</hi> We alſo borrowed the name <hi>Cacabis,</hi> whereby we in ſome places call a <hi>Partridge</hi> from their voice or cry. They follow one another on the Rocks. Of this kind, in my judgment, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is to be underſtood when he ſaith, <hi>If Hens couple with Partridges they generate a different kind.</hi> They build in an open place without cover or ſhelter in <hi>May-</hi>time, among cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain herbs, what time they come down from the Rocks, ſeeking convenient places to build and bring up their Young. They lay their Eggs upon the ground, under ſome great ſtone, ſometimes eighteen, ſometimes ſixteen, more or leſs, like Hens Eggs, but leſs, white, and ſpeckled thick with ſmall red ſpots, very good to eat as Hens Eggs, but their Yolks congeal not. After they have hatcht their Young, they lead them out into the Champain or open fields to ſeek their food. Wherefore we think this kind of <hi>Partridge</hi> to be altogether different from ours: for in ſome places of <hi>Italy</hi> both kinds are found, and called by divers names, <hi>viz.</hi> This by the name of <hi>Coturno</hi> the other by the name of <hi>Perdice</hi> or <hi>Pernice.</hi> Thus far <hi>Bellonius.</hi>

                        <p>IT is the leaſt bird in this kind; of a flatter or broader body, and not ſo narrow or compreſſed ſideways as the <hi>Land-Rail</hi> or <hi>Daker-Hen.</hi> Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail is ſeven inches and an half: Its breadth between the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the Wings ſpread fourteen inches.</p>
                        <p>Its Bill from the tip to the corners of the mouth half an inch long: its figure more depreſſed and plain than in the reſt of this kind: The lower Chap black, the upper of a pale dusky. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes are of a hazel colour: The Eyes have a nictating membrane.</p>
                        <p>The Breaſt and Belly are of a dirty pale yellow: The Throat hath a little mixture of red <hi>[ruffi.]</hi> Under the lower Chap of the Bill is a long and broad ſtroke of black tending downward. Above the Eyes, and along the middle of the Head are whitiſh lines. The head is black, only the edges of the feathers reddiſh or cinereous. The middle part of each covert-feather of the Back and lower part of the Neck is marked with a yellowiſh white ſtroke, the reſt of the feather being particoloured of black and reddiſh aſh-colour. Under the Wings is a bed of white terminated on each ſide with a border of red mingled with black.</p>
                        <p>The beam or quill-feathers of the Wings are dusky, croſſed with pale red lines: The leſſer rows of hard feathers in the Wings are almoſt wholly of one and the ſame reddiſh colour. The Tail is ſhort, not above an inch and half long, conſiſting of twelve feathers, of a blackiſh colour interrupted with pale-red tranſverſe lines.</p>
                        <p>The Feet are pale-coloured, covered with a skin divided rather into ſcales than entire rings: The ſoals of the Feet yellow. The outer Toes, as far as the firſt joynt, are connected with the middlemoſt by an intervening membrane.</p>
                        <p>It hath a Gall-bladder. The Cock had great Teſticles for the bigneſs of its body, whence we may infer that it is a ſalacious bird. It hath a muſculous Stomach or
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:63869:92"/>
Gizzard; and juſt above the Stomach the Gullet is dilated into the bag, which we call the Ante-ſtomach, the interior <hi>Superficies</hi> whereof is granulated with papillary Glandules.</p>
                        <p>For catching of <hi>Quails</hi> they uſe this Art: The Fowler betimes in the Morning ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpread his Net hides himſelf under it among the Corn: then calls with his Quail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, The Cock <hi>Quail,</hi> thinking it to be the note of the Hen that he hears, comes in a trice with all ſpeed to the place whence the noiſe comes. When the Bird is got un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Net, up riſes the Fowler and ſhews himſelf to him, he preſently attempting to fly away, is entangled in the Net and taken.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Quail</hi> is a bird no leſs ſalacious than the <hi>Partridge,</hi> infamous alſo for obſcene and unnatural luſt. The Cocks are of high ſpirit and courage; and therefore by ſome are wont to be trained up and prepared for the combate, after the manner of <hi>Cocks:</hi> And <hi>Aelian</hi> tells us, that of old time at <hi>Athens</hi> Quail-fightings were wont to be exhibited as ſhews; and ſo grateful and delightful they were to the people, that there was as great flocking to them as to a ſpectacle of Gladiators. In ſome Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Naples,</hi> they do alſo now adays keep fighting <hi>Quails,</hi> as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> reports. The manner how they induce and provoke them to fight ſee in him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quails</hi> are birds of paſſage: for being impatient of cold, when Winter comes they depart out of Northern and cold Countries into hotter and more Southerly; flying even over Seas; which one would admire, conſidering the weight of their bodies and ſhortneſs of their Wings. When we ſailed from <hi>Rhodes</hi> to <hi>Alexandria</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellonius)</hi> many <hi>Quails</hi> flying from the North toward the South were taken in our Ship, whence I am verily perſwaded that they ſhift places: For formerly alſo when I ſailed out of the Iſle of <hi>Zant</hi> to <hi>Morea</hi> or <hi>Negropont,</hi> in the Spring time I had obſerved <hi>Quails</hi> flying the contrary way from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North,</hi> that they might abide there all Summer: At which time alſo there were a great many taken in our Ship.</p>
                        <p>Among the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines Quails</hi> were condemned and baniſhed Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles as an unwholſom diſh; for being reported to feed upon <hi>Hellebore,</hi> and to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the falling ſickneſs, they were thought to produce the like diſeaſe in thoſe that eat their fleſh: But undeſervedly, for now adays they are eaten without any danger, and eſteemed a choice diſh: And being ſomewhat rare with us in <hi>England</hi> are ſold very dear: Indeed their fleſh both for delicacy of taſte, and wholſomneſs of nouriſhment is nothing inferiour to that of <hi>Partridge</hi> or <hi>Pheaſant.</hi> Poulterers, and ſuch as feed them in Coops do not permit them a high place to be in, becauſe leaping up they hurt their heads againſt the top: nay, though their Coops be ſo low that they can hardly ſtand upright in them, yet by ſtriking their heads againſt the top, they will rub off all the feathers; as we have obſerved.</p>

The body of this bird is narrow or compreſſed ſide-ways, and like to that of <hi>Water-hens,</hi> The lower part of the Breaſt and the Belly are white; the Chin alſo is white, elſe the Throat is of a more ſordid or dirty colour. On the Head are two broad black lines: Alſo a white line from the ſhoulders as in the <hi>Morehen.</hi> The middle parts of the covert feathers of the Back are black, the outſides of a reddiſh aſh-colour. The Thighs are variegated with tranſverſe white lines. In each Wing are twenty three quil-feathers.

The Tail is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two inches long, made up of twelve feathers. The Bill is like the <hi>Water-hens,</hi> the upper Mandible being whitiſh, the nether dusky. The Legs bare above the Knees: the Feet whitiſh. In the Stomach diſſected we found Snails.</p>
                        <p>It is called <hi>Rallus</hi> or <hi>Grallus</hi> perchance from its ſtalking <hi>[à gradu grallatorio]</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance from <hi>Royale,</hi> becauſe it is a Royal or Princely diſh.</p>

                        <p>This, if I much miſtake not, is the Bird which Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> takes to be the <hi>Crex</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> There is (ſaith he) a certain Bird in <hi>England</hi> with long Legs, elſe like to a <hi>Quail,</hi> ſave that it is bigger, which among Corn and Flax in the Spring and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Summer hath no other cry than <hi>Crex, Crex;</hi> but this it often iterates: Which I think to be the <hi>Crex</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> call it a <hi>Daker-hen,</hi> the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Ein Schryck.</hi> I never ſaw or heard it any where in <hi>England</hi> ſave in <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But ſeeing (as <hi>Geſner</hi> rightly) it is manifeſt by the teſtimony of the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Writer <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that the <hi>Crex</hi> is as big as the black <hi>Ibis,</hi> the Engliſh <hi>Daker-hen</hi> cannot be the <hi>Crex.</hi> Although this Bird be more rare in <hi>England,</hi> yet is it found every where in <hi>Ireland</hi> in great plenty.</p>

                        <p>THis Bird feeds by Coveys, like <hi>Partridges,</hi> in the Woods of <hi>Java,</hi> although it be alſo made and kept tame, and its Female, accompanied with her Brood, walks up and down the Yards of houſes like the common Hen; the Cocks alſo are no leſs ſtout, and given to fighting among themſelves till they kill one another, than the Dunghil-Cocks. In the colour of their feathers they very nearly reſemble the true <hi>Quail:</hi> But their Bill is a little longer: They alſo make ſuch an interrupted noiſe or cry by intervals as <hi>Quails</hi> are wont to do; but of a far different ſound from that of <hi>Quails,</hi> more like to that horrid drumming noiſe which <hi>Bittours</hi> make among Reeds in fenny places, which in <hi>Low Dutch</hi> we call <hi>Pittoor.</hi> The longer theſe Birds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue or draw out that cry, the more generous are they thought to be. They are of ſo cold a nature, that when ſhut up in Cages or Coops, if you do not expoſe them to the Sun-beams, and ſtrow Sand under them, they preſently languiſh, and run a hazard of dying: And therefore by night after Sunſet, they ſhrink up on a heap, as the Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kow doth with us in hollow trees in Winter-time, and in the trunks of trees cover themſelves with their feathers. But when the Sun riſes they preſently ſing, and that ſound is heard many paces off, that you would wonder ſo little a bird (for they do not exceed a common <hi>Pigeon</hi> or <hi>Turtle</hi> in bigneſs) ſhould have ſo deep and loud a cry. I have ſometimes kept of them in Cages, which would give me notice of the approach of Morning or break of day, if I had any ſerious buſineſs to do. For if any buſineſs be to be done, it is moſt commodiouſly diſpatcht either in the Morning or Evening. For the day time, while the Sun roaſts all things with his ſcorching heat, is unfit for action, and very unhealthful to ſtir much in.</p>

                        <p>FOr bigneſs and figure it comes near to a <hi>Turkey.</hi> The Cock we meaſured from the point of the Bill to the end of the Tail was thirty two inches long: The Hen but twenty ſix. The ends of the Wings extended were in the Cock forty ſix inches diſtant, in the Hen no more than forty one.</p>
                        <p>It had ſuch a Bill as the reſt of this kind, an inch and half long, meaſuring from the tip to the angles of the mouth; its ſides ſharp and ſtrong. Its Tongue is ſharp, and not cloven. In the Palate is a Cavity impreſſed equal to the Tongue. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes are of a hazel colour. Above the Eyes is a naked skin of a ſcarlet colour, in the place and of the figure of the Eyebrows, as in the reſt of this kind. The Legs on the forepart are feathered down to the foot, or riſe of the Toes, but bare behind. The Toes are joyned together by a membrane as far as the firſt joynt, then they have on each ſide a border of skin all along, ſtanding out a little way, and ſerrate.</p>
                        <p>The Breaſt is of a pale red, with tranſverſe black lines, the tips of the feathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whitiſh. The bottom of the Throat is of a deeper red: The Belly cinereous. The upper ſide of the body is particoloured of black, red, and cinereous, the tips of the feathers being powdered with ſpecks, excepting in the Head, where the black colour hath a purple gloſs if beheld in ſome poſitions. The Chin in the Cock is black, in the Hen red. The Tail is of a deeper red than the other feathers, and croſſed with black bars; the tips of the feathers being white. The Tail of the Cock is black, the tips of the feathers being white, and their borders as it were powdered with red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh aſh-coloured ſpecks. The middle feathers eſpecially, and thoſe next to them are marked with white ſpots. The feathers covering the bottom of the Tail have white tips, elſe are variegated with alternate black and reddiſh aſh-coloured tranſverſe lines. After the ſame manner the whole Back is alſo painted with black and white croſs lines, but finer, and ſlenderer. The feathers under the Tail are black, but their tips and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour edges white. The Head [in the Hen] is of the ſame colour with the back. The tips of the Breaſt-feathers are black.</p>
                        <p>Each Wing hath twenty ſix quill-feathers, the greater whereof are of a more dusky and dark colour: The reſt have their exteriour Vanes variegated with red and black. The tips of all beſide the ten outmoſt are white. The longer feathers ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſhoulders are adorned with angular beds of black, wherewith a little red is mingled below. The leſſer rows of hard feathers of the Wings are variegated with dusky, red and white, their tips being white. In the Cock the ſhoulders and leſſer rows of hard feathers above are variegated with red and black lines, underneath are white, except thoſe under the firſt <hi>internodium,</hi> which are black. The longer feathers under the ſhoulders are white, which when the Wings are cloſed make a large white ſpot. The Wings under the ſecond <hi>internodium</hi> are black, with tranſverſe lines of white. In the Cock the Neck is of a ſhining blue. The Thighs, Sides, Neck, Rump, and Belly are in like manner variegated with white and black lines. The Head is blacker: About the vent it is of an aſh-colour.</p>
                        <p>It hath very long blind Guts, ſtraked with ſix white lines. The Stomach muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, as in the reſt of this kind, full of little ſtones. The Craw was ſtuft with the Leaves, Tops, and Buds of the Fir-tree. The skin of the ſtomach ſticking to the muſcles is ſoft and hairy like Velvet.</p>
                        <p>But for the knowledge of this Bird, and diſtinguiſhing it from all others, there is no need of ſo prolix and particular a deſcription of colours, which vary much by age, and perchance alſo place, and other accidents, when as the bigneſs alone is ſufficient for that purpoſe.</p>

This Bird is found on high Mountains beyond Seas, and as we are told in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (where they call it, <hi>Cock of the Wood)</hi> but no where in <hi>England.</hi> At <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Padua</hi> we ſaw many to be ſold in the Poulterers Shops, brought thither from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Alps.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I take the <hi>Grygallus major</hi> of <hi>Geſner</hi> and <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> (who alſo calls it the <hi>Tetrax</hi> of <hi>Nemeſianus)</hi> to be the Female of this Bird. For the Females in this kind of Birds in variety and beauty of colours excel the Males. Whereas <hi>Geſner</hi> taking it for granted, that the Females do in no kind of creature excell the Males in variety of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, being deceived by this preſumption, took and deſcribed for different <hi>Species</hi> the different Sexes in both theſe kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Cock of the Mountain,</hi> and the <hi>black game:</hi> And ſo of two Species made four; to wit, 1. <hi>Urogallus major.</hi> 2. <hi>Grygallus major.</hi> 3. <hi>Urogallus minor.</hi> 4. <hi>Grygallus minor.</hi> The ſecond and fourth being the Females of the firſt and third. Moreover, being himſelf miſtaken, he thought <hi>Turner</hi> to be ſo: Who makes the Male <hi>Morehen,</hi> that is the leſſer <hi>Tetrao,</hi> or leſſer <hi>Urogallus</hi> of <hi>Geſner,</hi> to be black; the Female all variouſly ſpotted, ſo that if it were not bigger and redder than a <hi>Partridge,</hi> it could hardly be diſtinguiſhed from it. <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> follows <hi>Geſner,</hi> making the <hi>Grygallus major</hi> of <hi>Geſner</hi> (that is, the Female of the <hi>Urogallus major)</hi> the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trax</hi> of <hi>Nemeſianus;</hi> without cauſe reprehending <hi>Longolius,</hi> who indeed was of the ſame opinion; whereas he himſelf erroneouſly makes the Male and Female of the Cock of the Mountain <hi>[Urogallus major]</hi> diverſe or diſtinct kinds. So then the caſe ſtands thus:</p>

                        <head>§. II. <hi>The Heathcock or Black game or Grous, called by</hi> Turner <hi>the Morehen.</hi> Tetrao, ſeu Urogallus minor.</head>
                        <p>THe Cock weighed forty eight ounces: was in length from the point of the Bill to the end of the Tail twenty three inches, [The Hen was but nineteen inches long.] Its breadth thirty four inches [the Hens thirty one.]</p>
                        <p>The Cock is all over black, but the edges of the feathers, eſpecially in the Neck and Back, do ſhine with a kind of blue gloſs. His Legs are grey. The Female is of the colour almoſt of a <hi>Woodcock</hi> or <hi>Partridge,</hi> red with black tranſverſe lines. The Breaſt and Belly are hoary, The Wings underneath and the long feathers are white, as in the Cock. The middle of the Back is of a deeper red. The Rump and edges of the feathers on the Throat are hoary. The feathers under the Tail white.</p>
                        <p>In each Wing are about twnety ſix beam-feathers: In the Cock the bottom of the fifth of theſe is white, of the eighth and ſucceeding to the twenty ſixth the whole lower half. Of the eleventh and following feathers to the two and twentieth the tips are alſo white. The long feathers under the ſhoulders are purely white. In the Hen the ten outmoſt feathers are dusky, the reſt of the ſame colour with the body, ſaving their tips, which are whitiſh. The bottoms of all but the firſt ſix are white. Moreover, thoſe great quil-feathers, which, as we ſaid, are dusky, have ſomething of white in the outer borders. The Wings underneath, and thoſe longer feathers in both Sexes are white, which when the Wings are cloſed appear outwardly on the Back in the form of a white ſpot.</p>
                        <p>The Tail conſiſts of ſixteen feathers, and is in the Cock near ſeven inches long; [Underſtand this of the exteriour feathers, for the interiour do not exceed four inches.] In the Cock the three exteriour feathers on each ſide are longer than the reſt, and ſtand bending outward, the fourth on each ſide ſhorter, and leſs reflected. In the Female the outmoſt feathers are indeed longer than the reſt, but not reflected. The Tail is of the ſame colour with the body, only the tips of the feathers of a hoary white.</p>

The Bill is black and crooked; the upper Chap ſomewhat prominent and gibbous. Under the Tongue is a kind of glandulous ſubſtance: In the Palate a Cavity impreſſed equal to the Tongue. The Tongue is undivided, ſoft, and ſomewhat rough. The Eyebrows bare and red. The Ears great both in Male and Female. The Legs rough with feathers growing on their fore-part: The Toes naked, and connected by a membrane as far as the firſt joynt. On each ſide the Toes are the like borders of skin as in the precedent Fowl, ſtanding out from the Toe, and pectinated. The Claw of the middle Toe is on the inſide thinned into an edge. It hath no ſpurs.</p>
                        <p>Its Guts are <note n="*" place="margin">Underſtand it of the bird we deſcribed.</note> fifty one inches long: Its blind Guts (which is ſtrange) twenty four, ſtriate with ſix lines. The Craw large. They feed upon the tops of Heath, Acorns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Pouts do a long time accompany their Dams even after they be come to their full growth, as do young <hi>Partridges.</hi> They are infeſted with Lice and Ticks.</p>
                        <p>This kind is frequent in the ſides of high Mountains; ſometimes it deſcends into the plains, not rarely occurring in the lower Heath-grounds. The Male differs ſo ſtrangely from the Female, that to one unacquainted with them they might well ſeem to be of different kinds; yea, to <hi>Geſner</hi> himſelf they ſeemed ſo, as we ſhewed in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                        <p>This is <hi>Turners Morehen,</hi> which he thinks to be ſo named from the colour of the Cock, which is black, as in Moors, though he is miſtaken in that he writes, that it hath on its Head a red fleſhy Creſt, and about the Cheeks two as it were red fleſhy Lobes, or Gills, for it hath no other red fleſh about the Head but the Eye-brows, which all the reſt of this <hi>Genus</hi> have. See <hi>Aldrovand.</hi> lib. 14. cap. 15. <hi>Geſner</hi> calls it <hi>Gallus Scoticus Sylveſtris,</hi> that is, The wild <hi>Scotch</hi> Cock.

                        <head>§. III. * <hi>The</hi> Attagen <hi>of Aldrovandus, called by the Italians</hi> Francolino.</head>
                        <p>IN bigneſs and the whole habit and faſhion of its body it approaches to a <hi>Pheaſant.</hi> It hath a ſhort, black Bill, crooked at the end. The colour is various almoſt the whole body over. The Head eſpecially hath a very beautiful aſpect, a yellowiſh Creſt variegated with black and white ſpots, being erected in the middle of its Crown. The Pupil of the Eyes is black, the <hi>Iris</hi> yellow. It hath Eye-brows, like the Heathcock, of naked ſcarlet-coloured skin. Under the Bill and in the beginning of the Throat hangs down as it were a beard of very fine feathers. Its Neck is of the longeſt, and in compariſon with the bulk and make of its body ſlender, of an aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour, beſprinkled with black and white ſpots; which in this reſpect differ, that here the white, in the Head the black are the deeper. The ſpots of the Breaſt are of the ſame colour, wherewith are other ferrugineous ones mingled. The Belly, Tail, Hips, and Legs [which are covered with feathers] are of a lead colour, and alſo beſprinkled with black ſpots. The fore-toes of the Feet are long, the back-toe ſhort, all armed with crooked Claws.</p>
                        <p>They are by the <hi>Italians</hi> called <hi>Francolini</hi> as it were <hi>Franci,</hi> that is, <hi>Free Fowl,</hi> becauſe the common people are forbidden to take them, and Princes grant them free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of living.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Olina</hi> deſcribes this <hi>Francolino</hi> a little otherwiſe. In the figure (ſaith he) and proportion of its body it reſembles a common Partridge, but in bigneſs ſomething exceeds it. The Breaſt and all the Belly are ſpotted with black and white. The ends of the Wings and Tail are black. The Head, Neck, and Rump are fulvous, inclining to red, with a little and black intermixed. But neither his figure repreſents, nor deſcription mentions any Creſt. The Legs alſo in <hi>Olina</hi>'s figure are naked.</p>
                        <p>This Bird is either the ſame with our other <hi>Lagopus,</hi> called the <hi>Red-game,</hi> or very like it; but differs from it, in that it hath a Creſt upon its Head. But the <hi>Attagen</hi> of <hi>Bellonius</hi> (as may be ſeen by its Picture) is deſtitute of a Creſt. Indeed I ſhould think it to be the ſame, did not the place forbid it. For our <hi>red Game</hi> lives upon the tops of the higheſt Mountains in Northern Countries, whereas the <hi>Attagen</hi> of <hi>Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus</hi> is found plentifully in the Mountains of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which is a very hot Country. Yet I make no queſtion, but the Bird, which <hi>Bellonius</hi> and <hi>Scaliger</hi> underſtand by this * name, that lives in the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Mountains, and the Mountains of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63869:94"/>
which, <hi>Bellonius</hi> ſaith, comes not down into plain Countries, is the very ſame with our <hi>Red Game:</hi> And perchance alſo the <hi>Attagen</hi> of <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> is no other, ſith <hi>Francolinus</hi> is a name common to both <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> and <hi>Bellonius</hi> his Bird: And <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandus</hi> writes, that his <hi>Attagen</hi> is a Mountain Bird. Neither is it a ſufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the contrary, that <hi>Sicily</hi> where it is found is a hot Country: for Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> is ſo cold, that the top of it for the greateſt part of the year is covered with Snow. I am ſure when we went up it in the year 1664, in the beginning of <hi>June</hi> the Snow was not melted. But if the Legs thereof be bare, (for <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> doth not affirm it in his deſcription, though his figure repreſents them bare) and the Head al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways creſted, it cannot be our <hi>Red Game.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fleſh of this Bird is moſt excellent, of eaſie digeſtion, and yielding plentiful and very good nouriſhment: And therefore among the Ancients was preferred before all other, and placed in the higheſt degree of dignity.</p>

                        <p>THe Bird we deſcribed was a Cock, <note n="*" place="margin">This Bird was exente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, for it was bigger than a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, and equal to a handſom Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and would elſe have weighed more.</note> weighed but a pound, being from Bill point to Tail end fifteen inches long; and twenty two broad.</p>
                        <p>The Bill, as in Hens, is blackiſh, from the tip to the angles of the ſlit of the mouth almoſt an inch long: The upper Chap a little prominent and crooked. In the Palate is a Cavity equal to the Tongue. Above the Eyes a naked red skin takes up the place of Eye-brows, as in the <hi>Heathcock,</hi> and others of this kind. The Eye-brows of the Female are not ſo red, but paler. The Legs before are feathered half way down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind bare as high as the knees. The fore-toes are joyned together by a membrane from the divarication to the firſt joynt: And have beſides ſuch like ſerrate borders, or welts, ſtanding out on each ſide, as were obſerved in the precedent Birds. The inſide of the Claw of the middle Toe is thinned into an edge.</p>
                        <p>The whole Belly is white. The Breaſt white, ſpotted with black ſpots in the middle of the feathers: The ſeveral feathers having ſome one ſpot, ſome two or three croſs lines: The lower part of the Throat red, but the Chin of a deep black, encompaſſed with a white line. The Hen wants this black ſpot under the Chin. From the Eyes to the hind-part of the Head a white Line is produced. The Head is of a reddiſh aſh-colour: The Back and Rump are yet more cinereous, of a colour like that of a <hi>Partridge.</hi> The lower part of the Throat or Gullet is variegated with tranſverſe black lines. The ſides under the Wings are red or fulvous, the tips of the feathers being white. The long feathers ſpringing from the ſhoulders, that cover the Back, are all white.</p>
                        <p>The Wings are concave as in <hi>Partridges</hi> and the reſt of the Poultry kind: The beam-feathers in each Wing are twenty four in number, the foremoſt or outmoſt whereof on the outſide the ſhaft were parti-coloured of dusky and white, on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide dusky. The greater rows of covert Wing-feathers were variegated with red, white, and black.</p>
                        <p>The Tail was made up of ſixteen feathers all equal, of about five inches long. The ſeven exteriour on each ſide had their tips of a dirty white; next the white a bar or bed of black an inch broad; the reſt of the feather to the very bottom particolou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of black and white. The two middlemoſt of the Tail are of the ſame colour with the body, having croſs bars of white powdered with dusky ſpecks. The tips of the long feathers under the Tail are white, the middle part black, the lower red.</p>
                        <p>The Stomach is muſculous: The Guts thirty ſix inches long: The blind Guts fifteen, which in this Bird alſo are ſtriate. The fleſh boiled or roaſt, as in the reſt of this kind, is white, very tender alſo and delicate.</p>
                        <p>Moſt learned men (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus)</hi> are of opinion, that this is the Bird which by the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> was called <hi>Attagen;</hi> from whom yet he diſſents. It is wont (ſaith <hi>Georg. Agricola</hi> as he is quoted by <hi>Aldrovandus)</hi> to live in thick and ſhady woods. The ſame alſo writes that it is found plentifully in the Mountainous Woods about the foot of the <hi>Alps,</hi> eſpecially where hazels and briers abound. We ſaw them in the Market at <hi>Nurenberg</hi> to be ſold: Whence we gather that they are found in the great Woods near that City, though they be not mountainous: What they live chiefly upon we cannot certainly ſay, but we verily believe that their food is

                        <p>FOr figure and bigneſs it comes near to a tame <hi>Pigeon,</hi> ſave that it is ſomething bigger; weighs fourteen ounces: From the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail or Feet (for they are equally extended) is about ſixteen inches long; between the extremities of the Wings ſpread twenty four inches broad. The Bill ſhort, black, like a Hens, but leſs: The upper Chap longer and more prominent. The Noſthrils are covered with feathers, ſpringing out of a skin on the lower ſide the holes. Above the Eyes, in the place of the Eyebrows is a naked skin of a ſcarlet colour, and of the figure of a <hi>Creſcent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Cock-birds a black line drawn from the upper Chap of the Bill reaches fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Eyes towards the Ears; which in the Hens is wanting: All the reſt of the body, excepting the Tail, is as white as Snow.</p>
                        <p>Each Wing hath twenty four prime feathers, of which the firſt or outmoſt is ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the ſecond, the ſecond than the third. The ſhafts of the ſix outmoſt are black. The Tail is more than a Palm long, compounded of ſixteen feathers, the two middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt whereof are white; the outmoſt on each ſide without the ſhaft alſo white, all the reſt black. [Thoſe that I <hi>(J.

The Claws are very long, not unlike the nails of ſome Quadrupeds, as for example <hi>Hares;</hi> of a dark horn or lead colour. Its back-toe or heel is ſmall, but its Claw great and crooked. The fore-toes are joyned together by an intervening membrane, as in the other fowl of this kind. The Claw of the middle Toe is ſomething hollow all along the middle, the edges of this furrow or channel being ſharp. Under the Toes grow long hairs very thick.</p>
                        <p>The Craw is great, and in that we diſſected full of the tops and leaves of <hi>Fir, Heath, Bill-berry,</hi> &amp;c. The Stomach or Gizzard muſculous: The Guts forty inches long: The blind Guts long, great, and ſtriate.</p>
                        <p>In the Alps of <hi>Rhoetia,</hi> and in other high Mountains, which are for a great part of the year covered with Snow, it is frequently found. Wherefore Nature, or the Wiſdom of the Creator, hath fenced its Feet againſt the ſharpneſs of the cold with a thick covering of feathers and down.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Birds, for the excellency of their fleſh, are commonly called <hi>White Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges,</hi> and thought to be ſo by the Vulgar; whereas indeed the <hi>Partridge</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gopus</hi> are far different Birds.

The Neck underneath had a great deal of white, and but a little black; above was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered partly with pied, partly with white feathers. Above each Eye was a ſemicir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular skin of a red colour. Its Bill was very ſhort, and black, the upper Chap whereof was crooked, and received [within its edges] the nether, which was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelled. The Tail was five inches long, conſiſting of twelve black feathers, and two
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:63869:95"/>
white ones in the middle, and three or four particoloured ones. The Legs and Feet, down to the very Claws, were covered with white feathers growing very thick and cloſe together, ſo that nothing at all appeared bare but the black Claws. Only the ſoal of the Foot and inner part of the Toes were without feathers: Yet might the Toes be wholly covered with the hair-like feathers meeting underneath. It was as big as a <hi>Pigeon,</hi> or ſomething bigger: The length of the whole about five Palms. I ſuppoſe this Bird is called in <hi>Italian</hi> about <hi>Trent Otorno;</hi> about the Lake called by the Ancients <hi>Verbanus,</hi> now <hi>Maggiore,</hi> [or the greater,] <hi>Colmeſtre:</hi> Our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men [the <hi>Switzers] Stein-hun</hi> [or Stone-hen;] as ſome do alſo the precedent.

Thus far <hi>Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> I am of opinion that this Bird is not only generically, but even ſpecifically, the ſame with the former or firſt <hi>Lagopus</hi> of <hi>Pliny:</hi> For, except ſome marks and ſpots on the upper ſide of the body, it agrees perfectly therewith: But thoſe are not ſufficient to infer a difference of kind: Seeing that the firſt <hi>Species</hi> alſo is ſaid to change colour in Summer, and become dusky: Yea, thoſe which aſcend not up the Mountains are reported not to be white, no not in Winter. But I dare not pronounce any thing raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; referring the matter to the determination of the learned and curious, that live in thoſe Countries, or have opportunity of travelling and ſojourning there.</p>

                        <head>§. VII. <hi>The Red Game, called in ſome places the Gorcock and More-cock,</hi> Lagopus altera Plinii.</head>
                        <p>IT is near half as big again as a <hi>Partridge,</hi> for the figure of its body not unlike: Somewhat [yea, conſiderably] bigger than the <hi>Lagopus:</hi> Its Feet and Claws ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly like his. Its Bill is ſhort and blackiſh: Its Noſthrils elegantly covered with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as in the <hi>Lagopus.</hi> But eſpecially remarkable are the ſcarlet-coloured naked skins above each Eye, of the figure of a Creſcent, in place of Eye-brows, which in the Cock are much broader, and have in their upper Circumference a border of looſe fleſh ſnipt, as it were a fringe or Creſt. In the Cock the Plumage about the <hi>baſis</hi> of the Bill is powdered with white ſpecks; and at the <hi>baſis</hi> of the lower Chap, on each ſide is a pretty great white ſpot; but not ſo in the Female. Moreover, the Male differs from the Female, in that it is much redder than ſhe: So that in the Throat and upper part of the Breaſt it hath no mixture at all of any other colour. All the upper ſide of the Body, Head, Neck, Back, and covert-feathers of the Wings are partico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured of red and black, each ſingle feather being painted with red and black tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe wayed lines. Howbeit in the Cock the red exceeds the black; yet hath he in the middle of the Back and on the Shoulders great black ſpots, which the Female hath not.</p>
                        <p>In each Wing are twenty four quil-feathers, all dusky, except the exteriour edges of thoſe next the body, which are red. The outmoſt feather of the Wing is ſhorter than the ſecond, the third the longeſt of all. The interiour baſtard Wing is made up of white feathers. The feathers alſo on the under ſide of the Wings next to the flags are white. The Breaſt and Belly are almoſt of the ſame colour with the Back in both Sexes: Yet in the middle of the Breaſt and Belly are ſome pretty great white ſpots. The Legs and Feet are clothed with a long thick Plumage or Down to the utmoſt ends of the Toes. The Tail is more than a handful long, not forked, conſiſting of ſixteen feathers, all black except the two middlemoſt, which are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with red. The fleſh is very tender, eſpecially in the younger ones, not ſo white as a Hens.</p>
                        <p>It is frequent in the high Mountains of <hi>Derbyſhire, Yorkshire, Weſtmorland,</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> It lays five, ſix, ſeven, or eight Eggs, ſeldom more, one inch three quarters long, ſharper at one end, all ſpeckled with dark red ſpecks or points, only towards the ſharper end are one or two beds void of ſports. The younger are infeſted with belly-worms, which ſometimes as they fly hang down a foot length from behind. We take this Fowl to be the <hi>Lagopus altera</hi> of <hi>Pliny,</hi> lib. 10. cap. 48.</p>
                        <p>It delights to abide in the higheſt tops of the higheſt Mountains, and with us never comes down into the Plains, yea, ſeldom into the ſides of the Mountains.</p>

This is the Bird which <hi>Bellonius</hi> call the <hi>Attagen,</hi> as we ſaid before in the Chapter of the <hi>Attagen</hi> of <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> and takes that Bird which the <hi>Savoyards</hi> call, the <hi>white Partridge,</hi> and <hi>Pliny, Lagopus,</hi> to be a variety of this; for it is all over white, and hath the Legs covered with feathers (though finer) like the <hi>Attagen:</hi> The <hi>Italians</hi> alſo call both kinds <hi>Francolino.</hi> And indeed the colour and bigneſs excepted, the <hi>Red Game</hi> differs little from the <hi>Lagopus.</hi> The figure of the Bill and whole body is the ſame in both: The Feet alike feathered to the very Claws: So that Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> alſo, together with <hi>Bellonius,</hi> did ſometimes ſuſpect that they differed rather acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally than ſpecifically. But to me ſo great difference of colour and bigneſs do neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily infer a diverſity of kind. The fleſh of theſe, and the reſt of this Tribe, doth ſuddenly corrupt, and therefore the Fowlers, ſo ſoon as ever they take them, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exenterate them, and ſtuff the Cavity of the Belly with green <hi>Ling.</hi>

It feeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Corn, Seeds of Herbs, Colewort, Dandelion leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Stomach of one diffected we found a great quantity of <hi>Hemlock</hi> Seed, with three or four grains of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and that in Harveſt time. On <hi>New-market</hi> and <hi>Royſton Heaths</hi> in <hi>Cambridgeſhire</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and elſewhere in Waſts and Plains they are found with us.</p>
                        <p>They are of ſlow flight, and when they are lighted can hardly raiſe themſelves from the earth, by reaſon of the bulk and weight of their bodies, from whence without doubt they got the Latine name <hi>Tarda.</hi> They are called by the Scots <hi>Guſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae,</hi> as <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> witneſſeth in theſe words: <hi>In</hi> March, <hi>a Province of</hi> Scotland, <hi>are Birds bred, called in the Vulgar Dialect</hi> Guſtardes, <hi>the colour of whoſe feathers and their fleſh is not unlike the Partridges, but the bulk of their body exceeds the Swans.</hi>

                        <p>Some ſay, one may catch them with ones hands before they can compoſe themſelves to fly; but this is a miſtake, for though (as we ſaid before) it be long ere they can raiſe themſelves from the earth, yet are they very timorous and circumſpect, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63869:96"/>
will not ſuffer a man to come within a Furlong of them, before they take Wing and fly away. Yet our Fowlers report that they may be run down with <hi>Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds.</hi>

But we when we travelled in <hi>Italy</hi> did ſee in the Market at <hi>Modena</hi> a <hi>Buſtard</hi> to be ſold, whence we ſuſpect that there are of them in that Country.</p>
                        <p>Though ſome diſcommend their fleſh, yet with us it is eſteemed both delicate and wholeſome. Hence, but chiefly for its rarity, the <hi>Buſtard</hi> ſells very dear, ſerving only to furniſh Princes and great mens Tables at Feaſts and public entertainments.</p>

                        <p>THe <hi>Field-Duck</hi> ſeems to us to be a Bird peculiar to <hi>France,</hi> where there is not a Country man but knows it, at leaſt by name. It is ſo called, not becauſe it is a Water-bird, but becauſe it ſits on the ground like the <hi>Water-Duck.</hi> But it hath no ſimilitude or agreement with Water-fowl, being a Land-bird. It is of the bigneſs of a <hi>Pheaſant;</hi> the Head, ſaving the bigneſs, reſembling a <hi>Quails,</hi> the Bill a Pullets. It is more known by its name, than by its ſhape: For we have a Country-Proverb againſt ſuſpicious perſons, wherein we ſay, that they play the <hi>Land Duck.</hi> It is taken in Plains and open fields, as they take <hi>Partridges,</hi> in ſnares, with Nets and <hi>à la for me,</hi> and alſo with Hawks. But it is very crafty in defending and ſhifting for it ſelf: flying near the ground, and that <note n="*" place="margin">Impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</note> with great force and ſwiftneſs, for two hundred or three hundred paces, and when it alights or falls on the ground running ſo ſwiftly, that ſcarce any man can overtake it. It hath only three Toes in each foot, like the <hi>Buſtard</hi> or <hi>Plover.</hi> The roots of all the feathers are red, and as it were of a ſanguine colour, ſo joyned to the skin as in the <hi>Buſtard,</hi> whence alſo we take it to be a kind of <hi>Buſtard:</hi> For both, but eſpecially this, is white under the Belly: But the Back is variegated with three or four colours, to wit, a yellow tending to red, with ſomewhat of cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous and red intermixed. Four Wing-feathers in the upper part have black tips. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bill, down as far as the Breaſt, it is white. A white Collar near the Crop compaſſes the Breaſt, as in the <hi>Savoy Merulae,</hi> or <hi>Water-Ouzels.</hi> [But this Collar ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not in <hi>Bellonius</hi> his figure.] The colour of the Head and upper part of the Neck is the ſame with that of the Back and Wings. The Bill is black, leſs than in the <hi>Ionic Attagen.</hi> The Legs incline to cinereous. He that deſires an exact deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of this Bird, let him imagine a <hi>Quail</hi> of the bigneſs of a <hi>Pheaſant,</hi> but very much ſpotted; for juſt ſuch is this <hi>Field-Duck.</hi> All the interiour parts it hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with other granivorous birds. It is reckoned among delicate Birds, and eſteemed as good meat as a <hi>Pheaſant.</hi> It feeds indifferently upon all ſorts of Grain, as alſo upon <hi>Ants, Beetles,</hi> and <hi>Flies,</hi> and likewiſe upon the leaves of green corn. And although the colour of the Neck and Head be not always the ſame, (and herein conſiſts the difference between the Male and the Female) yet the Back and Wings never change colour.

                        <p>A Female, which we deſcribed, weighed thirteen ounces: Was in length from Bill to Tail thirteen inches; in breadth twenty ſix.</p>
                        <p>Its Bill was ſlender, ſharp-pointed, and indifferently long, like to that of a <hi>Lapwing</hi> or <hi>Plover,</hi> above the Noſthrils ſoft, and white by the aſperſion of a kind of furfuraceous ſubſtance, elſe dusky. The Tongue neither hard, nor cloven, but ſharp and ſoft. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes of a yellowiſh red. The Legs on the forepart feathered almoſt to the Toes: The Feet and Toes red; the Talons black.</p>
                        <p>The Head was of a pale blue; the Neck as it was diverſly objected to the light did exhibite to the Beholder various and ſhining colours. The Crop was reddiſh, the reſt of the Breaſt and Belly aſh-coloured. The Back beneath, a little above the Rump, was white, (which is a note common to moſt wild <hi>Pigeons)</hi> about the ſhoulders ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereous, elſe black, yet with ſome mixture of cinereous.</p>
                        <p>The number of prime feathers in each Wing was about twenty three or twenty four. Of theſe the outmoſt were dusky, of the reſt as much as was expoſed to ſight black, what was covered with the incumbent feathers cinereous. The covert-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the ten firſt <hi>Remiges</hi> were of a dark cinereous: Of the reſt of the covert-feathers (almoſt to the body) the tips and interiour Webs, as far as the ſhafts were cinereous, the exteriour black. The covert-feathers of the underſide of the Wings purely white.</p>
                        <p>The Tail is made up of twelve feathers, four inches and an half long, the middle being ſomewhat longer than the extremes. The tips of all were black: The two outmoſt below the black on the outſide the ſhaft were white; all the reſt wholly cinereous, the lower part being the darker. The feathers incumbent on the Tail were cinereous.</p>
                        <p>It had a great Craw, full of <hi>Gromil</hi> ſeed. The blind Guts were very ſhort, ſcarce exceeding a quarter of an inch. It hath (as we ſaid of <hi>Pigeons</hi> in general) no Gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bladder, and lays but two Eggs at a time.</p>

                           <hi>Runt;</hi> a name (as I ſuppoſe) corrupted from the <hi>Italian Tronfo:</hi> Though to ſay the truth, what this <hi>Italian</hi> word <hi>Tronfo</hi> ſignifies, and conſequently why this kind of Pigeon is ſo called, I am altogether ignorant. Some call them <hi>Columbae Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicae, Ruſſia-Pigeons,</hi> whether becauſe they are brought to us out of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> or from ſome agreement of the names <hi>Runt</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> I know not. Theſe ſeem to be the <hi>Campania</hi> Pigeons of <hi>Pliny.</hi> They vary much in colour, as moſt other Domeſtic Birds: Wherefore it is to no purpoſe to deſcribe them by their colours. In reſpect of magnitude they are divided into the <hi>biggeſt</hi> and the <hi>leſſer</hi> kind. The <hi>greater</hi> are more ſluggiſh birds, and of ſlower flight; the ſame perchance with thoſe <hi>Geſner</hi> ſaith he obſerved at <hi>Venice,</hi> which were almoſt as big as <hi>Hens.</hi> The <hi>leſſer</hi> are better breeders, more nimble, and of ſwifter flight. Perchance theſe may be the ſame with thoſe, which <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Croppers,</hi> ſo called becauſe they can, and uſually do, by attracting the Air, blow up their Crops to that ſtrange bigneſs that they exceed the bulk of the whole body beſide. A certain <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <hi>Hollander</hi> informed <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> that theſe <hi>Kroppers Duve,</hi> as they call them, are twice as big as the common Domeſtic Pigeons, which as they fly, and while they make that murmuring noiſe, ſwell their throats to a great bigneſs, and the bigger, the better and more generous they are eſteemed. Thoſe that I ſaw at Mr. <hi>Copes,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> living in <hi>Jewin</hi> Street, ſeemed to me nothing bigger, but rather leſs than <hi>Runts,</hi> and ſomewhat more ſlender and long-bodied. Theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no leſs one from another in colour than the precedent.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Broad-tail'd Shakers,</hi> called <hi>Shakers</hi> becauſe they do almoſt conſtantly ſhake or wag their Heads and Necks up and down: <hi>Broad-tail'd,</hi> from the great number of feathers they have in their Tails; they ſay, not fewer than twenty ſix. When they walk up and down they do for the moſt part hold their Tails erect like a <hi>Hen</hi> or <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key-Cock.</hi> Theſe alſo vary much in colour.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Narrow-tail'd Shakers.</hi> Theſe agree with the precedent in ſhaking, but differ in the narrowneſs of their Tails, as the name imports. They are ſaid alſo to vary in colour. This kind we have not as yet ſeen, nor have we more to ſay of it.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Carriers.</hi> Theſe are of equal bigneſs with common <hi>Pigeons,</hi> or ſomewhat leſs, of a dark blue or blackiſh colour. They are eaſily diſtinguiſhed from all others, 1. By their colour. 2. In that their Eyes are compaſſed about with a broad circle of naked, tuberous, white, furfuraceous skin. 3. That the upper Chap of the Bill is covered above half way from the Head with a double cruſt of the like naked fungous skin. The Bill is not ſhort, but of a moderate length. They make uſe of theſe birds to convey Letters to and fro, chiefly in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire. Perchance theſe may be the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pigeons of <hi>Aldrovand,</hi> all over of a dusky or dark brown co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, excepting the Eyes which are ſcarlet, the Feet which are of a pale red, and the Bill, which (as he ſaith) is yellow; wherein they differ from ours, whoſe Bills are black. The nature of theſe birds is ſuch, that though carried far away they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſpeedily thither, where either themſelves were bred or brought up, or where they had hatcht and brought up Young. Of this kind we ſaw in the Kings Aviary in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park, and at Mr. <hi>Copes,</hi> an Embroiderer in <hi>Jewin</hi> Street, <hi>London.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we read that the Ancients ſometimes made uſe of <hi>Pigeons</hi> in ſending Letters, as for example, <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> in the Siege of <hi>Modena, Hirtius</hi> ſending a Dove to <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> back again to <hi>Hirtius,</hi> having, by meat laid in ſome high places, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed theſe <hi>Pigeons,</hi> before ſhut up in a dark place, and kept very hungry, to fly from one to another.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>Jacobines,</hi> called by the <hi>Low Dutch, Cappers,</hi> becauſe in the hinder part of the Head or Nape of the Neck certain feathers reflected upward encompaſs the Head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, almoſt after the faſhion of a Monks Hood, when he puts it back to uncover his

Head. Theſe are called <hi>Cyprus</hi> Pigeons by <hi>Aldrovand,</hi> and there are of them rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed. <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> hath ſet forth three or four either <hi>Species</hi> or accidental varieties of this kind. Their Bill is ſhort: The <hi>Irides</hi> of their Eyes of a Pearl-colour, and the Head (as Mr. <hi>Cope</hi> told us) in all white.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. <hi>Turbits,</hi> of the meaning and original of which name I muſt confeſs myſelf to be ignorant. They have a very ſhort thick Bill like a <hi>Bullfinch:</hi> The crown of their Head is flat and depreſſed: The feathers on the Breaſt reflected both ways. They are about the bigneſs of the <hi>Jacobines,</hi> or a little bigger. I take theſe to be the <hi>Candy</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Doves of <hi>Aldrovand, tom.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 477. 478. the Low Dutch <hi>Cortbeke.</hi>

A broad circle of naked, tuberous, white fleſh compaſſes the Eyes, as in the <hi>Carriers.</hi> The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes are white. My worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Philip Skippon,</hi> in a Letter to me concerning tame Pigeons, writes, that the Eyes of this kind are red. Perchance the colour may vary in ſeveral birds.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. <hi>Smiters.</hi> I take theſe to be thoſe, which the fore-mentioned <hi>Hollander</hi> told <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> that his Country-men called <hi>Draiiers.</hi> Theſe do not only ſhake their Wings as they fly: But alſo flying round about in a ring, eſpecially over their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, clap them ſo ſtrongly, that they make a greater ſound than two Battledores or other boards ſtruck one againſt another. Whence it comes to paſs that their quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers are almoſt always broken and ſhattered; and ſometimes ſo bad, that they cannot fly. Our Country-men diſtinguiſh between <hi>Tumblers</hi> and <hi>Smiters.</hi>

                        <p n="10">10. <hi>Tumblers,</hi> theſe are ſmall, and of divers colours. They have ſtrange motions, turning themſelves backward over their Heads, and ſhew like footbals in the Air.</p>

They are the beſt breeders of all, and will not lightly forſake any houſe to which they have been accuſtomed.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. <hi>Baſtard-bills.</hi> Which name why it is impoſed upon them I know not, unleſs perchance becauſe their Bills are neither long nor ſhort, ſo that it is not certain to what Species they ought to be referred.

                           <hi>Pigeons</hi> are far harder to concoct than Chickens, and yield a melancholy juyce. They ſay that the eating of <hi>Doves</hi> fleſh is of force againſt the Plague; inſomuch that they who make it their conſtant or ordinary food are ſeldom ſeized by Peſtilential diſeaſes. Others commend it againſt the Palſie and trembling: Others write, that it is of great uſe and advantage to them that are <note n="*" place="margin">Or have weak Fyes.</note> dim-ſighted. The fleſh of young

Pigeons is reſtorative, and uſeful to recruit the ſtrength of ſuch as are getting up, or newly recovered from ſome great ſickneſs: To us it ſeems to be moſt ſavoury, and if we may ſtand to the verdict of our Palate, comparable to the moſt eſteemed.</p>
                        <p>A live <hi>Pigeon</hi> cut aſunder along the back-bone, and clapt hot upon the Head, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigates fierce humours and diſcuſſes melancholy ſadneſs.

Our Phyſicians uſe to apply Pigeons thus diſſected to the ſoals of the Feet, in acute diſeaſes, in any great defect of ſpirits or decay of ſtrength, to ſupport and refreſh the patient, that he may be able to grapple with, and maſter the diſeaſe. For the vital ſpirits of the Pigeon ſtill remaining in the hot fleſh and bloud, do through the pores of the skin inſinuate themſelves into the bloud of the ſick perſon now diſ-ſpirited and ready to ſtagnate, and induing it with new life and vigour, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it to perform its ſolemn and neceſſary circuits.</p>

But the Cock hath his Head, Neck, Breaſt, Wings as far as the quill-feathers, and Back down to the Rump reddiſh, but of a much fainter colour than in our common Turtle, and not at all ſpotted. Its bigneſs is almoſt the ſame, its note the ſame: Its Bill alſo like, but black.

                        <p>IT is a little bigger than a <hi>Lark, Nieremberg</hi> ſaith, than a <hi>Sparrow;</hi> hath a ſmall dusky [black] Bill, like a <hi>Pigeons;</hi> black Eyes, with a golden Circle. The whole Head, the upper part of the Neck, the Sides, Back, and Wings are covered with dark aſh-coloured, or black and blue feathers, having black, ſemilunar borders. But the long feathers of its Wings, which are ſeen as it flies, are of a red colour, and black on one ſide, and in their tips. The Tail is of a good length, conſiſting of dusky aſh-coloured feathers, yet ſome of them are black, and have their exteriour half white. The feathers of the Belly are white, having their borders black, of the figure of a Creſcent. The Legs and Feet like thoſe of other <hi>Doves,</hi> but whitiſh. Theſe <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons</hi> are good meat, and grow very fat. <hi>Nieremberg</hi> adds, that the Head is little, the Bill little and black, the Neck ſhort, the Legs red [wherein it differs from <hi>Marg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graves</hi> bird,] the Claws dusky and little. The <hi>Mexicans</hi> gave it its name from the colour of its Wings, and the noiſe it makes in flying; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (who call it a <hi>Turtle)</hi> from its murmuring voice, and the taſte and quality of its fleſh, although it be much leſs than our common <hi>Turtle.</hi> It cries <hi>hu, hu,</hi> affords good nouriſhment, though ſomewhat hard of concoction.

They ſay, that it will cure a woman of jealouſie, if you give it her boil'd to eat, ſo that ſhe knows not what ſhe eats. There is alſo another ſort of this Bird, every way like it, ſave only that the body is fulvous and black, and the Head aſh-coloured: Whence ſome call it <hi>Tlapalcocotli.</hi>

                        <p>THat we deſcribed weighed twenty ounces and an half. Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail was eighteen inches: Its breadth thirty.</p>
                        <p>Its Bill yellowiſh, covered for ſome ſpace from the Head with a red or purpliſh skin, wherein are the Noſthrils. Above the Noſthrils is as it were a white Dandroof. The Tongue is ſharp-pointed, not cloven, but channel'd. The circle about the Pupil of the Eye of a pale yellow.</p>
                        <p>The Feet were bare, of a red colour, as in other <hi>Pigeons.</hi> The outmoſt Toe by a membrane joyned to the middlemoſt as far as the firſt joynt. The Legs feathered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt down to the foot.</p>
                        <p>The upper part of the Neck is adorned with a ſemicircular line of white, which they call a ring, and from whence the Bird took its name <hi>[Ring-Dove.]</hi> Both above and beneath this ring the Neck, as it is variouſly objected to the light, appears of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colours. The Head and Back are of a dark aſh-colour. The lower part of the Neck, and upper part of the Breſt are purpliſh, or red, with a certain mixture of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereous. The Belly of a light aſh-colour, inclining to white. In the Cock theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are deeper than in the Hen.</p>
                        <p>The quill-feathers in each Wing about twenty four, of which the ſecond is the longeſt: The ten foremoſt or outmoſt were black: The ſecond, and ſucceeding as far as the ſeventh, had their utmoſt edges white: The reſt of the hard feathers were of a dusky aſh-colour. At the bottom or riſe of the baſtard Wing a white ſpot tending downwards covered the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth quill-feathers. The Tail was ſeven inches long, and made up of twelve feathers, the top or end, for two inches and an half, being black, the remaining part cinereous.</p>
                        <p>The Liver was divided into two Lobes: It had no Gall-bladder, but a large Gall-channel to convey the Gall into the Guts.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Birds in Winter-time company together, and fly in flocks: They build in trees, making their Neſts of a few ſticks and ſtraws. They feed upon Acorns, and alſo upon Corn, and Ivy and Holly berries.</p>

The top of the Head cinereous. The Neck covered with changeable feathers, which as they are variouſly objected to the light, appear of a purple or ſhining green; no Silk like them. The fore-part of the Breaſt, the Shoulders and Wings are daſhed with a purpliſh or red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine colour, whence it took the name <hi>[Oenas.]</hi> The Wings, Shoulders, and middle of the Back are of a dark aſh-colour, the reſt of the Back to the Tail of a paler. All the quil-feathers (except the four or five outmoſt, which are all over black, with their edges white) have their lower part cinereous, and their upper black. The Tail is five inches long, made up of twelve feathers, having their lower parts cinereous, their upper for one third of their length black. The nether ſide of the body, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the upper part of the Breaſt, is all cinereous. The Wings cloſed reach not to the end of the Tail. In both Wings are two black ſpots, the one upon two or three quil-feathers next the body, the other upon two or three of the covert feathers incumbent upon thoſe quils: Both ſpots are on the outſide the ſhafts, and not far from the tips of the feathers. The two outmoſt feathers of the Tail have the lower half of their exteriour Vanes white.</p>
                        <p>The Feet are red, the Claws black: the Legs feathered down a little below the Knees. The blind Guts very ſhort.

                        <head>§. I. <hi>The Miſſel-bird or Shrite;</hi> Turdus viſcivorus major.</head>
                        <p>THis Bird is the biggeſt of this kind, weighing four ounces and an half. Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail was eleven inches. Its breadth eighteen.</p>
                        <p>Its Bill is ſtreight, like a <hi>Blackbirds,</hi> or for the bigneſs, a little ſhorter: The upper Chap dusky, ſomewhat longer than the lower: The Tongue hard, channel'd and ſlit at the tip, horny, and pellucid: The inſide of the Mouth is yellow: The Noſthrils great, almoſt of an Oval figure: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes hazel-coloured. The Legs and Feet yellowiſh; the Claws black. The outer fore-toe ſticks to the middlemoſt as far as the firſt joynt, no membrane intervening. The Head is of a dusky cinereous, or lead-colour, the middle part of each feather being blacker. The Back, Tail, and Rump have ſome mixture of yellow. In Summer it changes colour, and becomes more cinereous. [The colour of the Head, Back, Wings, and Tail, in a word of the whole upper ſide ſeemed to me to approach to that of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Olives pickled while yet immature, ſuch as are uſually brought over to us.] The underſide of the body from the Bill to the Tail is ſpeckled with pretty great blackiſh ſpots. The upper part of the Breaſt, the Sides, and feathers under the Tail are yellow, the middle of the Belly white.</p>
                        <p>The number of quill-feathers in each Wing is eighteen, whereof the ſecond, being the longeſt, is by meaſure five inches. The tips of the feathers next incumbent on the quills are white. The Tail is four inches and an half long, and made up of twelve equal feathers.</p>
                        <p>It hath no Craw: The Gizzard is not very thick or fleſhy; therein we found Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, Caterpillars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though the Bird was killed in <hi>January.</hi> The Guts were great, but ſhort: The blind Guts very little and ſhort. It had a pale-coloured Liver, and a Gall bladder.</p>
                        <p>Sitting upon the tops of high trees, as Oaks, Elms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Spring time it ſings rarely well. It abides the year round with us in <hi>England,</hi> and breeds here. It is a ſolitary Bird, accompanying and flying only with its Mate. It is the worſt meat of all its kind.</p>
                        <p>In Winter time it feeds much upon <hi>Holly-berries.</hi> And (which is ſtrange) the birds of this kind are obſerved each to take poſſeſſion of his tree, and to be always near it, and not to permit other birds to feed on it, but to beat and drive them away: Which quality of theirs is the occaſion that they are eaſily taken.</p>
                        <p>A late Engliſh Writer ſaith, that this bird makes as large a Neſt as a <hi>Jay,</hi> and lays as big an Egg: Builds commonly with rotten twigs the outſide of his Neſt, the inſide with dead Graſs, Hay, or Moſs, that he pulls from trees. It ſeldom lays above five Eggs, but four moſt commonly, breeds but twice a year, and hath three young ones, never above four, that I could find; She feeds all her young ones with <hi>Miſſelto</hi> ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and nothing elſe as I could perceive, having diligently watched them for two or three hours together. <hi>This I can hardly believe, for that the old ones feed upon other berries too, and alſo Inſects.</hi> For Convulſions or the Falling ſickneſs, kill this bird, dry him to a powder, and take the quantity of a penny weight every morning in ſix ſpoonfuls of black Cherry water, or the diſtilled water of <hi>Miſelto-</hi>berries. The reaſon of this conceit is, becauſe this bird feeds upon <hi>Miſſelto,</hi> which is an approved remedy for the <hi>Epilepſie.</hi>

                        <p>IT is called viſcivorous, not becauſe its feeds upon <hi>Miſſelto-</hi>berries, but becauſe it is like the <hi>Miſſel-bird.</hi> It is leſſer than the <hi>Fieldfare,</hi> ſcarce bigger than the <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing,</hi> of three ounces weight; from the point of the Bill to the end of the Tail or the Feet, (for all is one) nine inches long. The Bill is an inch long, of a dusky colour. The Tongue, viewing it attentively, appears to be a little cloven: The Mouth within<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide is yellow: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes hazel-coloured.</p>
                        <p>In the colour and ſpots of the Breaſt and Belly it agrees with the <hi>Miſſel-bird:</hi> For the ſpots are dusky; the Breaſt yellowiſh; the Belly white. The upper ſurface of the body is all over dusky, with a mixture of yellow in the Wings. [I ſhould rather call this an Olive-colour, from its likeneſs to that of unripe pickled <hi>Olives,</hi> ſuch as are brought over to us out of <hi>Spain.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Bird for its outward ſhape and colour is ſo like the <hi>Redwing</hi> that they are hard to be diſtinguiſhed: Only this hath more and greater ſpots on the Breaſt and Belly. <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> tells us, that it is proper to this kind to be ſpotted about the Eyes. The leſſer feathers, covering the Wings underneath, are of a yellowiſh red colour: The lower covert-feathers have yellow tips. The quill-feathers in each Wing are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber eighteen. The Tail is three inches and an half long, and made up of twelve feathers.</p>
                        <p>The Legs and Feet are of a light brown or dusky: The ſoals of the Feet yellow; The exteriour toe grows to the middle one as far as the firſt joynt. It hath a Gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bladder; the Stomach or Gizzard not ſo thick and fleſhy as in other birds of this Tribe. Its feeding is rather upon Inſects than berries: It eats alſo ſhell-ſnails, which are by moſt Naturaliſts reckoned among Inſects. The Sex cannot be known by the colour. It abides all the year, and breeds with us in <hi>England.</hi> It builds its Neſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly of earth, moſs, and ſtraws, and within dawbs it with clay, laying its Eggs and Young upon the bare clay; it lays at one ſitting five or ſix Eggs of a bluiſh green co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſpeckled with a few ſmall black ſpots, thin-ſet. In the Spring time it ſits upon trees and ſings moſt ſweetly. It is a ſolitary bird like the <hi>Shrite.</hi> But it builds rather in hedges than high trees. Moreover, it is a ſilly bird, and eaſily taken.</p>
                        <p>For the delicate taſte of its fleſh it is by all highly and deſervedly commended. If we ſtand to <hi>Martials</hi> judgment, the <hi>Thruſh</hi> is the beſt meat of all birds:</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>Inter aves Turdus, ſiquid me judice verum eſt,</l>

                        </q>
                        <p>This (ſaith a late Engliſh Writer) is a rare Song-bird, as well for the great variety of his notes, as his long continuance in ſong [at leaſt nine months in the year.] They breed commonly thrice a year, in <hi>April, May,</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> but the firſt birds prove uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the beſt. They may be taken in the Neſt at fourteen days old or ſooner, muſt be kept warm and neat, not ſuffering them to ſit upon their dung if it happen to fall into the Neſt. When they are young you muſt feed them with raw meat, and ſome bread mixt and chopt together, with ſome bruiſed Hemp, wet their bread and mix it with their meat. When they are well feathered, put them in a large Cage, with two or three Perches in it, and dry Moſs at the bottom; and by degrees you may give them no fleſh at all, but only bread and hemp-ſeed. Give them freſh water twice a Week, to bathe themſelves, otherwiſe they will not thrive. If he be not clean kept he is ſubject to the Cramp, like other ſinging birds.</p>

The Bill is an inch long, like a <hi>Blackbirds,</hi> yellow ſave the tip, which is black: The Bills of the Hens or young birds are darker and leſs yellow, as in <hi>Blackbirds;</hi> the Tongue is rough, horny,

channel'd in the middle. The edges of the Eye-lids being yellow make a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low circle round the Eye. The Noſthrils are great. In the lower part of the nictating membrane is a black ſpot. The Ears are large: The Feet black, but the Claws more: The outer Toe is joyned immediately to the middle one as far as the firſt joynt.</p>
                        <p>It ſeems to be ſomewhat bigger than a <hi>Blackbird,</hi> and the ſecond in bigneſs of this kind, or next to the <hi>Miſſel-bird.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Head, Neck, and Rump are aſh-coloured, [in ſome of a deep blue.] The crown of the Head ſprinkled with black ſpots [which yet in ſome birds are wanting.] The Back, Shoulders, and covert feathers of the Wings are of a dark red or Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-colour; the middle parts of the feathers being black. The Throat and upper part of the Breaſt are yellow, ſpotted with black, the black ſpots taking up the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle parts of the feathers. The bottom of the Breaſt and Belly are white, and leſs ſpotted. The covert-feathers of the ſides under the ends of the Wings are white: Thence a red or yellow line ſeparates the white from the black. On each Cheek it hath a black ſtroak reaching from the Bill to the Eyes. It hath alſo on both ſides, at the bottom of the Neck, juſt by the ſetting on of the Wings, a black ſpot. The number of quil-feathers, as in the reſt, is eighteen, the outmoſt of which are black, with white edges; the inner have ſomething of red, The covert-feathers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Wings are white. The Tail is four inches and an half long, compoſed of twelve feathers, of a dark blue or blackiſh colour: Only the tips of the outmoſt fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are white, and the edges of the middlemoſt aſh-coloured.</p>
                        <p>The Liver is divided into two Lobes, and furniſhed with its Gall-bladder: The Muſcles of the Gizzard are not very thick. I found no footſtep of the paſſage for conveying the Gall into the Guts.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Birds fly in flocks together with <hi>Stares</hi> and <hi>Redwings.</hi> They ſhift places ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeaſons of the year. About the beginning of Autumn come over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible flights of them into <hi>England,</hi> which ſtay with us all Winter, and in the Spring fly all back again, not one bird remaining; inſomuch that (as far as ever I could hear) there was never ſeen young <hi>Fieldfare</hi> or <hi>Redwing,</hi> or ſo much as a Neſt of thoſe birds with us in <hi>England.</hi> Whither they betake themſelves, or where they breed is not to us perfectly known: It is by ſome reported, that they breed in <hi>Bohemia;</hi> others tell us with much confidence, in <hi>Sweden.</hi> They have a hoarſe chattering note, not much unlike a <hi>Magpie;</hi> by reaſon the ſides of the fiſſure in the Palate are rough; as we conjecture.</p>
                        <p>This kind of <hi>Thruſh</hi> (ſaith <hi>Geſner)</hi> loves to feed upon Berries of all ſorts, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe of <hi>Juniper.</hi> With us in <hi>England</hi> they are very greedy of <hi>Holly-berries.</hi> This bird is accounted very good meat, and preferred far before the <hi>Miſſel-bird.</hi> In open weather they feed upon Worms, and other Inſects, lying much upon Meadows and Paſture-grounds.</p>

                        <head>§. I. <hi>The common Blackbird,</hi> Merula vulgaris.</head>
                        <p>IT is little, or nothing leſs than a <hi>Fieldfare;</hi> of four ounces weight; nine inches and an half long from the tip of the Bill to the Claws, to the end of the Tail ten and an half, and the Cock eleven.</p>
                        <p>The Bill is an inch long, in the Cock of a deep yellow; in the Hen the tip and upper part is black. The Mouth in both Sexes is yellow within. The Bill in young Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds is black, and turns not perfectly yellow till they be near a year old. The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the Eye-lids is alſo yellow. The Cock, after he hath mewed his chicken feathers, becomes cole-black; the Hen and young Cock-birds are rather brown, or of a dark ruſſet than black: Their Breaſts have ſomething of reddiſh, and their Bellies of aſh-colour. The Cocks while young cannot be diſtinguiſhed from the Hens by their colour.</p>
                        <p>The number of quill-feathers in each Wing is eighteen, of which the fourth is the longeſt. The Tail is four inches and an half long, made up of twelve feathers of equal length ſave the two outmoſt, which are ſomewhat ſhorter than the reſt.</p>
                        <p>The Feet are black: The outmoſt fore-toe and the back-toe are equal: And the outmoſt Toe joyned to the middlemoſt at bottom, as in the reſt of this kind.</p>
                        <p>The Liver is divided into two Lobes, and hath its Gall-bladder annexed. The Giz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard not very fleſhy nor thick, as in the reſt. It feeds promiſcuouſly upon Berries and Inſects. I could not find any remainder of the Yolk-channel in the Guts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="191" facs="tcp:63869:102"/>
The Cocks in this kind are very canorous, whiſtling and ſinging very pleaſantly all the Spring and Summer-time, only their note is too loud and ſhrill near hand.</p>
                        <p>The Hen lays four or five Eggs, ſeldom more at once, of a bluiſh green colour, full of dusky ſpots and lines.</p>
                        <p>On the <hi>Alps,</hi> the <hi>Appennine,</hi> and other high Mountains are ſometime found birds of this kind all over white. We our ſelves ſaw one in a Poulterers Shop at <hi>Rome</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured of black and white. But this we look upon as accidental: Either the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Region, or the conſtant intuition of Snow effecting this alteration of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, as in <hi>Crows, Ravens,</hi> &amp;c. So that we do not think a white <hi>Blackbird</hi> (pardon the ſeeming contradiction <hi>in adjecto)</hi> to differ ſpecifically from a black one.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Blackbird</hi> builds her Neſt very artificially withoutſide of Moſs, ſlender twigs, bents, and fibres of roots, cemented and joyned together with Clay inſtead of Glue, dawbing it alſo all over withinſide with Clay: Yet doth ſhe not lay her Eggs upon the bare Clay, like the <hi>Mavis,</hi> but lines it with a covering of ſmall ſtraws, bents, hair, or other ſoft matter, upon which ſhe lays her Eggs, both that they might be more ſecure, and in leſs danger of breaking, and alſo that her Young might lie ſofter and warmer.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Blackbird</hi> loves to waſh it ſelf, and prune its feathers with its Bill. It flies alſo ſingly for the moſt part: Whence it took the name <hi>Merula</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> being (as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> and <hi>Varro</hi> tell us) ſo called becauſe it flies and feeds <hi>Mera,</hi> that is, ſolitary or ſingly.</p>
                        <p>The fleſh of <hi>Blackbirds</hi> is accounted good meat, yea, ſome prefer it before that of the <hi>Thruſh.</hi> But Palate-men, and ſuch as are critical in diſcerning of taſtes, are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>MEeting with a Female of this kind at <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> I thus deſcribed it. It is of the bigneſs of a <hi>Blackbird,</hi> and for ſhape of body very like it, nor much different in colour.</p>
                        <p>The Head and Neck were thicker than to anſwer the proportion of the body. The top of the Head was of a dark aſh-colour. The Back was of a deep blue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt black, only the extreme edges of the feathers were whitiſh. The Shoulders and covert-feathers of the Wings were of the ſame colour. Each Wing had eighteen quill-feathers, beſides a little ſhort one outmoſt, all dusky, but ſome had white tips. The ſecond row of Wing-feathers had alſo white tips. The Tail was about four inches long, and compoſed of twelve black feathers. The underſide of the Body Breaſt, Belly, and Thighs, was all variegated with black, cinereous, and whitiſh tranſverſe waved lines, ſo that in colour it reſembled a <hi>Cuckow.</hi> Under the Throat, and in the upper part of the Breaſt no aſh-colour appeared, and the white lines had ſomething of red mingled with them. The Bill was ſtreight, blackiſh, rather longer than a <hi>Thruſhes</hi> Bill, as alſo a little thicker and ſtronger. The Legs ſhort and black: The Feet and Claws black. The Legs, Feet, and Claws in this ſort ſeemed to me leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than in the reſt of the <hi>Thruſh-kind.</hi> The Mouth within was yellow, the ſtomach filled with Grapes.</p>
                        <p>The Cocks are much more beautiful, all over of a ſhining blue, or bluiſh purple colour, as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> witneſſeth, and as we alſo obſerved in a Cock we ſaw at <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Back eſpecially was of a moſt lovely gliſtering dark purple colour.</p>
                        <p>It is wont to ſit alone on the tops of ancient Edifices and Roofs of Churches, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt ſweetly, eſpecially in the Morning, whence it took its name, being ſuppoſed to be the bird ſpoken of, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 102. 7. It builds alſo in the like places, for which <hi>Olina</hi> is my Author. For the excellency of its ſinging it is highly prized in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſpecially, at <hi>Genua</hi> and <hi>Milan.</hi> It hath a whiſtling note like a Pipe, and may eaſily be taught to imitate mans voice.</p>

In another place he thus diſcourſes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame bird: This <hi>(viz.</hi> which <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. de Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleo.</note> 
                           <hi>Bellonius,</hi> whoſe words he had cited, calls <hi>Merula torquata, i. e.</hi> Ring-Ouzel) ſeems to be the very ſame with that bird of which <hi>Raphael Seillerius</hi> of <hi>Augsburg</hi> lately wrote to me in theſe words. The bird which from its blue colour the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Blauvogel</hi> is of the bigneſs of a <hi>Stare,</hi> hath his Breaſt, Loins, and Neck of a lovely blue, yet darker than the <hi>Kingfiſher.</hi> The Back and Wings are ſomewhat black, yet ſhewing ſomething of blue. The Bill is an inch and half long, under the Noſthrils dusky, the upper Chap being hooked, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the nether, for the moſt part. The Feet are divided, as in other birds. It lives in the higheſt parts of the <hi>Alps,</hi> neither is it contented to abide in the tops of the Mountains, but chuſes the moſt rocky and craggy places, and ſuch as are covered with Snow, neither do we know certainly that it is found in any other place than the Mountains about the River <hi>Atheſis,</hi> eſpecially near the City of <hi>Inſpruck.</hi> For this cauſe it is had in great account even by the Inhabitants themſelves of thoſe places, and is fed with ſuch meat as men uſually eat, and ſuch as is uſually given to <hi>Blackbirds</hi> and <hi>Thruſhes</hi> deſigned for fowling. It ſpeaks with an articulate voice very pleaſant and various; and is it ſelf ſo docile, and obſerves things ſo diligently, that it will expreſs moſt things by ſome articulate ſound. Being awakened at Midnight, and called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a by-ſtander, as if it were bidden, it will ſing with a clear and loud note. Like other birds, it aims at mens Eyes, becauſe ſeeing in them, as in a Looking-glaſs, its own image, it is affected with a deſire of its like, and thinks to joyn it ſelf in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with it. Before the Autumn, at what time other birds ſit, and are buſie in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Young, together with its colour it changeth alſo its voice. Its colour about the beginning of Winter of blue becomes black, which about the beginning of next Spring it changes again into its own natural blue. Being fully fledg'd, and once got out of the Neſt, and a little accuſtomed to flying, it cannot any more (as all the Fowlers affirm) by any allurement or deceit be enticed and taken, ſo naturally crafty it is. It makes its Neſt in deep holes in very high and unacceſſible ſolitudes, having found a ſecure place, to which it may ſafely commit it ſelf and its Young. And by its cunning doth not only remove it from the acceſs of men by placing it on the higheſt ridges of the Mountains, but alſo hide it in deep Caverns from the <hi>Chamois,</hi> and other wild beaſts, and there it feeds three or four Young with worms, till it brings them out of the Neſt, and turns them looſe to ſhift for themſelves. Now the Fowlers having either by chance, or by lying in wait, found out the place, taking with them a long, round, ſmooth ſtilt or ſtake, made of a ſingular piece of wood, hard to be found (ſuch as the climbers of Rocks and hunters of <hi>Chamois</hi> are wont to make uſe of to aſſiſt them in getting up the crags and cliffs of Rocks) mount up there where you would not think it poſſible for them to find room to ſet one foot. And to omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing, they wrap their heads with cloth, covering their faces ſo far that they may ſee ſide-ways, to avoid dizzineſs; and this they do partly to fence them againſt the old birds, partly, and chiefly (this being the true cauſe of their ſo doing) to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their proſpect any ways but juſt forward, to ſee where they are to pitch their ſtake, or clap on their hands. So at length, not without extreme toil and danger, they arrive at the Neſt, which with that long pole or ſtake I mentioned they draw up out of the deep hole where it was placed, and carry away with them, cheriſhing, and bringing the Young up at their own houſes: And afterwards either ſell them dear, or preſent them to Gentlemen and great perſons of their knowledge. Thus far <hi>Seillerius.</hi> I ſuſpect that this very bird, which <hi>Geſner</hi> calls <hi>Blauvogel,</hi> is the ſame which about <hi>Chur</hi> in the <hi>Griſons</hi> Country and elſewhere is called <hi>Steirotele,</hi> or near akin to it.</p>

It affords as good and better nouriſhment than a <hi>Blackbird,</hi> flies ſwifter, and uſes the ſame food. All this out of <hi>Bellonius;</hi> whom <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> pronounces miſtaken, in that he thought this bird to be the <hi>Cyanus</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Himſelf, with <hi>Geſner,</hi> deeming the <hi>Cyanus</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to be of the <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecker</hi> kind: Which how he proves ſee in this place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Turner</hi> conjectures the <hi>Caeruleus</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to be that bird which is called in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a <hi>Clot-bird,</hi> a <hi>Smatch,</hi> an <hi>Arling,</hi> a <hi>Stonecheck,</hi> and in <hi>High Dutch, Ein Brechvogel.</hi> This he ſaith in <hi>England</hi> breeds in Coney-burrows, and under ſtones, and appears not in Winter. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> names and place of building argue <hi>Turner</hi> to have meant the common <hi>Oenanthe</hi> or White-tail; which is a far different bird from the <hi>Caeruleus</hi> of <hi>Bellonius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For my part, to ſpeak freely what I think, I judge the <hi>Blauvogel</hi> of <hi>Geſner</hi> to be the very ſame bird with the <hi>ſolitary Sparrow;</hi> but the <hi>Caeruleus</hi> of <hi>Bellonius</hi> to be a bird ſpecifically different, and which I have not yet ſeen alive, though I have often ſeen its picture.</p>

                           <hi>BEllonius</hi> figures this bird among the <hi>Merulae,</hi> induced only by this reaſon, that thoſe who bring it out of <hi>Braſil</hi> into <hi>Europe</hi> call it, the <hi>Braſilian Blackbird.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing he ſpeaks nothing concerning the nature of the Bird, and it is alike un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, I alſo adjoyn it to the <hi>Merulae,</hi> although in the ſhortneſs, or rather crookedneſs, of its Bill it differs much from them. Thoſe (ſaith <hi>Bellonius)</hi> who trade in Countries newly diſcovered, bring back thence ſuch ſtrange rarities as they think will ſell dear with us here: But becauſe they cannot bring the birds themſelves alive in Cages, therefore they flay off the skins of ſuch as are more beautiful than the reſt, as this is, and bringing them over make a great gain of the ſale of them; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of this which they call, the <hi>Braſilian Blackbird;</hi> though in bigneſs it differs from a <hi>Blackbird.</hi> The colour of the whole body, except the Tail and Wings, which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:63869:104"/>
are black; is ſo deep [perchance by the word <hi>intensè</hi> he may mean bright] a red, that it exceeds all other redneſſes. The Tail is long; the Feet and Legs black; The Bill ſhort, as in a <hi>Sparrow.</hi> The feathers are red to the very bottom. That which <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> deſcribes, perchance from a picture, was in ſome things different from <hi>Bellonius</hi> his bird. For, ſaith he, the Wings are not all over black, but all the upper feathers by the ſhoulders of a deep red. Next to them are ſome black ones, then red ones again; the ſubſequent, <hi>viz.</hi> all the great feathers, being black, as is alſo the Tail. The Bill alſo is not ſo ſhort as in <hi>Sparrows,</hi> yet thick, and remarkably crooked, without of a dusky colour, within yellow, as I conjecture from the colour of the corners of the mouth <hi>[rictûs.]</hi> Moreover, the Feet are not black, but of an aſh-colour, only a little dusky, being great for the proportion of the Legs: The Claws ſhort, but crooked, of the ſame colour.</p>
                        <p>We have ſeen in <hi>Tradeſcants</hi> Cabinet a red <hi>Indian</hi> bird dried, of the bigneſs almoſt of a <hi>Mavis,</hi> having a long Tail, which perchance is the ſame with the bird in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle deſcribed.</p>

                        <p>WE ſaw the Caſe of this bird in <hi>Tradeſcants</hi> Cabinet. It was of the bigneſs and ſhape of a <hi>Blackbird,</hi> as far as I could judge by the dried skin.

                        <p>IT is like, and equal to, or ſomewhat bigger than the common <hi>Blackbird:</hi> From Bill to Tail eleven inches long, to the end of the Feet ten and a quarter; the Wings extended were by meaſure ſeventeen inches. The Bill more than an inch long, of a dark dusky or blackiſh colour. The mouth yellow withinſide: The Tongue rough. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes are of a dark hazel colour: The Legs and Feet dusky. The outer Toe is joyned to the middle as far as to the firſt joynt. The colour of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſide of the body is a dark brown, or ruſſet, inclining to black. The feathers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Breaſt and Belly are marked with a long whitiſh ſpot down the ſhaft,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:63869:104"/>
having alſo white edges. The Ring or Collar is below the Throat, juſt above the Breaſt, of a white colour, an inch broad, of the form of a Creſcent, the horns end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſides of the Neck.</p>
                        <p>It hath eighteen quil-feathers in each Wing; twelve in the Tail, the outmoſt being a little ſhorter than the reſt; four inches long. The exteriour feathers of the Tail are blacker than the middlemoſt. The ſmall feathers under the Wings whitiſh.</p>
                        <p>[In a bird that I deſcribed at <hi>Rome</hi> the edges of the prime feathers of the Wings, as alſo of the covert-feathers of the Head and Wings were cinereous. The ring alſo was not white, but aſh-coloured. I ſuppoſe this was either a young bird, or a Hen.]</p>
                        <p>It hath a large Gall, and a round Spleen: In the Stomach we found Inſects, and Berries like to Currans. Theſe Birds are common in the <hi>Alps</hi> in <hi>Rhoetia</hi> and <hi>Switzerland:</hi> They are alſo found in the mountainous parts of <hi>Derbyshire, Yorkshire,</hi> and elſewhere in the North of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They ſay that the Female of this kind hath no ring: Whence I perſwade my ſelf that the bird which I ſometimes deſcribed for the <hi>Merula Saxatilis</hi> or <hi>Montana,</hi> that is, the <hi>Rock-Ouzel</hi> of <hi>Geſner,</hi> p. 584. was no other than a <hi>Hen Ring-Ouzel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It nearly reſembles the common <hi>Blackbird</hi> in bigneſs, figure, and colour; yet is in ſome things manifeſtly different; <hi>viz.</hi> it is a thought bigger, hath a longer body, and not ſo dark a colour. Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail was ten inches and an half, to the end of the Claws nine and an half: Its breadth one foot and five inches: Its weight three ounces and two drachms. The top of the Head, the Shoulders, Back, Wings, and Tail, in a word, the whole upper ſide was of a dark brown or dusky colour, The number of quill-feathers in each Wing eighteen. The Tail was four inches and an half long, not forked, black, made up of twelve fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The underſide, <hi>viz.</hi> the Breaſt, Belly, Sides, Thighs, and under-coverts of the Wings, particoloured of brown and white, or rather cinereous; the middle part of each feather being brown, and the borders round about cinereous.</p>
                        <p>Its Bill is every way like the common <hi>Blackbirds,</hi> excepting the colour which in this is of a dark brown, or blackiſh. The inſide of the mouth, as in that, yellow. The Legs are of a moderate length, and dusky colour, as alſo the Feet and Claws.</p>
                        <p>The Guts indifferent large, but not very long, and conſequently not having many revolutions: The blind Guts ſmall, white, and very ſhort, as in the reſt of this kind. The Stomach or Gizzard was of a moderate bigneſs, filled partly with Inſects, partly with the purple juyce of Bill-berries, which had alſo tinctured all the excrements of the Guts.</p>
                        <p>It is uſually converſant about the Rocks and ſteep Cliffs of high mountains. This we deſcribed was ſhot by <hi>Fr. Jeſſop</hi>

                        <p>THe Cock weighed three ounces and an half, the Hen three. From Bill to Claws it was nine inches long, to Tail end eight and three quarters. Its breadth was ſixteen inches. It is of the bigneſs and ſhape of a common <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bird.</hi> Its Bill from the tip to the angles of the mouth an inch and a quarter long, in the Cock of a pale yellow, in the Hen dusky, broader and more depreſſed than in <hi>Thruſhes</hi> or <hi>Blackbirds,</hi> by which <note n="*" place="margin">This we make the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic note of this kind.</note> mark eſpecially it differs from them. The upper Mandible is equal to the nether: The Tongue is hard, horny, and cloven: The <hi>Iri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> of the Eyes of a hazel colour, whiter on the upper part. It hath the nictating membrane, which I believe few birds want. The Legs and Feet are yellowiſh, [ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a fleſh colour:] The Claws blackiſh. The outer and inner fore-toe are equal to each other; and the outer joyned to the middle toe as far as the firſt articulation. The Legs feathered down to the Knees.</p>
                        <p>The tips of the feathers on the Neck and Back are yellow: The feathers under the Tail cinereous, elſe they are black all the body over, with a certain blue or purple gloſs, varying as it is variouſly expoſed to the light. In the Hen the tips of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on the Breaſt and Belly, to the very Throat, are white. In the Cock the Back participates more of purple, the Rump of green; only the lower Belly is more ſpotted.</p>
                        <p>All the quil-feathers are dusky; but the edges of the third, and ſubſequent to the tenth, and from the fifteenth again to the laſt are more dark, The covert-feathers of the Wings gliſter, and the tips of the leſſer coverts are yellow. The feathers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the underſide of the Wings are dusky, having pale-yellow edges.</p>
                        <p>The Tail is three inches long, made up of twelve dusky feathers with pale yellow edges: It lays four or five Eggs lightly tinctured with a greeniſh blue.</p>
                        <p>The blind Cuts as in the reſt of this kind are very ſhort and ſmall, nearer to the Fundament than in others. The muſcle of the Gizzard not very thick: The Guts thirteen inches long. It feeds upon Beetles, Worms, and other Inſects. It hath a Gall-bladder.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Stares</hi> are gregarious birds, living and flying together in great flocks. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany alſo with <hi>Redwings</hi> and <hi>Fieldfares;</hi> yet do they not fly away with them, but abide with us all Summer, breeding in the holes of Towers, Houſes, Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This kind ſometimes varies in colour. For we have ſeen in <hi>Wales</hi> two white <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;</hi> one with a black Head, and all the reſt of the body white at <hi>Aberdaren,</hi> a little Village in <hi>Carnarvanſhire. Stares</hi> are not eaten in <hi>England</hi> by reaſon of the bitterneſs of their fleſh: The <hi>Italians,</hi> and other Outlandiſh people are not ſo ſqueamiſh, but they can away with them, and make a diſh of them for all that. It is a notable bird at imitating mans voice, and ſpeaking articulately.</p>

The meaſure of the Wings extended fourteen. The Bill is morethan an inch long, broad and flat, as in <hi>Stares,</hi> not round, and riſing up in a ridge, as in <hi>Blackbirds,</hi> black of colour: The upper Chap longer, ſharp-pointed, and ſomewhat crooked. The mouth within yellow. The Tongue a little eleſt at the end. The Legs and Feet of a lead colour; the Claws black; the ſoal of the foot yellow. The outer Toe grows or is faſtned immediately to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle one as far as the firſt joynt; the inner toe is a little ſhorter than the outer. The Chin underneath is whitiſh: The tips of the feathers on the Breaſt cinereous. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Breaſt is a tranſverſe black line; below which the Plumage is of a red or deep Orange-tawney colour. The Head and Back brown, the tips of the feathers being cinereous. The quil-feathers of the Wings of a black brown, with reddiſh tips. The Tail conſiſts of twelve feathers, of a red tawney or Orange colour, whence it took the name of the greater <hi>Redſtart.</hi> The leſſer feathers under the Wings are of the like colour.</p>
                        <p>Its Stomach was fleſhy, and ſtuffed with the ſtones of certain berries, we knew not what. Its Guts were eleven inches long. It imitates mans voice, learning to ſpeak articulately, like the <hi>Stare.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Hens are paler-coloured; above being of a Mouſe-dun, ſpotted with white ſpots; underneath rather hoary. Thoſe parts which in the Males are fulvous, in the Females are of a pale yellow.</p>
                        <p>Lighting upon three or four of theſe birds at <hi>Florence,</hi> comparing them together, I <hi>[J. R.]</hi> deſcribed them as exactly as I could in theſe words.</p>
                        <p>It is equal in bigneſs, and like in ſhape to a <hi>Throſtle.</hi> Its colour is various, on the top of the Head and Neck mingled of a dirty white or aſh-colour and brown, ſo that it appears grey or hoary. Viewing each ſingle feather, the bottom or lower part is blue; the middle part about the ſhaft black, which black line near the tip of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is croſſed by another, which together repreſent the figure of the letter T in each feather. The very tips of all are white. The colour that fills up the angles of the T-like mark is dusky. Theſe colours in the Neck, Shoulders, upper part of the Back, and covert-feathers of the Wings are more bright and conſpicuous. The fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on the middle of the Back in the Cock-birds are marked about their middles with a large white ſpot, above which is a croſs line of blue, then one of black, and laſtly, their tips are red. The bottom of the Back about the Rump is more cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous or blue. The feathers incumbent on the Tail are red, with white tips. The great feathers of the Wings have their tips and exteriour edges white, elſe they are black: The greater covert-feathers are alſo of the ſame colour. The feathers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the underſide of the Wings are of a pale red or yellow colour.</p>
                        <p>The Tail is ſhort, ſcarce exceeding three inches, made up of twelve feathers of equal length, all red or fulvous, excepting the two middle, that are dusky, which yet in ſome birds are alſo above half red. It is here to be obſerved, that all the Tail-feathers have their outer edges toward the top, of the ſame colour with the middle feathers.</p>
                        <p>The nether ſide of the body, <hi>viz.</hi> the Throat, Breaſt, Belly, Thighs, are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured of white or grey, black and yellow. [In ſome Cock-birds the whole Belly was of a fulvous colour, ſpeckled with many white ſpots, and a few black ones.] The Throat and upper part of the Breaſt are darker than the Belly, for that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned colours are there more mingled and confounded, whereas in the belly they are more diſtinct, and make greater ſpots. If you heed each feather, you ſhall find the bottom to be blue, in the middle a yellow ſpot, encompaſſed with a black line, and the top white. The Wings are long, reaching almoſt to the end of the Tail. The deſcription of the Bill and Legs we have already given in Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi>'s words, and have nothing further to add concerning them.</p>
                        <p>It is ſaid to abide and build in mountainous places. It is kept in Cages for its ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I ſuſpect that <hi>Bellonius</hi> his ſolitary <hi>Sparrow</hi> is the ſame with this bird, though the deſcription anſwers not exactly in all things.</p>

The whole Head, Neck, Back, Wings, and Tail have brown or <note n="*" place="margin">Of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Soot.</note> fuligineous feathers, which in the Tail are darker-coloured than the reſt.

                     <p>THis bird from the beginning of the Bill to the end of the Tail was by meaſure ten inches long: Equal in magnitude to, or ſomewhat bigger than a <hi>Thruſh:</hi> Its Bill more than an inch long, red, like a <hi>Thruſhes,</hi> but bigger, and longer: Its Tongue cloven and rough: The <hi>Irides</hi> of its Eyes red: Its Legs, Feet, and Toes of a Lead-colour.

                     <p>The quil-feathers of the Wings were black: But the tips of the fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh, alſo of the tenth, and four ſubſequent white, and the utmoſt edges of the third and fourth. The foremoſt feathers of the ſecond row were almoſt half way of a pale yellow: Elſe the upper ſurface of the whole Wing black. The twelve feathers of the Tail were of equal length, <hi>viz.</hi> about three inches and an half: The two middlemoſt black, the reſt had their upper halfs yellow, their lower black. All the body beſide was of a bright yellow, very beautiful to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: So that for the luſtre and elegancy of its colours it ſcarce gives place to any of the <hi>American</hi> birds. Between the Eyes and Noſthrils on each ſide it had a black ſpot.</p>

In the Female the colours are not ſo fair and lively, the yellow being mingled with black and brown, the Breaſt ſhaded with dusky lines: The leſſer rows of Wing-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the two middle feathers of the Tail green. The young ones alſo are greener, and have their Breaſts ſpotted.</p>
                     <p>The Guts are ſixteen inches long, great and lax: the blind Guts very ſmall and ſhort: The Teſticles round. In the Belly we found Caterpillars.</p>
                     <p>We ſhot this bird near <hi>Frankeford</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> Afterwards we ſaw many of them at <hi>Naples</hi> in the Poulterers Shops: Whence we gueſs that they are frequent in the neighbouring Country.</p>

It is called <hi>Galbula</hi> or <hi>Galgulus,</hi> from its yellow colour.</p>
                     <p>It is a bird of paſſage. <hi>Geſner</hi> writes, that it comes into his Country for the moſt part in <hi>May,</hi> but ſometimes alſo in <hi>April:</hi> After whoſe coming they have certain hope that there will be no more froſts. Whence it appears, that it delights in hot places and ſeaſons.

                     <head>Of ſmall Birds in general.</head>
                     <p>SMall Birds in general may be divided into ſlender-bill'd, which are for the moſt part Inſectivorous; and ſuch as have ſhort and thick Bills, which are for the moſt part Phytivorous, living upon the fruits and ſeeds of Plants. The firſt kind are commonly called ſoft-beak'd, the ſecond hard-beak'd birds.</p>
                     <p>Of both kinds there are many ſubalternate <hi>Species, viz.</hi> of ſlender-bill'd, <hi>Larks,</hi> whoſe characteriſtic notes are a very long <note n="*" place="margin">By heel is meant the claw of the back-toe.</note> heel; earthy coloured feathers, mounting up in the air, and ſinging as they fly; <hi>Swallows,</hi> whoſe marks are a ſhort Bill, a wide Mouth, long Wings, a forked Tail, ſhort and ſmall Legs and Feet; ſwift, and almoſt continual flight: The <hi>Hedge-Sparrow, Redſtart, Robin-red-breaſt,</hi> and many others, which we divide into two <hi>Claſſes</hi> or ranks. The firſt is of ſuch whoſe Tail is only of one colour; the ſecond of thoſe whoſe Tails are particoloured; either all the feathers, or the outmoſt on each ſide being in part white.</p>
                     <p>Of thick-bill'd Birds the kinds are, the <hi>Sparrow,</hi> whoſe marks are an earthy or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaceous colour, a Bill a little crooked, feeding upon Corn, the <hi>Hawfinch,</hi> the <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch,</hi> the <hi>Shel-apple</hi> or <hi>Sheld-dapple,</hi> the <hi>Linnet,</hi> the <hi>Chaff-finch,</hi> the <hi>Gold-finch,</hi> the <hi>Siskin,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe characteriſtics we will give when we come to treat of them.</p>

                           <hi>AMerica</hi> (as <hi>Marggravius</hi> obſerves) breeds more fair-coloured birds, but fewer ſinging birds than <hi>Europe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As we have diſtinguiſhed ſmall birds in general into ſoft and hard beak'd, ſo may we alſo diſtinguiſh ſinging birds. The ſoft-beak'd are, The <hi>Mavis</hi> or <hi>Song-Thruſh;</hi> the <hi>Blackbird;</hi> the <hi>ſolitary Sparrow,</hi> which is a ſtranger to <hi>England;</hi> the <hi>Nightingale,</hi> eſteemed the Prince of all ſinging birds, of the rearing and ordering of which we ſhall treat at large when we come to his Hiſtory; the <hi>Skie-Lark;</hi> the <hi>Wood-Lark;</hi> the <hi>Tit-Lark;</hi> the <hi>Robin-red-breaſt;</hi> the <hi>Wren;</hi> the <hi>Black-cap;</hi> the <hi>Beccafigo;</hi> the <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart;</hi> and the <hi>Hedge-Sparrow.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The hard-beak'd are, The <hi>Canary bird;</hi> the <hi>Linnet;</hi> the <hi>Chaffinch;</hi> the <hi>Goldfinch;</hi> the <hi>Greenfinch;</hi> the <hi>Bulfinch;</hi> the <hi>Brambling;</hi> the <hi>Hortulane;</hi> the <hi>Siskin;</hi> the <hi>Citril,</hi> the <hi>Hirngril;</hi> the <hi>Yellow-hammer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In all ſinging birds in general obſerve to keep them very neat and cleanly; and therefore often to ſhift the ſtraw, moſs, gravel, or whatever elſe you put in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of their Cages; and to give them freſh water, and meat often; for nothing offends them more than the ſtench of their own dung, or putrid meat and water. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if their Cages be foul, they will be apt to clog their Feet with their dung, which often rots off their toes, at leaſt cauſes the Cramp, Gout, and other infirmities. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandus</hi> adviſes to put in their Cages a piece of Pumice ſtone, or old rubbiſh, to cleanſe and whet their Bills upon, which otherwiſe will be apt to grow blunt.</p>
                        <p>All Birds (ſaith he) are wont to ſwallow ſomething out of the earth to cleanſe their bodies; I rather think they uſe only to ſwallow ſome grit or gravel, to aſſiſt them in grinding their meat in their Gizzards; and therefore it is needful to put fine gravel in their Cages.</p>

In the rearing of young ones from the Neſt obſerve, 1. To feed them often, but to give them but little at a time, as the old ones do, for fear of over-charging their ſtomachs, and cauſing them to caſt up their meat. 2. After they begin to feed themſelves, give not over feeding them preſently, leſt they neglect and ſtarve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                           <hi>Hard-beak'd</hi> birds are to be fed with ſeeds, and of all ſeeds <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> commends Canary-ſeed, as the moſt ſavoury, pleaſant, and wholſom of all other, which makes them ſing with greater alacrity, and alſo live long: For want of which you may (ſaith he) give them Millet, Panic, Spelt, Off-corn-wheat, Hemp-ſeed, and Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed; he might have added Rape-ſeed, Cole-ſeed, and many others.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Soft-beak'd</hi> birds are to be fed with heart of Veal or Weather, Worms, Flies, and ſuch kind of Inſects, as alſo that ſort of paſte the receipt whereof we ſhall give you in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Nightingale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In preparing their meat have a care to free it from all skin, fat, and Sinews, or ſtrings, which will be apt to ſtick in their Throats, or twine about their Tongues, and cauſe them to fall off their meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

I have alſo known <hi>Nightingales</hi> to be troubled with it, that have been fed too much with Eggs hard-boyled. For the remedy of this (for the bird will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eat his meat kindly, nor ſing with any ſtomach ſo long as he hath it) take the bird in your hand, and having opened his Bill, with a Needle take that hardneſs off from the top of his Tongue, and the ſides of his Bill alſo; and give him as in the precedent diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. The <hi>diſeaſe</hi> of the <hi>Rump,</hi> known by the birds growing melancholy, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from ſinging. The beſt remedy whereof is to cut off that ſharp part that lies upon the top of the Rump, and give him ſome cleanſing thing in his meat, and refreſhing thing in his water.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. The <hi>flux</hi> of the <hi>Belly</hi> or <hi>Scouring.</hi> For remedy whereof pluck off the Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers, and the feathers about the Vent, and anoint the place with Oyl or Capons greaſe, and if they be hard-beak'd birds, inſtead of Hemp-ſeed, or Rape-ſeed, give them Pumpion ſeeds [or red Beet ſeeds] for two or three days; if ſoft-beak'd, give them nothing but the yolks of hard-boyl'd Eggs.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. <hi>Moulting</hi> or caſting their feathers is a kind of diſeaſe common to all birds. At that time they all grow melancholy, and ceaſe to ſing, and forſake their meat, and ſome of them will be very ſick. For help of this <hi>Aldrovand</hi> adviſes to ſprinkle them twice or thrice a Week with Wine not too ſtrong, then ſetting them in the Sun till they be dry, and after putting ſome greens about their Cage.</p>
                        <p>To preſerve birds of all kinds in health, <hi>Aldrovand</hi> ſaith, it would be uſeful to purge them once a month with Pumpion ſeeds decorticated, Lettuce, Succory, Beet, Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernel, or Mercury, which laſt herb is proper to the <hi>Linnet.</hi> Such birds as are uſed to duſt themſelves, it would without doubt be convenient to put ſand or duſt in their Cages; for this basking themſelves in the duſt rids them of Lice and Vermine: Likewiſe, ſuch as are uſed to waſh themſelves ought to have water ſet them for that purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>It would alſo be of advantage, indeed it were neceſſary, to put a little fine gravel in their Cages, that they may pick up and ſwallow ſome grit or ſmall ſtones, to help them in grinding their meat in their ſtomachs, as wild birds are uſed to do, in whoſe Gizzards you will never fail to find ſmall ſtones and grit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Olina</hi> adviſes in tumours or impoſtumes on the head, (which are moſt incident to birds of a hot complexion) to cauterize the place affected with a hot Iron, and then anoint it with black Sope diſſolved, or Oyl and hot aſhes. Some uſe to purge the birds, before they burn them, with juyce of Beet.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Aphthae</hi> he preſcribes lightly to touch the Palate with a feather dipt in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of Roſes, which hath been ſharpned with a little Oyl of <note n="*" place="margin">Brimſtone.</note> 
                           <hi>Sulphur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Aſthma,</hi> or ſhortneſs of breath, he adviſes to drop two or three drops of <hi>Oxymel</hi> into their throats with a feather; mingling thereof alſo with their water for two or three days, or diſſolve white Sugar-candy in their water.</p>
                        <p>Hoarſeneſs and loſs of voice he ſaith is remedied by giving them for their drink a decoction of Jujubes, dried Figs, and pounded, boil'd in common water, and that for two days, and the next two or three days juyce of Beet: And if it be in Summer time ſetting them all night in the open air, ſo as the dew may not fall upon them.</p>
                        <p>For a ſcouring he commends water in which Iron is quencht, or a light decoction of Services, or Cornelian Cherries.</p>
                        <p>For coſtiveneſs he adviſes to put a feather anointed with oyl into the Fundament once or twice a day for two days, giving them alſo the ſame days juyce of Beet.</p>
                        <p>For the Gout: Waſhing the Legs and Feet twice a day for four or five days with a decoction of the root of white Hellebore in common water, as hot as the Bird can endure it; and for want thereof bathing it with Brandy Wine, or Aqua Vitae.</p>
                        <p>To ſtir up and quicken birds to ſing, give them ſomewhat that they are moſt greedy of, and moſt delighted in, or ſomething that is heating. Some uſe to give them Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed mingled with Pine-kernels pounded; putting in their drinking Cup two or three Chives of Saffron, encompaſſing their Cages with ſome pleaſing verdure, as of</p>
                        <p>Birds fed with Paſte are wont to have their drinking Cup ſet without their Cages; Seed-birds within. Keep their Cages neat, and in the bottom put in Winter-time hay or ſtraw broken, in Summer-time ſand.

                           <head>§. II. <hi>The common Skie-Lark.</hi> Alauda vulgaris.</head>
                           <p>IT is not much bigger than a <hi>Houſe-Sparrow,</hi> yet longer bodied; of an ounce and half weight: from the tip of the Bill to the Claws or Tail-end, (for they are equally extended) ſix inches and a quarter. The ends of the great feathers in the Wings ſtretched out were ten inches and a quarter diſtant. The Bill, meaſuring from the tip to the angles of the Mouth, was three quarters of an inch long: The upper Mandible black or horn-coloured, the lower commonly whitiſh. The Tongue broad, cloven, hard: The Noſthrils round. It ſometimes ruffles up the feathers of its head, almoſt in faſhion of a Creſt. A cinereous Ring or Crown compaſſes the hind part of the Head from Eye to Eye, but more ſordid, and leſs conſpicuous than in the <hi>Wood-Lark.</hi> The Head is of a teſtaceous or reddiſh aſh-colour, the middle parts of the feathers being black. The Back is of the ſame colour with the Head: The Chin whitiſh: The Throat yellow, with brown ſpots: The ſides of a reddiſh yellow. Each Wing hath eighteen quil-feathers. Of theſe all betwixt the ſixth and ſeventeenth have blunt, indented, white tips. The edges of the four or five outmoſt are white, of thoſe next the body cinereous, of the reſt reddiſh.</p>
                           <p>The Tail is three inches long, conſiſting of twelve feathers, of which the outmoſt on each ſide hath both its upper half, and alſo the exteriour Vane of the lower white: The next to this hath only its outer Web white, the inner being black: The three following on each ſide are black. The two middlemoſt are ſharp-pointed; of which that that lies undermoſt when the Tail is ſhut hath aſh-coloured edges: That which covers it lying uppermoſt, towards the tip is cinereous, toward the bottom blackiſh. The Feet and Legs are dusky: The Claws black, with white tips. The outer toe grows to the middle below as in other ſmall birds.</p>
                           <p>The Liver is divided into two Lobes, the left much leſs than the right, that there may be room for the Gizzard, which in this bird is fleſhy, and great for the bigneſs of the bird. The fleſh is very ſweet and delicate. In mild Winters it feeds wondrous
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:63869:109"/>
fat: And there are then taken an innumerable number with us in <hi>England</hi> for the furniſhing and adorning of our Tables, as <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> truly writes. It builds upon the ground, and lays four or five Eggs at once: A late Writer ſaith three or four, and that to his knowledge he never found five in all his life.</p>
                           <p>This Bird builds (ſaith <hi>Olina)</hi> in plain, open ground, under ſome clod of Earth; others ſay in Corn, or thick high graſs in Meadows: And though in Winter we ſee great flocks of them, yet we find the feweſt of their Neſts of any birds that are ſo plentiful. He makes his Neſt of dried herbs and ſtrings, and breeds thrice a year, in <hi>May, July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> rearing his young very ſuddenly: So that if you have a Neſt, you muſt take them as ſoon as they are ſpoon-feathered, or elſe you run the <hi>riſco</hi> of loſing them, for they will get them gone of a ſudden. This bird breeds much later than the <hi>Wood-Lark,</hi> by almoſt two months, for ſhe ſeldom hath young ones before the middle of <hi>May.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Young Neſtlings may be brought up almoſt with any meat, but if you give them ſheeps Heart and Egg chopt together, till they are about three weeks old, it will not be amiſs: And when they come to eat alone, give them Oatmeal, Hemp-ſeed and bread, mixed together with a little Egg. <hi>Olina</hi> ſaith, to ſave charges, you may feed them with Wheat, Oats, and Millet. Theſe birds that are ſo young may be brought up to any thing, one bird learning another birds Song. You muſt always obſerve to give them ſand at the bottom of the Cage, and let them have a new Turf every week placed in a diſh of water in their Cage, (which muſt be as large as two of the <hi>Wood-Larks</hi> Cage.) They need have no Pearches in their Cages.</p>
                           <p>The Cock may be known from the Hen, according to <hi>Olina,</hi> by having his heel ſo long that it reaches beyond his knee; and having two black ſpots on his Neck, one on each ſide, ſomewhat in faſhion of a Ring or Collar; his breaſt darker, and more ſpeckled with black, and a groſſer body. My Engliſh Author ſaith, that thoſe you intend to keep for ſinging were beſt be taken in <hi>October</hi> or <hi>November,</hi> and then they will ſing a little after <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> and adviſes to chuſe the ſtreighteſt, largeſt, and loftieſt bird, and he that hath moſt white in his Tail, for theſe (ſaith he) are the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al marks for a Cock. If you find him very wild and buckiſh, tie his Wings for two or three weeks, till he is become both acquainted and tame alſo, and then when you perceive him pretty orderly, untie his Wings, ſtill letting him hang in the ſame place he did. You muſt feed this old bird with Hemp-ſeed, Bread, and a few white Oats, for he takes great delight to husk the Oats: And when he begins to ſing, once in a week you may give him a hard Egg, or ſhred him a little boyled Mutton, or Veal, or Sheeps heart. You muſt obſerve in this bird, as in all others, that you give it no ſalt meat, nor bread that is any thing ſalt.</p>

                           <head>§. III. <hi>The Woodlark, called at</hi> Rome, Tottovilla.</head>
                           <p>THe Cock we made trial in weighed an ounce and a quarter: Its length from Bill to Tail was ſix inches and an half: The diſtance between the ends of the Wings ſpread twelve inches and an half.</p>
                           <p>It is leſſer than the common <hi>Lark,</hi> and ſhorter bodied. Its Bill, as in the reſt of this kind, ſtreight, ſlender, ſharp-pointed, above half an inch long, ſomewhat flat, of a dusky colour: Its Tongue broad, cloven: The <hi>Irides</hi> of its Eyes hazel-coloured: Its Noſthrils round. Its Feet of a pale yellow, inclining to fleſh colour: Its Claws dusky; that of the back-toe longeſt. The outmoſt fore-toe ſticks to the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low near the divarication.</p>
                           <p>The Breaſt and Belly are of a pale whitiſh yellow; the Throat deeper coloured; both ſpotted with black in the middle parts of the feathers. The Head and Back are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoloured of black and reddiſh yellow, the middle of each feather being ſpotted with black. The Neck is aſh-coloured. A white line encompaſſeth the Head from Eye to Eye like a Crown, or Wreath. The Rump is of a yellowiſh red or tawny.</p>
                           <p>Each Wing hath eighteen prime feathers; the outmoſt being much ſhorter than the reſt. The next five are half an inch longer than the reſt, having their points ſharp, and their outer edges white: The reſt have blunt points, indented as it were in the middle, having yellow edges. The feathers of the baſtard wing are dusky with clay-coloured tips, and at its root is a white ſpot. The ſmall feathers on the ridge of the Wing are aſh-coloured. The Tail was two inches long, conſiſting of the uſual
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:63869:109"/>
number of feathers, <hi>viz.</hi> twelve, not forked; yet the middle feathers were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhorter than the reſt, and ended in ſharp points, being between green and a ſordid red or fulvous colour. The four next on each ſide had blunt points, were whitiſh at tips, the outmoſt moſt, the reſt in order leſs, elſe blackiſh.</p>
                           <p>It hath no Craw: In the Stomach we found Beetles, Caterpillars, Gromil-ſeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſtomach was provided with ſtrong and thick muſcles. The blind Guts in this kind, as in all other ſmall birds, that we have obſerved, are very ſhort: The Gut be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe appendants is larger.</p>
                           <p>Theſe birds fly many together in company, ſinging as they fly with a note not much unlike a <hi>Blackbirds.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is diſtinguiſhed from the common <hi>Lark,</hi> by the following marks eſpecially: 1. Whiſtling like a <hi>Blackbird.</hi> 2. A Circle of white feathers encompaſſing the Head from Eye to Eye like a Crown or Wreath. 3. The firſt or outmoſt feather of the Wing being much ſhorter than the ſecond, whereas in the common <hi>Lark</hi> it is near equal. 4. The outmoſt feathers of the Tail having white tips. 5. That it ſits upon trees. 6. It is leſſer than the common <hi>Lark,</hi> but hath a ſhorter, and thicker, or roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der body for its bigneſs.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> makes no mention of this bird that I know of. <hi>Olina</hi> figures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it in his <hi>Uccelleria</hi> under the title of <hi>Tottovilla.</hi>

                           <p>The <hi>Woodlark</hi> is comparable to the <hi>Nightingale</hi> for ſinging, and by ſome preferred before it. He will alſo emulate the <hi>Nightingale,</hi> and hath great variety of notes.</p>
                           <p>It is a very tender bird, and yet breeds the ſooneſt of any in <hi>England.</hi> My Author ſaith, that he hath had a Neſt of young birds ready to fly by the ſixteenth of <hi>March:</hi> That it builds moſt commonly in lays, where the graſs hath been pretty rank, and is grown ruſſet, under ſome large Turf, to ſhelter its Neſt from the wind and weather. He could never bring up a neſt of young ones, becauſe they either had the cramp, or fell into a ſcouring in leſs than a weeks time after he had taken them: Nor could he ever hear of any who had kept them ſo long as till they ſung. So that they are never bred from the Neſt.</p>

                              <head>The Seaſons of taking Woodlarks, and which beſt to keep.</head>
                              <p>There are three ſeaſons of taking <hi>Woodlarks;</hi> 1. The firſt is in <hi>June, July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when the Branchers are taken, having not yet moulted. Theſe birds ſing preſently, but continue their ſinging but little, for they ſoon fall a moulting. They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very familiar birds as being taken young.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The next ſeaſon for taking them is in the latter end of <hi>September,</hi> which my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor calls the general flight-time, when they rove from one Country to another. By this time they have all moulted their feathers, and you can hardly diſtinguiſh a young bird from an old. The birds taken at this ſeaſon are brave, ſtrong, and ſprightful; and prove well at Spring if they be well kept all Winter; otherwiſe they will be lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and quite ſpoiled. They uſually begin not to ſing till after Spring, and continue till <hi>July.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="3">3. The third ſeaſon is from the beginning of <hi>January</hi> to the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> when they are paired, and have parted with their laſt years Brood. Theſe ſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three or four days, or a week at furtheſt, (if they be well conditioned birds) and will ſoon become tame. For your fearful, wild, buckiſh birds ſeldom prove good: For upon every turn they bolt againſt the ſides of the Cage, and bruiſe themſelves, and ſo are apt to leave off ſinging. Therefore if you have a bird that is a good bird and wild, have a Net knit <hi>French</hi> Meaſh, and put it in the inſide of the Cage, ſowing it cloſe to the ſides and ſtrait, that when he bolts or flirts he may take no harm. Birds taken at this ſeaſon for the moſt part prove the beſt, they being in full ſtomach, and ſinging in a very ſhort time after, and being alſo more perfect in their ſong than thoſe taken at other ſeaſons.</p>

                              <head>How to order a Woodlark when taken.</head>
                              <p>In the firſt place you muſt have a Cage with two pans; one for mixt meat, and another for Oatmeal and whole Hemp-ſeed. Firſt, boil an Egg hard: Then take the crum of a half-peny white-loaf, and as much Hemp-ſeed as the bread: Chop your Egg very ſmall, and crumble your bread and it together: Then bruiſe your Hemp-ſeed very ſmall with a rolling pin, or pound it in a Mortar, mingle all together and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:63869:110"/>
give it him. 2. You muſt put red gravel ſifted fine at the bottom of his Cage; for he delights to bask himſelf in the ſand, which if he doth not pretty often he proves louſie, and then ſeldom comes to any thing: If you leave gravel-ſtones in the ſand, he will be apt to break his feathers in basking him. Shift this ſand twice a week, otherwiſe he will be ſubject to clog his feet with his dung. 3. Be ſure that his meat be not too ſtale, for he will never thrive upon it when dry or mouldy. 4. Have a great care to ſhift his water oft [thrice a week at leaſt] for it ſtinks ſooner than any birds water; becauſe throwing about his meat ſome falls into it, which cauſes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to ſtink. 5. Line your Pearch in the Cage with ſome green bays, or elſe make a Pearch of a Mat; which I have found them very much to delight in.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Note</hi> 1. If your bird be very wild when he is taken, keep him three or four days from company, till he begins to eat his meat. Strew ſome of the Hemp-ſeed and Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal upon the ſand, and ſome of his mixt meat alſo, becauſe ſometimes they find not the Pan till they be almoſt famiſhed.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Note</hi> 2. If he be very poor, at the beginning of the Spring give him every two or three days a turf of three-leaved graſs, and boil him a ſheeps heart, and mince it ſmall, and mingle it with his meat, and it will cauſe him to thrive exceedingly.</p>

                              <p>The ſureſt way to know a Cock from a Hen is, 1. The largeneſs and length of his call. 2. The tall walking of the bird about the Cage. 3. At Evenings the doubling of his note, which we call <hi>Cudling,</hi> as if he were going to rooſt: But if you hear him ſing ſtrong you cannot be deceived, for Hen-birds will ſing but little. The uſe of this is chiefly to know thoſe birds that are taken at flight-time; becauſe thoſe taken at other ſeaſons ſing ſoon after they are taken, or not at all.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>IT ſeemed to us leſs by half than the common <hi>Lark,</hi> weighing ſcarce an ounce; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a long body, and a ſmall head: A ſlender ſharp Bill of half an inch long, the upper Mandible black, more flat and depreſſed toward the Head: The tip of the Tongue is jagged, the Circle about the Pupil hazel-coloured. The colour on the top of the Head, Shoulders, and middle of the Back various, of a yellowiſh green and black; the middle parts of the feathers being black, the outſides or edges of a yellowiſhgreen. The lower part of the Back or Rump is only green without any mixture of black. The upper ſide is of the fore-mentioned various colour, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle colours being leſs conſpicuous by reaſon of a ſmall mixture of cinereous. As for the underſide of the body, the Breaſt and ſides under the Wings were of a ſordid yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh white, ſpotted with black, the lower belly and Throat under the Chin white, without any black ſpots.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="207" facs="tcp:63869:110"/>
The quil-feathers of the Wings were dusky, their exteriour edges being of a yellowiſh green. The middle feathers of the firſt row of coverts have their tips and exteriour edges white; and the middlemoſt of the ſecond row theirs ſtill of a lighter white. The reſt of the covert-feathers of the Wings are almoſt of the ſame colour with the ſcapular feathers. I ſuppoſe it is peculiar to this kind to have the four firſt quill-feathersequal.</p>
                           <p>The Tail is made up of twelve feathers, the two outmoſt of which on each ſide, are particoloured of white and brown: In the outmoſt feather about the one half, and that the uppermoſt, is white, the white dividing the feather obliquely. Of the next feather the tip only is white: The reſt of the feathers are of a dark brown, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their exteriour edges of a yellowiſh green. Of the two middlemoſt the edges round about are of the ſame yellowiſh green, not ſo even and trim as thoſe of the other feathers, but as it were jagged or fringed. The Tail, when folded up, is a little forked, near three inches long.</p>
                           <p>The Feet are yellow: The Claw of the back-toe, as in the reſt of this kind very long and dusky. The Gizzard not ſo muſculous as in other <hi>Larks,</hi> wherein we found Beetles and Inſects like to meal-worms. The blind Guts are ſomething longer than in the common <hi>Lark.</hi> It hath alſo a Gall-bladder.</p>
                           <p>This bird ſits alſo upon trees. In general it is leſs than the common <hi>Lark,</hi> greener, and not ſo finely coloured: In length from the point of the Bill to the end of the Claws or Tail (for they are equally extended) ſix inches: In breadth between the tips of the Wings ſpread out ten and a quarter.</p>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Jeſſop</hi> ſuſpects that there is yet another different ſort of this bird, which may be called the <hi>leſſer field-Lark</hi> which is 1. A little bigger than that here deſcribed; 2. Leſs <note place="margin">The leſſer field-Lark.</note> green; 3. Having paler Feet; And 4. much ſhorter Spurs.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Titlarks</hi> Neſt I once ſaw in a <hi>Furze-buſh</hi> not far from the ground: It was built outwardly of Moſs, inwardly of ſtraw, with a little horſe-hair. She lays five or ſix Eggs.</p>
                           <p>In this kind the Cock is all over more yellow than the Hen, but eſpecially under the Throat, on the Breaſt, Legs, and ſoals of the Feet.</p>
                           <p>
                              <q>The <hi>Titlark</hi> (ſaith a late Engliſh Writer) ſings moſt like the <hi>Canary bird</hi> of any bird whatſoever; whisking, curring, and chewing: But his Song is ſhort, and hath no variety in it: He comes with the <hi>Nightingale</hi> about the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and goes about the beginning of <hi>September.</hi> The Young are to be fed, when firſt taken, after the ſame manner as the <hi>Nightingale:</hi> The old one (if taken) in like manner to be at firſt cram'd: When he will feed himſelf give him <hi>Woodlarks</hi> meat, or almoſt any other. Before his going away he is apt to grow fat like the <hi>Nightingale,</hi> but will eat though never ſo fat. He is a hardy bird, and long-lived, if preſerved with care, not ſubject to colds or cramps.</q>

                           <p>THis bird <hi>Olina</hi> deſcribes in this manner.

                           <p>This bird ſeems to be the ſame with our <hi>Bunting</hi> hereafter to be deſcribed. The figure of the Bill in <hi>Olina</hi>'s Cut doth not agree to the <hi>Bunting,</hi> indeed anſwers not to his own deſcription; it being drawn as ſlender and long as a <hi>Thruſhes,</hi> whereas he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it thicker and ſhorter. <hi>Bellonius</hi> his deſcription of the <hi>Calandra</hi> agrees well enough to the <hi>Bunting;</hi> although he alſo deſcribes the <hi>Bunting</hi> elſewhere, under the title of <hi>Cenchramus.</hi> Howbeit, that we may leave the Reader to the liberty of his judgment concerning theſe matters, we ſhall ſubjoyn <hi>Bellonius</hi> his deſcription of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landra. Calandra</hi> (ſaith he) is a ſort of <hi>Lark;</hi> which who ſo deſires to know, let him fancy a creſted <hi>Lark</hi> approaching to the bigneſs of a <hi>Starling.</hi> Wherefore he that ſhall call it a great <hi>Lark,</hi> may well ſeem not unfitly to denominate it. For both its voice, though higher, is altogether like the voice of a <hi>Lark,</hi> and alſo the colour of its feathers the ſame, its Head the ſame, its Wings the ſame, its Tail the ſame, and likewiſe its conditions the ſame: Its Legs, Feet, and Toes altogether alike, and in theſe the Spur or back-claw long, as in <hi>Larks.</hi> The Neck ſlender where it is joyned to the Head, as we obſerved alſo in the <hi>Peacock,</hi> and which is likewiſe common to <hi>Quails.</hi> But becauſe it differs not from a common <hi>Lark</hi> ſave in bigneſs, and the creſted <hi>Lark,</hi> as we ſaid, is bigger than the common, and hath a tuft on his Head, which both the common <hi>Lark</hi> and the <hi>Calandra</hi> want; I can eaſily allow this ſort of bird to be called a <hi>Lark,</hi> and to be comprehended under the <hi>Genus</hi> of <hi>Larks.</hi> The <hi>Calandra</hi> exceeds the reſt of this kind in bigneſs, and therefore ſtands in need of a thicker Bill, that it might break the harder ſorts of grains upon which it feeds, though thoſe that are kept ſhut up in Cages are wont to be fed with Oats and crums of white bread. Thus far <hi>Bellonius.</hi>

                           <p>IT is bigger than the common <hi>Lark,</hi> hath a greater and longer Bill, almoſt an inch long, meaſuring from the point to the corner of the mouth: The upper Chap dusky, the lower whitiſh. The Tongue is broad, ſomewhat cloven; the <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes of a cinereous hazel colour.

                           <p>The prime feathers of the Wings are in number eighteen, beſides the outmoſt very ſhort and ſmall one. The outer Vane of the firſt Pinion feather is of a dirty white, inclining to red or yellow: The reſt are not ſo black as in the common <hi>Lark,</hi> and have ſome mixture of a pale red, even in their lower part. The Breaſt and Belly are white, with a daſh of yellow: The Throat ſpotted, as in the common <hi>Lark:</hi> The Tail is 2⅛ inches long, compoſed of twelve feathers; the two outmoſt whereof on each ſide have their exteriour borders white, with a daſh of red, being elſe black; the third and fourth are wholly black; the fifth and ſixth of the ſame colour with the body. The Gall from green inclines to a dark blue. [I ſuppoſe this is accidental, and that the colour of the Gall varies in divers birds.] The blind Guts are very ſhort.</p>

The whole Tail is ſcarcean inch long, and narrow, being made up of very narrow feathers. Its Legs and Feet are ſufficiently large, and of a fleſh colour or reddiſh white. In the Feet this is worthy the obſervation, that the back-toe is very long, and hath a Claw of equal length, ſo that both together make up an inch. This Claw is not, as in other birds for the moſt part, crooked from its riſe, but firſt ſtreight for a good way, and toward the tip moderately hooked. The Claws alſo are whitiſh.</p>

                           <p>Concerning its manners, place, neſt, breeding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we have nothing further to add.

                              <p>The firſt <hi>Spipola,</hi> which is greater than the reſt in this kind, hath an aſh-coloured Head: Under the Bill a white ſpot in place of a beard.

Its Wings particoloured of white, black and red: its Legs and Feet yellow; its Claws black: Its Bill long, ſlender, and dusky coloured.

                              <p>There is a certain other ſmall bird caught in our fields, which the Fowlers call <hi>Griſola,</hi> perchance from its grey or hoary colour, although it be not grey, but of a dusky aſh-colour: Or perchance becauſe it cries much, keeping alone; for we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſe the word <hi>gridare,</hi> to ſignifie lamenting.

This bird is the Springs Herald, being not ſeen throughout all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> in Winter-time: Whence that Greek Proverb, common to almoſt all Languages, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </p>
                        <p>We have obſerved four ſorts of <hi>Swallows</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and not more elſewhere. Thoſe are, 1. The common or <hi>Houſe-Swallow:</hi> 2. The <hi>Martin,</hi> or <hi>Martinet,</hi> or <hi>Martlet:</hi> 3. The <hi>Sand-Martin</hi> or <hi>Shore-bird:</hi> 4. The <hi>black Martin</hi> or <hi>Swift.</hi> Of this laſt we have ſeen a ſort painted with the whole Belly white. And <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> affirms, that he hath ſeen one of this kind as big as a <hi>Buzzard:</hi> No way differing in ſhape from the common one, ſave in the Legs and Talons, and hookedneſs of the Beak, all fitted for prey.</p>
                        <p>As for the Phyſical vertues and faculties of <hi>Swallows</hi> and their parts, <hi>Schroder</hi> hath thus briefly ſummed them up.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Swallows <hi>entire</hi> are a ſpecific remedy for the Falling ſickneſs, dimneſs of ſight, blear eyes, <hi>(their aſhes mingled with honey and ſo applied)</hi> they cure alſo the Squinancy, and inflammation of the <note n="*" place="margin">Pin of the Mouth.</note> 
                           <hi>Uvula, (being eaten, or their aſhes taken inwardly.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. A Swallows <hi>heart</hi> is alſo ſaid to be good for the Falling ſickneſs, and to ſtrengthen the memory. Some eat it againſt the Quartan Ague.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Some will have the <hi>bloud</hi> to be a ſpecific for the Eyes: And they prefer that which is drawn from under the left Wing.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There is a <hi>Stone</hi> found ſometimes (though ſeldom) in the ſtomach of ſome of the young Swallows, called <hi>Chelidonius,</hi> of the bigneſs of a Lentile or Peaſe. This they will have to help the Falling ſickneſs in Children <hi>(bound to the arm, or hung about the neck.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Note.</hi> They report this ſtone to be found eſpecially in the increaſe of the Moon, and in the firſt hatch'd yong one. Others take it out in <hi>Auguſt</hi> about the Full of the Moon.</p>

5. The <hi>Neſt,</hi> outwardly applied gives relief in the Squinancy: Heals the redneſs of the Eyes, and is good for the biting of an Adder, or Viper.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The <hi>Dung</hi> heats very much, diſcuſſes, and is acrimonious. Its chief uſe is againſt the bitings of a mad dog, taken outwardly and inwardly; in Colic and Nephritic pains taken inwardly, put up it provokes excretion. <hi>Schrod.</hi>

                           <p>THe Female weighed ſcarce an ounce: From the Bill to the end of the Tail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeven inches long, and meaſuring from tip to tip of the Wings extended, twelve and an half broad. Its Bill was ſhort, black, flat, and depreſſed, very broad at the Head, but ſharp-pointed; black alſo on the inſide: But the Tongue and roof of the mouth yellow. The aperture of the mouth gaping very wide, for the conveniency of catching Flies and Gnats as ſhe flies. The Tongue ſhort, broad, and cloven: The Eyes great, and furniſhed with nictating membranes: The <hi>Irides</hi> hazel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured. The Feet ſhort and black; the outmoſt toe growing to the middlemoſt at bottom.</p>
                           <p>The Head, Neck, Back, and Rump are of a very lovely ſhining, but dark purpliſh blue colour. As well above as underneath the Bill, that is to ſay, in the Forehead and under the chin, is a deep ſanguine ſpot: But that underneath is much the bigger. The Throat is of the ſame colour with the Neck. The Breaſt and belly white, with a daſh of red; as are alſo the interiour covert-feathers of the Wings. The Tail is forked conſiſting of twelve feathers; the outmoſt of which are an inch longer than the next, and end in ſharp points: Of the reſt the interiour are alſo ſhorter in order than the exteriour, but the difference much leſs. All theſe feathers of the Tail, except the two middlemoſt, are black, and each adorned with a white ſpot: Which ſpots croſs the Tail in a ſtreight line. [The two middlemoſt want the white ſpot.] The Wings have eighteen quill-feathers, alike black: But all the covert feathers are of a deep ſhining blue.</p>
                           <p>In the Stomach of an old bird we found Beetles; in the ſtomachs of the young ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmall, pellucid, unequal ſtones, tinctured with a fair Claret colour; not far from the Eggs ſmall worms ſpirally rolled up, of three inches length. Theſe birds build in Chimneys. About the end of <hi>September</hi> we ſaw great numbers of them to be ſold in the Market at <hi>Valentia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> when we travelled through that Country, <hi>Anno</hi> 1664.</p>
                           <p>What becomes of <hi>Swallows</hi> in Winter time, whether they fly into other Countries, or lie torpid in hollow trees, and the like places, neither are natural Hiſtorians agreed, nor indeed can we certainly determine. To us it ſeems more probable that they fly away into hot Countries, <hi>viz. Egypt, Aethiopia,</hi> &amp;c. then that either they lurk in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low trees, or holes of Rocks and ancient buildings, or lie in water under the Ice in Northern Countries, as <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> reports. For as <hi>Herodotus</hi> witneſſeth, they abide all the year in <hi>Egypt,</hi> underſtand it of thoſe that are bred there (ſaith <hi>Aldrovan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus)</hi> for thoſe that are bred with us only fly thither to winter. I am aſſured of my own knowledge (ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr)</hi> that <hi>Swallows, Kites,</hi> and other Fowl fly over Sea out of <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Alexandria</hi> to winter.</p>

Swallows ſometimes vary in colour, as do alſo many other birds; I have (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus)</hi> often ſeen <hi>Houſe Swallows</hi> all over white. If any one deſires to have white <hi>Swallows,</hi> let him anoint their Eggs while they ſit, with oyl-olive, <hi>Aldrov.</hi>

                           <p>THis being meaſured from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail was ſix inches long: The Wings being ſpread ten inches and an half broad. Its Head flat; Its Bill alſo very much depreſſed and flat, as in the <hi>Houſe-Swallow;</hi> at its inſertion into the Head ⅜ of an inch broad, but ſharp at the point: From the tip to the angles of the Mouth but half an inch long; the upper Chap ſomewhat longer than the nether. The Mouth is yellow withinſide: The Tongue cloven. The Circles encompaſſing the Pupils of the Eyes of a havel-colour. The Feet ſmall, and Legs ſhort. The ſoal of the foot bare; in which appear the bottoms of the exteriour Toes joyned by a membrane. The Claws are white: The Feet to the very Claws covered with a white Down: By which note it is eaſily diſtinguiſhable from all its fellows of the <hi>Swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                              </hi>kind.</p>
                           <p>Its Head, Neck, Back, Tail and Wings are of the ſame colour with the <hi>Houſe-Swallows,</hi> but ſadder, and not ſo gloſſie: Its Rump, Breaſt, and Belly milk-white. Under the Chin the white is ſomewhat more ſullen or obſcure. Each Wing hath eighteen maſter-feathers: From the tenth the ſix or ſeven following have their tips broad and indented. The tips of the <note n="*" place="margin">That is, thoſe next the body.</note> interiour quil-feathers are white. The Tail is leſs forked than in the <hi>Houſe-Swallow.</hi> The feathers from the middle on each ſide are longer in order, the exteriour than the interiour, almoſt by an equal exceſs; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than in the <hi>Houſe-Swallow,</hi> the outmoſt feathers of whoſe Tail (as we ſaid before) exceed the next three times as much as they do the following, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The length of the outmoſt feathers is two inches and an half, of the middlemoſt one and three quarters.</p>
                           <p>In the ſtomachs of the Young of this kind we found no ſtones, but many Flies and Beetles. This bird builds a round Neſt like the <hi>Houſe-Swallow,</hi> and alſo of like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet not in Chimneys, but in Windows, under Eves of Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It differs moreover, in that the <hi>Houſe-Swallows</hi> Neſt is like thoſe of other birds, ſemicircular, and all open above; but its Neſt is covered above, a round hole only being left open in the ſide, by which the old one goes in and out.</p>

Its Bill is ſmall, ſharp, flat, black, as in the reſt of this kind, from the point to the angles of the Mouth half an inch long: Its Tongue cloven: Its Eyes great; its Feet dusky.

                           <p>Its Head, Neck, and Back are of a dark dun, or Mouſe colour: Its Chin, Breaſt, and Belly white.

The number of feathers in Wings and Tail is the ſame as in other <hi>Swallows.</hi> But the quil-feathers of the Wings are blacker than the feathers on the back; from the tenth to the laſt all of equal length; the ſix next to the tenth have their tips indented.

                           <head>§. IV. <hi>The black Martin or Swift.</hi> Hirundo apus.</head>
                           <p>THis is the biggeſt of all <hi>Swallows</hi> we have hitherto ſeen. It hath a great Head, a huge wide mouth; but a very ſmall, black Bill, (wherein it agrees with the <note n="*" place="margin">Caprimulgus.</note> Churn-Owl) towards the Noſthrils broad and depreſſed. Its Tongue is broad, and ſomewhat cloven: Its Noſthrils long, placed obliquely, obtuſe toward the Head, acute toward the point of the Bill: Its Eyes great, and their <hi>Irides</hi> of a hazel colour.</p>
                           <p>It hath almoſt no variety or difference of colour in the whole body: For as well the upper as the lower ſide, and alſo the Wings and Tail are black, with an obſcure tincture of green, or red: Only under the Chin is a notable ſpot of white or aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour.</p>
                           <p>It hath in each Wing eighteen quil-feathers, all ending in ſharp points, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the exteriour ones. The Tail is about an hand-breadth long, conſiſting of but ten feathers, from the middle to the outmoſt in order one longer than another, ending all in ſharp points.</p>
                           <p>Its Legs are very ſhort, but thick: Its Feet very ſmall. All its Toes ſtand for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for the leaſt, which in others is wont to ſtand backward, is in this placed the ſame way with the reſt. The leaſt Toe hath, as in other birds, one bone: The other three, contrary to the manner of all other that we know beſides it, have all an equal number of bones or joynts, <hi>viz.</hi> only two, the one very ſhort, the other longer. The Toes alſo are all divided from the very riſe.</p>
                           <p>The Gall-bladder is little. The Stomach not very fleſhy, out of which diſlected we took Beetles and other Inſects.</p>
                           <p>They ſay, that by reaſon of the length of its Wings, and ſhortneſs of its Legs, if it happens to alight or fall upon the ground, it cannot raiſe it ſelf up again, but may eaſily be caught. Wherefore it doth either always fly, or ſit upon the tops of Churches, Towers, or other ancient buildings.</p>
                           <p>Its weight was three quarters of an ounce: Its length from the tip of the Bill to the Claws five inches, to the end of the Tail ſeven and a quarter. The diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the tips of the wings extended ſixteen inches and an half.</p>
                           <p>Of this kind we have ſeen the Picture of one having its whole nether part, Throat, Breaſt, and Belly, white: And, as we ſaid before, <hi>Scaliger</hi> mentions one of the bigneſs of a <hi>Buzzard.</hi>

                        <p>The upper ſide of the body is particoloured of black and dirty-red, the middle parts of each feather about the ſhaft being black, the outſides or edges red. Theſe colours are ſo dull and ſullen, that the bird notwithſtanding, look'd on at a diſtance, appears but of a brown or dirty colour. The Head and Back ſhew ſomething of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereous, the middle ſpots being darker. The Rump is greeniſh, and void of ſpots. The prime feathers of the Wings dusky, with reddiſh edges. The interiour of the ſecond row of Wing-feathers have whitiſh tips: The leſler covert-feathers of the Wings are of the ſame colour with thoſe on the body. This hath that extreme ſhort feather in each Wing, which ſome birds want. The Tail is about two inches long, made up of twelve feathers, all dusky, without any variety of colours. The nether part of the body is cinercous, yet the lower belly whitiſh, but in ſome birds darker, and of a lead-colour. The Legs and Feet are of a yellowiſh fleſh-colour; the Claws dusky; the hind-claw greater and longer than any of the reſt.

                        <p>The Cock had large Teſticles: The blind Guts ſeemed to us in this to be more round and tumid than in other ſmall birds. The ſtomach was not very fleſhy. It builds in hedges, and lays commonly five Eggs; is fooliſh bird, and eaſily taken. Its Eggs are of a fine pale blue or Sea-green colour.</p>

A late Engliſh Writer ſaith, that they are a very pleaſant Song-bird, ſinging early in the Spring, and having great variety of notes: Old or young become tame very ſwiftly, and will ſing in a ſhort ſpace after they are taken, if you take them in the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> or beginning of <hi>February.</hi>

                        <p>Its weight was three quarters of an Ounce: Its meaſures were from the Bill to the Claws ſix inches; to the Tail end ſeven; from Tip to tip of the Wings ſpread eight and an half.

                        <p>In the Neſt of this bird the <hi>Cuckow</hi> is ſaid to lay her Egg, which the fooliſh bird ſits upon, hatches, and brings up the young one till it be fledg'd, and can ſhift for it ſelf: Whence the word <hi>Curruca</hi> ſignifies as much in <hi>Latine</hi> as <hi>Cuckold</hi> with us in <hi>Engliſh, i. e.</hi> one that brings up another mans Child for his own. I ſuppoſe our word <hi>Cuckold</hi> came from <hi>Cuckow,</hi> but a man abuſed in that manner is very improperly ſo called, he that abuſes him being indeed the <hi>Cuckow,</hi> that lays an Egg in his Neſt.

The greater Wing-feathers are black; the Tail of a ſpadiceous, but paler than the Back. The Legs and Feet yellow, the Claws black. Some of our Fowlers call it <hi>Magnanina,</hi> as much to ſay, as a Smith or Carpenter-bird, perchance becauſe it makes a loud knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſnapping with its Bill as it catches flies: Other call it, <hi>Paſſere matto,</hi> that is a fooliſh Sparrow, perhaps from its colour, which approaches to ſpadiceous, or rather becauſe it eaſily yields it ſelf to be taken.</p>

                        <p>THis is a very ſmall bird, ſcarce ſo big as the common <hi>Linnet,</hi> ſhort bodied. The colour of its Head, Neck, Back, Wings, and Tail from aſh-colour inclines to green, in ſome dusky, with a Tincture of green. It hath the ſame number of Wing and Tail-feathers with all other ſmall birds. But the quills of the Wing are of a Mouſe-dun, with black ſhafts, and green edges. The leſſer rows of feathers that cover the underſide of the Wings are yellow. The Tail is about two inches long, not forked, and all its feathers of a dusky colour.</p>

                        <p>This bird is not remarkable for any variety of colours, ſo that it is very hard ſo to deſcribe it, as by certain and characteriſtic notes to diſtinguiſh it from all others.</p>

                        <p>FOr bigneſs and colour it is very like to a <hi>Hen-Sparrow,</hi> but of a longer and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer body. The Head, Neck, Back, and generally the whole upper ſide is of a dark cinereous or Mouſe-dun: Yet the Wings and Tail darker than the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Back: And on the top of the Head, to one who heedfully views it, appear certain black ſpots. All the nether ſide is white: But the ſhafts of the feathers in the Breaſt are black, and the Throat and Sides ſomewhat red. The Tail is two inches and a quarter long, all dusky, as are alſo the greater quil-feathers of the Wings, for the edges of the interiour are of a yellowiſh white. The outmoſt feather of the Wing is very ſhort and little. [In ſome birds of this kind the tips of the interiour fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the ſecond row, as alſo of the baſtard-wing feathers are of a yellowiſh white.]</p>
                        <p>The Bill is ſtreight, black, broad, and depreſſed, or flat near the Head. The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Chap riſes up in an angle or ridge all along the middle, (whence the Bill ſeems to be triangular) and is a little longer than the nether, and ſharp-pointed. The mouth gapes wide; and is yellow withinſide. The Tongue cloven with a deep inciſion, rough on the ſides. The Legs ſhort and black: The Feet alſo ſmall and ſhort. The outer toe below ſticks faſt to the middle one, as in the reſt of this kind.</p>
                        <p>The Gall is yellow: The Teſticles ſmall and black. In the Gizzard we found Bees, Flies, and other Inſects. In ſummer-time it frequents gardens with us in <hi>England.</hi> In the young birds of this kind the Back is ſpotted with black and white.</p>
                        <p>This bird differs from the <hi>White-throat,</hi> in that its Tail is all of one colour; from the <hi>Beccafigo</hi> in the colour of its body, being of a dusky cinereous or Mouſe-dun, whereas that is paler coloured, and tinctured with green; from both, in magnitude and in the figure of its Bill, which (as we ſaid before) is broad, depreſſed, and triangular.</p>

                           <hi>Curruca,</hi> lives in woods, and feeds chiefly upon flies, whence alſo it is called * <hi>Moucherolle (Mouche</hi> in <hi>French</hi> ſignifying a fly.) It is ſo like a <hi>Sparrow,</hi> that unleſs by its conditions while it is living, and its Bill when dead, it can hardly be diſtinguiſhed from it. It hath ſtrong legs and feet: The feet alſo black. The Bill is ſlender and oblong, like a <hi>Robin-red-breaſts:</hi> The Tail alſo long. In brief it is in all points like to the ſmall <hi>Field-Sparrow</hi> that haunts Oaks, excepting the Bill, and its pleaſant note. It lies much in Woods and Thickets, flying and hiding it ſelf there. This deſcription of <hi>Bellonius</hi> ſeems rather to agree to our <hi>Hedg-Sparrow</hi> than to the bird deſcribed in this Chapter.</p>

The Throat and Cheeks under the Eyes black, with a mixture of grey in the ends of the feathers. In the Female the Back is of a dusky aſh-colour: The Throat of a paler cinereous: The Breaſt red; the Belly white.</p>
                        <p>The quill-feathers in each Wing eighteen, as in other ſmall birds, all dusky: The upper covert-feathers black, the nether red. The Tail is made up of the uſual num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of twelve feathers, of which the five outmoſt on each ſide are red, the two mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt dusky, two inches and an half long.</p>
                        <p>The Bill is black: The Legs alſo are black in the Cock; in the Hen both Bill and feet are paler. The loweſt bone of the outer Toe is joyned to that of the middle Toe. The Tongue is cloven: The mouth within yellow: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes of a hazel colour. The Eyes are furniſhed with nictating membranes.</p>

                        <p>This bird, ſaith a late <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writer, is of a very dogged ſullen temper: For if taken old, and ordered as formerly directed in the <hi>Nightingale,</hi> he will be ſometimes ſo dogged as in ten days time never to look toward the meat, and when he feeds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to continue a whole month without ſinging. This is alſo the ſhieſt of all birds, for if ſhe perceive you to mind her when ſhe is building, ſhe will forſake what ſhe hath begun, and if you touch an Egg ſhe never comes to her Neſt more: And if you touch her young ones, ſhe will either ſtarve them, or throw them out of the Neſt and break their necks, as I found by experience more than once. The Young are to be taken at ten days old, and to be fed and ordered as the <hi>Nightingales.</hi> Keep them warm in Winter, and they will ſing as well in the night as the day, and will learn to whiſtle and imitate other birds. Taken young, and brought up, they become gentle and very tame.</p>
                        <p>Beſides this common Redſtart, <hi>Geſner</hi> and <hi>Aldrovand</hi> deſcribe ſeveral other kinds, as 1. That which <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> makes his third, which <hi>Geſner</hi> deſcribes thus: Its fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is marked with a white ſpot: The feathers under the Bill are black. The Head and Back are of a cinereous or dusky colour. The Wing-feathers are dusky, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately inclining to red. The Breaſt, Belly, and Tail are red; but the lower Belly whitiſh. The Tail conſiſts of <note n="*" place="margin">Either this place is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, or <hi>Geſner</hi> ſure miſtaken in the number of feathers: For all the <hi>Europaean</hi> ſmall birds I ever ſaw or heard of have twelve feathers in their Tails. <hi>Geſners Rotſch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wentzel Aldr.</hi> tom. 3. p. 748.</note> eight feathers.

The Bird called <hi>Wegflecklin</hi> about <hi>Strasburgh, Geſn.</hi> Its Breaſt was blue, the part between the Breaſt and Belly of a pale or yellowiſh red; which colour alſo the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſide of the Tail feathers, but not to the end, and thoſe about the Rump, were of. The Bill is ſhort, the Belly cinereous, not white, as the <hi>Strasburgh</hi> Picture repreſents it; the Legs dusky, not red, as in that Picture; and the feathers under the Bill not blue, but dusky and particoloured. The <hi>German</hi> name is impoſed upon it partly from the ways; for it is much converſant about high ways, roads, and fields, and thence (as we gueſs) picks up worms and ſeeds that it finds on the ground; partly from the blue ſpot on its Breaſt, as I conjecture.</p>

                        <p>THis bird denominated from its red breaſt, is ſo well known in almoſt all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that it needs no long deſcription. It weighs about half an ounce, being from Bill to Tail half a foot long; and between the tips of the Wings ſpread about nine inches broad. The Breaſt is of a red or deep Orange colour: which colour compaſſes alſo the Eyes and upper part of the Bill. The Belly is white; the Head, Neck, Back, and Tail of a dirty green or yellow, as in <hi>Thruſhes</hi> [rather cinereous, with a tincture of green.] A line of blue divides between the red colour and the cinereous on the Head and Neck. Under the Wings is alſo ſeen ſomething of Orange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawny.</p>
                        <p>The exteriour borders of the Wings are almoſt of the ſame colour with the back: the interiour are ſomething yellow. The Tail is two inches and an half long, and made up of twelve feathers.</p>
                        <p>The Bill is ſlender, of a dusky colour, more than half an inch long: The Tongue cloven and jagged: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes of a hazel colour. The Legs, Feet, and Claws of a dusky or blackiſh. The outer foretoe joyned to the middlemoſt at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, as in the reſt of this kind.</p>
                        <p>In Winter-time to ſeek food it enters into houſes with much confidence, being a very bold bird, ſociable and familiar with man. In the Summer-time (as <hi>Turner</hi> ſaith) when there is plenty of food in the Woods, and it is not pinched with cold, it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws it ſelf with its Brood into the moſt deſert places. It is a ſolitary bird, and feeds ſingly, whence the Proverb took its riſe, <hi>Unum arbuſtum non alit duos Erithacos.</hi> Of the manner of building its Neſt thus <hi>Turner</hi> from ocular inſpection. It makes its Neſt among the thickeſt thorns and ſhrubs in Spineys, where it finds many Oaken leaves, and when it is built covereth it with leaves, not leaving it open every way, but only one paſſage to it. On that ſide alſo where the entrance is, it builds a long porch of leaves before the aperture, the outmoſt end whereof when it goes forth to ſeek meat, it ſhuts or ſtops up with leaves. What I now write I obſerved when I was very young; howbeit I will not deny but it may build alſo after another manner. If any have obſerved another manner of building let them declare it, and they will very much gratifie ſuch as are ſtudious of theſe things, and my ſelf eſpecially. What I have ſeen I have candidly imparted. The Male (ſaith <hi>Olina)</hi> may be known and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the Female, by the colour of his Legs, which are blacker, and by certain hairs or beards which grow on each ſide his Bill. It feeds upon Worms and other Inſects, Ants Eggs, Crums of bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For a Song-bird it is by ſome eſteemed little inferiour to the <hi>Nightingale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They build commonly three times a year, in <hi>April, May,</hi> and <hi>June:</hi> Seldom have above five young ones, and not under four. You may take them at ten days old; if
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:63869:117"/>
you let them lie too long, they will be ſullen. Feed them with ſheeps heart and Egg minced ſmall, in all points like the <hi>Nightingale;</hi> give them but little at once, and pretty often, for if you give them too much, they are apt to throw it up again. Be ſure they lie warm, for they are tender birds. When they begin to be ſtrong, cage them in a Cage, like the <hi>Nightingales,</hi> lined with bays, and having Moſs at the bottom: And give them ſheeps heart and Egg, or the <hi>Nightingales</hi> Paſte, or <hi>Woodlarks</hi> meat. In a Trap-cage with a meal-worm you may take a dozen in a day. The Cock may be known by his Breaſt being of a deeper red, and the red going up further upon the Head. He is ſubject to the Cramp, and dizzineſs. For the firſt give him three or four Meal-worms and Spiders: For the latter ſix or ſeven Earwigs a week.</p>

The parts under the Wings, the Breaſt and Throat are of a darker colour, with a tincture of green. In each Wing it hath eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen quil-feathers, beſides the outmoſt ſmall one, the interiour Webs whereof are livid, the exteriour fulvous. The Tail, as we ſaid, is red, not forked, two inches and an half long, compounded of twelve feathers. The Bill ſlender, ſtreight, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different long, <hi>viz.</hi> meaſuring from the tip to the angles of the mouth, near an inch, of a dusky colour: The upper Chap a little longer and blacker than the nether, the nether paler, and fleſh-coloured at the root or riſe. The Bill for its figure reſembles a <hi>Thruſhes</hi> or <hi>Blackbirds.</hi> The Tongue is not very ſhort, the mouth yellow within: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes hazel-coloured: The Ears great: The colour of the Feet and Claws a deep fleſh. <hi>[Olina</hi> attributes to the Feet a pale fleſh-colour approaching to white.] But the colour varies according to the age, for in young birds it is fainter, in old ones fuller. The outmoſt foretoes are very near of equal length one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which the middlemoſt doth much exceed both in thickneſs and length. The Heel or Spur is ſtrong, but not long as in <hi>Larks.</hi> The outmoſt Toe beneath is joyned to the middle one. The Guts are about ten inches long. The blind Guts very ſmall.</p>
                        <p>This bird is not remarkable for any variety or beauty of colours, but well known from its ſinging by night. And now that mention hath been made of ſinging, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear to produce and inſert the elegant words of that grave Naturaliſt <hi>Pliny,</hi> concerning the <hi>Nightingales</hi> admirable skill in ſinging, her ſtudy and contention, the ſweetneſs of her accents, the great variety of her notes, the harmonious modulation and inflection of her voice; which becauſe I cannot ſo render in <hi>Engliſh</hi> but that they muſt needs loſe much of their native <hi>Emphaſis</hi> and Elegancy, I ſhall put down in the Language the Author wrote them. <hi>Luſciniis</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>diebus ac noctibus continuis quindecim garrulus ſine intermiſſu cantus, denſante ſe frondium germine, non in noviſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum digna miratu ave.

The Rhetorical Harangues of Modern Writers in commendation of the <hi>Nightingale</hi> I ſtudiouſly omit, ſith almoſt all they have concerning it is owing to <hi>Pliny,</hi> being either repeated in the ſame words, or a few only changed; or elſe compoſed in imitation of what we have delivered out of him. Theſe things, though with me they ſcarce ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain belief, yet will they ſeem very credible, if compared with what <hi>Geſner,</hi> from the relation of a certain friend of his, delivers concerning the admirable faculty of theſe birds in imitating of humane ſpeech. To theſe things (ſaith he) let me add a ſtory which a friend of mine, a very learned and credible perſon, wrote to me.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe you are writing of Birds, I will tell you ſomething concerning <hi>Nightingales</hi> imitating mens voice, and repeating their diſcourſes, which is indeed wonderful, and almoſt incredible, but yet moſt true, and which I my ſelf heard with theſe Ears, and had experience of, this laſt Diet at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> in the year 1546. whilſt I lodged there in a common Inn at the ſign of the <hi>Golden Crown.</hi> Our Hoſt had three <hi>Nightingales,</hi> placed ſeparately, ſo that each was ſhut up ſingly by it ſelf in a dark Cage. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that at that time, being the Spring of the year, when thoſe birds are wont to ſing indefatigably, and almoſt inceſſantly; I was ſo afflicted with the Stone, that I could ſleep but very little all night. Then about and after Midnight, when there was no noiſe in the houſe, but all ſtill, you might have heard ſtrange janglings and emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of two <hi>Nightingales,</hi> talking one with another, and plainly imitating mens diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. For my part I was almoſt aſtoniſhed with wonder. For they in the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſon, when all was whiſt and quiet, in conference together produced and repeated whatever they had heard in the day time from the Gueſts talking together, and had thought upon. Thoſe two of them which were moſt notable, and maſters of this Art, were ſcarce ten foot diſtant one from the other: The third hung more remote, ſo that I could not ſo well hear it as I lay in bed. But thoſe two it is wonderful to tell, how they provoked one another, and by anſwering invited and drew one another to ſpeak. Yet did they not confound their words, talking both together, but rather utter them alternately, or by courſe. But beſides the daily diſcourſe, which they had lately heard of the Gueſts, they did chant out eſpecially two ſtories one to the other for a long time, even from Midnight till Morning, ſo long as there was no noiſe of men ſtirring, and that with that native modulation and various inflection of their notes, that no man, unleſs he were very attentive and heedful, would either have expected from thoſe little Creatures, or eaſily obſerved. When I asked the Hoſt, whether their Tongues had been ſlit, or they taught to ſpeak any thing? He anſwered no; whether he had obſerved or did underſtand what they ſung in the night? He likewiſe denied that. The ſame ſaid the whole Family. But I who could not ſleep whole nights together, did greedily and attentively hearken to the birds, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeed admiring their induſtry and contention. One of the ſtories was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tapſter, or <note n="*" place="margin">Servant of the houſe.</note> Houſe-knight (as they call them) and his Wife, who refuſed to follow him going into the Wars, as he deſired her. For the Husband endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to perſuade his wife, as far as I underſtand by thoſe birds, in hope of prey, that ſhe would leave her ſervice in that Inn, and go along with him into the Wars. But ſhe, refuſing to follow him, did reſolve either to ſtay at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> or go away to <hi>Nurenberg.</hi> For there had been an earneſt and long contention between them about this matter, but (as far as I underſtood) no body being preſent beſides, and without the privity of the Maſter of the Houſe; and all this Dialogue the birds repeated. And if by chance in their wrangling they caſt forth any unſeemly words, and that ought rather to have been ſuppreſſed and kept ſecret, the Birds, as not knowing the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between modeſt and immodeſt, honeſt and filthy words, did out with them. This diſpute and wrangling the Birds did often repeat in the night time, as which (as I gueſſed) did moſt firmly ſtick in their memories, and which they had well conned and thought upon. The other was a Hiſtory or Prediction of the War of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour againſt the Proteſtants, which was then imminent. For as it were preſaging or prophecying they ſeemed to chant forth the whole buſineſs as it afterwards fell out. They did alſo with that ſtory mingle what had been done before againſt the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick.</hi> But I ſuppoſe thoſe Birds had all from the ſecret conferences of ſome Noblemen and Captains, which as being in a public Inn, might frequently have been had in that place where the Birds were kept. Theſe things (as I ſaid) they did in the night, eſpecially after twelve of the clock, when there was a deep ſilence, repeat. But in the day-time for the moſt part they were ſilent, and ſeemed to do nothing but meditate upon, and revolve with themſelves what the Gueſts conferred together about either at Table, or elſe as they walked. I verily had never believed our <hi>Pliny</hi>
                           <pb n="222" facs="tcp:63869:118"/>
writing ſo many wonderful things concerning theſe little Creatures, had I not my ſelf ſeen with my Eyes, and heard them with my ears uttering ſuch things as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Neither yet can I of a ſudden write all, or call to remembrance every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that I have heard.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Nightingale</hi> is very impatient of cold, and therefore in Winter-time either hides it ſelf in ſome lurking place, or flies away into hot Countries. <hi>Ireland</hi> (as <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi> relates) is altogether deſtitute of <hi>Nightingales;</hi> which whether it be true or not I cannot tell. In the South part of <hi>England</hi> in Summer time they are very frequent, but in the North more rare. Some build upon the ground at hedg-bottoms, others in thick green buſhes and ſhrubs. They lay four or five Eggs.</p>
                        <p>It is called in <hi>Italian, Roſſingnuolo,</hi> from its red or fulvous colour; or (as <hi>Aldrovan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> rather thinks) from the diminutive <hi>Latine</hi> word, <hi>Luſciniola.</hi>

                        <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> among thoſe little birds, which growing fat in the Autumn are ſold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately for <hi>Beccafico's,</hi> the <hi>Nightingale</hi> is one.</p>
                        <p>It breeds in the Spring-time about the month of <hi>May,</hi> building its Neſt of the leaves of trees, ſtraws and moſs. It ſeldom ſings near its Neſt for fear of diſcovering it, but for the moſt part about a ſtones caſt diſtant.</p>
                        <p>It is proper to this Bird at his firſt coming (ſaith <hi>Olina)</hi> to occupy or ſeize upon one place as its Freehold, into which it will not admit any other <hi>Nightingale</hi> but its Mate.</p>
                        <p>It haunts for the moſt part in cool or ſhady places, where are little Rivulets of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſuch as are Quick-ſet hedges, ſmall groves, and buſhes, where are no very high trees, for it delights in no high trees except the Oak.</p>

                              <p>The young Nightingales (ſaith <hi>Olina)</hi> muſt be taken when they are well feathered; [ſaith a late Engliſh Author, when they are indifferently well feathered, not too little, nor too much: if too much, they will be ſullen; and if too little, if you keep them not very warm, they will die with cold, and then alſo they will be much longer in bringing up;] and together with the Neſt put in the bottom of a little basket made of ſtraw, covering the Neſt ſo that they cannot get out, not tangle or double their Legs; keeping them at firſt in a quiet place where few people reſort, feeding them eight or ten times a day with heart of a Veal or Weather raw, well cleanſed and freed from skin, films, ſinews, and fat, cut into ſmall pieces of the bigneſs of a writing Pen. [Our Engliſh Author mingles a like quantity of white bread, ſoaked in water, and a little ſqueezed, with the fleſh, chopping both ſmall as if it were for minc'd meat,] giving to each bird upon a ſticks end two or three ſmall pieces [of the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a grey Peaſe] at a time. Make them drink two or three times a day, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them a little Cotton-wool dipt in water, on the end of a ſtick: Keeping them in this manner covered, till they begin to find their feet, and leap out of the Neſt: Then put them in a Cage with freſh ſtraw, fine moſs or hay at the bottom, [lining the Pearches with green bays, for they are very ſubject to the cramp at the firſt] feeding and ordering them as before, till you ſee they begin to feed themſelves, which you ſhall perceive by obſerving them pick the meat from the ſtick; then take of the heart ſome pieces of the bigneſs of a nut, and faſten them to the Cage ſides. When they are come to feed themſelves, give them four or five times a day a gobbet or two. Let them have a cup of water very clean and bright, changing the water in Summer-time twice a day, doing the ſame by the fleſh, that it grow not ſower nor ſtink. When they

are fully grown, put into little boxes with ſtone bottoms, on one ſide of the Cage crums of Paſte, ſuch as we ſhall anon deſcribe, and on the other ſide Sheeps heart, ſuch as was before mentioned. <hi>When they begin to moult</hi> (ſaith our Engliſh Author) <hi>give them half an Egg hard boiled, and the other half ſheeps heart, with a little Saffron mixt in the water, for you muſt not make it too ſtiff, nor too limber.

Wherefore to make them prove good, it is convenient to place them near one that hath the right wild note.

                              <p>WHen you have found the birds haunts, they may be taken by a Trap-cage, or Net-trap; deſcribed in <hi>Olina,</hi> and in the forementioned Engliſh Author; baited with a meal-worm, or other worms or Maggots. So ſoon as you have taken the <hi>Nightingale,</hi> tie the tips of his wings with ſome brown thread, not ſtraining it too hard, that he may not have ſtrength to beat himſelf againſt the top and wires of the Cage, for by this order he will grow tame ſooner, and be more apt to eat his meat. You ſhall ſhut him up in a Cage covered above half with green Bays, or brown paper, <hi>[Olina</hi> ſaith, covered with paper, and for a while without Perches] or elſe turn the Cage from the light in ſome private place, that at firſt he be not diſturbed, to make him wilder than he would be. <note n="*" place="margin">Birds taken in <hi>April</hi> muſt be fed ſeven or eight times a day, for then they are apter by half <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                                 </note> Feed him five or ſix times at the leaſt every day with ſheeps heart and Egg ſhred ſmall and fine, mingling amongſt the ſame ſome red Ants, and three or four red Earth-worms. And becauſe no Nightingale will at firſt eat any ſheeps heart or Paſte, or hard Egg, but live meat, as Worms, Ants, Caterpillars, or Flies; therefore taking him out in your hand, you muſt open his Bill with a ſtick made thin at one end, and holding it open, give him a gobbet about the bigneſs of a grey peaſe: Then when he hath ſwallowed that, open his Bill and give him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till he hath had four or five ſuch bits: Then ſet him ſome meat mingled with ſtore of Ants, that when he goes to pick up the Ants he may eat ſome of the ſheeps heart and Eggs with it. At the firſt you may ſhred three or four meal-worms in his meat, the better to entice him, that ſo he may therewith eat ſome of the ſheeps heart by little and little; at laſt when you perceive him to eat, give him the leſs Ants in his meat, and at laſt nothing but ſheeps heart and Eggs. <hi>[Olina</hi> makes no mention of forcing meat down his throat, but only laying it by him in the Cage, and adviſes to tie or faſten ſome of heart to Maggots and Caterpillars, to inure the bird to eat fleſh.] Our Author alſo, if the bird beſullen, adviſes to get ſome <hi>Gentles</hi> or <hi>Maggots,</hi> and take your paſte and roll it up in pieces like to little worms about half an inch long,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63869:119"/>
and put amongſt them ſome Ants, and put your Maggots at the bottom of your pan, then put your paſte rolled like worms upon the Maggots, and they ſtirring at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom will make the paſte move as if it were alive; which will cauſe the <hi>Nightingale</hi> to eat it more readily; and when he hath taſted the meat made of ſheeps heart, and paſte two or three times, he then is not apt to forſake it. <hi>But whereas he ſaith,</hi> that Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales feeding only upon live meat do not know that any thing is for food but what ſtirs, <hi>he is ſurely therein miſtaken, for (as</hi> Olina <hi>obſerves) they feed upon Figs, and ſome ſorts of berries, when wild, as well as upon Inſects.</hi> Such birds as you take in <hi>April</hi> our Author adviſes when you go a taking to carry a bottom bag with you, and ſome meat in a Gally-pot to feed them abroad, for if they be over-faſted they ſeldom live, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring to be fed every hour: Alſo to put or cut their feathers from their vent, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they will be ſubject to clog and bake up their vent, which is ſudden death. Birds, that are long a feeding, and make no curring or ſweeting for eight or ten days, ſeldom prove good; but on the contrary, they give great hopes of proving well when they take their meat kindly, and are familiar, and not buckiſh, and ſing quickly, and learn to eat of themſelves without much trouble. This is a ſure token of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving excellent birds: For I have had ſome birds feed in twelve hours after taking of them, and ſing in two or three days, and thoſe never proved bad. When you ſhall find that the Nightingale eats well by himſelf, and ſings often without ſeeming to be diſturbed at every little noiſe, you ſhall by little and little put back the green Bays or Paper wherewith the Cage was covered, putting ſome Greens in the opened part.</p>
                              <p>Now to know the Cocks from the Hens among the wild ones, <hi>Olina</hi> gives us theſe <note place="margin">How to diſcern the Cocks from the Hens.</note> marks of the Cock, That it hath a bigger Eye, and rounder and greater Head, a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Bill, thicker Legs, a longer Tail, and of ſomething a brighter red. Our Engliſh Author will not allow theſe for ſufficient notes of diſtinction; and yet afterward he dare not deny but all taken together may be ſufficient. He adds, that <hi>Nightingales</hi> taken in <hi>Auguſt</hi> are moſt certainly to be diſcerned by the ſinging: And as for thoſe that are taken in <hi>April,</hi> your knowledge, ſaith he, reſteth in theſe obſervations: Firſt, when you think you have taken the bird you heard ſing, call again, and if the Cock anſwers and ſings again, then you have taken the Hen, and not the Cock; but if you find the Cock not to ſing, then be aſſured you have taken him. Alſo you may know him by the lower parts of the Sex, which the Cock puts forth, but the Hen doth not. If you take a bird about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> or beginning of <hi>June,</hi> the Breaſt of the Hen will be bare with ſitting, and all full of ſcurf, whereas the Cocks Breaſt is all well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathered, without any bareneſs or ſcurf.</p>
                              <p>This Author ſaith, that he hath often proved, that old Nightingales are far per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter, and far excellenter in their ſongs than any Neſtling or Brancher whatſoever, and will come to ſing as laviſh and as often, and with care and a little trouble will know you, and be as familiar alſo.</p>
                              <p>Branchers (ſaith <hi>Olina)</hi> are better than Neſtlings, and will come to be as familiar, and very often ſing all Winter. [Underſtand it in <hi>Italy</hi> where their Winters are ſhort and mild.]</p>

Put theſe ingredients

in a Pan of the faſhion of that they make Confects in. Set the Pan on a Trevet over a fire of Charcoal, taking care that it be not ſmoaked, and ſtirring it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly with a wooden ſtick or <hi>Spathule,</hi> that it burn not to the bottom till it be ſufficiently boiled. Then take a pound of Honey, and three ounces of Butter, and melt it in any little Veſſel, ſtill ſcumming of it; and when it is well melted and boiled, let your aſſiſtant, with a Ladle having a hole or two in the bottom, take it up, and pour it upon the Paſte, gently moving his Ladle up and down, you in the mean while continuing to ſtir your Paſte till it be well incorporated and grained. This Paſte ſerves for the Summer: For the Winter, take a pretty quantity of Saffron and mingle with the Paſte, for it is hot and opening, and will maintain the bird more chearful and lively. Then take it from the fire, and paſs it through a Sieve or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander with round holes of the bigneſs of an ordinary Tare.

                              <p>FIrſt, note that the principal thing which cauſes moſt diſeaſes, not only in <hi>Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales,</hi> but in other birds kept for ſinging, is want of keeping them clean and neat, whereby they clog their feet, which cauſes the Claws of ſeveral to rot off, and breeds the Cramp and Gout in others, and makes them never thrive, nor delight in themſelves. No birds can be kept too clean and neat. Therefore be ſure to let them have twice a week gravel at the bottom of the Cage, and let it be very dry when you put it in, for then it will not be ſubject to clog.</p>
                              <p>The Nightingale in Autumn is apt to grow extraordinary fat and foggy; [I have had ſeveral when fat to be three weeks and not eat one bit of meat] to remedy which during that time give him two or three times in a week worms taken out of a Pigeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, two or three at a time, or two or three field-Spiders a day, which will purge and cleanſe them extraordinarily. Upon the falling of his fat he muſt be kept warm, and have ſome Saffron given him in his meat or water. To raiſe them when they are very lean and poor, give them new figs chopt ſmall among their meat, continuing no longer than till they have recovered their fleſh.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Nightingales</hi> that have been kept two or three years in a Cage are very ſubject to the Gout: Which when you ſhall perceive, take them out of their Cage, and anoint their feet with freſh Butter or Capons greaſe: Do ſo three or four days together and it is a certain cure for them.</p>
                              <p>Another thing that <hi>Nightingales</hi> are ſubject to, is breakings out about their Eyes and Neb; for which likewiſe uſe your freſh Butter or Capons greaſe.</p>
                              <p>There alſo hapneth unto the <hi>Nightingale</hi> a ſtraitneſs or ſtrangling of the breaſt; which comes very often for want of care in making of their meat, by mincing fat therewith; and you may perceive it by the beating pain not afore accuſtomed that he abideth in this place, and alſo by his often gaping: Other whiles this diſeaſe hapneth by reaſon of ſome ſinew or thread of the ſheeps heart (for want of well ſhredding) hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his throat, or claſping about his Tongue, which cauſeth him to forſake his meat, and grow very poor in a ſhort time, eſpecially if it be in the Spring time, or when he is in ſong. When you ſhall perceive it by his gaping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> take him gently out of his Cage, and open his bill with a quill or pin, and unlooſen any ſtring or piece of fleſh that may hang about his tongue or throat: After you have taken it a way, give him ſome white Sugar-candy in his water, or elſe diſſolve it, and moiſten his meat, which is a preſent remedy to any thing that is amiſs.</p>
                              <p>If they grow melancholy, put into their water ſome white Sugar-candy; and if that will not do, about ſix or eight Chives of Saffron, continuing withal to give them the Paſte and ſheeps heart ſhred very fine, and alſo three or four meal-worms a day, and a few Ants and Ants Eggs: Alſo boil a new-laid Egg, and chop it ſmall, and ſtrew it among the Ants and their Eggs.</p>

                              <p>TO make <hi>Nightingales</hi> ſing more than ordinarily, or at ſuch times as they are not wont, give them in Winter-time Paſte of Pine kernels pounded, and in their drinking-cup a chive or two of Saffron: For thoſe two things by heating them, render them chearful and brisk, without inducing any noxious alteration, and ſo excite them to ſing. That ſympathy alſo which this bird hath with Muſic both vocal and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental is of exceeding force to this purpoſe. And therefore if in the Chamber where ſhe is kept there be a conſort of ſweet ſounds or voices, ſhe is marvelouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to ſing. Many ſtories we have of <hi>Nightingales</hi> emulating and ſtriving to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie one another, and other birds, yea, and men too in ſinging: Nay, that ſometimes a bird will ſtrain her note ſo to exceed that of her Antagoniſt, that ſhe will fall down dead upon the ſpot with contending and over-ſtraining her ſelf.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Olina</hi> hath the receit of an odoriferous unguent to ſtir up a <hi>Nightingale</hi> to ſing.</p>
                              <p>Take of Civet not ſophiſticate twenty grains, <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Storax calamitae,</hi> of each three grains, mingle theſe together in a Mortar in the form of a ſoft ointment; Then diligently obſerve the buſh and particular branch, on which the Nightingale is wont to ſit and ſing, and there making as it were a little ſhelf of the leaves and boughs, lay thereon ſome meal-worms, and anoint the branch next to your ſhelf with this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent. The <hi>Nightingale</hi> when he returns from feeding, will preſently fly up to his bough, and finding there the meal-worms will fall a eating of them, and ſenting the odour of the Ointment will begin to ſing, and being as it were intoxicated with the perfume, will not give over, nor ſtir from the place though you take the boughs from about him. For as the <hi>Nightingale</hi> exceeds all other birds in ſinging, ſo doth he alſo in the exquiſiteneſs of his ſent: Wherefore alſo when wild he doth moſt willingly haunt where ſweet herbs grow: And is particularly delighted in Musk, ſo that a grain or two of true Musk put in Cotton, and that in a ſmall Reed ſerving for him to pearch on in his Cage, will provoke him to ſing.</p>

                        <p>THis is a very ſmall bird, not weighing above half an ounce: Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail is ſix inches; its breadth between the ends of the Wings ſtretcht out nine. The top of the Head is black, whence it took its name: The Neck cinereous; the whole back of a dark green. The quill-feathers in each Wing eighteen in number, of a dusky colour, ſave that their edges are a little green. The Tail hath twelve feathers, two inches and an half long, and almoſt equal, ſharp-pointed, of a dusky colour, with a little tincture of green. The nether part of the Neck, the Throat, and upper part of the Breaſt are of a pale aſh-colour: The lower Belly white, tinctured with yellow. The Bill ſtreight, ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, black, longer, and leſſer than in the <hi>Titmice:</hi> The Tongue cloven and rough: The Feet of a lead colour, the Claws black. The outmoſt Toe below is faſtned to the middlemoſt. The head of the Female is of a brown or cheſnut colour rather than black.</p>
                        <p>This bird is frequent in <hi>Italy,</hi> it is alſo found in <hi>England,</hi> but more rarely, <hi>Turner</hi> in vain contradicting.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Geſner</hi> ſaith, that the firſt Summer the head of theſe birds is red, and afterward grows black, and that in the Cocks only, for in the Hens it continues always red. The Ancients report, that the <hi>Black-caps [Atricapillae]</hi> in the beginning of Autumn are changed into <hi>Ficedulae,</hi> or <hi>Beccafigos</hi> by the mutation of their voice and colour; from whom, till I be aſſured by experience, I muſt crave leave to diſſent.</p>

                        <p>THis is the leaſt of all birds found with us in <hi>England,</hi> weighing not more than one ſingle drachm. Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Claws is four inches and an half, to the end of the Tail four and a quarter. The breadth of the Wings extended ſix and three quarters. The top of the Head is adorned with a moſt beautiful bright ſpot, (which they call a creſt) of a deep Saffron or pale Scarlet colour. Hence it got thoſe ambitious titles of <note n="*" place="margin">Little King and Tyrant.</note> 
                           <hi>Regulus</hi> and <hi>Tyrannus.</hi> This Creſt or Crown (if you pleaſe ſo to call it) it can when it liſts, by corrugating its forehead, and drawing the ſides of the ſpot together, wholly conceal and render inviſible. It is of an oblong figure, and extended directly through the middle of the Head from the Bill towards the Neck. The edges of it on both ſides are yellow; the whole is environed with a black line. The ſides of the Neck are of a lovely ſhining yellowiſh green colour. The Eyes are encompaſſed with white. The Neck and all the Back from a dark green incline to yellow. The Breaſt is of a ſordid white. [In the bird that I <hi>J. R.</hi> deſcribed the Breaſt and Belly were daſhed with a faint green.] The Wings were concave, not much unlike to a <hi>Chaſſinches</hi> Wings. The quil-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Wings, as in almoſt all ſmall birds, were eighteen, all of a dusky colour, only their exteriour edges yellowiſh, and their interiour whitiſh. The tips alſo of the three next to the body were white. But what was moſt eſpecially notable in the Wings of this bird was, that the middle quill-feathers, or indeed all excluding the five outmoſt, and the three inmoſt, had their exteriour Webs, as far as they appear above the covert feathers, to a conſiderable breadth black, ſo that when the Wings are ſhut they make a black ſpot of a good bigneſs about the middle of each Wing. The outmoſt quil-feather was very ſhort and little. The covert-feathers of the firſt row have white tips, all together making a white line acroſs the Wing. Above alſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ridge of the Wing is a white ſpot.</p>
                        <p>The Tail is made up of twelve ſharp-pointed feathers, an inch and half long, not forcipate, of a dusky colour, only the exteriour borders of the feathers are of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh green.</p>
                        <p>The Bill is ſlender, ſtreight, black, half an inch long. The feet yellowiſh, and the Claws of a not much different colour. The Tongue long, ſharp, and cloven. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes of a hazel colour.</p>

The ſtomach ſmall, muſculous, and full of Inſects; whence it is manifeſt (as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> rightly ſaith) that it is a vermivorousbird. The Female, as in moſt other birds, hath not ſo fair colours.</p>
                        <p>We ſaw of theſe birds firſt to be ſold in the Market at <hi>Nurenberg:</hi> Afterwards our worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Fr. Jeſſop</hi> of <hi>Broomhall</hi> in <hi>Sheffield</hi> Pariſh, whom we have occaſion often to mention in this Work, ſent us of them, which he had found and caught in the Mountainous Woods about <hi>Highloe,</hi> near <hi>Hatherſedge</hi> in the <hi>Peak</hi> of <hi>Derbyſhire.</hi> The ſame alſo found them here in <hi>Middleton</hi> Park in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> where he ſhot them and brought them to us. They abide and haunt for the moſt part on the tops of trees, eſpecially Oaks.</p>

                        <p>THis is equal to, or ſomewhat bigger than the <hi>creſted Wren,</hi> weighs two drachms, being in length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail, or, which is all one, the end of the Claws five inches, in breadth between the extremities of the Wings extended ſeven.</p>
                        <p>All its upper ſide, ſave the Wings and Tail, is of a dusky or cinereous colour, tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured with green. The Rump is greener than the reſt of the Back. A yellowiſh line is produced from the Noſthrils above the Eyes almoſt to the hinder part of the Head. The nether ſide, <hi>viz.</hi> the Throat, Breaſt, and Belly is white with a daſh of green, and ſometimes yellow. The Wing and Tail-feathers are dusky, having their outer edges green. The feathers under the baſtard-wing, and the coverts of the underſide of the Wings, from green decline to a lovely yellow. Each Wing hath eighteen prime fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the outmoſt of which is very ſhort and ſmall. The Tail is two inches long, not forked, made up of twelve ſharp-pointed feathers.</p>
                        <p>Its Bill is ſlender, ſtreight, ſharp, half an inch long, the upper Mandible being dusky on the outſide; but the angles of the Mouth are yellowiſh: The mouth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yellow. The Noſthrils are large: The Legs and Feet ſmall, of a dusky Amber co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The outmoſt fore-toe at bottom grows to the middle one. Its Gizzard is ſmall. It ſings like a <hi>Graſhopper,</hi> and doth much frequent Willow-trees. It is much in motion, continually creeping up and down trees and ſhrubs, and ſings with a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous note. It builds its Neſt of moſs, and ſtraws, and a few feathers and hairs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. It lays five Eggs all over beſprinkled with red ſpecks.</p>
                        <p>The birds of this kind vary in colour, ſome being of a paler, ſome of a deeper green or yellow: in ſome the Belly is white, without any tincture of green.</p>

                        <p>IT weighs three drachms, being extended from the point of the Bill to the end of the Tail four inches and an half: The Wings ſtretcht out equal to ſix inches and an half. The Head, Neck, and Back are of a dark ſpadiceous colour, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Rump and Tail. The Back, Wings, and Tail are varied with croſs black lines. The Throat is of a pale yellow, the middle of the Breaſt whiter: Below it hath black tranſverſe lines, as have alſo the ſides. The lower Belly is of a dusky red. The tips of the ſecond row of Wing-feathers are marked with three or four ſmall white ſpots. The tips of the covert-feathers of the Tail are alike ſpotted. The number of quil-feathers in each Wing is eighteen. The Tail, which for the moſt part it holds erect, is made up of twelve feathers.</p>
                        <p>The Bill is half an inch long, ſlender, yellowiſh beneath, dusky above: the Mouth withinſide yellow: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes hazel-coloured. The outer Toes are faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the middle one as far as the firſt joynt. It creeps about hedges and holes, whence it is not undeſervedly called <hi>Troglodites.</hi> It makes but ſhort flights, and if it be driven from the hedges, may eaſily be tired and run down.</p>
                        <p>It builds its Neſt ſometimes by the Walls of houſes, in the back-ſides of Stables, or other Out-houſes covered with ſtraw, but more commonly in Woods and Hedges, without, of Moſs, within, of hairs and feathers. This Neſt is of the figure of an Egg, erect upon one end, and hath in the middle of the ſide a door or aperture, by which it goes in and out. Being kept tame it ſings very ſweetly, and with a higher and louder voice than one would think for its ſtrength and bigneſs; and that eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> for then it builds and breeds. It lays nine or ten, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more Eggs at a ſitting.</p>
                        <p>A late Engliſh Writer tells us, that he hath had eighteen Eggs out of one Neſt, and ſixteen young ones out of another. It is ſtrange to admiration that ſo ſmall a bodied bird ſhould cover ſo great a number of Eggs, and more ſtrange, that it ſhould feed ſuch a company of young, and not miſs one bird, and that in the dark alſo. They breed twice a year, about the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and beginning of <hi>June,</hi> or middle of it. The Young are to be fed and rear'd like the young <hi>Nightingales,</hi> giving them often, and but one or two morſels at a time. Give them once in two or three days a Spider or two.</p>
                        <p>It perfectly cures the Stone of the Kidneys or Bladder (as <hi>Aetius</hi> writes) being ſalted and eaten raw; or being burnt in a pot cloſe-covered, and the aſhes of one whole bird taken at once, either by it ſelf, or with a little <note n="*" place="margin">A kind of <hi>Mercury.</hi>

                        <p>THis kind of bird, whoſe Synonyma we have given, is the leaſt of all birds. It comprehends under it many Species, or differences of which in general theſe things are delivered by thoſe who have written of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That it moves the Wings with that ſwiftneſs, as not to be diſcerned by the Eye, ſo that it ſeems rather to want Wings; and that as it flies it makes a humming noiſe like a Hornet or Bee; inſomuch that one who ſhould ſee it flying by, would take it rather to be a Hornet than a Bee: Hence it took its name in Engliſh of <hi>humming bird.</hi> It will alſo ſo poiſe it ſelf by the help of its Wings for a long ſpace of time, as if it reſted and ſtirred not, and ſo, being on the Wing, ſuck the flowers with its Bill, for it lights not upon them. But when it moves from one place to another, it is carried with that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity like a bullet through the air, that very oft it cannot be ſeen or diſcerned as it flies along.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That it is fed and nouriſhed with honey, dew, and the juice of flowers, which it ſucks out of them with its Bill, or rather its very long Tongue, provided and fitted by nature for that uſe; ſo that, being taken alive, they cannot be kept for want of food, but die in a ſhorttime.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That it lies torpid or ſleeps in Winter [hanging by the feet on a bough in ſome open place, according to <hi>Franc. Lopez:</hi> The Bill being faſtned to the trunks of Pines or other trees, according to <hi>Hernandes</hi> and <hi>Recchus]</hi> and in the Spring revives or awakens, whence alſo theſe birds are called <note n="*" place="margin">That is, born again.</note> 
                           <hi>Renati</hi> by the Inhabitants of the <hi>Caribbce</hi> Iſlands, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo long, ſay they, it continues alive, as the honey-bearing flowers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and when they wither and fail it becomes torpid, and continues without ſenſe or motion for full ſix months ſpace until new flowers come. Neither (ſaith <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez)</hi> is this an idle tale, or ſuch a thing whereof one may well doubt: For this bird hath been more than once kept in a Chamber faſtned to the <note n="*" place="margin">The word is <hi>Stipiti,</hi> which alſo may ſignifie a ſtake, or any truncheon of wood.</note> ſtock of a tree, and when it had hung as it were dead for ſix months, at what time Nature had appointed, it revived, and being let go flew away into the neighbouring fields. Believe it who will, I am not wont raſhly or haſtily to give credit to ſuch relations: Though I know it is taken generally for an undoubted truth, and I find our Mr. <hi>Joſſeline</hi> in his <hi>New Englands</hi> rarities to report it for ſuch. And truly if it lives only upon what it ſucks out of flowers, in the Northern parts of <hi>America,</hi> when flowers fail, it muſt either lie torpid, or fly into the hotter Countries. But in the more Southern parts of <hi>America</hi> (as in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil) Marggravius</hi> writes, that theſe birds are found all the year long in the Woods in great numbers.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Of the feathers of theſe and other birds of beautiful colours the Indians make the likeneſſes (for Pictures we muſt not call them) of Saints, and other things ſo dextrouſly, and artificially, and to the life that one would think they were drawn with a Pencil in colours, of which we have ſeen many in the Cabinets of the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſi.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Although almoſt all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who have written of the <hi>Weſt India</hi> matters, have made mention of this bird, yet (which is ſtrange) do they take no notice at all of its ſinging: Only <hi>Lerius</hi> and <hi>Thevetus,</hi> both <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> do attribute to it ſo high and ſweet a note, that it gives not place to our <hi>Nightingale,</hi> which no man, who
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63869:122"/>
ſhould not hear and ſee it, could eaſily be perſwaded, could poſſibly proceed from ſo ſmall a body. <hi>Marggravius</hi> affirms, that they do not ſing, but cry, <hi>Screp, ſcrep, ſcrep,</hi> with one tone, and that almoſt continually, like Sparrows.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Marggravius</hi> deſcribes nine ſorts of this bird in the fifth Book of his <hi>Natural Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Braſil,</hi> Chap. 4.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The length of the whole body of this <hi>firſt</hi> kind from the beginning of the Head (where the Bill is inſerted) to the riſe of the Tail is two inches. The Head, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the feathers, is of the bigneſs of a mean-ſized ſweet Cherry: The Neck is three quarters of an inch long; the body an inch and a quarter. The body, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the feathers, is ſcarce equal in bigneſs to a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Olive. It hath a ſlender, and very ſharp, round, even, ſtreight Bill, yet toward the end a little inclining downward, an inch and half long. The colour of this Bill is black, excepting the lower Chap toward the riſe, where it is reddiſh. It hath a double or cloven Tongue, very ſmall or ſlender, like a fine ſilken thread, white, long, ſo that it can thruſt it forth far beyond the Bill: Small black Eyes; very ſmall and ſhort Legs and Feet, of a black colour: Four Toes in each foot, three ſtanding forward, and one backward, armed with long ſemilunar, very ſharp, black Claws. It hath a ſtreight Tail, an inch long, conſiſting for the moſt part of four feathers. The Wings, which are of two inches length, reach almoſt to the end of the Tail. Nature hath ſhewn a ſingular Art in the compoſure of the Wing-feathers. From the riſe of the Wings for about three quarters of an inch there is a double row of feathers one longer than the other, and the feathers are put one upon another, as it were ſhort wings upon long ones. Then after theſe feathers come the Wing-feathers (which are about ten) the ſubſequent interiour being ſtill longer than the precedent exteriour, ſo that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, determining the end of the Wing, is the longeſt of all. Theſe Wings being ſpread it can fly a long time, and reſt in the ſame place, as it were hanging in the air. As it flies it makes a noiſe like a <hi>Bruchus,</hi> or more truly, like a linnen Spinning-wheel, <hi>Hur, hur, hur.</hi> The feathers of the Wings ſpread appear very thin and tranſparent. The colour of the feathers of the whole Head, the upper ſide of the Neck, the ſides, the whole Back, and the beginning of the Wings is wonderfully reſplendent, ſo that it cannot be well repreſented by any Painter, for with a green, ſuch as is ſeen in the Necks of <hi>Peacocks</hi> and <hi>Mallards,</hi> a golden, flame-colour, and yellow are ſtrangely mixt, ſo that being expoſed to the Sun-beams it ſhines admirably. In the Throat, the lower ſide of the Neck, the breaſt, and all the lower Belly, and the upper Legs are white feathers, wherewith underneath the Neck are feathers of an excellent colour, diſperſedly intermixt. In the Belly beneath the white feathers lie black ones. The beginning of the Wings was, as I ſaid, of an admirable rare colour, all the reſt of the Wing brown, and of a ſhining ſpadiceous. The Tail conſiſts of feathers of a blue colour, like poliſhed Steel. They make their Neſts in the boughs of trees, of the bigneſs of a <hi>Holland Schilling.</hi> They lay very white Eggs, two for the moſt part, of an oval figure, not bigger than a Peaſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort is more beautiful than the firſt, of the ſame bigneſs and figure. Yet is its Bill ſhorter, <hi>viz.</hi> ⅔ of an inch long, of the ſame colour and figure with that of the former. The Tongue is the ſame, as alſo the Eyes, Legs, Feet, and figure of the Wings and Tail. The colour of the feathers in the Head, upper ſide of the Neck, Back, Wings, and Tail like to that of the former: But in the Throat or underſide of the Neck, the whole Breaſt, and lower Belly, to the very end of the body of ſo ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and ſhining a green, with a golden colour, enterchangeably mixt, that they gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter wonderfully. Near the Vent is a ſpot of a good bigneſs, in reſpect of the bulk of the bird, conſiſting of pure white feathers.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> is leſſer than all the reſt. From the beginning of the Head, or inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bill to the riſe of the Tail two inches and an half long: The Neck is almoſt one inch long: The Head not great: The Body an inch and half long. The Bill a little more than an inch long, black, round, ſharp, and almoſt ſtreight. The Legs and Feet like thoſe of the reſt. The feathers alſo of the Body and Wings are alike diſpoſed, but differently coloured. It hath a Tail longer than any of the reſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than three inches, conſiſting of feathers, of which that which is nearer to its riſe is ſhorter, the ſecond always longer: The Tail alſo is forked, and the bird flying ſpreads it into two large horns, ſo that the tips of the horns are an inch and half diſtant one from the other. The whole Head and Neck of this bird is of a ſhining ſilken black colour, inclining to, or interchanging with blue, as in the Necks of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards.</hi> The whole Back and Breaſt are green, ſhining enterchangeably with golden
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63869:123"/>
and Sea-green, as in the ſecond kind; and near the vent is alſo the like ſpot of white feathers. The Wings are of a liver-colour. The Tail is of a blackiſh blue, ſhining like poliſhed Steel blued over.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The <hi>fourth</hi> is a little leſſer than the third. The ſhape of the body and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the feathers the ſame, but it is of another colour, and differs alſo in the Bill and colour of the Legs. The Bill is an inch and half long, bowed downward like a <hi>Polonian</hi> Sword, round, every where of equal thickneſs, and ſharp-pointed. The upper part thereof is black, the under yellow, excepting the tip, which is alſo black. The top of the Head, the upper ſide of the Neck, as alſo the Wings, are of like co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour with thoſe of the firſt kind. The Throat, the lower ſide of the Neck, the whole Breaſt, and lower Belly, from white incline to a red colour. It hath a Tail an inch long, ending with the Wings, conſiſting of feathers which from black incline to green, having white tips: The Toes ſo diſpoſed as the other <hi>Species,</hi> yet not black, but white or yellowiſh, with like ſemilunar, ſharp, and black Claws.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The <hi>fifth</hi> is in bigneſs equal to the third kind; having a black Bill, a little more than an inch long, and a little bending downward, black Eyes, as alſo Legs and Feet. The Throat, lower ſide of the Neck, and all the Belly are covered with black Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet feathers, having as it were a gloſs of ſhining blue. Near the Vent is a ſpot of white feathers. But the black ends of the feathers on the ſides of the Neck, Breaſt, and Belly ſhine wonderfully with a rare mixture of Sea-water colour, golden and green. All the upper ſide of the Head and Neck, and the whole Back are adorned with feathers mixt with golden, fire-colour, and green, as is alſo the beginning of the Wings. The reſt of the Wings is of an iron or dusky colour. The Tail is a little more than an inch long, conſiſting of feathers of an elegant brown, with a gloſs of blue. About the edges theſe feathers are of the colour of poliſhed Steel blued.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The <hi>ſixth</hi> is in bigneſs equal to the <hi>fifth;</hi> hath a Bill of an inch long, a little bending, white underneath, black above. The whole Head, Neck, Back, and Belly, and the beginning of the Wings are covered with feathers of an excellent ſhining co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, conſiſting as it were of a mixture of much gold, half fire-colour, and a little green: In brief, ſhining like the Sun. In the Belly are a few white feathers mixt. The Legs are black: The Wings blackiſh: The Tail almoſt an inch and half long, handſom and broad, conſiſting of ſome feathers of the ſame rare colour with the reſt of the body, ſome of a mixt colour of green and golden, and white about the edges, ſome half white, half green, ſhining with golden, that is, on one ſide the ſhaft white, on the other green.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The <hi>ſeventh</hi> is a little leſs than the fifth and ſixth kind; hath a Bill not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an inch long, being of an aſh-colour all over the body, almoſt like a <hi>Sparrow,</hi> which here and there ſhineth rarely with a mixture of red like a Rubine.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The <hi>eighth</hi> is the moſt elegant of all, hath a ſtreight, black Bill half an inch long; a long, double [or cloven] Tongue. Its bigneſs and ſhape agrees with that of the ſecond kind. The whole Head above and upper part of the Neck ſhine with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Rubine-colour, as if a Rubine were illuſtrated by the Sun-beams: But the Throat and under-ſide of the Neck do reſemble pure, poliſhed, <hi>Hungarian</hi> gold, ſhone upon by the Sun-beams: So that it is impoſſible in words perfectly to ſet forth the likeneſs of theſe colours, much leſs for a Painter to repreſent or imitate them. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Back is covered with a Velvet black, the reſt with dusky feathers, with which is mixt ſomething of a dark green. The whole lower Belly is inveſted with feathers of the ſame colour with the back, the Wings with a dusky, as in other kinds. Near the Vent it hath a white ſpot. The Legs are ſlender and black: The Tail little more than an inch long, conſiſting of feathers of a <note n="*" place="margin">The French word ſignifies a dead leaf.</note> 
                           <hi>feuillemort</hi> colour, which at the ends are dusky about the edges. The Tail is broad, which it ſpreads very wide in flying. The Wings end with the Tail.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The <hi>ninth</hi> is for figure and bigneſs like the firſt. Its Bill is black above, and red underneath. Its whole body ſhines with that bright green colour mixt with golden, that the Belly of the ſecond ſort is of. The Wings are dusky: The Tail an inch long, pretty broad, conſiſting of feathers of the colour of poliſhed blue ſteel.</p>
                        <p>This Bird is by the <hi>Braſilians</hi> called by many other names beſides <hi>Guainumbi,</hi> as <hi>Aratica,</hi> and <hi>Aratarataguacu,</hi> as <hi>Marggrave</hi> tells us, and <hi>Guaracyaba,</hi> that is, A Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam, and <hi>Guaracigaba,</hi> that is, the hair of the Sun, according to <hi>de Laet.</hi> It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in almoſt all the hotter Countries of <hi>America.</hi> It is reported (ſaith <hi>Nierember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius)</hi> that the powder of this Bird, taken inwardly, cures the Falling ſickneſs. What I find in <hi>Marggravius</hi> concerning the Tail of the firſt <hi>Species, viz.</hi> that it conſiſts

of four feathers, I vehemently ſuſpect to be a miſtake either of the Printer, or of the Author; for in the Tail of one that I examined I found the uſual number of twelve feathers.</p>

                              <hi>Hawſinch.</hi> [The Back of a Female Bird which I deſcribed at <hi>Florence</hi> was cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous, with a certain mixture of green and red.] The Rump in moſt is white, whence alſo it took its name; in ſome it is of the ſame colour with the Back, or more red. The whole Belly is white, lightly daſhed with red. The Breaſt and Throat have a deeper tincture of red. The Belly in the Cocks is ſometimes yellowiſh. Above the Eyes is a white line continued to the hinder part of the Head. Below the Eyes a black ſtroak is extended from the corners of the mouth to the ears. [I found not this black line in the Females.]</p>
                           <p>Both the quil-feathers and covert-feathers of the Wings are all black beſides the fringes or extreme edges, which are white, tinctured with a ſordid red. The Tail is two inches and a quarter long, made up of twelve feathers, of which the two mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt have their upper half white, the reſt their lower, the other half being black. Moreover, the tips and edges of them all are white. [In the Hen the white takes up but a quarter of the feathers.]</p>
                           <p>The Bill is ſlender, ſtreight, black, more than half an inch long: The mouth is black within, the Tongue black and cloven: The aperture of the Mouth great: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes hazel-coloured. The back-toe is armed with a great Claw.</p>
                           <p>The Stomach is not very muſculous; out of which diſſected we took Beetles, and other Inſects. It breeds in forſaken Coney-burroughs.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Suſſex</hi> Shepherds, to catch theſe Birds, uſe this Art. They dig long turves of earth, and lay them acroſs the holes whereout they were digged, and about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of them hang ſnares made of horſe-hair. The Birds, being naturally very timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, if a Hawk happen to appear, or but a cloud paſs over and intercept the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, haſtily run to hide themſelves in the holes under the Turves, and ſo are caught by the Neck in the ſnares.</p>

                              <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> hath another <hi>Oenanthe,</hi> which is a little leſs than the former, but yet bigger than a <hi>Sparrow,</hi> on the Head, Neck, Back, and leſſer Wing-feathers of a reddiſh yellow, deeper on the Back, lighter on the Breaſt, having black Eyes, behind which <note place="margin">The other <hi>Oenanthe</hi> of <hi>Aldrovand.</hi>

                           </head>
                           <p>IN bigneſs it ſcarce exceeds a <hi>Wagtail.</hi> The upper ſide of the body, <hi>viz.</hi> The Back, Head, and covert-feathers of the Wings are of a pale <hi>feuille-mort</hi> colour, varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with black ſpots, placed in rows. If you heed each ſingle feather, the middle part of it about the ſhaft is black, the ſides of a <hi>feuille-mort,</hi> or dusky yellow. The Belly is white, with a tincture of red. The ſides and upper part of the Breaſt from red incline to yellow. The Breaſt in ſome is variegated with black ſpots. From the Noſthrils above the Eyes to the hinder part of the Head is drawn a pale whitiſh line: Under the Bill alſo on each ſide is a white line. The intermediate ſpace between theſe lines in ſome birds is black. [In one Bird of this kind I obſerved a white ſpot behind each Eye.] The quil-feathers of the Wings are brown, with yellowiſh edges [or of a <hi>feuille-mort</hi> colour.] From the ninth the tips of the eight following are white. The covert-feathers next above the quils are black, with red edges. In which two white ſpots do mark or characterize each Wing, one under the baſtard Wing, the other at the firſt joynt, by which note this Bird may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from all others of its kind. The middle quil-feathers towards the bottom are white. The Tail is two inches and an half long, conſiſting of twelve feathers, of all which, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the two middlemoſt, the lower half is white, the upper black, the utmoſt edges being red. The two middlemoſt in ſome birds are wholly black, in all for the greater part; having red or <hi>feuille-mort</hi> edges. They all end in ſharp points. The feathers next to the incumbent on the Tail both above and beneath reach further than its middle, ſo that they wholly hide its white part.</p>
                           <p>Its Bill is ſlender, ſtreight, ſhort, black, not only without, but alſo within: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes hazel-coloured. The Legs ſlender: The Feet, Toes, and Claws black: The lower joynt of the outmoſt Toe ſticks faſt to that of the middle one.</p>
                           <p>In the Female thoſe white ſpots of the Wing ſcarce appear, and the whole body is of a duller colour. It frequents banks and ditches, feeding upon Beetles, and other Inſects.</p>
                           <p>Nature ſometimes ſports her ſelf in the colours of this Bird: For in ſome birds the two middle feathers of the Tail are wholly black excepting the edges, which are red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh; in others their bottoms are white, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It differs from the following bird chiefly by theſe notes, 1. That the upper ſide of the body is more beautifully coloured, the feathers having their middle parts about the ſhaft black, and their borders red. 2. That in each Wing they have two white ſpots. 3. That the lower part of their Tails is white. 4. That the feathers imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately incumbent on the Tail both above and beneath run out as far and further than the middle of the tail, ſo that they wholly hide the white part thereof. 5. In the white lines reaching from the Bill to the back of the Head.</p>
                           <p>The Bird which <hi>Aldrovand</hi> ſaith is called commonly <hi>Spipola,</hi> which perchance may be the <hi>Anthus</hi> or <hi>Florus</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is near of kin to, if not the ſame with this. It is <note place="margin">The <hi>Anthus</hi> or <hi>Florus</hi> of <hi>Ariſt.</hi> Aldrov.</note> of near the ſame bigneſs: Lives about Rivers and Fens, eſpecially in moiſt meadows; and if it be driven away by Horſes feeding there, it flies away with a certain chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, wherein it ſeems after a faſhion to imitate the neighing of a horſe. Whether it be dim-ſighted or no I know not, but I hear that it flies with difficulty. As for its colour, that is rather to be called beautiful than otherwiſe; on the upper ſide through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Neck, Back, and Wings being of a dusky red, and varied with ſemilunar ſpots. The Head above is of the ſame colour, but hath not thoſe ſpots. The prime-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Wings, and thoſe that cover them are black, having their ſides and tips yellowiſh. The Bill is ſit to catch Inſects, being neither ſlender, nor thick, of a white colour tinctured with yellow. The nether ſide from the Bill to the Tail is of the ſame colour, but variegated with ſpots, ſome long, ſome round, and ſome of another fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. Its Feet are black. This differs from our <hi>Whin-chat</hi> in the colour of its Bill, and in the place where it lives; ſith our <hi>Chat</hi> abides eſpecially in heaths, and among <hi>Furze-buſhes.</hi>

                           <p>IT is of the bigneſs of a <hi>Linnet,</hi> or thereabouts: Of half an ounce weight: From Bill-point to Tail-end five inches long.

The Head is great, in the Cock almoſt wholly black, as is alſo the Throat under the Bill: In the Hen it is particoloured of black and a dirty red. The upper part of the Neck is black; on each ſide it is marked with a white ſpot, ſo that the bird ſeems to have a ring of white about its Neck.

                           <p>The prime feathers of the Wings are all dusky, excepting the two next to the body, which have a white ſpot at bottom. The edges of all are red.

                           <p>It hath a Gall-bladder; a Stomach not very fleſhy, in which diſſected we found Beetles, and other Inſects; ſhort, round, tumid blind Guts.</p>
                           <p>That which I <hi>[J.

Of the feathers of the ſecond row thoſe five on the middle joynt are black, with <hi>feuille-mort</hi> edges, the reſt are of the ſame colour with the quil-feathers. The leſſer rows are of like colour with the foreſaid five middle feathers, The Tail-feathers are all black, only their edges are paler. The Cock is black about both Eyes, and under the Throat, the tips of the feathers being white. The Breaſt and parts under the Wings in both Sexes are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous or red; the middle of the Belly being whiter. The feathers of this bird are ſoft, and ſtand ruffling out, as in a <hi>Jay.</hi> In all other points it agrees with the above deſcribed, ſo that I doubt not but it is the ſame.</p>
                           <p>The third and fourth <hi>Muſcicapae</hi> of <hi>Aldrovand</hi> differ not, I think, from this, nor from one another otherwiſe than in colour.</p>

                           <p>THis Bird was ſhot by Mr. <hi>Jeſſop</hi> in the Mountains of the <hi>Peak</hi> in <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> and ſent us by him. Its Belly is white; its Breaſt of a dusky yellow: The Head and Back of a dusky or greeniſh aſh-colour: The covert-feathers of the Tail black. The quil-feathers of the Wings likewiſe black; but from the fifth they are all white toward the bottoms, whence ariſes a whiteſpot or ſtroak croſs the Wing, from a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row beginning widening by degrees, ſo that in the laſt feathers it takes up all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Vanes; but where it is broader, it is gradually tinctured with yellow. The ſecond row of Wing-feathers is black, with whitiſh tips: The edges of the reſt of the coverts are green. The Tail is two inches and a quarter long. Its outmoſt feathers have their exteriour Webs almoſt wholly white; in the next to them the white part is narrower: All the reſt are black, but the middlemoſt deeper.</p>
                           <p>Its Bill is black, compreſſed, and almoſt triangular. The Tongue cloven and rough: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes of a hazel-colour. The Feet black; The outmoſt Toe joyned to the middlemoſt, as in other ſmall birds. The Teſticles ſmall and round. In the Stomach we found Inſects.</p>

The Feet are of a dusky yellow or Amber-colour: The back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe great; the exteriour foretoes equal, and leſs than in other ſmall birds, joyned at bottom to the middlemoſt, the interiour by an intervening membrane, which we have not obſerved in other Birds of this kind.

                           <p>THis Bird is every where ſo well known, that it may ſeem enough to name it, not needing any deſcription. It weighs ſix drachms, being in length from the point of the Bill to the end of the Tail ſeven inches three quarters; in breadth between the extremities of the Wings ſtretcht out eleven. The Bill is ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not an inch long, ſharp-pointed, and black. The Tongue cloven, and as it were torn: The Mouth within black: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes hazel-coloured: The Feet, Toes, and Claws long, and of a dark blackiſh colour. The back-claw very long, as in <hi>Larks.</hi> The outer Toe at its riſe ſticks faſt to the middle one. White feathers encompaſs the upper Chap of the Bill, then the Eyes, being produced on both ſides almoſt to the Wings. The Crown of the Head, upper and lower ſide of the Neck, as far as the Breaſt, and the Back are black: The Breaſt and Belly white. The middle of the Back from black inclines to cinereous: The Rump is black. [In another Bird, below the Throat I obſerved a ſemicircular black ſpot like a Creſcent, the horns being produced almoſt as far as the Jaws.] The Wings ſpread are of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircular figure; the quil-feathers in each eighteen in number, of which the three outmoſt end in ſharp points: The tips of the middle ones are blunt and indented; the inmoſt are adorned with white lines. The covert feathers of the firſt row are black, having their tips and edges white: Thoſe of the ſecond row have only white tips. Its Tail is very long, of about three inches and an half, which it almoſt continually wags up and down, whence alſo it took its name. The Tail hath twelve feathers, of which the two middlemoſt are longer than the reſt, and ſharp-pointed; the others all of equal length: The outmoſt are almoſt wholly white, the reſt black. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Plumage in this kind in ſeveral birds varies not a little, being in ſome more cinereous, in ſome blacker. The Liver is of a pale colour.</p>
                           <p>It is much converſant about the brinks of Rivers, and Pools, and other watry places, where it catches Flies, and water Inſects: Moreover it follows the Plough, to gather up the Worms, which together with the earth it turns up: As I find in <hi>Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus,</hi> and our Husbandmen have told me of their own obſervation; who therefore call it the <hi>Seed-bird,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> informed me.</p>
                           <p>In the Northern part of <hi>England</hi> it appears not in the Winter, and is alſo then more
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63869:126"/>
rare in the Sòuthern: Either becauſe it is impatient of cold, or for want of meat; Flies, and other winged Inſects, on which it chiefly feeds, being not to be found in Winter-time. In the Gizzard of one diſſected we found Inſects like to <hi>Meal-worms. Geſner</hi> writes, that the Fowlers in his Country have obſerved the <hi>Cuckow-chicken</hi> hatch'd and brought up by this bird: The ſame, <hi>Albertus,</hi> and our experience alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, as we have <note n="*" place="margin">In the Chapter of the Cuckow.</note> elſewhere ſhewn.</p>
                           <p>One or two ounces of the powder of this Bird put in a Pot cloſe-ſtopt and bak'd in an Oven together with the feathers, taken in <hi>Saxiſrage</hi> water, or ſtrong White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine is ſaid to be good againſt the Stone, eſpecially that of the Kidneys. But <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Benedictus</hi> thinks, that the modern Phyſicians, who commend this Medicine through miſtake, mean the <hi>Wren</hi> when they name the <hi>Wagtail:</hi> As if the <hi>Wagtail</hi> were of no force in breaking the Stone. <hi>Geſner</hi> (to whom alſo we readily aſſent) thinks that it matters not much what bird be burnt, ſith the vertue of the aſhes of almoſt all birds ſeem to be the ſame. Yet (ſaith he) if there be any difference, I would prefer thoſe ſorts of birds which feed upon Inſects, as Flies, Ants, and the like.</p>

                           <p>IN bigneſs and ſhape of body it agrees with the white.

                           <p>The Tail is two inches three quarters long, conſiſting of twelve feathers, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle two whereof are ſharper than the reſt.

The quil-feathers in number eighteen; of which the ſixteenth is longer than thoſe next it, and hath the outward limb white. The tips of the middle covert-feathers are of a greeniſh white; elſe the Wings are all over dusky. The Bill is black: The Tongue cloven, but not hairy. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes from cinereous incline to a hazel-colour. The Feet are black: The outer fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe is joyned to the middle one at bottom. The Spur or Claw of the back-toe is long as in a <hi>Larks:</hi> The blind guts ſhort. Some birds in this kind are much yellower or greener than others.</p>
                           <p>It builds upon the ground among the Corn; making its Neſt of bents and the ſtalks of herbs, ſpreading hairs within under the Eggs. It lays at one time four or five Eggs, varied with dusky ſpots and lines drawn without any order.</p>

                              <hi>TItmice</hi> are a ſort of ſmall birds, that are found for the moſt part about trees, and live chiefly upon Inſects which they find there. <hi>Turner</hi> writes, that they feed not only upon Worms, but alſo Hemp-ſeed and Nuts, which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forate with their ſharp Bills. Some of theſe build in holes of trees: Others make Neſts of an Oval figure, with a hole left open in the ſide to go in and out at. They are reſtleſs birds, never ſitting long ſtill in a place, but flitting from bough to bough, and from tree to tree. They have ſhort Bills, but bigger for the bulk of their bodies than the precedent ſmall birds: Small bodies; and long Tails. The moſt of them are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norous: But all of them multiparous, laying many Eggs ere they ſit. <hi>Titmice</hi> are called by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>

The Rump is blue: The Breaſt, Belly, and Thighs are yellow: Yet the lower or hindmoſt part of the Belly white. A broad, black line reaching from the Throat to the Vent divides the Breaſt and Belly in

The outer edges of thoſe three next the body are green. Of the covert feathers of the firſt row, thoſe that are about the middle of the Wing, with their white tips make a tranſverſe white line. The ſmaller covert-feathers of the Wings are blue.

Of the interiour capacity all the ſides, it ſeemed, as well as the bottom, were covered and lined with feathers, for the more ſoft and warm lying of the Young. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſuperficies round about was fenced and ſtrengthened with fragments of that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Moſs, which every where grows on trees, firmly bound together. In the forepart reſpecting the Sun-riſe, and that above (where an arched roof of the ſame uniform matter and texture with the ſides and bottom covered the Neſt) was ſeen a little hole, ſcarce big enough one would think to admit the old one.

The <hi>French</hi> from the bigneſs of its Bill do fitly call it <hi>Grosbec;</hi> the <hi>Italians, Friſone</hi> or <hi>Froſone. Heſychius</hi> and <hi>Varinus</hi> of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>It is bigger than a <hi>Chaffinch</hi> by about one third part; ſhort-bodied: Its Head bigger than for the proportion of the body. Its Bill very great, hard, from a broad baſe ending in a ſharp point, of the figure of a Cone or Funnel, half an inch long, having a large cavity within, of a whitiſh fleſh-colour, almoſt like that of the interiour ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the mother of Pearl ſhell, only the tip blackiſh. The Eyes are grey or aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured, as in <hi>Jackdaws.</hi> The Tongue ſeems as it were cut off, as in the <hi>Chaffinch.</hi> The Feet are of a pale red: The Claws great, eſpecially thoſe of the middle and back-toes. The middle Toe is the longeſt; the outer fore-toe and the back-toe are equal one to the other.</p>
                           <p>At the baſe of the Bill grow Orange-coloured feathers, between the Bill and the Eyes black. The lower Chap in the Males is compaſſed with a border of black fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The head is of a yellowiſh red, or ruſty colour: The Neck cinereous. The Back red, the middle parts of the feathers being whitiſh. The Rump from yellow
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:63869:129"/>
inclines to cinereous. The ſides and Breaſt, but eſpecially the ſides, are of a mixt colour of red and cinereous. Under the Tail, and in the middle of the Belly the Plumage is whiter. [In another bird the Back was of a grey or aſh-colour, tinctured with red: The Head and Throat greeniſh: The ſides and Breaſt painted with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe black lines.]</p>
                           <p>The quil-feathers in each Wing are eighteen in number, of which the nine or ten foremoſt for half way from the ſhaft inward are white. The white part from the firſt inward being dilated. Of the ſubſequent one half is white, but not ſo far as the ſhaft: The three inmoſt or next the body are red. The tips of all from the ſecond to the tenth ſhine with a changeable colour of purpliſh and blue, like the Necks of <hi>Pigeons.</hi> From the tenth the exteriour borders of the ſixth or ſeventh ſucceeding are grey, elſe they are all dusky. The Tail is but ſhort, of about two inches length, compoſed of twelve feathers, ſpotted at the top on their interiour Vanes with white, on their exteriour in the middle feathers with red, in the outer with black. [In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bird the middle feathers of the Tail were greeniſh]</p>
                           <p>About <hi>Frankefort</hi> on the <hi>Main,</hi> and elſewhere in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in <hi>Italy,</hi> it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. In Summer time it lives in the Woods and Mountains; in the Winter it comes down into the Plains. It ſeldom comes over to us in <hi>England, viz.</hi> only in hard Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. It breaks the ſtones of Cherries, and even of Olives with expedition, the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels whereof it is very greedy of. The Stomach of one we diſſected in the Month of <hi>December</hi> was full of the ſtones of <hi>Holly-berries.</hi> It feeds alſo upon Hemp-ſeed, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic,</hi> &amp;c. and moreover upon the buds of trees, like the <hi>Bulfinch.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is ſaid to build in the holes of trees, and to lay five or ſix Eggs. It weighs an ounce and three quarters: Is in length from Bill to Claws ſeven inches and an half; in breadth between the tips of the Wings extended twelve and an half.</p>

                           <p>IT is as big as a <hi>Blackbird,</hi> or ſomething leſs. A black border compaſſes the Eyes and Bill; which is like to that of the common <hi>Hawfinch,</hi> or a little ſhorter. The Head is adorned with a towring creſt, which it often moves as well toward the Bill, as toward the Tail. The colour of the whole is a lovely Scarlet, in the Head and Tail more dilute. It is brought into <hi>England</hi> out of <hi>Virginia;</hi> whence, and from its rare ſinging, it is called, The <hi>Virginian Nightingale.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Of this Bird <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> writes thus: In its native Soil, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Iſlands of <hi>Capo Verde,</hi> it is commonly called <hi>Fruſo,</hi> a name very like to our <hi>Italian Friſone,</hi> [i. e. <hi>Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothrauſti vulgari]</hi> to which alſo it is very like in the Bill. Moreover, a black line or border encompaſſes its Bill; and it is (as <hi>Hieronymus Mercurialis</hi> witneſſes) of the bigneſs of a <hi>Thruſh.</hi> Wherefore alſo we thought fit to call it <hi>Coccothrauſtes Indica.</hi> It greedily devours Almonds, in which alſo it agrees with the <hi>Grosbeak,</hi> which with its Bill cracks ſuch kind of fruits, and other Grains or ſtones; whence it is called <hi>Nuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſraga</hi> or <hi>Nut-cracker.</hi> And that this Bird doth the like it is very probable, ſeeing it is likewiſe armed with a very thick and ſtrong Bill. <hi>Mercurialis</hi> affirms, that by the <hi>Portugues</hi> it is commonly called, The <hi>Cardinal bird,</hi> becauſe it is of a ſcarlet <hi>[purpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rei]</hi> colour, and ſeems to wear on its Head a red hat. Of the nature and qualities of this Bird <hi>Fr. Malochius,</hi> Praefect of the Phyſic-garden at <hi>Piſa,</hi> gave me this account. It imitates the notes of birds, eſpecially the <hi>Nightingale:</hi> it is greedy of <hi>Panic</hi> and <hi>Almonds,</hi> devours <hi>Chickweed;</hi> ſeeing its Image in a glaſs it hath many ſtrange geſticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, making a hiſſing noiſe, lowring its creſt, ſetting up its Tail after the manner of the <hi>Peacock,</hi> ſhaking its Wings, in fine ſtriking at the Looking-glaſs with its Bill. The temper of its body is very hot, which thence appears that it often immerſes it ſelf in water. It is of a very gentle nature, and will take meat out of ones hand. Its ſhape is as followeth. It hath a tuft on its Head of a triangular figure, and ſcarlet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, with which colour alſo the Neck, Breaſt, and Belly are adorned. The ends of the Wings are not of ſo deep a ſcarlet, as neither the Tail, which for the proportion of the body is pretty long, of about a Palm, ſomething erected, as broad as ones little ſinger. The Legs are ſhort and whitiſh: The Claws ſtrong, and ſomething crooked. The whole bird meaſured from Head to Tail is full two Palms long.</p>

                        <p>IT is bigger than a <hi>Houſe-Sparrow;</hi> of an ounce and ⅛ weight; of ſix inches and an half length, meaſuring from Bill-point to the Feet or Tails end: of ten inches and an half breadth between the extreme terms of the Wings expanded. It is called by ſome the <hi>Green Linnet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Its Bill is like that of the <hi>Grosbeak,</hi> but much leſs, of half an inch length, ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and not crooked: The upper Mandible dusky, the nether all whitiſh. The Tongue is ſharp, and as it were cut off, ending in filaments: The Eyes furniſhed with nictating membranes: The Noſthrils round, ſituate in the upper part of the Bill next the Head: The Feet of a fleſh-colour; the Claws dusky. The outer Toe at bottom ſticks faſt to the middle one.</p>
                        <p>The Head and Back are green, the edges of the feathers being grey. The middle of the Back hath ſomething of a Cheſnut colour intermingled. The Rump is of a deeper green or yellow: The Belly white: The Breaſt of a yellowiſh green: The Throat of the ſame colour with the Neck: The feathers contiguous to the Bill are of a deep yellowiſh green.</p>
                        <p>The borders of the outmoſt quil-feathers of the Wings are yellow, of the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt green, of the inmoſt grey. The inner feathers of the ſecond row are grey, the outer green. All the reſt of the covert-feathers of the Wings are green. The fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers along the baſe or (if you pleaſe) ridge of the Wing are of a lovely yellow. The coverts alſo of the underſides of the Wings are yellow. The Tail is two inches and a quarter long, made up of twelve feathers; of which the two middlemoſt are all over black, thoſe next have their outer edges yellow: The remaining four on each ſide from the middle outwardly are black, but all their inner Webs from top to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom yellow.</p>
                        <p>The Liver is divided into two Lobes, and hath a Gall-bladder annexed. The bird we diſſected had a large Craw, a muſculous ſtomach, filled with ſeeds of Plants.</p>
                        <p>It builds in hedges: The outmoſt part of its Neſt is made of hay, graſs, or ſtubble; the middle of Moſs; the inmoſt, on which the Eggs lie, of feathers, wool, and hair. In this Neſt it lays five or ſix Eggs, near an inch long, of a pale green colour, ſprinkled with ſanguine ſpots, eſpecially at the blunt end.</p>
                        <p>The colours of the Hen are more languid, not ſo bright and lively: And on the Breaſt and Back it hath oblong dusky ſpots.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Chloris</hi> of <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> according to his deſcription, ſeems to be leſs green than ours. It feeds upon the ſeed of <hi>Rape, Thiſtles, Docks,</hi> and moſt willingly <hi>Canary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs,</hi> as do other birds of this kind.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Anthus</hi> or <hi>Florus</hi> of <hi>Bellonius,</hi> called in <hi>French, Bruant,</hi> is of kin to this. He <note place="margin">The <hi>Anthus</hi> of <hi>Bellonius: Le Bruant.</hi>
                           </note> deſcribes it thus: <hi>Le Bruant</hi> in <hi>French</hi> hath its name from its voice: For when it ſings it expreſſes the word <hi>Bruire.</hi> As it flies it makes a noiſe. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign">

The extremities of the Tail-feathers are alſo altogether yellow; but within of another colour. The Bill is great and ſharp, of a pale colour: The Legs and Feet are ſomething red. They are kept in Cages for the ſweetneſs of their ſinging. They feed for the moſt part upon Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, and keep much about tall trees, far remote from Meadows. It hatches at leaſt five young ones.</p>

[In the elder birds it is ſomething crooked.] The Tongue is as it were cut off: Its Eyes are hazel-coloured: Its Claws black: Its Legs dusky. The lower joynt of the outmoſt Toe ſticks faſt to the middle Toe.</p>
                           <p>The Head for the proportion of the body is great. In the Male a lovely ſcarlet or crimſon colour illuſtrates the Breaſt, Throat, and Jaws, as far as the Eyes. The fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on the crown of the Head above the Eyes, and thoſe that compaſs the Bill, are black: The Rump and Belly white: The Neck and Back grey, with a certain tincture of red. [The Neck, Back, and Shoulders ſeemed to me blue or aſh-coloured.] The quil-feathers of the Wings are in number eighteen; the laſt or inmoſt of which on the outer half from the ſhaft is red, on the inner black and gloſſie. Of the reſt the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour <hi>[i. e.</hi> thoſe next the body] are black, with a gloſs of blue; the exteriour duſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky or black.

The tips of the lower covert-feathers are cinereous, in the interiour more, in the exteriour leſs. The next to theſe are of the ſame colour with the Back. The Tail is two inches long, black, and ſhining, made up of twelve feathers.</p>
                           <p>The Cock is of equal bigneſs to the Hen, but hath a flatter crown, and excels her in the beauty of his colours.</p>
                           <p>They feed moſt willingly upon thoſe buds of trees which break forth before, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are pregnant with, the leaves and flowers, eſpecially thoſe of the Apple-tree, Pear-tree, Peach-tree, and other Garden-trees; and by that means bring no ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to the Gardeners, who therefore hate and deſtroy them as a great Peſt of their Gardens, intercepting their hopes of Fruit.</p>

                              <hi>Turner</hi> writes, that they are very docile birds, and will nearly imitate the ſound of a Pipe [or the Whiſtle of a man] with their voice. They are much eſteemed for their ſinging with us in <hi>England,</hi> and deſervedly in my judgment. For therein they excel all ſmall birds, if perchance you except the <hi>Linnet.</hi> I hear (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus)</hi> that the Hen in this kind ſings as well as the Cock, contrary to what is uſual in moſt other ſorts of birds.</p>

                        <p>IN ſhape of body it is not much unlike the <hi>Green-finch:</hi> It weighs an ounce and half, and from tip of Bill to Tail end is ſix inches three quarters long.</p>
                        <p>Its Bill is thick, hard, ſtrong, black, and contrary to the manner of all other birds, crooked both ways, the Mandibles near their tips croſſing one another: For the lower, being drawn out into a ſharp point, turns upward, the upper bends down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Neither do they always obſerve the ſame ſide; for in ſome birds the upper Chap hangs down on the right ſide, the nether riſes up on the left; in others contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, the lower takes the right ſide, the upper the left. The lower Chap is like the <hi>Chafinches,</hi> neither is the Tongue different. The Noſthrils are round: The Ears great and wide: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes from grey tend to a hazel-colour: The Feet dusky, the Claws black. The loweſt joynt of the outmoſt toe ſticks to that of the middlemoſt.</p>
                        <p>The middle parts of the Back and Head feathers are black, the edges green. In the Head there is ſomething of cinereous mixt with the other colours. The Rump is green: The Chin aſh-coloured: The Breaſt green: The Belly white, only under the Tail the middle parts of the feathers are black or dusky.</p>
                        <p>Each Wing hath eighteen quil-feathers, all blackiſh, only the outer edges of the foremoſt are green. The Tail conſiſts of twelve feathers, two inches and a quarter long, and black, with green edges. The Guts have many ſpiral convolutions. The blind guts are very ſhort.</p>
                        <p>This bird was deſcribed in the Autumn: He that ſold it told us that it changed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours thrice in a year, being green in the Autumn, yellow in the Winter, and red in the Spring. <hi>Geſner</hi> alſo ſaith, that they are firſt of all red on the Breaſt, Neck, and Belly; that then they grow yellow: And that they change colour eſpecially in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Some affirm, that it changes colour every year, ſo that it ſometimes declines more to yellow, ſometimes to green, red, or aſh-colour. That it changes its colour with age, or according to the different ſeaſons of the year, we cannot but think probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo well atteſted. Perchance alſo in the ſame age and ſeaſon of the year the colour in divers birds may be different. For we ſaw and bought at <hi>Nurenberg</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> two of this ſort of birds brought up together in one Cage, of which one was green, the other red, when the Summer was almoſt ſpent, and Autumn coming on. But however the colours may differ, this bird is ſufficiently characterized by the make of it Bill. Kept in Cages they climb up and down the ſides with the Bills and Feet, after the manner of <hi>Parrots.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is a moſt voracious bird; much delighted and feeding very fat with Hemp-ſeed. It alſo loves Fir-kernels, and in the Months of <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February</hi> builds its Neſt in thoſe, or the like trees. They ſay, that with one ſtroak of its bill, it will in a trice divide an Apple in halves, that it may feed upon the Kernels, by that means doing a great deal of miſchief in Orchards.</p>
                        <p>In ſome parts of <hi>Germany, Bavaria, Suevia, Noricum,</hi> they are found in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers all the year round. Sometimes they come over to us, and in the Weſtern part of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> make bad work, ſpoiling a great deal of fruit in our Orchards.</p>
                        <p>One thing alſo more (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus)</hi> ſeemeth to me ſtrange and unuſual in the <hi>Croſs-bill;</hi> that in the Winter-time, when all things ſhrink with cold, and other birds are mute, ſhe ſings; and in Summer, when other birds ſing, ſhe is ſilent.

                           <p>The Hen-bird wants that black ſpot under the Throat, as alſo the white ſpots on the Neck, and above the Eyes: Its Head and Neck being alſo of the ſame colour with the Rump: The nether ſide of the body of a ſordid white. Inſtead of a white line croſs the Wings it hath black feathers with pale reddiſh tips. In general the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours all the body over are not ſo fair and lively.</p>
                           <p>Each Wing hath eighteen quil-feathers, dusky, with reddiſh edges. From the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Wing a broad white line is extended to the next joynt. Above this line the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert-feathers of the Wings are of a <note n="*" place="margin">A colour near to cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut, but red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> ſpadiceous colour; beneath they have their middle parts black, their exteriour edges red. The Tail hath twelve feathers, and is two inches and a quarter long, the middlemoſt feathers being ſomething ſhorter than the reſt: All of a dusky blackiſh colour, with reddiſh edges.</p>
                           <p>Its Teſticles are great, as being a very ſalacious bird. Its Guts nine inches long: The blind Guts very ſhort. Its Stomach muſculous, it feeding upon Wheat, Barley, and other Grain. The Womb of the Female is great. It hath a Gall-bladder.</p>
                           <p>Whether or no it be ſo ſhort-lived as is reported, I think there is ſome reaſon to doubt.</p>
                           <p>This kind of bird doth ſometimes vary in colour: <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> ſetting forth a white and a yellow <hi>Sparrow:</hi> The figures and deſcriptions whereof may be ſeen in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Book of his <hi>Ornithology,</hi> Chap. 11, 12.</p>

                           <p>The Head in the Cock is blue, but the feathers contiguous to the Noſthrils black. The Back is reddiſh with a mixture of aſh-colour or green: The Breaſt red; the Belly under the Tail white.</p>
                           <p>The colours of the Hen are not ſo bright and lively. But its Rump is green: Its Back not ſo red: The Belly from red inclines to a dirty kind of green. The Breaſt alſo is of a duller colour.</p>
                           <p>The Quil-feathers in each Wing, in number eighteen, all but the three firſt, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt have their bottoms and interiour Webs white; their exteriour edges yellowiſh, or rather green. In the Cock the ſmall feathers inveſting the ridge or <hi>baſis</hi> of the Wing are blue. Above in each Wing is a remarkable white ſpot: Then after an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſtice of black ſucceeds a long white fillet, beginning from the fourth quill, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:63869:134"/>
after the tenth continued through the tops of the covert-feathers. That part of this white fillet which paſſes through the tips of the coverts is tinctured with yellow.</p>
                           <p>The Tail is two inches and an half long, and made up of twelve feathers, of which the outmoſt on each ſide have their bottoms, and alſo their tops on the outſide the ſhaft black, their middle part white. The next to theſe have leſs white, <hi>viz.</hi> only near the top, and on the outſide the ſhaft: The three ſubſequent on both ſides are black: the two middlemoſt cinereous with greeniſh edges.</p>
                           <p>The Liver is divided into two Lobes, the right being the biggeſt. The Stomach not very fleſhy. The outmoſt Toe in each foot, as in other ſmall birds, grows to the middlemoſt at bottom.</p>
                           <p>This bird ſometimes varies in the colour of its feathers. For <hi>Geſner</hi> affirms, that himſelf had ſeen a <hi>Chaffinch</hi> all over white: And <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> deſcribes two others, one whoſe whole body from white declined to yellow: Another that was partly yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh, and partly blackiſh.</p>
                           <p>They are (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus)</hi> birds of paſſage: They love moderate cold, but are offended by immoderate. But with us in <hi>England</hi> they fear no cold, abiding here all Winter, be the weather never ſo ſharp: Neither is there any Bird more frequent in all parts of this Land, excepting perchance the <hi>Lark,</hi> the <hi>Sparrow,</hi> and the <hi>Yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hammer.</hi>

                           <p>IN weight and bigneſs it agrees with the precedent. Its Bill is thick, ſtrong, ſtreigt, from a broad baſe diminiſhing into a ſharp point, almoſt like a Cone or Funnel; in ſome birds wholly black, in others black at point, and yellow at bottom. Its Tongue like the <hi>Chaffinches;</hi> the upper Chap of equal length with the lower, its ſides ſtrong and thin'd into ſharp edges. [The Bill of the Female hath no part yellow.] Its Feet of a pale dusky colour: The outer Toe joyned to the middle below, as in other ſmall birds. From the head to the middle of the Back the colour in the Cock is like that of a <hi>Starling,</hi> a ſhining black, the edges of the feathers being of a reddiſh aſh-colour. The lower part of the Back is white. The Throat is of a yellowiſh red; the Breaſt white; the feathers behind the Vent reddiſh.</p>
                           <p>In the Female the Head from red or dusky inclines to cinereous: The Neck is aſh-coloured: The feathers of the Back have their middle parts black, their borders of that ſame reddiſh aſh-colour. The Throat is not ſo red as in the Cock. Within the ridge of the Wing it hath leſs yellow, and without no Orange colour. In brief it is every where more diſcoloured.</p>
                           <p>The interiour quil-feathers of the Wings are red, the inmoſt of all black, with red edges. Beginning from the fourth, ſeventh, or eighth of the ſubſequent feathers have a white ſpot on the outſide their ſhafts, by the tips of the feathers of the ſecond row. Underneath alſo their exteriour edges are whitiſh; elſe the quil-feathers are all black. The Plumage near the baſe of the Wing underneath is of a lovely yellow, above of an Orange colour.</p>
                           <p>The Tail is four inches ⅛ long, compounded of twelve feathers, of a black colour, but the exteriour Web of the outmoſt feather on both ſides is white, and ſometimes alſo the interiour. The tips and edges of the two middle feathers are of a reddiſh aſh-colour.</p>
                           <p>At <hi>Venice</hi> we found great numbers of theſe birds in the Poulterers ſhops in Winter time; whence we infer that they are common in the Country thereabouts at leaſt in that ſeaſon of the year. They are found alſo in <hi>England,</hi> but more rarely.</p>
                           <p>Theſe birds alſo ſometimes vary in their colours. Hence in <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> we have three figures and deſcriptions of <hi>Montifringillae:</hi> Of which that in the ſecond place is of a paler colour, and hath its head wholly white. The third is altogether like the firſt, ſave that under the Bill it hath no black: And beſides that ſecond yellow ſtroak which is in others, in this was far more conſpicuous.</p>

                           <p>IT is equal in bigneſs to the common <hi>Lark,</hi> from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail being five inches and a quarter long; and between the extremes of the Wings ſtretched out twelve and three quarters broad. Its Bill is half an inch long, of a yellow colour, with a black tip. The end of the Tongue is divided into filaments. The top of the Head of a fulvous red, darker toward the Bill. [Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the Head and upper part of the Neck a dusky red or cheſnut colour.] The upper ſide of the Neck, the Rump and ſides are alſo red: So is the Breaſt, but paler, the reſt of the under ſide, Throat, Belly, Wings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is white. The underſide of the Neck, the Back and ſcapular feathers are elegantly variegated with black and a reddiſh aſh-colour; the middle part of each feather being black, and the outſides red. The black ſpots appear of a triangular figure. In the upper part of the Wings and bottom of the Back there is more of red.</p>
                           <p>Each wing hath eighteen prime feathers, of which the eight outmoſt or longeſt are black; yet their bottoms, as far as they are hidden by the ſecond row, except the outer edge of the outmoſt feather are white: Moreover, the very tips, or rather edges of the tips of all excepting the two outmoſt, are white. The ſeven next, which take up the middle part of the Wing, are wholly white, ſave that near the tip on the outſide each feather hath an oblong black ſpot. The remaining three or four next the body are black, having their uppermoſt edges red. All the covert-feathers of the Wings, excepting thoſe next the body, and two or three, which make up the baſtard Wing, are white; thoſe excepted being black. But Nature (as I ſee) obſerves not an exact rule in the colours of this birds Wings: For in the bird deſcribed by Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lughby</hi> the covert-feathers of the black quils were for the moſt part black, of the white ones white: Yet in general in all birds that we have ſeen there were large white ſpaces in each Wing. The Tail is ſomewhat forked, two inches and an half long, made up of twelve feathers, the two outmoſt whereof on each ſide being wholly white, ſave a very little of the outer edge toward the tip, which is black, more in the outmoſt, leſs in the next. The outward Web of the third on each ſide almoſt from the top quite down to the bottom is white: The remaining ſix are black, having only their edges about their tips white. The Legs, Feet, and Claws are cole-black. The back-Claw or Spur is longer than the reſt, as in <hi>Larks,</hi> of about half an inch. The outmoſt Toe for a good ſpace from the divarication is joyned to the middle one, as in moſt ſmall birds.</p>
                           <p>This Bird Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> found and killed in <hi>Lincolnſhire.</hi> Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſent us the Bird it ſelf, and the deſcription of it out of the Northern part of <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>

                           <p>The Hen-bird hath a ſmaller note than the Cock, and ſings not ſo much, and the feathers on the ridge of the Wing are dusky or cinereous, whereas in the Cocks they are cole-black: and theſe (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus)</hi> are conſtant and infallible marks by which the Sexes may be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Goldfinches</hi> are gregarious birds, for the elegancy of their colours and ſweetneſs of their ſinging every where well known and highly eſteemed. They are of a mild and gentle nature, as may even thence appear, that preſently after they are caught, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing any art or care, they will fall to their meat and drink; nor are they ſo ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and affrighted at the preſence of a man, as to ſtrike their Bills and Wings againſt the ſides of the Cage, as moſt other birds are wont to do. Nor are they very much troubled at their captivity and impriſonment in a Cage: Nay, if they have continued there a good while, they like it ſo well, that though you let them looſe, they will not fly away, as (ſaith <hi>Aldrovand)</hi> I my ſelf have obſerved, to whom I refer the Reader. They feed upon the ſeeds of Thiſtles in Winter times, from whence they took their name, and not of Thiſtles only, but of Teaſel, and Hemp, and Dock, and Poppy, as <hi>Albertus</hi> tells us. The <hi>Goldfinch</hi> kept in a Cage will with its Bill draw up a little pot of water hanging upon a ſtring, and putting its foot ſometimes under the ſtring when it can reach the Pot, will drink out of it, and quench its thirſt, which other ſmall birds alſo will learn to do. Beſides that little Thiſtle-finch (ſaith <hi>Turner)</hi> adorned with a golden fillet, I know another ſpinivorous bird of a green colour, which, in like manner as the <hi>Goldfinch,</hi> out of two pots, one going up, the other mean time go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, will take meat out of the one, and drink out of the other. The ſame doth alſo the <hi>Millet-bird,</hi> which our Country men call a <hi>Linnet.</hi> The ſame likewiſe will imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate any tune you whiſtle to it. So then not only that bird which is in Greek called <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, and in <hi>Latine</hi> by <hi>Gaza</hi> rendred <hi>Carduelis,</hi> will do what you bid it, and uſe its Bill and Feet for a hand, but many others alſo. All which things (ſaith <hi>Aldrovan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus)</hi> daily experience proves to be moſt true. It builds its Neſt in thorns, and trees. <hi>Geſner</hi> affirms, that it lays ſeven Eggs, <hi>Bellonius,</hi> eight: The difference is not great, and it may lay ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other number.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Goldfinch,</hi> by reaſon of age, ſex, or other accidents, varies ſometimes in its colours. <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> ſets forth four varieties: 1. One not full grown, which had no red at all on its Head: 2. One with white Eye-lids: 3. A white one with a red head: 4. A whitiſh one, which yet on the forepart of the Head and under the Chin had ſomething of red. Beſides which he deſcribes alſo a bird of kin to the <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch,</hi> (which perchance was a baſtard kind) in theſe words.</p>
                           <p>In bulk of body it exceeds a <hi>Goldfinch,</hi> being equal to a <hi>Chaffinch.</hi> A circle of a lively <note place="margin">A Bird of kin to the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finch.</note> Saffron colour encompaſſes the Bill. Its Eyes are like a <hi>Goldfinches,</hi> but bigger. Its Head, except the Saffron ring now mentioned, and its Back are of the ſame colour, <hi>viz.</hi> blackiſh. The Breaſt is of a black green, as are alſo the ſmall feathers, covering the ridges of the Wings: Whoſe quil-feathers are black, and much more varied or diſtinguiſhed with white, than in other birds of this kind. That part which in other <hi>Thiſtle-finches</hi> is yellow, in this is of a pale colour. The Tail of as deep a black as in others; but in the two outmoſt Tail-feathers on each ſide when extended appeared ſomething of white; which otherwiſe, when the Tail was cloſed, was hidden, and not expoſed to view. The whole Belly from cinereous inclined to dusky.</p>

                           <p>IT weighs about an ounce: From the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail being half a foot long; between the tips of the Wings ſpread forth ten inches broad. Its Bill is half an inch long, thick, ſtrong, black above, white underneath. The Tongue is as it were cut off: The Noſthrils round: The Head particoloured of cinereous and black; the Back of black and reddiſh, the middle part of each feather being black, the edges or outſides in the Head cinereous, in the Back reddiſh. The Breaſt is white: The lower Belly about the Vent yellowiſh. The region of the Craw or bottom of the Gullet is of a lovely red, the edges of the feathers being yellowiſh. Each Wing hath eighteen quil-feathers, all black but the edges, which in the exteriour are whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, in the interiour red. The foremoſt feathers of the ſecond row are black, the edges of the interiour, or thoſe next the riſe of the Wing red. The leſſer covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers about the ridge or baſe of the Wing are red. The Tail is ſomewhat forked, its two outmoſt feathers being two inches and a quarter long; the middle only two: Of the middle two the borders or edges are red, of the reſt white. The Tail conſiſts of the uſual number of twelve feathers. It delights to feed upon Line-ſeed, whence <hi>Geſner,</hi> in imitation of the <hi>French,</hi> (who call it <hi>Linote)</hi> impoſed on it the name of <hi>Linaria.</hi> It ſeems not to have been deſcribed or mentioned by the Ancients: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, <hi>Bellonius</hi> makes it to be the <hi>Aegithus</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> It is kept in Cages with us for the ſweetneſs of its ſinging; wherein, in my judgment, it excels all other ſmall birds. It feeds upon Canary ſeed, Panic, Millet (whence alſo it is by ſome called <hi>Miliaria)</hi> Rape-ſeed, Cole-ſeed, and Hemp-ſeed. But whatever ſeed it eats it firſt <note n="*" place="margin">

But Hemp-ſeed (that we may note that by the by) makes birds that feed upon it ſo fat that it either kills them, or takes from them all courage and liſt to ſing. <hi>Olina</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Linnet</hi> builds in trees that are not very tall, and lays three or four Eggs. We have obſerved it to build in black or white thorn buſhes, or Furze-buſhes. Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> aſcribes to the Feet of this bird an obſcure dusky or blarkiſh colour; <hi>Olina</hi> a middle colour between fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:63869:136"/>
and white. Perchance the Feet of the younger birds are paler, of the old darker coloured: Or thoſe of the Cock blacker, the Hen-birds white. Mr. <hi>Jeſſop</hi> ſent us a Linnet of the common ſort with Feet perfectly black, but that was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.</p>

                           <p>YOu may take the young ones out at four days old, if you intend they ſhall learn to whiſtle or hear any other birds ſong: For then being ſo young they have not the old birds ſong, and are more apt to take any thing than if you ſuffer them to be in the Neſt till they are almoſt quite fledg'd. You muſt be ſure when you take them out ſo young, to keep them very warm, and to feed them but a little at a time. Your meat muſt be Rape-ſeed ſoaked, and then bruiſed, mingled with full as much ſoaked white-bread. You muſt make freſh every day; for if it be ſour, it immediately makes them ſcour, and not long after die. You muſt not give them their meat too dry, for if you do it will make them Vent-burned; and that is as bad as if they ſcoured. If you intend to whiſtle to them, do it when you feed them. For they will learn very much before they can crack hard ſeeds. So hang them under any bird you intend they ſhall learn his Song. I have known ſeveral that have been taught to ſpeak.</p>
                           <p>You may know the Cock-Linnet by theſe two marks: 1. The Cock is much browner on the Back and pinion of the Wing than the Hen. 2. By the white of the Wing. Take your young Linnet when the Wing-feathers are grown, and ſtretch out his Wing, holding his body faſt with the other hand (otherwiſe I have known them by a ſudden jerk to break their Wings) and then obſerve the white upon the fourth, fifth, and ſixth feather, if it be gloſſie and gliſtering, and the white goes cloſe to the quill, this is a certain ſign of a Cock.</p>

                              <p n="1">1. This Bird is ſometimes troubled with melancholy, and then you will find the end of his Rump to be very much ſwelled; which you muſt prick with a Needle, and let out all the corruption, ſqueezing it out very well with the point of the Needle; then anoint him with the ointment made of freſh butter and Capons greaſe, and feed him for two or three days with Lettice, or Beet ſeeds, and the leaves alſo: And you may give him the ſeeds of Melons chopt in pieces, which he will eat very greedily; and when you find him to mend take the Melon ſeeds away, and give him his old diet again: Put into his water two or three blades of Saffron and white Sugar-candy for a Week or more, till you perceive the bird to be wholly recovered.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. The diſeaſe this Bird is moſt troubled withal is a ſcouring; of which there are three ſorts: The firſt very thin, and with a black ſubſtance in the middle, which is not very dangerous; for I have known many ſing very ſtrong and laviſh when they have had this ſcouring in a very violent manner. The ſecond is between a black and a white, but not ſo thin as the other, but very clammy and ſticking. This is worſe than the former. It is recovered by giving your bird ſome Melon-ſeed ſhred, and Lettuce ſeeds and Beet ſeeds bruiſed, and in his water ſome Liquorice and white Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-candy, with a little flour of Oatmeal. You muſt be diligent at the firſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him when he is ſick, that ſo he may have a ſtomach to eat: For in two or three days his ſtomach will be quite gone, and then it will be hard recovering him again. The third and worſt ſort of ſcouring is the white clammy ſcouring, which is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and mortal, if not well looked after at the firſt. This is occaſioned by bad ſeeds, and many times for want of water. If it be not taken at the firſt appearance it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cauſeth him to droop, and fall from his meat, and then all medicines are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Firſt, give him Flax-ſeeds, taking away all other ſeeds; then give him Plantain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeds, if green, otherwiſe they will do him no good: For want of Plantain-ſeeds give him ſome of the Leaves ſhred ſmall, and ſome Oatmeal bruiſed, with a few crums of bread: And in his water give him ſome white Sugar-candy and Liquorice, with a blade or two of Saffron.</p>

                              <p>THis is ſomething leſs than the <hi>common Linnet:</hi> Its Bill ſhort, thick, of a Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal figure like the <hi>Chaffinches,</hi> the upper Chap black, the lower at the baſe white: The Tongue ſharp, and as it were cut off, as in the <hi>Chaffinch:</hi> The Noſthrils round: The Eyes hazel-coloured. The crown of the head adorned with a red or ſanguine colour, but not very bright and ſhining. The reſt of the Head and Neck round about are cinereous. The Shoulders, Back, and covert feathers of the Wings are red. The Breaſt is tinctured with red. The ſides under the Wings are of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh red or ſpadiceous colour. The outmoſt quil-feathers of the Wings are black, the inner dusky. The exteriour edges of the eight outmoſt, excluding the firſt, are white, the white from the bottom towards the top extending it ſelf in breadth in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feather more and more in order, till in the ninth feather it reaches almoſt to the tip. Theſe white edges in the Wing complicated concur to make up a white ſpot externally conſpicuous. From the ninth the tips of the ſixth or ſeventh ſucceeding are blunt and indented. The interiour margins of all the quil-feathers are white, and the tips alſo of thoſe toward the body, or ſetting on of the Wing. The Tail is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forked, two inches and an half long, made up of the uſual number of twelve feathers; all ſharp-pointed, and of two colours, both edges, as well inner as outer, being white, but the outer more; which colour in the extreme or outmoſt feathers takes up almoſt half the breadth of the exteriour Web: In the reſt it grows narrower and narrower by degrees to the middlemoſt, which are almoſt wholly black, the very extreme edges only remaining white. The feathers incumbent on the Tail in the middle along the ſhaft are dusky, their outſides being white. It hath ſmall Legs and Feet of a reddiſh dusky colour, but not perfectly black; black Claws, the hinder the biggeſt, the two outer Claws equal one to the other: There is alſo the like coheſion between the outmoſt and middle toes, as in other birds.</p>
                              <p>In the Female neither is the Back bay, nor the crown or Breaſt red; but the Back dusky, with a tincture of green, the Breaſt of a dirty yellow, varied with dusky ſpots. The other notes agree in both Sexes.</p>
                              <p>It weighs five drachms, from tip of Bill to end of Tail is five inches and an half long; to the end of the Claws but five. A line of nine inches and a quarter mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the Wings ſtretcht out. It is common on the Sea-coaſts.</p>

                              <p>THis is leſſer than the precedent. The Back coloured like the <hi>common Linnet:</hi> The forehead adorned with a remarkable ſhining red ſpot: The Bill like that of the greater <hi>red Linnet,</hi> but leſs: The Breaſt red; the lower Belly white. The prime feathers of the Wings and Tail dusky: The Tail about two inches long, and ſomething forked. The outmoſt borders or edges of the Wing and Tail-feathers round are white.</p>
                              <p>The Legs and Feet are dusky; the Claws black, and long for the bigneſs of the bird; but the Legs very ſhort. The like coheſion or adnaſcency of the outmoſt and middle toe at bottom, as in other ſmall birds.</p>
                              <p>In this kind the Female alſo hath a ſpot on her head, but more dilute than that of the Cock, and of a Saffron colour.</p>
                              <p>This Bird differs from the precedent <hi>red Linnet</hi> in many particulars. 1. In that it is leſs: 2. That it hath a leſſer and ſharper Bill: 3. That the Hen agrees with the Cock in the ſpot on its head, though it be paler: 4. That the Legs and Feet in this are blacker: 5. That the border of white about the tail-feathers is narrower: 6. That the tips of the ſecond row of Wing-feathers being white make a tranſverſe white line croſs the Wing. Laſtly, that this Bird is gregarious, flying in flocks, not that.</p>

                              <p>THis was found by Mr. <hi>Fr. Jeſſop</hi> in the Mountains of the <hi>Peak</hi> of <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> and ſent to us. It is twice as big as the precedent. The colour of its Head and Back is the ſame with that of the <hi>common Linnet;</hi> for the middle parts of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of both are black, but the outſides or edges of thoſe on the Back red, on the Head cinereous. The middle parts of the feathers on the Throat and Breaſt are alſo black, but the edges whitiſh. Only the Rump is of a very fair ſhining ſcarlet or Orange-tawny colour. The edges of the middle quil feathers of the Wings are white, as are alſo the tips of thoſe of the ſecond row. The Tail is two inches and an half long, conſiſting of twelve feathers, of which the two middle are all over of one uniform brown or dusky colour. Of the reſt, as well the outer as inner edges, are white: Theſe white edges in the outmoſt feathers are broader than in the reſt. Its Bill is like that of the precedent, <hi>viz.</hi> leſs for the proportion of its body than that of the ſecond ſpecies. The whole bird from Bill to Tail was ſix inches and an half long; to the Claws five and an half.</p>

Yet the <note n="*" place="margin">This word is to be taken largely for the middle part about the ſhaft.</note> ſhafts of the feathers on the Back are black; and the Neck being darker than the Back ſeems to partake ſomething of the colour of the Head. The Rump is of a greeniſh yellow: The Throat and Breaſt of a yellowiſh green: The Belly white: The feathers under the Tail yellowiſh, with oblong dusky ſpots in the middledown the ſhaft. The feathers alſo inveſting the ſides are ſpotted in the middle with brown. The Hen is paler and more diſcoloured. Her Throat and ſides under her Wings are white, the middle parts of the feathers being ſpotted with brown. The Head and Back are of a greeniſh aſh-colour, with brown ſpots in the middle. The Throat and Breaſt have leſs of green.</p>
                        <p>The Wings are croſſed by a broad line or bed of yellow. The Pinion-quill of the Wing is all over dusky, only the edges green. Of the nine following the outer Webs are green; the green part is widened by degrees in every feather, till in the laſt it take up half the length. From the tenth almoſt the lower half of each feather is yellow, the upper black. The exteriour covert-feathers of the Wings are black, the edges of the interiour green.

                        <p>
                           <hi>CAnaria</hi> is an Iſland of the <hi>Atlantic</hi> Sea, on the left ſide of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> one of thoſe which the Ancients for the excellent temperature of the Air called <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,</hi> ſo denominated from the multitude of great Maſtive Dogs, as <hi>Pliny</hi> out of <hi>Juba</hi> delivers. All thoſe Iſlands, which the Ancients called <hi>Fortunate,</hi> are now adays called the <hi>Canaries.</hi> Out of which in our Age are wont to be brought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſinging birds, which from the place where they are bred they commonly call <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary-birds:</hi> Others call them <hi>Sugar-birds,</hi> becauſe the beſt Sugar is brought thence. Of this bird we have thought fit to treat next after the <hi>Siskin,</hi> becauſe ſome have judged it to be a ſort of <hi>Siskin,</hi> as <hi>Turner:</hi> And in truth to look upon for colour and ſhape it is very like it. This bird <hi>Geſner</hi> from the relation of a friend of his thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes. It is of the bigneſs of the common <hi>Titmouſe,</hi> hath a ſmall white Bill, thick at baſe, and contracted into a ſharp point: All the feathers of the Wings and Tail being of a green colour: So that it differs little from thoſe ſmall birds, which our Country men call <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Citrinellae</hi> or <hi>Citrinae.</hi>

                           <hi>Citrils,</hi> or thoſe they call <hi>Ziſels,</hi> and the <hi>Italians, Ligurini,</hi> ſave that it is a little bigger than either of thoſe, liker in ſhew or outward appearance to this, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greener than that. So far <hi>Geſner.</hi> Between the Cock and Hen-bird I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this difference, that the Breaſt, Belly, and upper part of the Head, adjoyning to be Bill, are more yellow in the Cock than in the Hen. This is common to both Sexes to be fleſhy, and not fat. Of its ſinging the ſame <hi>Geſner</hi> hath recorded as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. It hath a very ſweet and ſhrill note, which at one breath continued for a long time without intermiſſion, it can draw out ſometimes in length, ſometimes raiſe very high, by a various and almoſt muſical inflexion of its voice, making very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and artificial melody. The ſound it makes is very ſharp, and ſo quavering, that ſometimes when it ſtretches and exerciſes its little throat and Chaps, whiſtling with all its force, it vehemently ſtrikes, and even deafens the Ears of the hearers with its ſhrilneſs. Many are delighted with this kind of its ſinging, many alſo are offended, ſaying, that they are aſtonied and deafned by it. It is ſold every where very dear, both for the ſweetneſs of its ſinging, and alſo becauſe it is brought from far remote places with great care and diligence, and but <note n="*" place="margin">Now adays there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them brought over; nor are they ſold ſo dear but that even mean perſons can afford to buy and keep them.</note> rarely; ſo that it is wont to be kept only by Nobles and great men. But if any one be taken with the melody of theſe Birds, let him buy thoſe which have long Tails and ſmall Bodies. For it is found by experience that by how much leſs they are, by ſo much are they more canorous. But the great ones ſhut up in Cages turn their heads round about and backward, and are not to be eſteemed genuine or right bred <hi>Canary Birds.</hi> Of this ſort there are brought from the Iſlands <hi>Palma</hi> and <hi>C. Verde,</hi> which they call fools, from that motion of their head, which is proper to fools. They are fed with <hi>Canary-ſeed,</hi> wherein they take great pleaſure, which therefore is wont to be brought together with them out of the ſame Iſlands. <hi>Geſner</hi> from the relation of his friend writes, that they are fed with the ſame food with the <hi>Siskin</hi> and <hi>Citril; viz.</hi> Line ſeed, and Poppy ſeed, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo Millet: But particularly, that they delight in Sugar and the Sugar-cane, as alſo in that ſort of Chickweed or Mouſe-ear, which they commonly call Henbit. For he affirms, that by this they are preſently provoked to ſing. This ſort of birds is wont to be infeſted with certain tumours or kernels in its head; which I take to be a kind of <hi>Atheromata:</hi> They are to be anointed with Butter or the fat of Hens till they ripen, then they are to be opened, and the matter dexterouſly preſſed out, and again anointed till they be perfectly whole. Sometimes alſo they happen to be troubled with Lice: In which caſe it will be of advantage to ſprinkle them often with Wine. For ſo thoſe Vermine will be killed, and they become ſtronger to overcome that trouble. Thus far <hi>Aldrovandus.</hi>

But the difference of place hath wrought ſome change in the external figure of this Bird. For theſe ſpurious Birds have black Feet, and are more yellow under the Chin than the genuine <hi>Canary-Birds.</hi>

Before you buy him, hear him ſing in a ſingle Cage; ſo you may be ſure not to be cheated with a Hen for a Cock, and may pleaſe your fancy in his ſinging.

                              <p>If he ſtands up boldly, without crouching or ſhrinking his feathers, if his Eyes look chearful, and not drowſie; and he be not apt to clap his head under his Wing, theſe are good ſigns of a healthful bird: But the ſureſt is to obſerve his dung; which when he is in perfect health lies round and hard, with a fine white on the outſide, and dark within, and will quickly be dry. The larger the birds dung is, I hold it the better, ſo it be long, round, and hard. A Seed-bird very ſeldom dungs too hard, except it be very young. If he bolts his tail like a <hi>Nightingale</hi> after he hath dunged; or if his dung be very thin, or if it have only a ſlimy white, with no blackneſs in it, the bird is not healthful.</p>

                              <head>Of the ordering of Canary-birds, which you intend for breeding, in building and breeding.</head>
                              <p>Firſt, make a convenient Cage, or prepare a room fit for that purpoſe: You muſt be ſure to let it have an out-let toward the riſing of the Sun, where you muſt have a piece of wire, that they may have egreſs and regreſs at their pleaſure. When you have prepared a convenient Room, then ſet up in the corners of it ſome Beſoms, either Heath or Frail, opening them in the middle: If the Room be pretty high you may ſet two or three brooms, one under another; but then you muſt ſet partitions with boards over every broom; otherwiſe the birds will dung upon one anothers heads; and alſo they will not endure to ſee one another ſo near each others Neſt, for the Cock or Hen will be apt to fly upon a Hen that is not matcht to them, when they ſee them juſt under their Neſt, which many times cauſes the ſpoiling of their Eggs and young ones.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. You muſt cauſe ſomething to be made ſo convenient, and of ſuch bigneſs as may hold meat for ſome conſiderable time, that you may not be diſturbing of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and a convenient Veſſel for water alſo. Let your place where you intend to put your ſeeds be ſo ordered that it may hang out of the reach of the Mice, for they will deſtroy all the Canary ſeeds, and ſo conſequently way ſtarve your birds.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. You muſt prepare ſome ſtuff to build withall of ſeveral ſorts of things, as Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-wool, ſmall dead graſs, <hi>Elks</hi> hair [this is hard to get in <hi>England]</hi> and earth-moſs. You muſt dry it before you put them together: Then mingle them all, and put them up in a little Net like a Cabbage-net, hanging of it ſo that they may with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency pull it out. You muſt ſet Pearches all about the Room, and, if big enough, ſet a tree in the middle, that ſo they may take the more pleaſure. You muſt proportion your birds according to the bigneſs of your Room: Rather let it be under-ſtocked than over: for they are birds that love liberty.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. When you perceive them begin to build and carry ſtuff, give them once a day, or in two days at leaſt, a little greens and ſome Loaf-ſugar, for that will cauſe a ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perineſs in the body, that ſo the Eggs may come forth without injuring the birds; for many times the Hen dies in laying her firſt Egg: Which will be a great loſs, both in loſing the firſt brood, and unpairing the Cock. If this happens, and you have but
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:63869:139"/>
few pairs in your breeding place, take out the ſingle Cock, and match him, and put him in again: If many, it is adviſable to let your Cock alone, till you draw all your birds out to part them; becauſe it will be hard to find out the ſingle Cock, and as hard to take him when found.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. When you find that they have built, take away the Nets that have the breeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff in them. They breed moſt uſually three times in a year, begin in <hi>April,</hi> and breed in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June,</hi> and ſometimes in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which is not very uſual, neither here, nor in <hi>Germany.</hi>

                              <p>Firſt, they prepare a large Room, and build it in the likeneſs of a Barn, being much longer than broad, with a ſquare place at each end, and ſeveral holes at each end, to go into thoſe ſquare places. In thoſe out-lets they plant ſeveral ſorts of trees, which grow pretty thick, for they will take much delight both to ſing and breed in them: And the bottom of the place they ſtrow with a fine ſort of ſand, and upon it caſt ſeeds of Rape, Chickweed, and Groundſil; which the old bird doth eat, both at time of laying, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo when they have young ones. They put in the houſe all ſorts of ſtuff for the building of their Neſts; and Brooms up and down the corners, one under another, and to the height of the place that is built for the purpoſe; and make partitions between every Neſt, to make them breed the quieter, without diſturbing one another: And in the middle of the Room they will ſet a board edge-ways to darken the light on each ſide; for no bird almoſt doth naturally love to have much light come to his Neſt. They plant a tree or two, if the houſe be big enough, one at each end, with many Pearches alſo along each ſide of the houſe, and all along where they make their Neſts: The place alſo that is in the air is full of Pearches. They hang their ſtuff for building all up and down the houſe, that the rain come not at it, and ſtrow ſome on the ground alſo. Some have fine fountains in thoſe places that are out-lets for the birds to go at pleaſure into the air; in which the birds take very much delight to waſh and prune themſelves.</p>
                              <p>They ſeldom take their Neſts away to bring them up by hand, as we do here, but they let the old ones always bring them up; and when they are pretty ſtout, and can crack hard ſeeds, they have ſmall places for the young to come and feed in; and they give them of all ſorts of green ſeeds to feed upon; and have a kind of trap-door to take them. They ſay, that if they do not ſoak ſeeds for the young ones, very few will live, by reaſon the Hen is apt to forſake them, and go to Neſt again; and the ſeeds being very hard, they pine away and die.</p>

                              <head>How to breed and order the young ones taken out of the Neſt.</head>
                              <p>Theſe Birds muſt not be left too long in the Neſt; for if they are, they will be very apt to grow ſullen, and will not feed kindly: Therefore take them out about nine or ten days old, and put them in a little basket, and cover them with a Net, elſe they will be very ſubject to jump out upon the firſt opening of the Basket, and if they fall to the ground they will be bruiſed and die. You muſt keep them warm for the firſt week, for they are very tender, and if they take cold will be ſubject to the cramp, and not digeſt their meat.</p>
                              <p>Take them in the Evening, and if you can poſſibly when the old ones are out of ſight; otherwiſe they will be apt to take diſtaſte when they ſit again, and have young ones; and will be apt at every fright to forſake both their Young and Eggs.</p>
                              <p>Make their meat after this manner. Take ſome of your largeſt Rape-ſeeds, and ſoak them in water twenty four hours or leſs, if the water be a little warm I think twelve hours will ſerve the turn. Drain the water from the ſeeds, and put a third part of white bread to the ſeeds, and a little Canary ſeed in flour, and ſo mix them all together: Then having a ſmall ſtick, take up a little at the end, and give every bird ſome two or three times over; give them but a little at firſt at a time and often; for if you over-charge their ſtomachs they will caſt up their meat, and ſeldom thrive after it. For the old ones give them but little at a time, and beſides, all the ſeeds huld and warmed in their ſtomachs; which lie nothing ſo hard on their ſtomachs as ſeeds that have their skins on. You muſt not make their meat too dry, for then they will be apt to be Vent-burnt, by reaſon all the ſeeds are hot. For I have obſerved, that the old ones do conſtantly drink after they have eaten ſeeds, and a little before they feed their young ones; and they commonly after feeding of them ſit a quarter of an
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:63869:139"/>
hour or more to keep them warm, that the meat may the better nouriſh them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do you alſo when you have fed them cover them up warm. I approve beſt of the neſtling bird by reaſon of his tameneſs and familiarity with his Keeper; which is the chief pleaſure of a bird. For if a bird be not tame, but extraordinarily wild and buckiſh, there is no pleaſure in feeding or hearing of him ſing, being apt upon all occaſions to bruiſe himſelf, and to forſake his ſinging when moſt deſired.</p>

                        <p>IN the ſhape of the Head and whole body it is very like to a <hi>Linnet.</hi> The Head and Back green: The Rump of a yellowiſh green: The hinder part of the Head and Neck aſh-coloured. [In a bird that I deſcribed at <hi>Rome,</hi> the top of the Head, the upper ſide of the Neck and the Shoulders were particoloured, of a yellowiſh green and dark brown.] The nether ſurface of the body is green, but about the Vent it is whitiſh. The upper part of the Breaſt and the Belly in the Male birds is of a lovely yellow. The Tail is 2 ⅛ inches long, and black, but the extreme edges of the feathers are green. The quil-feathers of the Wings are of the ſame colour with the Tail: The leſſer rows of Wing-feathers green. [In thoſe birds I deſcribed at <hi>Rome</hi> the tips both of the quil-feathers, and alſo of the ſecondary feathers of the Wings were white.]</p>
                        <p>The Bill is hard, of a dusky or livid colour, having ſharp edges, thicker and ſhorter than the <hi>Siskins</hi> [yea, in proportion to its body ſhorter and thicker than the <hi>Linnets</hi> or <hi>Greenfinches</hi> Bill:] The upper Chap equal to the lower. The Tongue as in <hi>Chaffinches:</hi> The Feet whitiſh or fleſh-coloured, with blackiſh Claws. The Guts long, ſlender, and rolled up together.</p>
                        <p>It is murſed up in Cages for the ſake of its ſinging. At <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Auſtria</hi> we ſaw of theſe birds to be ſold, brought out of <hi>Stiria.</hi> It is frequent about <hi>Rome.</hi>

                        <p>The Tail is black, the outmoſt edges of the feathers being green, conſiſting of the uſual number of twelve feathers.

                        <p>THe length of this Bird, taken from the tip of the Bill to the end of its Claws, was little leſs than ſeven inches: Its breadth between the extremes of the Wings diſtended twelve and a quarter. Its Bill ſtrong, ſharp-pointed, like that of a <hi>Chaffinch,</hi> from the tip to the angles of the Mouth ſomewhat more than half an inch long: The upper Chap black, the lower about the angle yellow. The angle itſelf is round: The ſides of the Bill ſharp-edged. The Head is of a dusky aſh-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but for the moſt part through the middle of the crown is a line drawn of a whiter colour. The Neck is aſh-coloured. Below, between the Shoulders the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have their outer edges of a pale aſh-colour, their inner black. The Rump from dusky inclines to green, but the tips of the feathers next the Tail are white. The prime feathers in each Wing are in number eighteen, of which the firſt or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is ſhorter than the ſecond, the ſecond equal to the third, and longeſt of all. Theſe three feathers are of a dark brown or blackiſh, only their outmoſt edges of a pale green. The ſecond, third, and fourth rows of Wing-feathers have white tips, but elſe are black. The Plumage on the baſe or ridge of the Wing is of a ſordid green. The feathers covering the underſide of the Wing are white. The Breaſt is of a ſordid white. The feathers next the Tail have pale yellow tips, elſe they are brown. The Tail is two inches and an half long, and made up of twelve feathers.</p>
                        <p>This ſort is diſtinguiſhed from all other ſmall Birds, 1. That it hath a very fair, lovely, yellow ſpot about the middle of its Throat. 2. That all the feathers of the Tail on the interiour Web near the tip are marked with one great round white ſpot, being elſe all black, ſave the edges, which are greeniſh. The outer half of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt feather on each ſide is alſo white. 3.

Its breadth between the tips of the Wings ſpread eleven inches and an half. Its Bill is great and thick, having a hard knob or eminency in the upper Mandible or Palate, wherewith it is thought to bruiſe Wheat, Oats, and other Grain. The ſides of the lower Chap riſe up in an angle on each ſide, [as may be better repreſented by a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure than expreſſed in words] and incline to one another under the Tubercle of the Palate.

Its Bill was ſhort, <hi>viz.</hi> from the tip to the corners of the Mouth ſcarce half an inch long, thick at baſe, ſharp at point; of a red or fleſh colour in the Cock.

The outmoſt from the bottom to the firſt joynt ſticks faſt to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt without any membrane intervening, as in moſt ſmall birds. The Throat and Breaſt are aſh-coloured, the reſt of the underſide to the very Tail is red. The Rump of a deeper red. The Head of a brown or dusky aſh-colour, the middle parts of the feathers being black: As they are likewiſe on the Back, having their edges of a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh aſh-colour. [In the Cocks the Breaſts are more red.] Under the Bill is a yellow ſpot.

                           <p>The quil-feathers of the Wings, as in almoſt all ſmall birds, are eighteen in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of which the greater have their edges of a greeniſh white, the leſſer or interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of a red. The tips of all the feathers of the ſecond row have their tips white, and exteriour edges red. The tips of the third row are alſo white. The edges of the leſſer coverts are cinereous.

The <hi>fourth</hi> had a green Head and Neck; a red Bill; aſh-coloured Legs; elſe it was black. Yet hath it on the crown of the head, and alſo in two of the quil-feathers only an oblong white ſpot. 5. The <hi>fifth</hi> I may call a <hi>white-tail'd Hortulane:</hi> For its Tail was white, elſe it was like the common <hi>Hortulanes,</hi> but in all parts paler. 6. The <hi>laſt</hi> ſome of our Fowlers reckoned a kind of <hi>Spipola,</hi> others a kind of <hi>Hortulane;</hi> and indeed I ſhould make it congenerous rather to the <hi>Spipolae</hi> than the <hi>Hortulanes.</hi> For its Bill is longer, and its Legs and Feet dusky, which in the <hi>Hortulanes</hi> are wont to be yellow.

            <p>We call thoſe Birds <hi>Mudſuckers,</hi> which ſuck out of the Mud or Channels ſome oyly ſlime or juice, wherewith they are nouriſhed: Whence they have delicate fleſh, and their very guts not emptied or cleanſed from the Excrements are uſually eaten.

            <p>Moſt Water-fowl have a ſhort Tail; none of them have their Feet ſo diſpoſed as <hi>Woodpeckers</hi> and <hi>Parrots,</hi> that is two forward, and two backward; none having more than one back toe.

                        <p>THis is a large-bodied Fowl, weighing ſometimes ten pounds. Meaſuring from the beginning of the Bill to the end of the Tail it is well nigh five foot long. That it hath a very long Neck is ſo well known that it is needleſs to write it: Its Legs alſo are very long.</p>
                        <p>Its Bill is ſtreight, ſharp-pointed, of a dark greeniſh colour, near four inches long, compreſſed ſide-ways: Its Tongue broad and horny at the tip. The top of the Head black; from the Bill to the hinder part covered with black hairs or briſtles rather than feathers. On the back of the Head it hath a ſpace or bed of the figure of a Creſcent, bare, or thin ſet with hairs, and of a red colour: Below which, on the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Neck is a triangular ſpot of aſh-coloured feathers. Two white lines or ſtroaks, one from each Eye, are produced backwards, and meeting behind the <hi>Vertex</hi> of the now mentioned triangular ſpot, are thence continued as far as the Breaſt. The Throat and ſides of the Neck are of black hue. The Back, Shoulders, covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers of the Wings <note n="*" place="margin">Excepting thoſe on the utmoſt joynt.</note>, Breaſt, and all the Belly and Thighs are aſh-coloured; only the quil-feathers of the Wings, and thoſe on the utmoſt Pinion are black.</p>
                        <p>The Wings are very large: The quil-feathers are in number twenty four, and (as we ſaid) black, yet the leſſer of them from black incline to red or ruſſet, as do alſo the primary covert-feathers which are on the utmoſt joynt or Pinion. The Tail for the bigneſs of the bird is ſmall and ſhort, round when ſpread, conſiſting of twelve feathers, all cinereous, with black tips.</p>
                        <p>The Legs are black, bare of feathers for an hand breadth above the Knees: The Toes black, and very long. The lower joynt of the outmoſt and middle Toe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected by a thick membrane.</p>
                        <p>But that which is moſt rare, and eſpecially remarkable, yea, wonderful in this bird, is the conformation of the Wind-pipe. For entring far into the Breaſt bone, which hath a great cavity within to receive it, and being there thrice reflected (as the figure adjoyning to the ſculp of the Crane repreſents) goes out again at the ſame hole, and ſo turns down to the Lungs,</p>
                        <p>The blind guts are five inches long. The Stomach or Gizzard muſculous as in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivorous birds. The fleſh is very ſavoury and well-taſted, not to ſay delicate.</p>
                        <p>We ſaw many <hi>Cranes</hi> to be ſold in the Poulterers ſhops at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Winter time, which I ſuppoſe had been ſhot on the Sea-coaſt.</p>
                        <p>They come often to us in <hi>England:</hi> And in the Fen-Countries in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> and <hi>Cambridgeſhire</hi> there are great flocks of them, but whether or no they breed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> writes, he was told by a certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, who ſaid he had often ſeen their young ones) I cannot certainly determine either of my own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or from the relation of any credible perſon. The delicate taſte of the fleſh and the muſculous Stomach are ſufficient arguments to evince, that this bird feeds not at all upon fiſh, but only upon herbs, grain, and ſeeds of divers ſorts, and it is likely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Inſects too: As the Authors alſo that have written of it unanimouſly report.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cranes</hi> differ from <hi>Herons,</hi> 1. In that the Claw of the middle toe is not ſerrate as in <hi>Herons:</hi> 2. In bigneſs, wherein they exceed them: 3. In having a ſhorter Bill: And 4. a muſculous ſtomach or Gizzard: 5. Two <hi>Appendices</hi> or blind guts, whereas <hi>Herons</hi> have but one: 6. In the ſtrange revolution of the Wind-pipe within the Breaſt-bone.</p>

About the horn ſtand up very fine, ſhort, black and white feathers. Its Neck is ſeven inches long, the reſt of its Body to the riſe of its Tail al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a foot and half. It hath very large Wings; the greater feathers being above a foot and half long. In the forepart of each Wing are two ſtreight triangular <note n="*" place="margin">Spurs they may more properly be called.</note> horns, ſpringing from the very bone of the Wing, as thick as the tip of ones little finger,

and of a Conical [more properly Pyramidal] triangulate figure. The foremoſt of theſe goads or ſpurs are an inch long; the hindmoſt a little ſhorter, and of a dusky colour. It hath a Tail ten inches long, and broad like that of a <hi>Gooſe.</hi> The upper Legs [Thighs] are four inches long, and for the lower half bare of feathers. The lower Legs are five inches long, and almoſt two thick. In each foot it hath four toes ſo ſituate as in <hi>Hens:</hi> The middle of the three fore-toes is four inches and an half long; the other two three and an half; the back-toe almoſt two. Each hath a crooked, black Claw an inch long, but the back toes a little longer. Both Feet and Legs, as far as they be naked, are covered with a brown ſcaly skin. The crown of the Head is variegated with black and white feathers. The ſides of the Throat and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per half of the Neck are black. The lower half of the Neck and Breaſt are varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with white, cinereous, and black feathers. The lower Belly is all white.

                        <p>Its Bill is great, ſtrong, ſtreight, from a thick baſe gently leſſening into a ſharp point; from the tip to the angles of the Mouth five inches and an half long, of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh green colour. The upper Mandible is a thought longer than the nether, and therein a furrow or groove impreſſed, reaching from the Noſthrils to the utmoſt tip. Its ſides towards the point are ſomething rough, and as it were ſerrate, for the faſter holding of ſlippery fiſhes. The lower Mandible is more yellow: The ſides of both are thinned into very ſharp edges. The Mouth gapes wide. The Tongue is ſharp, long, but not hard. The eye-lids, and that naked ſpace between the Eyes and Bill, are green. The Noſthrils are oblong narrow chinks.</p>
                        <p>The Legs and Feet are green: The hind-part of the Legs and ſoals of the Feet greener. The Toes very long. The outmoſt foretoes are joyned to the middle by a membrane below. The inner edge of the middle claw is ſerrate, which is worthy the notice taking.</p>
                        <p>Its Stomach is large and flaggy, rather membranous than muſculous, as in carnivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous birds, in which diſſected we found <note n="*" place="margin">Lenticula aquatica tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulca.</note> 
                           <hi>Ivy-leaved Duckmeat.</hi> The Guts towards the Vent, where the blind guts are ſituate, are larger than in other birds. It hath not two blind guts, one on each ſide, like other birds, but only one, like Quadrupeds, but that bigger and thicker than ordinary. The Gullet under the Chin is dilated into a great wideneſs. In the middle of the Merry-thought is an <hi>Appendix.</hi> It hath a long Gall-bladder. <hi>Geſner</hi> counts but eleven Vertebres in the Neck; I obſerved fifteen, of which the fifth hath a contrary poſition, <hi>viz.</hi> is <note n="*" place="margin">In another place Mr. <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lughby</hi> puts it among his queries, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the five upper verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres in the Neck of a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron be refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way.</note> reflected upward.

                        <p>IT weighed forty ounces. Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Feet was fifty three inches and an half; to the end of the Tail no more than forty. Its breadth, as we reckon it, between the tips of the Wings extended ſixty inches and an half.</p>
                        <p>Its colour was all over as white as ſnow. The number of the main feathers of its Wings was about twenty ſeven; of its Tail twelve: The length of its tail ſix inches and an half. It had no Creſt. Its Bill, as in the common <hi>Heron,</hi> was yellowiſh. The edges of its Eye-lids, and that naked ſpace between the Eyes and Bill green. The Eyes of a pale yellow. The Legs for ſome ſpace above the knees bare of feathers. The Feet and Talons black: The outer fore-toe connected with the middle one from the divarication to the firſt joynt by an intervening membrane. The Claw of the middle toe had its interiour edge <note n="*" place="margin">Sawed of toothed.</note> ſerrate.</p>
                        <p>The figure of the Breaſt-bone was arcuate [bending like a Bow] as in other <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons.</hi> The vertebres of the Back were ſix or ſeven: Thoſe of the Neck to the fourth were bent downwards, all the reſt upwards.

                        <head>§. V. <hi>The leſſer white Heron:</hi> Ardea alba minor.</head>
                        <p>BEing weighed it ſcarce amounted to one pound. From the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail it was twenty four inches and an half long, to the end of the Legs thirty two and an half. It is all over of a pure white colour, like the bigger. From the hinder part of the Head hangs down backward a ſhort Creſt. About the Eyes the skin is bare of feathers, and of a green colour. The Bill is four inches and an half long, and black. The Eyes are of a pale yellow. The Tongue ſhort: The Feet green; but ſometime covered with a black, ſcaly bark, which may eaſily be rubbed or ſcraped off. The Legs are bare of feathers ſomething above the knees, and up higher than in the former kind. The outer fore-toe is connected with the middle from its riſe to the firſt joynt by an intervening membrane. The middle Talon is toothed, as in the reſt of this kind. It hath alſo but one blind gut, like them; and a great Gall.</p>
                        <p>It differs from the precedent white <hi>Heron</hi> in being much leſſer, and in having a creſt, which that wants.</p>
                        <p>We take this to be the ſame with the ſmall white <hi>Heron</hi> or <hi>Garzetta</hi> of <hi>Geſner</hi> and <hi>Aldrovand,</hi> and with <hi>Bellonius</hi> his <hi>Aigretta</hi> of the <hi>French,</hi> although the deſcriptions differ in ſome particulars.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Geſner</hi> ſaith, that the feathers of the Creſt are long, and ſold at a great rate. But <hi>Bellonius</hi> and <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> write, that theſe feathers, which Noblemen and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders are wont to ſtick in their Caps and Head-pieces for ornament, and which are fold very dear in the Cities ſubject to the <hi>Turk,</hi> do not grow on the Head, but on the Back, at the ridge of each Wing. Our Bird, which we bought in the Market at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> had no ſuch feathers; perchance they had been before pluckt off, and concealed by the Fowler that ſold us the bird.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond leſſer white <hi>Heron</hi> of <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> is the very ſame with this, called alſo <hi>Garzetta</hi> in the Valleys of <hi>Malalbergo,</hi> as will manifeſtly appear to him that will but take the pains to compare the deſcriptions. <hi>Aldrovand. tom.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 93. deſcribes it thus. It is a bird all over white, excepting the Legs and Bill, which are black. Its Bill is long, ſlender, very ſharp-pointed, all of one colour. Between the Eyes and Bill is a certain ſpot of green. The Pupil of the Eyes is black, encompaſſed with a yellow or golden circle, and that again with a black. The Neck and Legs, as in other <hi>Herons,</hi> are long; ſo are alſo the Toes, but yellow. The back-toe is the leaſt of all: The middlemoſt of the fore-toes longeſt, and that on the right ſide of it next in length. The Claws black and ſharp. The Wings very great; the Tail ſhort; the Body ſlender and little.</p>
                        <p>This, I ſay, is without all doubt the ſame with our ſmall white <hi>Heron;</hi> neither (as I judge) doth it differ from the <hi>Garzetta</hi> of <hi>Aldrovand,</hi> before deſcribed, in any thing but in age, for that was a young bird. In this there is no mention made either of the Creſt, or of thoſe rare feathers growing on the Back. Perchance they were by the Fowlers, (who knew well enough their value) plucked off from both <hi>Aldrovands</hi> bird and ours.</p>

Its Bill is ſtreight, ſtrong, thick at the Head, and growing ſlenderer by degrees to the point, of a greeniſh colour, and having ſharp ſides or edges. The ſides of the lower Mandible fall within the upper, when the Mouth is ſhut. The upper Chap hath a long cranny, or furrow, or channel excavated on each ſide, wherein are the Noſthrils. The Tongue is ſharp, not cloven, reaching ſcarce to the middle of the Bill. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes from hazel incline to yellow. [In another bird they were red.] The ſlit of the Mouth is very wide, running out beyond the Eyes toward the hinder part of the Head, ſo that the Eyes ſeem to be ſituate as it were in the very Bill. Under the Eyes the skin is bare of feathers, and of a green colour. The Ears are great, and wide open.</p>
                        <p>The Shanks are bare a little above the knees: The Feet green: The Toes great, and very long, armed alſo with long and ſtrong Talons; that of the middle Toe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate on the interiour edge, in like manner, and for the ſame purpoſes, <hi>viz.</hi> of holding faſt Eels, and other ſlippery fiſh, as in the reſt of this kind. The back-claw, which is remarkably thick and long above the reſt, is wont to be ſet in Silver for a Pick-tooth, and is thought to have a ſingular property of preſerving the teeth. The outmoſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe is joyned to the middlemoſt at bottom by a membrane.</p>
                        <p>They ſay, that it gives always an odd number of bombs at a time, <hi>viz.</hi> three or five: Which in my own obſervation I have found to be falſe. It begins to bellow about the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> and ceaſes when breeding time is over. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people are of opinion that it thruſts its Bill into a Reed, by the help whereof it makes that lowing or drumming noiſe. Others ſay, that it thruſts its Bill into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or mud, or earth, and by that means imitates the lowings of an Ox. It hides it ſelf commonly among reeds and ruſhes, and ſometimes lies in hedges with its Neck and Head erect.</p>

                           <pb n="283" facs="tcp:63869:148"/>
In the Autumn after Sun-ſet theſe birds are wont to ſoar aloft in the air with a ſpiral aſcent ſo high till they get quite out of ſight: In the mean time making a ſingular kind of noiſe, nothing like to lowing.</p>
                        <p>As for the interiour parts, The annulary cartilages of the Wind-pipe after its diva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication, are not entire [or perfectly round] but only ſemicircular: The other part of the circle being ſupplied by a thin, looſe membrane: They ſtand alſo at a greater diſtance one from another than before. The Liver is divided into two Lobes, and hath its Gall-bladder annexed. The interiour membrane of the Stomach is wrinkled, and full of papillary glandules. Beneath the lower Orifice of the Stomach was as is were a ſecondary ſtomach, of a ſingular ſtructure, and of the figure of the Letter ∽, having a thick coat, and being rugged and uneven with folds or wrinkles within. The firſt ſtomach was lax and membranous rather than muſculous, like a Dogs ſtomach, as <hi>Bellonius</hi> rightly compares it. It hath no Craw: Only one blind gut, like the reſt of this kind, half an inch long. The Gullet juſt below the Bill may be vaſtly dilated, ſo as to admit a mans fiſt. In the ſtomach diſſected we found the fur and bones of Mice. Inſtead of the tranſverſe ribs are only ſmall <hi>Appendices.</hi> The Vertebres next the Head are bent downwards, all the reſt up wards. The Breaſt-bone is <note n="*" place="margin">Bending like a Bow.</note> arcuate. The angle or aperture of the Breaſt-bone is filled up with a thin, looſe, pellucid membrane. The Gullet and Windpipe deſcend down the right ſide of the Neck. It hath alſo a bony <hi>Appendix</hi> in the angle of the <hi>Merry-thought,</hi> but leſs than the common <hi>Heron.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is called by later Writers, <hi>Butorius</hi> and <hi>Botaurus,</hi> becauſe it ſeems to imitate <hi>boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum tauri,</hi> the bellowing of a Bull. The Author of <hi>Philomela</hi> calls it <hi>Butio:</hi> But his miſtakes are ſo many, that no account is to be made of his authority. Some have made it to be the <hi>Onocrotalus,</hi> becauſe of its voice; which, to ſay the truth, ſeems to me much more to imitate the braying of an Aſs than the lowing of a Bull: But <hi>Pliny</hi> hath ſo exactly deſcribed the <hi>Onocrotalus,</hi> that no man that ſhall compare the notes with the bird, can poſſibly doubt that it is that we commonly call the <hi>Pelecan:</hi> Though thoſe that have ſeen and obſerved it, never heard it make any ſuch braying noiſe when kept tame: Which is ſomething ſtrange; unleſs perhaps being diſcontented with its captivity, it delights not to make that noiſe it doth when at liberty. The <hi>Bittern</hi> is ſaid above all other birds to ſtrike at mens eyes. It builds upon the ground, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in a tuft of Ruſhes, lays four or five Eggs, of a round figure, and whitiſh colour, inclining to cinereous or green, not ſpotted at all.</p>
                        <p>This without doubt is that bird our common people call the <hi>Night-raven,</hi> and have ſuch a dread of, imagining it cry portends no leſs than their death, or the death of ſome of their near Relations: For it flies in the night, anſwers their deſcription of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a flagging Collar, and hath ſuch a kind of hooping cry as they talk of.</p>

Theſe birds frequent Fens, Lakes, and Sea-ſhores; into theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they run, intent upon their prey, ſometimes alſo diving under water, maintain themſelves by fiſhing, as I am aſſured by our Fowlers upon their credit. This Bird is not very frequent at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet is it ſometimes expoſed to ſale among other Sea-fowl. Its fleſh hath ſuch a fiſhy taſte and ſtench, that being thrown to our Cat, ſhe refuſed it, and would not touch it. <hi>He endeavours to prove this Bird to be the Mergus of Ovid.</hi> See the Author.</p>

                        <p>THat which we deſcribed was a young one taken out of the Neſt. It weighed forty five ounces and an half. Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Claws was thirty four inches, to the end of the Tail twenty four. The colour of the whole body was Snow-white like a <hi>Swans.</hi> Beyond the Eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Bill grow neither feathers nor down, as in the <hi>Heron</hi> and <hi>Cormorant.</hi> The angle alſo of the lower Chap is bare, which perchance is peculiar and proper to this Bird.</p>
                        <p>The firſt quil-feather of the Wing is black; of the ſecond only the exteriour Web, or outer half from the ſhaft; and the tip of the interiour are black; of the third only the top, and of the fourth yet leſs. In like manner the tips and ſhafts of the inferiour feathers of the ſecond row were black. The Tail is very ſhort, <hi>viz.</hi> three inches and an half, made up of twelve feathers.</p>
                        <p>The Bill is of a ſingular and unuſual figure, plain, depreſſed, and broad, near the end dilated into an almoſt circular figure, of the likeneſs of a Spoon, whence alſo the Bird it ſelf is called by the <hi>Low Dutch, Lepelaer,</hi> that is, <hi>Spoon-bill.</hi> The broad part of the Bill is graven with twelve or fourteen lines or creviſes; but its inward ſurface is ſmooth and even, without any ſuch ſculptures or gravings. The Bill in the young ones before they be grown up is white, or of a fleſh-colour, in old ones black. The Tongue is ſharp and little. The Legs half way up the ſecond joynt are bare of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; in the young ones of a whitiſh colour. The Feet ſtrong: The fore-toes joyned together by a membrane; the outmoſt and middlemoſt to the ſecond joynt, the middlemoſt and inmoſt no further than the firſt. The Toes and Claws black.</p>
                        <p>We did not obſerve in our Bird thoſe reflections of the Wind-pipe, which <hi>Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus</hi> mentions, deſcribes, and figures. It had a large Gall: The Guts had many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions. Above the Stomach the Gullet was dilated into a Bag, whoſe inward ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face was rough and uneven, with many papillary glandules.</p>
                        <p>Its Eggs are of the bigneſs of Hens Eggs, white, and powdered with a few ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine or pale-red ſpots.</p>

                        <p>IT is ſomewhat leſſer than a <hi>Partridge:</hi> The upper ſide of the body particoloured of red, black and grey, very beautiful to behold. From the Bill almoſt to the middle of the Head it is of a reddiſh aſh-colour. The Breaſt and Belly are grey, with tranſverſe brown lines. Under the Tail it is ſomewhat yellowiſh. The Chin is white, with a tincture of yellow. A black line on each ſide between the Eye and Bill. The back of the Head is moſt black, with two or three croſs bars of a teſtaceous colour.</p>
                        <p>The prime feathers in each Wing are about twenty three, black, croſſed with red bars. The feathers under the Wings are curiouſly variegated with grey and brown lines. The Tail is 3 ⅜ inches long, conſiſting of twelve feathers, the tips whereof are cinereous above, and white underneath; their borders or outſides as it were inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with red; the remaining part black.</p>
                        <p>The Bill is three inches long, or more, dark brown toward the end, near the Head paler or fleſh coloured: The upper Mandible a very little longer than the nether: The Tongue nervous: The Palaterough: The Ears very great and open. The Eyes

ſtand higher or nearer to the top of the Head than in other birds, that they be not hurt when ſhe thruſts her Bill deep into the ground. The Legs, Feet, and Toes are of a pale brown or dusky colour: The Claws black: The back-toe very little, having alſo but a little Claw.</p>
                        <p>The Liver divided into two Lobes, having a Gall-bladder annexed: The Guts long, ſlender, and having many revolutions. The blind Guts very ſhort, not half ſo long as that ſingle blind gut the remnant of the Yolk-funnel.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are Birds of paſſage coming over into <hi>England</hi> in Autumn, and departing again in the beginning of the Spring; yet they pair before they go, flying two together, a Male and a Female. They frequent eſpecially moiſt Woods, and Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets near hedges. They are ſaid both to come and to fly away in a Miſt. At <hi>Nuren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> I ſaw of them to be ſold in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> whence I ſuppoſe they abide thereabout all the year. On the <hi>Alps</hi> and other high Mountains they continue all Summer. I my ſelf have fluſhed <hi>Woodcocks</hi> on the top of the Mountain <hi>Jura</hi> in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July.</hi> Some ſtraglers by ſome accident left behind when their fellows depart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main alſo in <hi>England</hi> all Summer, and breed here. Mr. <hi>Jeſſop</hi> ſaw young Woodcocks to be ſold at <hi>Sheffield,</hi> and others have ſeen them elſewhere. Their Eggs are long, of a pale red colour, ſtained with deeper ſpots and clouds.</p>
                        <p>Of two that I deſcribed, one was a Male, and the other a Female; the Female was heavier than the Male by an ounce and half; the Female weighing eleven ounces and an half, the Male but ten: The Female alſo was of a darker colour.</p>
                        <p>The fleſh of this Bird for the delicacy of its taſte is in high eſteem. The Leg eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially is commended, in reſpect whereof the <hi>Woodcock</hi> is preferred before the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> it ſelf, according to that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rhythm before recited in the Chapter of the <hi>Partridge.</hi>

But the laſt five are variegated with tranſverſe black and pale-red lines. The Tail is compoſed of twelve feathers, two inches and an half long. It ſeems to be ſhorter than it is, becauſe it is wholly covered and hid by the incumbent feathers. The tips of its outmoſt feathers are white, the reſt of the feather varied with croſs bars or lines of brown, and grey, or pale red colour. The following to the two

Of the two middle feathers the tips are white, next beneath the white is a brown bar, under the brown a red one, with ſome dusky ſpots in the middle. The reſt of the feather is black, ſave that in the outer Webs are ſometimes ſeen one or two reddiſh ſpots. [I ſuppoſe the colours of the Tail vary, and are not exactly alike in all birds.]</p>
                        <p>The Bill is almoſt three inches long, black at the tip, and ſomewhat broad and chamferd: The Tongue ſharp: The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes hazel-coloured.

I ſometimes following the vulgar error, thought it not to differ from the <hi>Snipe</hi> in kind, but only in Sex, taking it to be the <hi>Cock-Snipe.</hi> But afterward being adviſed by Mr. <hi>M.

                        <p>IT is like and equal to a <hi>Woodcock,</hi> or a little bigger: From point of Bill to the Claws ſeventeen inches and an half long: Between the tips of the Wings ſpread twenty eight and an half broad. The feathers of the Head are grey or cinereous, with ſome tincture of red, their middle parts being black; above the Eyes white. The Neck and Throat are reddiſh. The Breaſt of a ſordid white. The Back is particoloured of red, black, and white; the middle parts of the feathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing black, the edges of a pale red. In the Cock the Throat and Breaſt are croſſed with black lines: In the Hen the Throat and Neck are grey [or aſh-coloured,] The whole rump almoſt is white, powdered with blackiſh ſpecks. [In the Bird that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a triangular ſpot of white, took up the Rump or lower part of the Back, the <hi>vertex</hi> reſpecting the birds Head.] The great feathers of the Wings are black, with white ſhafts: The reſt of the firſt row, as alſo thoſe of the ſecond row have reddiſh aſh-coloured tips and edges. The leſſer covert-feathers of the Wings are of like colour with the body. The Tail-feathers are in number twelve, all croſſed alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with black and white lines; the middlemoſt, which are the longeſt, of 3 ⅛ inches length: The reſt on each ſide in order ſomewhat ſhorter, the exteriour than the interiour.</p>
                        <p>The Bill is white at the Baſe, black toward the point, longer for the bigneſs of the bird even than the <hi>Snipes</hi> or <hi>Woodcocks;</hi> the upper Mandible a little longer than the lower: The Tongue ſharp: The Noſthrils oblong: The Ears great.</p>
                        <p>The Legs are not very long; naked to the middle of the ſecond joynt: The Claws black. The Claw of the middle fore-toe on the inſide is thinned into an edge. The outer Toe is joyned to the middle one from the riſe to the firſt joynt by a pretty thick membrane of a dusky or dark green colour.</p>
                        <p>It lives and ſeeks it food on the ſandy ſhores by the Sea-ſide, which for a great ſpace are uncovered when the Tide is out, where it hides not it ſelf like the <hi>Woodcock,</hi> but walks up and down the Sands in open view, like a <hi>Gull.</hi>

will be content to take the pains to cut it up, may obſerve. It is eſteemed a delicate bird by the <hi>French,</hi> but ſeldom appears in places far remote from the Sea, ſeeking its food moſt willingly in ſalt Marſhes.

                        <p>THe Female weighed twenty eight ounces; the Male, which is ſomewhat leſs, and commonly called, <hi>The Jack Curlew,</hi> twenty five and a quarter. The length of the Female from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Claws was twenty nine inches: To the end of the Tail twenty three and an half. The diſtance of the tips of the Wings ſpread forty inches.</p>
                        <p>The middle parts of the feathers of the Head, Neck, and Back are black, the borders or outſides aſh-coloured, with a mixture of red. In the Throat and Breaſt the middle parts or ſhafts of the feathers are black, the borders or edges, in the Breaſt white, in the Throat white, with a tincture of red. The Chin is not ſpotted. The Rump and Belly are white.</p>
                        <p>The feathers inveſting the underſide of the Wing are all white: the firſt or outmoſt quil-feathers all over black, the reſt ſpotted with white. The firſt feather of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond row is all black: the tips of the eighth or ninth next are white. This Bird hath a ſmall, ſharp-pointed, black feather at the end of the Wing, which whether or no it is to be reckoned among the quil-feathers one may juſtly doubt.</p>
                        <p>Its Bill is <note n="*" place="margin">In ſome five inches and an half. in ſome above ſix.</note> very long, narrow, bowed, of a dark brown or black colour: Its Tongue ſharp, and very ſhort, extending not further than the angle of the lower Chap: The Noſthrils long: The Legs long, of a dusky blue colour, bare of feathers half up the ſecond joynt: The Claws ſmall and black: That of the middle Toe thinned into an edge on the inſide: All the Toes connected by a thick membrane from the divaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the firſt joynt. It hath a great Gall-bladder, with a long neck extending to the gut, which concurs not in one common paſſage with the <note n="*" place="margin">Porus bila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</note> Gall-pore, but enters the gut at a diſtinct hole, though near to that.</p>
                        <p>It hath a muſculous Stomach or Gizzard like granivorous birds: In the Stomach of one we found <hi>Periwinkle</hi> ſhells, ſmall ſtones, and grit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in anothers Frogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſingle blind gut is very long: The common blind gut three or four inches long, and full of excrements. Above the Stomach the Gullet is dilated into a bag, granu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated within with thick-ſet papillary glandules.</p>
                        <p>This bird for the goodneſs and delicate taſte of its fleſh may juſtly challenge the principal place among Water-fowl: Of this our Fowlers are not ignorant, and therefore ſell them dear. They have a Proverb among them in <hi>Suffolk:</hi>

The whole Bird is covered with feathers of an elegant ſcarlet colour: Only the quil-feathers of the Wings have their ends black.

                     <p>IT is of the bigneſs of a <hi>Magpie</hi> or <hi>Crow:</hi> of the weight of eighteen ounces: From Bill to Tail, or Claws (for it is all one) eighteen inches long.</p>
                     <p>Its Bill is ſtreight, three inches long, narrow, or compreſſed ſideways, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſharp, of a red colour, [In another bird, perchance a young one, the Bill was
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:63869:156"/>
half black from the tip.] By its figure the Bill ſeems to be framed by Nature, to thruſt under <note n="*" place="margin">Patella.</note> 
                        <hi>Limpets,</hi> and to raiſe them from the Rocks, that ſo it may feed upon their meat. The upper Chap is a little longer than the nether. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes, and edges of the Eye-lids of a curious red colour, [in another bird they were from yellow hazel-coloured.] The Legs and Feet red. It wants the back-toe. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt and middle toe are for a good way up joyned together by a membrane: So that this Bird ſeems to be of a middle nature between whole and cloven footed. [In ſome we obſerved the feet to be of a pale dusky colour, perhaps thoſe alſo were young ones.] The Claws were black.</p>
                     <p>The Head, Neck, Back, and Throat to the middle of the Breaſt were black. The reſt of the Breaſt and Belly white, as alſo the Rump. From this likeneſs in colour it took the name of <hi>Sea-pie.</hi> In one bird there was a great white ſpot under the Chin, and another leſſer under each eye.</p>
                     <p>The Tail is made up of twelve equal feathers, of four inches long, the lower half white, the upper black. The prime feathers of each Wing are about twenty eight, of which the firſt is black, having only the interiour edge white: In the reſt in order the white part is enlarged, till in the twentieth and three following it takes up the whole feather. The ſucceeding from the tweenty third grow gradually black again. The covert-feathers of the middle quils are white, and together make up a tranſverſe bed of white in the Wing.</p>
                     <p>The Stomach is great, not muſculous, but membranous, in which diſſected we found <hi>Limpets</hi> entire, upon which it ſeems chiefly to feed and live; as from the make of its Bill we gathered before. It hath a great Liver, divided into two Lobes, with a Gall annexed: A ſmall Spleen: Huge Ureters. The Cock differs not from the Hen in colour. Its fleſh is very black, hard, having a rank taſte, in a word very bad meat; which we cannot but wonder at, ſeeing it feeds chiefly upon Shel-fiſh; as do alſo the beſt relliſh'd and moſt ſavoury of Water-fowl. On the Coaſt of <hi>Wales</hi> and elſewhere on the Weſtern Shores of <hi>England</hi> we ſaw abundance of theſe birds.</p>

                        <p>IT weighs near ſeven ounces: In length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Claws it exceeds ſeventeen inches; to the end of the Tail fourteen; in breadth from tip to tip of the Wings expanded it is about twenty four and an half. Its Bill is black, yet at the angle of the lower Mandible red, ſlender, ſtreight, two inches and an half long. Its colour on the upper ſide of the Head, Neck, Wings, Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and forepart of the Back is mixt of brown and whitiſh, we commonly call it grey. On the Head the outer borders of the feathers are white, the middle parts black. A white line paſſes above the Eyes. The under ſide of the body is all white and alſo the lower part of the Back or Rump.</p>
                        <p>The quil-feathers of the Wings are in number about twenty ſix, all dusky or dark brown. The five outmoſt darker than the reſt, their interiour Webs being powdered with white ſpecks: The inner quils are paler, ſpeckled with white. The Tail is three inches long, compoſed of twelve feathers, waved with croſs lines or bars of brown and white alternately placed.</p>
                        <p>Its Legs are very long, bare of feathers for two inches above the firſt joynt [or Knees] of a middle colour between green and livid, or <note n="*" place="margin">Lead colour</note> plumbeous: The back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe ſmall: The Claws black.

                        <p>WE ſaw and deſcribed at <hi>Venice</hi> another bird, we think different from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent: though the main difference were in the colour of its Legs, which were of a pale yellowiſh-red. Its Bill alſo ſeemed to be ſomething ſhorter.</p>
                        <p>We take this to be the bird the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Chevalier aux pieds rouges,</hi> the <hi>red-leg'd Horſeman;</hi> the precedent (as we ſaid before) that they denominate, <hi>Chevalier aux pieds verds.</hi> And perchance they may differ only in Sex; for this was a Male, that a Female. For in other birds alſo of this kind, as for example, the <hi>Erythra</hi> of <hi>Geſner,</hi> which he puts among the <hi>Water-hens,</hi> the Female differs from the Male both in bigneſs, and in the colour of the Legs. The red <hi>Callidrys</hi> of <hi>Bellonius</hi> is either the ſame with this or very like it: It differs in that the Neck and feathers under the Wings and Rump are aſh-coloured, and that on the Temples on each ſide it hath two black ſpots, which give as it were a ſhadow to the Eye-brows, which themſelves alſo are marked with a white ſpot. His figure of the red <hi>Callidrys</hi> doth not anſwer to the deſcription, for the Bill and Legs are drawn too ſhort.</p>

The Throat par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoloured of black and white, the black being drawn down longways the feathers. The white colour ſeems to have ſomething of red mingled with it. The Breaſt is whiter with fewer ſpots, and thoſe tranſverſe.</p>
                        <p>The Tail, and feathers next to it are variegated with tranſverſe waved lines of white and black alternately. The number of Tail-feathers is twelve; the length of the Tail two inches three quarters. The quil-feathers in each Wing are twenty ſix, of which the firſt is brown, only its ſhaft white: The five next of a black brown; on the inner ſide white, and as it were ſprinkled or powdered with white. The tip of the ſeventh is white, with one or two tranſverſe black lines. In the following fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the white ſpreads it ſelf further, till in the nineteenth it takes up the whole fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The <note n="*" place="margin">Underſtand it of the firſt row of coverts</note> foremoſt covert-feathers are black; the middle varied with white lines. The other rows of covert-feathers are of the ſame colour with the Back, that is of a dark aſh-colour.</p>
                        <p>The Bill is two inches long, ſlender, and like a <hi>Woodcocks,</hi> of a dark red at baſe, black toward the point. The Tongue is ſharp, ſlender, and undivided; the upper Mandible longer, and ſomething crooked at the very tip: The Eyes hazel-coloured: The Noſthrils oblong.

Of the fore-toes the inmoſt is the leaſt: All are connected by a membrane below; but the outmoſt with a larger, extending to the ſecond joynt.</p>
                        <p>It is common on the ſandy ſhores about <hi>England</hi> every where.</p>

The feathers growing on and between the Shoulders, as alſo the quil-feathers next the body, and moſt of the covert-feathers of the Wings are ſpotted on the edges with many white ſpecks.

The Throat is white, and ſpotted with brown. The fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on the middle of the Back are blackiſh, with white edges: Thoſe next the Tail milk-white. The colour alſo of the Breaſt and whole Belly is purely white.</p>
                        <p>The quil-feathers, twenty four in each Wing, are all dusky, ſave only the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, three in number. The Tail is more than two inches long, conſiſting of twelve feathers of feathers of almoſt equal length. The outmoſt of theſe are wholly white; the next near their tips marked with a white ſpot. The third in order from the outmoſt have one broad tranſverſe white line not far from the point; the fourth two; the fifth two and an half; the middlemoſt three or four. The covert-feathers of the underſide of the Wing are brown, with white edges. The interiour baſtard wing makes a lovely ſhew. For its feathers being of a dark brown, or black colour, are curiouſly varied with many white lines, drawn not directly croſs each feather, but obliquely, yet parallel one to another in each Web of the feather, and by pairs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring at the ſhaft in an obtuſe angle all along the length of the feather. <figure/>

                        <p>This is a ſolitary bird; yet in breeding time they fly two together, Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, about the banks of Pools, Lakes, and Rivers.</p>

The Head is paler, not varied with croſs lines, but black ſtrokes drawn downward along the ſhafts of the feathers. The Sides, Breaſt, and Belly are white. Above the Eyes is a white line. The Throat is of a ſordid white, the ſhafts of the feathers being darker. The three or four quil-feathers next to the body are of the ſame colour with the body: The outmoſt is dusky, [or dark brown] the inner edge of the ſecond, about the middle of the feathers length, hath a ſpot of white: Of the reſt to the tenth the inner Webs in order have larger white ſpots. After the tenth the white ſpreadeth beyond the ſhaft into the other Web of the feather. The tips alſo of the feathers, from the fourteenth to the twentieth, are white.

                     <p>IT weighed four ounces and an half; from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Feet was ten inches long; between the ends of the Wings ſtretcht out twenty inches broad.</p>
                     <p>As for the colour, the Head and Back were of a dusky aſh-colour, or dark grey: The Rump varied with white and black lines: The Breaſt and Belly white: The ſides under the Wings ſpotted with brown. [In ſome Birds we obſerved a white line between the Eyes and the Bill.]</p>
                     <p>The greater quil-feathers of the Wings were black, with white ſhafts: The outer edges of the next after the fifth white: Of the ſecond row of Wing-feathers, the foremoſt were black, with white tips: From the fourth the white increaſed, or ſpread it ſelf further down the feather. The leſſer covert-feathers of the Wings were of the ſame colour with the back, only fringed as it were with white. The Tail was two inches and a quarter long, made up of twelve feathers, the outmoſt whereof on each ſide was white.</p>
                     <p>The Bill was near an inch and half long, black, as in the <hi>Woodcock;</hi> bigger and ſtronger than in the <hi>Snipe-kind:</hi> The Tongue extended to the very end of the Bill.

                     <p>About the beginning of Winter they are ſaid to come into <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> where they continue two or three months about the Sea-ſhores, and away again.

                     <p>THat we deſcribed was a young one. It weighed five ounces: Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Feet was fifteen inches. Its Neck was aſh-coloured: Its Head of a dusky aſh-colour, ſpotted with a dark brown. The Back and ſcapular feathers particoloured, of cinereous, black, and white: The Breaſt and Belly white: The Throat white and cinereous: The Chin white. The outmoſt ten Wing-feathers of the firſt row were black: Of the following the tips began to be white: From the fourteenth to the twentieth the edges were alſo white. The five next the body were of the ſame colour with it, having darker ſpots. The tips of the ſecond row of Wing-feathers were white (of the foremoſt more obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the remaining part of the ſame colour with the Back. The covert-feathers of the under ſide of the Wing were white. Thoſe of the exteriour baſtard wing purely white. The Tail was two inches a quarter long, made up of twelve feathers, of a dusky colour, with whitiſh tips.</p>
                     <p>In the Cock birds a circle or collar of long feathers, ſomething reſembling a Ruff, encompaſſes the Neck under the Head, whence they took the name of <hi>Ruffs.</hi> This ſhaft in ſome is white, in ſome yellow, in ſome black, in ſome aſh-coloured, in ſome of a deep blue, or black, with a gloſs of blue ſhining like ſilk. For there is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:63869:158"/>
and almoſt infinite variety in the colours of the feathers of the Cocks, ſo that in the Spring-time there can ſcarce be found any two exactly like one to another. After Midſummer, when they have moulted their feathers they ſay they become all alike again.</p>
                     <p>The Hens are ſomewhat leſs than the Cocks; they change not their colours, and are like the Bird here deſcribed: They ſeldom or never fight.</p>
                     <p>Their Bills are like the <hi>Tringa's,</hi> black, but ſomewhat red about the Noſthrils. The upper Mandible a little longer than the nether. The Tongue reaches to the end of the Bill. The Eyes are hazel-coloured. The Legs from yellow incline to red: The back-toe ſmall: The outmoſt fore-toe joyned to the middlemoſt below with a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane: The Claws black, pretty long, and almoſt ſtreight. The Stomach within yellow: The Gall large.</p>
                     <p>They breed in Summer-time in the Fens of <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> about <hi>Crowland.</hi> They are fatted with white bread and milk, like <hi>Knots,</hi> being ſhut up in cloſe dark rooms: For let in but the light upon them, preſently they fall a fighting, never giving over till one hath killed the other, eſpecially if any body ſtand by. The Fowlers when they ſee them intent upon fighting, ſpread their Nets over them, and catch them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be aware.</p>
                     <p>In the Spring time they come over alſo to the <hi>Low Countries:</hi> And it is reported, that at their firſt coming in the beginning of the Spring there are many more Cocks than Hens, but that they never ceaſe fighting till there be ſo many Cocks killed, as to make the number of both Sexes equal.</p>
                     <p>The Hens never have any Ruffs, the Cocks have none immediately after moulting time. When they begin to moult, white Tumours or Warts break out about their Eyes and Head.</p>

                     <p>IT is ſomthing bigger than the <hi>Sand-piper,</hi> though both take their names from ſand. It weighs almoſt two ounces. Its length from the Bill to the end of the Feet is eight inches and an half, to the end of the Tail eight. The breadth of the Wings ſpread ſixteen. It is rather long than round-bodied.</p>
                     <p>Its Bill is ſtreight, black, ſlender, an inch long; for its figure and make like to a <hi>Tringa's</hi> Bill: The upper Mandible a little longer than the nether. The Tongue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the end of the Bill: The Noſthrils oblong. The Ears great. The Legs, Feet, and Claws black: And, which is eſpecially remarkable, it wants the back-toe: The fore-toes disjoyned from the very riſe.</p>
                     <p>The Head is ſmall, particoloured of cinereous and black. The Neck more cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous. The middle of the Back, the Shoulders, and ſcapular feathers are of a lovely colour, in ſome various, of black and white; in others of black and aſh-colour, each feather being black about the ſhaft, and cinereous about the edges. The reſt of the Back to the Tail is of the ſame colour, but more faint and dilute. But the edges of the feathers have more of a reddiſh aſh-colour.</p>
                     <p>Each Wing hath twenty two quil-feathers: The four outmoſt (excepting the ſhafts, which are white) all of a dark brown, or dusky colour. The reſt have their upper halves, as far as they appear, above the ſecond row brown, the lower white. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, theſe colours do not divide all the feathers equally, but from the fifth the white is gradually increaſed, ſo that in the twentieth it takes up almoſt the whole feather. The next following after the tenth have alſo their tips white. The firſt row of covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers [next the quils] have white tips, which when the Wing is ſpread make a long tranſverſe white line, broader and broader by degrees from the beginning. The feathers near the ridge of the Wing, and on the outmoſt joynt, are all dusky, in the Cocks almoſt black, of the ſame colour with the middle of the Back. The Wings, when cloſed, reach as far or further than the Tail it ſelf; which is ſhort, of about an inch and half, or two inches, conſiſting of twelve feathers, of an aſh-colour: The two middlemoſt darker than the reſt, and almoſt black.</p>
                     <p>The whole Belly and underſide of the Wings as white as Snow. The Breaſt in ſome ſpotted or clouded with brown; in others (perhaps theſe are the Males) no

ſpots appear, yet the Breaſt is darker than the Belly, and inclined to red. The blind guts are an inch and half long. The Stomach not very muſculous. Theſe birds live upon the ſandy ſhores of the Sea, and fly in flocks. We ſaw many of them on the Sea-coaſts of <hi>Cornwall.</hi>

                        <p>IT is equal to the common <hi>Lark,</hi> or but very little leſs: For the ſhape of its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy like to a <hi>Snipe.</hi> From Bill to Feet eight inches and an half long. Its Bill is ſtreight, ſlender, black, an inch and half long, and like to a <hi>Snipes</hi> bill. The Tongue extended to the end of the Bill. The Feet dusky or blackiſh, with a tincture of green. The toes not joyned by any membrane. The back-toe ſmall. The colour of the upper ſide of the body, excepting the prime feathers of the Wings, and firſt row of coverts, is grey, or cinereous, with black ſpots, or lines in the middle of each ſingle feather. The feathers in the middle of the Back and upper ſide of the Wings have a tincture of red. [Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> deſcribes it a little differently thus: The middle parts of the feathers on the Head are black, the edges red or ruſſet. The Neck is more of an aſh-colour. The Back-feathers of a <note n="*" place="margin">Or black with a purple gloſs.</note> dark purple, with reddiſh aſh-coloured edges. Thoſe on the Rump of a lighter red, with black lines or ſtroaks down their ſhafts.]</p>
                        <p>The Wings are long, and when folded up reaching to the end of the Tail. The quil-feathers of each Wing twenty four, of a dusky colour as far as they appear above the covert-feathers, for their bottoms are white, and the interiour in order gradually more than the exteriour to the nineteenth, which is almoſt wholly white. [Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lughby</hi> in the bird he deſcribed obſerved the tips of the ſecond row of Wing-feathers to have been alſo white, in the ſame proportion as in the <hi>Sanderling,</hi> making together a white line croſs the Wing, yet narrower than in that. The exteriour edges of the fifth, counting from the outmoſt, and of the ſubſequent to the eleventh are white. The four next the body are wholly dusky, and by little and little ſtreightned into ſharp points, and when the Wing is cloſed reach almoſt to the end of the Tail. The Tail is ſcarce two inches long, not forked, made up of twelve feathers, of which the two middlemoſt are longer than the reſt, ſharper pointed alſo, and darker-coloured. All the reſt are of a pale aſh-colour, without any croſs lines or bars, only their outmoſt edges whitiſh. All the under-ſide of the body is white, only the Throat and upper part of the Breaſt clouded a little with dark-coloured ſpots. Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> obſerved ſmall brown ſpots under the Wings, and the Throat to be of an aſh-colour, thick-ſet with black ſpots, down ſometimes to the Breaſt.</p>
                        <p>The Liver divided into two Lobes, of which the right is much the bigger. The Stomach muſculous.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Birds live about the Sea-ſhores, and fly together in flocks. At <hi>Weſtcheſter</hi> they call them <hi>Purres.</hi>

                     <p>ITs weight is eighteen ounces: Its length from Bill to Tail eighteen inches, to the points of the Claws twenty: Its breadth from tip to tip of the Wings extended thirty ſix inches. The length of the Bill, meaſuring from the tip to the angles of the mouth, two inches. The Bill is not much unlike a <hi>Gulls,</hi> but ſtreight, ſharp-pointed, black as far as the Noſthrils, then yellow. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes and edges of the Eye-lids are yellow. Under the Eyes is a bare ſpace of a yellowiſh green colour. The Legs are long and yellow. The Claws ſmall and black. It hath only three fore-toes, wanting the back-toe. The outmoſt Toe a little longer than the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt; All joyned together by a certain membrane, which on the inſide the middle toe begins at the ſecond joynt, on the outſide at the firſt, and reaches almoſt to the Claws of the outer Toes. The Legs (as <hi>Bellonius</hi> obſerves) are very thick below the Knees, as if they were ſwoln, by reaſon of the bones, which are there great; wherefore that he might render the Bird more eaſie to be known, he named it, <hi>Oedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemus.</hi> The upper Legs are above half way bare of feathers; which note alone, were there no other, argues this Bird to be a Water-fowl. The Chin, Breaſt, and Thighs are white: The Throat, Neck, Back, and Head covered with feathers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their middle parts black, their lateral or borders of a reddiſh aſh-colour, like that of a <hi>Curlew:</hi> Whence they of <hi>Norfolk</hi> call it, The <hi>Stone-Curlew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In each Wing are about twenty nine quil-feathers; the firſt and ſecond of which have a tranſverſe white ſpot, elſe their exteriour ſurface black: The four next to theſe black: The three following have their bottoms and tips white: Then ſucceed thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen black ones; the laſt or next to the body are of the ſame colour with it. The firſt feathers of the ſecond row are black: The reſt have white tips, and under the tips a croſs line or border of black. In the leſſer rows of Wing-feathers is a tranſverſe bed or bar of white. The coverts of the under-ſide of the Wings, eſpecially thoſe ſpringing from the ſhoulders, are purely white. The outmoſt feathers of the Tail for the ſpace of an inch are black, then white: The next to theſe, one on each ſide, are variegated, with one or two brown bars croſſing the white part: The reſt, the white by degrees fading and diſappearing, become of the ſame colour with the body. The tips of the middlemoſt are a little black. The Tail is five inches long, conſiſting of twelve feathers. The guts great: The blind guts three inches long: The ſingle um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical blind gut half an inch. We bought this bird in the Market at <hi>Rome,</hi> and there deſcribed it.</p>
                     <p>It breeds very late in the year (ſaith <hi>Bellonius)</hi> for we found of the Young about the end of <hi>October,</hi> which could not yet fly. <hi>Bellonius</hi> when he travelled firſt in <hi>England,</hi> obſerved this Bird here; for the feathers and the Feet very like to a <hi>Buſtard.</hi>

                     <p>THis Bird is in all Countries very well known; and every where to be met with. In the North of <hi>England</hi> they call it the <hi>Tewit,</hi> from its cry.

                     <p>The top of the Head above the Creſt is of a ſhining black. The Creſt ſprings from the hind part of the Head, and conſiſts of about twenty feathers, of which the three or four foremoſt are longer than the reſt, in ſome birds of near four inches length. The Cheeks are white; only a black line drawn under the Eyes through the Ears. The whole Throat or under ſide of the Neck, from the Bill to the Breaſt is black, which black part ſomewhat reſembles a Creſcent, ending in horns on each ſide the Neck.

The Bill is black, hard, roundiſh, of an inch length.

                     <p>It lays four or five Eggs, of a dirty yellow, all over painted with great black ſpots and ſtroaks. It builds its Neſt on the ground, in the middle of ſome field or heath, open, and expoſed to view, laying only ſome few ſtraws or bents under the Eggs, that the Neſt be not ſeen. The Eyes being ſo like in colour to the ground on which they lie, it is not eaſie to find them though they lie ſo open. The Young ſo ſoon as they are hatcht inſtantly forſake the Neſt, running away (as the common tradition is) with the ſhells upon their heads, for they are covered with a thick Down, and follow the old ones like Chickens. They ſay, that a <hi>Lapwing</hi> the further you are from her Neſt, the more clamorous ſhe is, and the greater coil ſhe keeps, the nearer you are to it, the quieter ſhe is, and leſs concerned ſhe ſeems: That ſhe may draw you away from the true place, and induce you to think it is where it is not.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Birds are wont to be kept in Gardens in the Summer time, in which they do good ſervice in gathering up and clearing the ground of Worms and other Inſects.

If you heed each ſingle feather, you will find the middle part to be black, the borders or edges round about ſpotted with a yellowiſh green colour. The Head for the bulk of the body is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than in the <hi>Fringae;</hi> the Bill ſtreight, black, of an inch length, furrowed about the Noſthrils.

The reſt of the covert-feathers are on the upper ſide of the Wing of the ſame colour with the Back, on the under-ſide with the Belly.

The Bill, meaſuring from the tip to the angles of the mouth, was an inch long: The Head elegantly variegated with white and black ſpots, the middle part of each ſingle fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being black. Above the Eyes was a long whitiſh line: The Chin whitiſh. The Throat is of a pale cinereous or whitiſh colour, with oblong brown ſpots. The Breaſt and underſide of the Wings of a dirty yellowiſh colour, the Belly white. Each Wing hath about twenty five prime feathers, of which the firſt or outmoſt is the longeſt, the tenth the ſhorteſt; from the tenth to the twentieth they are almoſt equal: The reſt to the twenty fourth are again longer the foregoing than the following. The firſt or Pinion-quil hath a broad, ſtrong, white ſhaft: The three outmoſt are blacker than the reſt, which are of a dusky [or brown] colour, having the edges of their tips whitiſh. The leſſer rows of the Wing-feathers are brown, with yellowiſh white tips, but thoſe next the quils blackeſt. The middle of the Back between the Wings is almoſt of the ſame colour with them. The Rump and Neck are more <note n="*" place="margin">Grey.</note> cinereous. The Tail is compoſed of twelve feathers, two inches and an half long, but the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt ſomething the longer: The bottoms of all are cinereous, the tips white, the remaining part black: In the outmoſt feather the white part is broader, in the middle ones narrower: The edges alſo of the outmoſt feathers are whitiſh. The Legs are bare for a little ſpace above the Knees, of a ſordid or greeniſh yellow; the Toes and Claws darker coloured than the Legs. The inner Toe joyned to the middle only at bottom, the outer by a thick membrane as far as its firſt joynt.

                     <p>Of the catching of <hi>Dotterels,</hi> my very good Friend Mr. <hi>Peter Dent,</hi> an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> a Perſon well skill'd in the Hiſtory of Plants and Animals, whom I conſulted concerning it, wrote thus to me. A Gentleman of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> where this kind of ſport is very common, told me, that to catch <hi>Dotterels</hi> ſix or ſeven perſons uſually go in company. When they have found the Birds, they ſet their Net in an advantageous place; and each of them holding a ſtone in either hand get behind the Birds, and ſtriking their ſtones often one againſt another rouſe them, which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very ſluggiſh; and ſo by degrees coup them, and drive them into the Net. The Birds being awakened do often ſtretch themſelves, putting out a Wing or a Leg, and in imitation of them the men that drive them thruſt out an Arm or a Leg for faſhion ſake, to comply with an old cuſtom. But he thought that this imitation did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the taking of them, for that they ſeemed not to mind or regard it.</p>

                     <p>IN bigneſs it ſomewhat exceeds the common <hi>Lark:</hi> From the point of the Bill to the end of the Tail or Legs (for they are equally extended) being eight inches and an half long, a line of black compaſſes the baſe of the upper Bill. This black line from the corners of the mouth is produced through the Eyes as far as the Ears, and then turns up and paſſes croſs the middle of the Head, encompaſſing a broad bed or fillet of white drawn from the inner corner of one Eye to the inner corner of the other. The hinder part of the Head is aſh-coloured: The Chin white. The Neck encompaſſed by a double ring or collar, the upper white, which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath reaches as far as the Bill, and under the Chin is dilated almoſt to the Eyes; the lower black, which is broader in the middle, and takes up part of the Breaſt, before alſo runs out toward the Bill. The Back and leſſer covert feathers of the Wings are <note n="*" place="margin">Or grey.</note> aſh-coloured. The Breaſt and Belly white.</p>
                     <p>The outmoſt of the quil-feathers of the Wings is black, on the middle of the ſhaft only ſpotted with white, which colour ſpreads it ſelf gradually and continually more and more in the following feathers, inſomuch that the twentieth and twenty firſt are wholly white. Thoſe next the body are of the ſame colour with the Back. The feathers of the ſecond row have white tips, excepting the foremoſt or outmoſt. Hence, and from the white of the firſt row ariſes a long tranſverſe white line in the Wings. The outmoſt feather of the Tail on each ſide is white, as alſo the tip and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour half of the next; of the three following only the tips: The two middlemoſt are of the ſame colour with the Back, or a little darker. The Tail is two inches and an half long, made up of twelve feathers, of which the outmoſt are the longeſt, of the reſt the interiour are a little ſhorter in order than the exteriour. [The Tail-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in divers birds vary in colour, for in ſome the two outmoſt feathers are wholly white, and the tips alſo of the middlemoſt.]</p>
                     <p>The Bill is ſhort, ſcarce an inch in length, of two colours: For beneath toward the Head it is of a deep yellow or gold-colour more than half way, toward the point black. The upper Mandible a little longer, and ſomewhat crooked. [In others (perhaps they were young ones) we obſerved the whole Bill to be black.] The Tongue is not divided: The Eyes are hazel-coloured: The Legs and Feet of a pale yellow: The Claws black. It wants the back-toe. The outmoſt of the fore-toes is joyned to the middlemoſt by a membrane reaching to the firſt joynt. The Stomach hath not very thick muſcles, in it diſſected we found <hi>Beetles.</hi> The Gall-bladder is large.</p>
                     <p>It builds on the Sea-rocks, making its Neſt of graſs, ſtraws, and ſtalks of Plants: Its Eggs are of a greeniſh colour, ſpotted with brown, all the blunt end being dusky. It runs very ſwiftly on the ſhores, and makes ſhort flights, ſinging or crying

                     <p>The colour of the Plumage in the Head, Neck, Shoulders, Wings, and upper part of the Breaſt is brown.

The Plumage on the middle of the Back is white; but on the very Rump is a great, tranſverſe, black ſpot. The long ſcapular feathers are brown, with edges of an aſh-colour, or dirty white. The quil-feathers of the Wings are about twenty ſix, of a brown or dusky colour: But from the outmoſt three or four their bottoms are white, continually more and more, till in the nineteenth and twentieth the white ſpreads almoſt over the whole feather. In the ſecond row the foremoſt feathers are wholly black: The tips of the following being white, together make a broad line of white croſs the Wing. The edges of the leſſer rows are red. Near the ſecond joynt of the Wing is a white ſpot. The Tail is two inches and an half long, conſiſting of twelve feathers, of which the lower half is white, the upper black, yet the very tips white.</p>

                           <p>IT is like the common <hi>Water-hen,</hi> but leſs; bigger than a <hi>Quail;</hi> of a ſlender, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or compreſſed body: From point of Bill to the end of the Claws ſixteen inches long, to the end of the Tail but twelve: According to our uſual way of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring ſixteen inches broad.</p>
                           <p>Its Head is ſmall, narrow, or compreſſed ſideways. Its Bill, like the <hi>Ruffs,</hi> about two inches long, ſtreight, compreſſed likewiſe ſideways, red, eſpecially the lower Mandible, and lower part of the upper, for toward the top or point it is black, ſmooth, and hard. The Tongue reaches to the very end of the Bill, and is white and rough at the tip. It hath a round, black, bald ſpot or naked skin in the forehead, but much leſs than that of the <hi>Coot,</hi> ſo little that it is ſcarce obſervable. The colour of the Head, Shoulders, Back, covert-feathers of the Wings, in brief, the whole up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſide is various of black or dark brown, and olive colour; each ſingle feather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving its middle part black, and its edges olive-coloured. [Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> makes the colour of the borders or edges of the feathers a yellowiſh red or ruſſet; and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes white ſpots to the Head, which were not, or at leaſt not obſerved in the birds ſeen and deſcribed by me.] The Chin is white, the Throat red, with a mixture of aſh-colour; the extreme edges, and as it were fringes of the feathers being a little grey. The Breaſt is more blue, with a bed of white in the middle. On the Thighs and ſides under the Wings grow black feathers, elegantly variegated with tranſverſe white lines. The Belly is ruſſet, with white feathers under the Tail, like the common <hi>Morehen,</hi> marked with one or two black ſpots. The Wings are hollow, the quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers ſhort, black, or very near it, in number twenty two. Along the <hi>baſis</hi> of the Wing is a line of white, as in the <hi>Morehen.</hi> The Tail is <note n="*" place="margin">Of about two inches length.</note> ſhort and black, only the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:63869:164"/>
edges of the two middle feathers are red. The Legs and Feet are of a dark fleſh-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: The Legs ſtrong: The Toes, as in the reſt of this kind, very long, divided from the very riſe, except that the outer Toe is joyned to the middle by a membrane at the bottom. The Claws are of the ſame colour with the Toes.</p>
                           <p>It had a great, long, crooked Gall-bladder; and a large Gall-pore beſides: Long blind-guts, filled with Excrements; a muſculous Stomach, in which we found a ſhell-Snail.</p>
                           <p>It runs very ſwiftly, and hides it ſelf about the banks of Rivers: It walks rather than ſwims in the water. It flies with its feet hanging down. It is called at <hi>Venice, Forzane,</hi> or <hi>Porzana,</hi> a name common to other <hi>Water-hens</hi> alſo.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>IT is leſs not only than the common <hi>Water-hen,</hi> but than the <hi>Rail,</hi> but in ſhape of body like. Its Legs and Feet are of the ſame, both figure and colour, with the common <hi>Water-hens, viz.</hi> a ſordid green. The Toes very long, divided to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom: The Bill ſhorter than either the <hi>Rails</hi> or common <hi>Morehens,</hi> compreſſed or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſharp-pointed, of a yellow colour, brighter at the head, darker toward the tip. The upper part of the upper Chap near the Head above the Noſthrils is cruſted over with a kind of yellow plaiſter. The Head, as in the reſt of this kind, is little. The colour of the feathers in the middle of the crown is darker: From the Bill above the Eyes on each ſide is drawn a line of grey or pale aſh-colour: Beneath about the Ears the feathers are of the ſame colour with the reſt of the body; under the Throat again they are aſh-coloured or blue. The Neck, both above and beneath, and all the Breaſt are particoloured, <hi>viz.</hi> of a middle colour between green, yellow, and dusky, elegantly ſprinkled with black ſpots. [Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> makes the Breaſt white or cinereous, the bottoms of the feathers being black, the Throat black, with white ſpots, the Chin of a dark aſh-colour without ſpots.] The feathers on the crown of the head have their middle parts black, their edges red: Thoſe on the Shoulders and middle of the Back their middle parts about the ſhaft black, their ſides and tips of a ſordid red, their utmoſt edges on each ſide white.</p>
                           <p>The quil-feathers of the Wings are all of a dark brown, with a certain tincture of red: The covert-feathers red, with tranſverſe waved lines of white at intervals. The lateral parts covered by the Wings, are cloathed with brown feathers, variegated with tranſverſe waved lines of white. The Tail is ſhort, conſiſting of twelve feathers, of the ſame colour with the quils of the Wings, ſave that the middlemoſt on their lateral edges have ſomething of white. But what is eſpecially remarkable in the Tail is, that when ſpread it is not plain, as in moſt birds, but notably concave. The middle fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are longer than the reſt. Moreover, the Wings are very hollow, as in moſt Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowl of the <hi>Poultry-kind.</hi> The Gall is large, the Stomach muſculous: In it we found ſeeds of Plants.</p>
                           <p>This ſort of <hi>Water-hen</hi> we firſt ſaw and deſcribed at <hi>Milan,</hi> then at <hi>Florence,</hi> where the Fowlers call it <hi>Tordo Gelſemino,</hi> unleſs perchance that be a diſtinct kind; and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:63869:165"/>
laſtly, at <hi>Valence</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> That this is the <hi>Gallinula poliopus</hi> of <hi>Aldrovand</hi> the names impoſed on it do perſwade us, though the deſcriptions do not in all points agree.</p>
                           <p>The Bird that I deſcribed at <hi>Florence</hi> was of the bigneſs of the leſſer <hi>Tringa,</hi> long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied, with a ſmall Head, Wings of a mean ſize, a ſhort Tail, Legs bare for a little above the knees, very long Toes except the back one, which is ſhorter in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than the reſt, and ſituate higher. The Bill, for the bigneſs of the bird, is of a good length, ſtreight, narrow, or compreſſed ſideways; of a greeniſh yellow colour: But the upper Mandible both at the baſe and toward the tip is darker coloured, and as it were of a dusky green. The Legs and Feet are of a ſordid green, neither is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Claws different. In the colour of the feathers it agrees moſtwhat with the deſcribed, ſave that in the middle of the Back between the Wings a black liſt runs down beſprinkled with white ſpots, of a conſiderable length and breadth: to which alſo are two lines adjacent, one on each ſide, in the covert-feathers of the Wings, not parallel to the middle one, but running out wider toward the Tail. The Eyes are ſmall, and their <hi>Irides</hi> of a greeniſh yellow. In the bird that Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the length from Bill to Claws was thirteen inches, from Bill to Tail nine and an half: The breadth between the tips of the Wings ſixteen. The Bill, like that of the common <hi>Water-hen,</hi> from the point to the angles of the mouth ſcarce an inch long: The Tail two inches. along the utmoſt edge of the Wing from the Shoulders to the very tip of the outmoſt pinion feather runs a line of white, as in the common <hi>Water-hen.</hi> This line of white was not in the Bird we deſcribed at <hi>Florence:</hi> Yet I perſwade my ſelf that both theſe deſcriptions are of one and the ſame <hi>Species</hi> of bird, differing either in Age or Sex.</p>

                           <p>SO he denominates it from the pale yellow or Brimſtone-like colour of its Legs, (which appears alſo in its Bill to the middle part or further, for the forepart of it is black.)

There is alſo ſomething of brown and cinereous in the Wings. The Feet want the back-toe, unleſs the Picture deceives me. It builds among ſhrubs with moſs and graſs.

This Bird he thus briefly deſcribes.</hi> It is thick and ſhort-bodied, and ſhaped otherwiſe like its Picture, [of which he there gives a draught,] ſcarce any bird hath longer Toes for its bigneſs. The hind-toe alſo is about half as long as the fore ones. The colours I do not well remember, but I think their Legs were greeniſh. The Back and Wings from a reddiſh colour inclined to brown. Its note (as they ſay) is harſh, <hi>Ger, ger, ger,</hi> ſomething like a Serpents. And therefore it is alſo taken by Fowlers imitating its voice by a knife drawn through dry wood. But whereas he ſaith, that the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> accounting it a very delicate bird, uſe ſeveral ſnares and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to catch it among the ſtanding corn, he was certainly deceived by a falſe relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for that <hi>England</hi> neither breeds nor feeds any ſuch bird beſides the <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Water-Rail.</hi>

                           <p>THis Bird neither <hi>Geſner,</hi> nor <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> nor we truly have hitherto ſeen, but Pictures of it only. It is (if the Pictures deceive us not) of the <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen</hi> kind. Its body is all over of a blue colour. The extreme half of the Tail is a whitiſh aſh-colour: The Bill and Legs of a ſhining purple. So <hi>Geſner</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it by a Picture ſent him from <hi>Montpellier. Aldrovandus</hi> deſcribes it otherwiſe, as may be ſeen in <hi>Book</hi> 20. <hi>Chap.</hi> 28. of his <hi>Ornithology.</hi> Seeing therefore the Pictures of this Bird do ſo much vary, and none of thoſe who have compiled Hiſtories of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals do profeſs themſelves to have ſeen the <hi>Porphyrio,</hi> we did ſometimes doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were any ſuch bird in nature, eſpecially ſeeing ſome of thoſe things which the Ancients attribute to it, as for example, that it hath five Toes in each foot, are without doubt falſe and fabulous. But becauſe all the Pictures of it do agree in the figure of its Bill, Legs and Feet, and indeed the whole body, we have now changed our minds, and are more apt to believe the affirmative, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is ſuch a

                        <p>THis <hi>Rail</hi> (as <hi>Geſner</hi> deſcribes it) is more a Water than a Land Fowl: And at <hi>Meſtre,</hi> a Village not far diſtant from <hi>Venice,</hi> it is taken, not without great toil and expence, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Falcons,</hi> or other Hawks, and a troup of Servants, who wearing Buskins or high-ſhoos, do, in the room of hunting Dogs, wade up and down the ſhallow waters thereabouts, and put up thoſe Birds with certain Clubs they carry, ſhaking and beating the ſhrubs and buſhes where they lie; that ſo they may afterwards become a prey to the <hi>Falcons</hi> that wait for them. This is a very noted Bird in that City, but in my judgment much inferiour for taſte both to a <hi>Thruſh</hi> and a <hi>Quail. Aloyſius Mundella,</hi> principal Phyſician at <hi>Breſcia,</hi> in his Letters to me, writes thus. This Bird differs from our <note n="*" place="margin">Coot.</note> 
                           <hi>Fulica,</hi> in that it hath more white in the Wings, and about the Eyes. Its Bill is black; its Legs greeniſh. It hath no ſuch diſſected or ſcalloped membranes between the Toes, no baldneſs on the Head, as far as I gather from the Picture.</p>
                        <p>What Bird this is, and whether we have ever ſeen it, being ſo briefly deſcribed with a few, and ſome of thoſe negative notes, we cannot certainly determine.</p>

                        <p>IT weighs twenty four ounces: From Bill-point to Tail-end is ſixteen inches long; to the Claws twenty two. The Bill is an inch and half long, white, with a light tincture of blue, ſharp-pointed, a little compreſſed or narrow; both Mandibles equal. The feet bluiſh, or of a dusky green: The back-toe little, with one only membrane adhering, and that not ſcallop'd, but extending all the length of the Toe. The inner fore-toe is a little ſhorter than the outer: All the Toes longer than in whole-footed birds. About the joynts of the Toes are ſemicircular membranes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant, on the inner Toe two, the middle three, the outer four. Theſe circular membranes are bigger, and more diſtinct on the inſide of the Toes, ſo that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inciſures or nicks reach to the very joynts. [This may be thus briefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, The three fore-toes have lateral membranes on each ſide, ſcalloped, the inner with two, the middle Toe with three, and the outer with four ſcallops.] From the Bill almoſt to the crown of the Head ariſes an Excreſcency or Lobe of fleſh, bare of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:63869:167"/>
feathers, ſoft, ſmooth, round, which they call the <note n="*" place="margin">Calvities.</note> baldneſs. The feathers about the Head and Neck are low, ſoft, and thick. The colour all over the body black, deeper about the Head. The Breaſt and Belly are of a lead-colour. The Thighs cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with feathers almoſt down to the knees: Juſt beneath the feathers is a ring of yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low about the Leg. The firſt ten quil-feathers are of a dark, dusky, or black colour, the eight next lighter, with white tips; the laſt or next the body are of a deeper black The Tail conſiſts of twelve feathers, and is two inches long.</p>
                        <p>The Liver is great, divided into two Lobes, having alſo a large Gall. The blind guts are nine inches long, their ends for an inches ſpace being reflected or doubled backwards. It builds its Neſt of graſs, broken reeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> floating on the top of the water, ſo that it riſes and falls together with the Water.

                     <p>The Neck and body are white: The quil-feathers of the Wings black: The covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers are wholly died with a moſt beautiful bright purple or flame-colour, whence it took the names <hi>Phoenicopter</hi> and <hi>Flammant.</hi>

                     <p>It is whole-footed (as <hi>Geſner</hi> rightly hath it) from whom <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> deceived (I gueſs) by the Picture of it diſſenting, affirms the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is cloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed.</p>
                     <p>In Winter-time in hard weather it comes over to the Coaſt of <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and is often taken about <hi>Martiguez</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> and <hi>Montpellier</hi> in <hi>Languedoc.</hi> We ſaw ſeveral caſes of it dried at <hi>Montpellier.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>French</hi> call it <hi>Flambant</hi> or <hi>Flammant,</hi> rather from the flammeous colour of its Wings and Feet, than becauſe it comes from <hi>Flanders</hi> in the Winter-time to the Coaſts of <hi>Languedoc.</hi> For I believe there was ſcarce ever ſeen about <hi>Flanders</hi> a bird of this kind, ſo far are they from being common there, and flying from thence into other Countries.

                     <p>It feeds upon <hi>Periwinkles</hi> and fiſhes.

Underneath on the Belly it is white. Two white feathers, which yet have black tips, cover the Tail. The upper ſide, Head, Neck, Back, and Wings are moſtly of a ferrugineous colour.

The Bill is three inches and an half long, ſlender, black, flat or depreſſed, reflected upwards, which is peculiar to this Bird, ending in a very thin, ſlender, weak point. The Tongue is ſhort, not cloven. The Head is of a mean ſize, round, like a ball or bullet, black above, (ſave that the fore part of the Head is ſometimes grey) which colour alſo takes up the upper ſide of the Neck extending to the middle of it. The colour of the whole under ſide of the body is a pure ſnow-white; of the upper ſide partly white, partly black, <hi>viz.</hi> the outmoſt quil-feathers of the Wings are above half way black, the reſt white, as are alſo the feathers of the ſecond row. The reſt of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert-feathers almoſt to the ridge of the Wing are black, which make a broad bed of black, not directly croſs the Wing, but a little oblique. On the Back again it hath two black ſtrakes, beginning from the point of the Shoulder or ſetting on of the Wing, and proceeding tranſverſly till in the middle of the Back they do almoſt meet, being thence produced ſtreight on to the Tail. The whole Tail is white, three inches and an half long, made up of twelve feathers. The Legs are very long, of a lovely blue colour, bare of feathers for almoſt three inches above the Knees. The Claws black and little. It hath a back-toe, but a very ſmall one. The blind guts are ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, almoſt three inches long. The whole length of the Guts is three foot. It hath a Gall-bladder, emptying it ſelf into the Gut by its own proper duct or channel, and a Gall-pore beſides. The Stomach is ſmall, in which diſſected we found nothing but little ſtones, ſo that thence we could not learn on what it feeds. Indeed, the Bill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſlender, weak, long, and of ſo inconvenient a figure, turning upwards, one would wonder how it could gather its food, be it what it will.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> deſcribes the Wings thus. The interiour ſcapular feathers are black, which make a long black ſpot in the middle of the Back. The covert-feathers of the upper part of the Wing, from the ſetting on thereof to the firſt joynt, are white; from the firſt to the ſecond joynt the leſſer covert-feathers are black; from the ſecond joynt to the roots of the greater quil-feathers white again. The firſt quill or pinion feather is wholly black, the ſucceeding have by degrees leſs and leſs black, till in the eight only the exteriour tip remains black.</p>

I underſtood that they abide for the moſt part in the water, and go to land only in breeding time, and for the moſt part lie three or four in one hole.

This Bird was brought me from the <hi>Ferroyer</hi> Iſlands; I kept it alive for ſome months at my houſe.

The feathers on its back were ſo ſoft and even that they reſembled black Velvet. Its Belly was of a pure white. Above the Eyes it had a round white ſpot, of the bigneſs of a Dollar, that you would have ſworn it were a pair of Spectacles, (which <hi>Cluſius</hi> obſerved not) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were its Wings of that figure he expreſſes; but a little broader, with a border of white.</p>

                     <p>THis is leſs by half than the <hi>Penguin,</hi> being not ſo big as a tame Duck: Between the tips of the Wings ſpread it was twenty ſeven inches broad. Its Head, Neck, Back, and Tail, in general its whole upper ſide is black. Its Belly and Breſt as far as the middle of the Throat white. The upper part of the Throat under the Chin hath ſomething of a dusky or purpliſh black.

                     <p>The Bill from the tip to the angles of the mouth is two inches long, of a deep black, narrow or compreſſed ſideways. A little beyond the Noſthrils in the upper Mandible there is engraven a furrow or inciſion deeper than that in the <hi>Coulter-neb.</hi> As far as
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:63869:169"/>
this groove the Bill is covered with a thick, ſhort, ſoft down, like the nap of <hi>Velvet,</hi> The upper Chap is crooked at the end, concave and overhangs the lower: Both are of equal length, channelled with two tranſverſe furrows or grooves [the upper for the moſt part with three,] that next the Head, which is the wideſt, and almoſt croſſes the whole Bill, being white. In theſe furrows there is ſome diverſity in ſeveral birds, for ſome have more than two: Yet are the white lines like and equal in all. Beſides from each Eye to the corner of the upper Mandible is a narrow white line drawn. The Mouth within is of a lovely yellow: The Eyes hazel-coloured. The Legs are ſituate as in the <hi>Penguin</hi> and <hi>Coulterneb,</hi> of a black colour, as are alſo the Feet and Claws. It wants the back-toe.</p>
                     <p>It lays, ſits, and breeds up its Young on the ledges of the craggy Cliffs and ſteep Rocks by the Sea-ſhores, that are broken and divided into many as it were ſtairs or ſhelves, together with the <hi>Coulternebs</hi> and <hi>Guillemots.</hi> The <hi>Manks</hi> men are wont to compare theſe Rocks, with the Birds ſitting upon them in breeding time to an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries ſhop, the ledges of the Rocks reſembling the ſhelves, and the Birds the pots. About the Iſle of <hi>Man</hi> are very high Cliffs, broken in this manner into many ledges one above another from top to bottom. They are wont to let down men by ropes from the tops of the Cliffs to take away the Eggs and young ones. They take alſo the birds themſelves when they are ſitting upon their Eggs, with ſnares faſtened to the tops of long poles, and ſo put about their Necks. They build no Neſts, but lay their Eggs upon the bare Rocks. They fetch many circuits in getting up to their Neſts, and if they have not aimed right, and ſo miſs of them, they drop down into the Sea, and aſcend up again by degrees.</p>
                     <p>All the birds of this kind that we know lay extraordinary great Eggs in proportion to their bodies: This birds are two inches three quarters long, the leſſer ends not ſo ſharp as in the <hi>Guillemots,</hi> white, varied with black ſpots, as <hi>Hoierus</hi> rightly deſcribes them. They feed altogether upon fiſh.</p>

                     <p>It breeds yearly on the ſteep Cliffs and inacceſſible Rocks of the Iſle of <hi>Man,</hi> as do the <hi>Auks,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>THis is leſſer than the tame <hi>Duck,</hi> extended in length from Bill to Feet twelve Inches. Its Bill is ſhort, broad, and compreſſed ſide-ways, contrarily to the Bills of <hi>Ducks,</hi> of a triangular figure, and ending in a ſharp point, the upper Mandible arcuate, and crooked at the point. Where it is joyned to the Head a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain callous ſubſtance encompaſſes its baſe, as in <hi>Parrots.</hi> Between this callous body and the firſt furrow, anon to be deſcribed, are long holes for the Noſthrils produced by the aperture of the mouth. The Bill is of two colours, near the Head * cinereous <note n="†" place="margin">Aſh-colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> or livid, toward the point red; it hath three furrows or grooves impreſſed in it, one in the livid part, two in the red. The Mouth is yellow within. The Eyes grey or aſh-coloured. The Eye-lids are ſtrengthened with a black cartilage: in the lower is a carneous protuberance of a <note n="*" place="margin">Black and blue, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in the skin after a ſtroke or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</note> livid colour, in the upper a ſmall triangular excreſcency of the ſame colour.</p>
                     <p>The Feet of ſome are yellow; I ſuppoſe thoſe are young ones, of others red, ſituate backwards almoſt in the ſame plain with the Belly, as they are in <hi>Doukers</hi> or <hi>Loons,</hi> ſo that the Bird ſtands and walks almoſt perpendicularly erected upon the Tail. It wants the back-toe. The inmoſt of the fore-toes is the ſhorteſt, the middlemoſt the longeſt. The Claws are of a dark blue, inclining to black. The top of the Head, the Neck, and Back are black: The Breaſt and Belly white. A ring or muffler of black produced from the Neck encompaſſes the Throat. The ſides of the Head from the crown, to the now mentioned muffler are white, or of a very pale aſh-colour, ſo that the Eyes and Ears are included in theſe white ſpaces.</p>
                     <p>Their Wings are ſmall, made up of ſhort feathers, nevertheleſs near the ſuperſicies of the water they fly very ſwiftly. They ſay that out of the ſight of the Sea they
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:63869:170"/>
cannot fly at all, nor unleſs they do ever and anon dip their Wings in the water. The Tail is two inches long, made up of twelve feathers, all black. The Stomach within is yellow: The Liver divided into two Lobes, with a Gall annexed.</p>
                     <p>They build no Neſt, but lay their Eggs upon the bare ground. They breed in holes under ground, which either they dig for themſelves, or borrow of the Rabbets, whom they drive out and diſpoſſeſs of their burrows. They lay but one Egg apiece (which is eſpecially remarkable) but if you take away the Egg out of any Neſt, that Bird will lay a ſecond; if you remove that, a third, and ſo on to the fifth. It lays huge Eggs for its bigneſs, even bigger than <hi>Hens</hi> or <hi>Ducks,</hi> of a reddiſh or ſandy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, much ſharper at one end than <hi>Hens</hi> Eggs, and blunter at the other.</p>
                     <p>In the Iſlands of <hi>Man, Bardſey, Caldey, Farn, Godreve, Sillies,</hi> and other ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert Iſlets near the Sea-ſhore they breed yearly in great numbers: And not only in Iſlands, but alſo on Rocks and Cliffs by the Sea-ſide, about <hi>Scarborough, Tenby,</hi> and elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>In the Summer time they abide in the places mentioned, being buſie in breeding and feeding their Young: In the beginning of Autumn they fly away, returning again the next Spring. Whither they fly, and where they ſpend their Winter we know not. It is reported, that in the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> or beginning of <hi>April</hi> there come over firſt ſome Spies or Harbingers, which ſtay ſome two or three days as it were to view and ſearch out the places they uſe to breed in, and ſee whether all be well: Which done they depart, and about the beginning of <hi>May</hi> return again with the whole troup of their fellows. But if that ſeaſon happen to be ſtormy and tempeſtuous, and the Sea troubled, there are abundance of them found caſt upon the ſhores lean and periſhed with famine. For they cannot, unleſs the Sea be calm, either proceed in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or fiſh for their living. In <hi>Auguſt</hi> they all depart, nor are they ſeen any more any where about our Coaſts till the next Spring. The Young which cannot then fly they leave to ſhift for themſelves. All theſe things are to be underſtood alſo of the <hi>Auk</hi> and <hi>Guillemot.</hi> For theſe three kinds do for the moſt part fly together, and build in the ſame places.</p>
                     <p>A certain Fiſherman told us, that in the middle of Winter he once found a <hi>Puffin</hi> under water, torpid, among the Rocks not far from <note n="*" place="margin">This Iſland is not far diſtant from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory of <hi>Carnarvanſhire</hi>

                        <hi>Bardſey</hi> Iſland, which being again caſt into the Sea ſtreightway ſank to the bottom. Believe it that will. Mr. <hi>Fr. Jeſſop</hi> ſent us one killed in the freſh waters not far from <hi>Sheffield</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> much leſs than this we have deſcribed, which yet I think differed only in age; for all marks agreed.</p>
                     <p>Of all the birds of this kind hitherto deſcribed I think it to be true which Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> hath obſerved, that the underſide is ſo far white as it is immerſed in the water in ſwimming, the upper ſide as far as it is extant above the water being black.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Auk, Guillemot,</hi> this Bird, and perchance all the reſt of this kind and the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-Gooſe</hi> lay but one Egg, and bring up but one young one at once, which is a thing very remarkable and worthy the obſervation: But that Egg for the bigneſs of the birds is an extraordinary great one.</p>

The ſhafts of the back-feathers are black. The Tail and covert-feathers of the Wings are of a dusky aſh-colour, as in <hi>Geeſe:</hi> The ends of the quil-feathers black. The Tail is about ſeven inches long, made up of twenty or twenty two feathers, of almoſt equal length, ſave that the outmoſt are a little ſhorter than the middlemoſt. Each Wing hath twenty eight quil-feathers. The Bill toward the Head is of a Lead-colour, the end being yellowiſh: The upper Mandible broad and flat, the nether as it were two long ribs or ſpars joyned at one end, with a thick yellow skin interceding, which reaches backwards to the Throat beyond the Bill. At the end of the Bill is a little knob or protuberance, but the utmoſt tip of the Bill is hooked. The Noſthrils are ſituate at the baſe of the Bill near the Head; above the cranny or furrow running along the length of the Bill, as in the <hi>Soland-gooſe,</hi> and are round. The Eyes are of a yellowiſh aſh-colour, or rather whitiſh: The Legs and Feet of a lead colour. The ſhanks bare above the knees.

Nor is this colour uniform all the body over, for the Wing-feathers are darker than of the reſt of the body. Its Feet are made up of three Toes joyned together by a membrane, and a Heel behind. [Here by inadvertency I ſuppoſe <hi>Stellutus</hi> is miſtaken, for all four toes are web'd together.] The Bill almoſt as long as ones arm, but not toothed.

I could not ſee any Tongue, [neither could <hi>Faber,</hi> who ſaw this ſame bird afterward at <hi>Rome,</hi> find the Tongue, though he ſearched diligently for it] but where the root of the Tongue was fixed I obſerved certain perforate bodies. On the crown of the Head there ſtood up ſome feathers elevated above the reſt, imitating a Creſt. The bag which hangs down under the Bill, and which makes the <hi>Pelecan</hi> greatly different from other birds, is membrana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous, which it ſometimes contracts and draws up ſo to the Bill, that it is ſcarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, other times it ſuffers to be ſo dilated as to receive and contain many <hi>(Faber</hi> ſaith thirty) pounds of water: The membrane being ſo ſtretcht and diſtended, that it appears tranſparent, many fibres and veins running up and down through it. I wondered moſt (they are <hi>Fabers</hi> words) when the Bill being opened very wide, I ſaw the whole head of a man of great ſtature received in that vaſt gulf of the

                        <note n="*" place="margin">He ſo calls this bag un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bill.</note> Craw. In the Head I diſcovered two manifeſt but ſmall holes reaching to the brain, which ſerved for ſmelling. Wanting a Tongue it muſt make that uncouth ſound, like the braying of an Aſs, by the help of its <hi>Larynx</hi> only. I heard not this, but the Keeper of this Bird, that carried it up and down to ſhew, when he provoked it, ſtriking it on the Bill, and the Bird ſeemed angry, and ready to peck or ſtrike with its Bill, ſo that it would ſometimes catch hold of his hand, it made a noiſe ſomewhat like the cry of a <hi>Gooſe,</hi> and that a ſmall and hoarſe one.</p>
                     <p>The noble Lord <hi>Jo. Carolus Schaad</hi> related to me, that a great while ſince there were three <hi>Pelecans</hi> ſhot in the River <hi>Danow</hi> running through <hi>Bavaria,</hi> two of which were kill'd, the third brought alive to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Court, where it lived forty years. It was much delighted in the company and converſation of men, and in Muſick both Vocal and Inſtrumental. For it would willingly ſtand by thoſe that ſung or ſounded the Trumpet, and ſtretching out its Head, and turning its Ear to the Muſick, liſtened very attentively to that ſweet harmony, though its own voice is ſaid to be like the braying of an Aſs. This confirms what we read in <hi>Aldrovand</hi> of the age of the <hi>Pelecan.</hi> which was kept fifty years at <hi>Mechlin,</hi> and was verily believed to be eighty years old. Thus far <hi>Faber.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is ſingular in this Bird, that its bones are pellucid, ſolid, without any marrow at all within; and that the diviſion of the Wind-pipe into two branches is near about the middle of the ſtomach, which I never obſerved in any other bird, ſaith <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This bird feeds upon fiſh, as do all the reſt of this kind. <hi>Faber</hi> ſaw it ſwallow two freſh <hi>Hakes,</hi> that weighed about four pounds, whole.</p>
                     <p>Many of them frequent the River <hi>Danow,</hi> but breed not there. <hi>Bellonius</hi> ſaith he ſaw flocks of <hi>Onocrotali</hi> in <hi>Egypt: Olaus Magnus</hi> writes, that they are frequent in the Northern Countries. <hi>Oviedus</hi> reports, that there is often ſeen a great flock of them about <hi>Panama</hi> in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> where they breed on the adjacent Rocks and Iſlandr. There are ſaid to be of them likewiſe on the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea. Of old time it ſeems they have frequented the Coaſt of <hi>Italy</hi> about <hi>Ravenna,</hi> for <hi>Martial</hi> hath it, <hi>Turpe Ravennatis guttur Onocrotali.

                        <hi>Upſilon-</hi>like bone is a very ſmall Tongue: The Ears of a mean ſize: The Eyes hazel-coloured. [In another bird they were yellow.] By a diligent ſearch we could find no Noſthrils, but in their ſtead a furrow or cranny extended on each ſide through the whole length of the Bill. If one view them attentively the edges of both Mandibles appear ſerrat, that it may more firmly hold the fiſh that it catcheth. It hath four fore-toes; for all its four toes are web'd together, and ſtand forward. The Legs are feathered down to the knees: The Feet and Legs, as far as they are bare, black: The Claw of the middle Toe is broad, and pectinated on the inſide as in <hi>Herons.</hi> The Plumage is like that of a <hi>Gooſe.</hi> The colour of the old ones that have moulted their Chicken-feathers is all over white, excepting the greater quil-feathers of the Wings, which are black, and

the top of the head, which with age grows yellow. The young ones are partico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured of white and dark brown or black, eſpecially on the upper part of the body. The number of quil-feathers in each Wing is about thirty two. The Tail is white, about ſeven inches long, conſiſting of twelve feathers. The skin is very full, ſticking looſe to the fleſh.</p>

Each Wing hath about thirty quil-feathers, the extreme tips whereof, as alſo of thoſe of the ſecond row, are a little aſh-coloured. The Tail is extended beyond the Feet, being an hand-breadth and an half long, when ſpread ending in a round circumference, being concave on the underſide, conſiſting of fourteen ſtiff hard feathers, not being in any part covered with feathers incumbent on it either above or beneath. The Bill is like that of the <hi>Shag,</hi> three inches and an half long, hooked at the end; the upper Mandible black with ſharp edges; the ſides of the lower Mandible compreſſed and broad. The Tongue ſmall, and almoſt none. The Eyes ſituate nearer the aperture of the Mouth than in moſt other birds, having cinereous circles round the Pupil. The Legs are ſtrong, thick, but very ſhort, broad, and flat, at leaſt in the young ones. The Feet and Claws black, covered with a skin not divided into perfect ſcales, but cancellated. It hath four Toes in each foot, all web'd together by a broad black membrane, and ſtanding forward, the outmoſt the longeſt, the reſt in order ſhorter, The Claw of the middle Toe is ſerrate on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.

                     </p>
                     <p>Its ſtomach is membranaceous, but its upper part thick and glandulous: Within were bones of fiſhes which it had devoured, and alſo one fiſh entire; that was a ſmall <hi>Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh;</hi> alſo many little, long, blackiſh worms of the figure of Earthworms.

When they carry them out of the rooms where they are kept to the fiſh-pools, they hood-wink them, that they be not frightned by the way. When they are come to the Rivers they take off their hoods, and having tied a leather thong round the lower part of their Necks that they may not ſwallow down the fiſh they catch, they throw them into the River. They preſently dive under water, and there for a long time with wonderful ſwiftneſs purſue the fiſh, and when they have caught them they ariſe preſently to the top of the water, and preſſing the fiſh lightly with their Bills they ſwallow them; till each Bird hath after this manner devoured five or ſix fiſhes. Then their Keepers call them to the fiſt, to which they readily fly, and little by little one

after another vomit up all their fiſh a little bruiſed with the nip they gave them with their Bills. When they have done fiſhing, ſetting the Birds on ſome high place they looſe the ſtring from their Necks, leaving the paſſage to the ſtomach free and open, and for their reward they throw them part of their prey they have caught, to each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance one or two fiſhes, which they by the way as they are falling in the air will catch moſt dextrouſly in their mouths.

                     <p>IT is bigger than a tame <hi>Duck,</hi> weighing almoſt four pounds. Its length from Bill-point to Tail end was two foot and an half.

It hath a wide gape. The Tongue is ſmall, and almoſt none. The Noſthrils were not conſpicuous, at leaſt I could not diſcover any that it had. The Eyes ſmall, ſituate lower and forwarder than is uſual in other birds. Its body is ſmall, flat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed like the <hi>dun Divers:</hi> The upper ſide of a black purpliſh colour, or black, with a dark tincture of green, ſhining like ſilk.

It hath a huge, long, membranous ſtomach, which in the birds we diſſected was full of ſmall fiſhes. It ſwims in the Sea with its Head erect, its body almoſt immerſed in the water.

A line of black is drawn on each ſide from the corner of the mouth to the back of the Head.

The Feet are black, the Legs white: All the four Toes web'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the Tail (if one may rely upon the ſtuft skin, or credit the relation of thoſe thoſe that ſent it) are only two very long feathers, of about eighteen inches, narrow, and ending in ſnarp points.

The whole breaſt, lower Belly, and upper Legs are covered with ſoft feathers of a ſilver colour: The beginning of the Back with brown ones, each whereof hath in its middle an oblong ſpot of a whitiſh yellow colour, ſo that it appears ſpeckled: The reſt of the Back hath a black Plumage. It hath long Wings, at the <note n="*" place="margin">Or their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance he may mean near the ridge.</note> ſetting on cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the like ſhort feathers as the beginning of the Back. Then follows a row of half grey, half black ones, that is, on one ſide the ſhaft gray, on the other black: But the prime feathers are black. The Tail conſiſts of black and ſhining fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe ends are grey. The Legs and Feet are of a colour from a dark yellow inclining to grey. It is very cunning in catching of fiſh. For after the manner of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, firſt drawing up its neck, it darts forth its Bill upon the fiſhes, and catches them with its Claws. I have eaten of its fleſh, but it is not much better than the fleſh of a <hi>Gull.</hi>

They are (ſaith he) of the bigneſs of a good corpulent hen, but have pretty long Necks and Legs. Their colour is dusky, or a dark aſh, and (if I be not miſtaken) they have ſome white under their Bellies, as wild <hi>Pigeons</hi> ſometimes have. [My Bird on the under-ſide was almoſt wholly white.] Its Bill is very hard, and hooked at the end like an <hi>Eagles,</hi> but not ſo much, of a bright red, if I well remember. [I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he did not well remember this, for the Bill in my Bird was of a pale yellow, all but the hook, which was black.] Its Eyes fair, of a fire-colour, not very great. For I did once ſee one, which being ſmitten with a rod on the Head opened its Eyes and cried out, but ſhut them preſently again, not being able to bear the light of the Sun. <hi>And again:</hi> Their colour is not ſimply white (as <hi>Pliny</hi> writes) but inclining to cinereous, as in <hi>Fulicae</hi> (he means a Bird of the <hi>Gull-</hi>kind) to which alſo he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them. Whether they have toothed Bills or not, I did not obſerve, but they have them ſtrong and pretty long. Thus far <hi>Geſner.</hi> Which notes (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus)</hi> do for the moſt part agree exactly to my Bird, which had it not a hooked Bill, one might not unfitly judge to be of the great <hi>Gull-kind:</hi> It doth ſo reſemble them in the whole body, but eſpecially in the Wings. The Feet are of the ſame colour with the Bill, as are the Legs alſo.</p>
                     <p>But this deſcription is not much to be confided in, being partly borrowed of <hi>Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> (who had it from the relation of a certain friend, who deſcribed it by memory) partly took from a Picture, or a dried caſe of the Bird ſent him out of the Iſland.

                     <p>MR. <hi>Willughby</hi> ſaw and deſcribed only a young one taken out of the Neſt, who makes it equal in bigneſs to a tame <hi>Pigeon.</hi> Thoſe which I ſaw dried in the Repoſitory of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and in <hi>Tradeſcants</hi> Cabinet, ſeemed to me ſomewhat bigger. Its colour on the Head, Neck, Back, and whole upper ſide is dusky or black, on the Breaſt and Belly white. The Bill is an inch and half, or it may be two inches long, narrow, black, and for its figure ſomething like to a <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wings</hi> Bill, the upper Chap being hooked at the end, like a <hi>Cormorants.</hi> Its baſe is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a naked skin, in which are the Noſthrils. From the Noſthrils on each ſide a furrow or groove is produced almoſt to the hook. The Head is blacker than the reſt of the Back: The Wings long: The Tail an hand-breadth long, and black. The Feet underneath black; above, the outer half of each foot is black, the inner of a pale or whitiſh fleſh-colour, ſo that the middle toe is partly white, partly black. It hath a ſmall back-toe, and black Claws.</p>
                     <p>For its extraordinary fatneſs its fleſh is eſteemed unwholſom meat, unleſs it be well ſeaſoned with ſalt.</p>
                     <p>At the South end of the Iſle of <hi>Man</hi> lies a little Iſlet, divided from <hi>Man</hi> by a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row channel, called the <hi>Calf of Man,</hi> on which are no habitations, but only a Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or two lately built. This Iſlet is full of Conies, which the <hi>Puffins</hi> coming year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſlodge, and build in their Burroughs. They lay each but one Egg before they ſit, like the <hi>Razor-bill</hi> and <hi>Guillem;</hi> although it be the common perſwaſion that they lay two at a time, of which the one is always addle. They feed their young ones wondrous fat. The old ones early in the morning, at break of day, leave their Neſts and Young, and the Iſland it ſelf, and ſpend the whole day in fiſhing in the Sea, never returning or once ſetting foot on the Iſland before Evening twilight: So that all day the Iſland is ſo quiet and ſtill from all noiſe as if there were not a bird about it. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fiſh or other food they have gotten and ſwallowed in the day-time, by the innate heat or proper ferment of the ſtomach is (as they ſay) changed into a certain oyly ſubſtance [or rather chyle] a good part whereof in the night-time they vomit up into the mouths of their Young, which being therewith nouriſhed grow extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fat. When they are come to their full growth, they who are intruſted by the <note n="*" place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Darby.</hi>
                        </note> Lord of the Iſland draw them out of the Cony-holes, and that they may the more readily know and keep account of the number they take, they cut off one foot and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:63869:174"/>
reſerve it; which gave occaſion to that Fable, that the Puffins are ſingle-footed. They uſually ſell them for about nine pence the dozen, a very cheap rate. <note n="*" place="margin">The ſame is reported of the French <hi>Macreuſe,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch ance the ſame bird with the <hi>Puffin.</hi>

                     <p>ITs weight was almoſt four pounds: Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail or Claws (for they were equally extended) twenty eight inches: Its breadth, the Wings being ſpread, forty. It is long-bodied: Its Back broad and flat. The Head and upper part of the Neck is of a very deep ſhining green, almoſt black: The lower half of the Neck is of a gloſſie white. Yet the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſide of the bottom of the Neck, the middle of the Back, and the interiour ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular feathers are black [the exteriour are white.] The lower part of the Back is of a pale aſh-colour. On both ſides near the Rump, and on the very Rump and Thighs the feathers are variegated with tranſverſe <note n="*" place="margin">Or grey, for they are made up as it were of innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble little black points or ſpecks.</note> dusky lines. The Tail is made up of eighteen feathers, wholly cinereous. Each Wing hath about twenty ſix prime feathers, the ten outmoſt black; the four next alſo black, but tipt with white: The five ſucceeding white, with their bottoms black: The remaining ſix or ſeven next the body white, with their exteriour edges black. In the ſecond row of the Wing thoſe incumbent on the white quil-feathers are white from their tips to the middle, beneath black. Thence as far as the baſtard Wing all are white: But between thoſe white ones and the long ſcapular feathers ſome black ones intervene. Whence if you take the long ſcapular feathers, which cover the Back, for part of the Wing, the Wings will be (as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> deſcribes them) black toward the back, next white, with a certain paleneſs; then black again, but more remiſsly; after that again white, the extreme feathers at laſt being black. The whole under-ſide of the body (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Wings, which are white underneath) of a faint yellow or <hi>Iſabella</hi> colour. The exteriour feathers of the Thighs are elegantly varied with tranſverſe waved lines of a whitiſh and blackiſh colour, alternately placed.</p>
                     <p>The Bill meaſured from the tip to the corners of the mouth exceeds the length of a mans middle ſinger: The lower Mandible black; the upper along its middle or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part black, on the ſides red; the tip being black and hooked, both upper and lower toothed on both ſides like a Saw, the teeth inclining inward. The Tongue and Palate are yellow.</p>
                     <p>It hath not a Creſt properly ſo called on the Head, but the feathers are more looſe, and ſtand more ſtaring upwards than ordinary, whence alſo the Head ſeems to be big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than indeed it is. The Ears are round; the Noſthrils large, the <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes of a ſanguine colour. The Legs and Feet are of an elegant red-lead colour. The back-toe broad, with an appendant membrane. It hath a huge bony labyrinth on the wind-pipe juſt above the divarications and beſides, the windpipe hath two ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings out one above another, each reſembling a powder-puff.</p>

                     <p>THis Bird is very common at <hi>Venice.</hi> In bigneſs it comes near to the common <hi>Duck.</hi> All its Head and the upper part of its Neck are of a dark fulvous co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but the crown of the head darker or blackiſh. It hath a pretty long creſt or tuft on its head hanging down backward. The Back is dusky, or of a very dark cinereous. The Throat for an inch and halfs ſpace is white, below griſled of black, white and red. The whole Belly white. The Bill from the tip to the angles of the mouth three inches, ſlender, and of a round figure: The lower Mandible wholly red, hath in the end an aſh-coloured oval ſpot, the upper is of a dark brown above with ſome mixture of green, red on the edges, hooked at the end, and marked with a whitiſh oval ſpot: Both toothed on both ſides along the edges with teeth like thoſe of a Saw inclining inwards. The Eyes of a ſanguine colour. The Wings are very ſhort and little for the bigneſs of the bird, having each about twenty five or twenty ſix feathers in the firſt row. Of theſe the outmoſt ten are black, the eleventh hath the tip white, and the three next in order ſtill more, the following ſix have their upper halves white: The reſt are indeed white, but have their edges black, ſome on one ſide only, ſome on both. Of the ſecond row thoſe that cover the white ones of the firſt are themſelves white half way. Above toward the baſe of the Wing is a great white ſpot, beginning from the baſtard Wing. The coverts of the underſide of the Wing, and the interiour baſtard wing are white; but thoſe under the outmoſt quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers are dusky. The Tail is ſhort, conſiſting of eighteen feathers. The Legs ſhort: The Feet red, or of a deep Saffron colour. The Wind-pipe at the divarication hath ſuch a veſſel as the precedent, and beſides above ſwells out into a puff-like cavity. In the ſtomach we found a <hi>Mullet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Bird is not much more than half ſo big as the precedent: It differs alſo in its colour, its creſt, the white ſpot below the baſtard Wing, and other accidents. We ſuſpect the Bird deſcribed was a Female, and that its Male repreſents the <hi>Gooſander,</hi> though we have not as yet hapned to ſee it; unleſs perchance it be that whoſe skin ſtuft we ſaw in Sir <hi>William Foſters</hi> Hall at <hi>Bambergh</hi> in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> which had on each Wing a white ſpot, and two ſmall tranſverſe black ſtrakes. We cannot but wonder (if the Male of this Bird be ſuch a one as the <hi>Gooſander)</hi> that among ſo many Females at <hi>Venice</hi> we ſhould not ſee one Male. Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> ſaw and deſcribed at <hi>Venice</hi> another Bird of this kind, perchance ſpecifically different from this, under the name of <hi>Cokall;</hi> for 1. It was leſs: 2. It had no Labyrinth. This makes us doubt again concerning the Sexes of theſe birds; for in others of the <hi>Duck-kind</hi> the Females have no labyrinth; whereas in the <hi>dun Diver,</hi> which we take to be the female of the <hi>Gooſander</hi> we found a large labyrinth; and yet in this leſſer Diver, called <hi>Cokall,</hi> it ſeems there was none; ſo that we will not be very conſident that the <hi>Gooſander</hi> and <hi>Dun Diver</hi> differ no more than in Sex. This Bird <hi>Leon. Baltner</hi> calls <hi>Klein Merch, i. e.</hi> a <hi>little Diver.</hi>

The Tail black: The Wings and whole back diſtinguiſhed with ſeveral black and white ſpaces alternately. Some call this Bird a <hi>White Nun.</hi>

                     <p>I ſuſpect that this Bird was no other than our <hi>Albellus,</hi> next to be deſcribed: Only the bigneſs and want of a creſt forbid it. Perchance <hi>Geſner</hi> might deſcribe it from the relation of others, or from a Picture. I am ſure <hi>Leonard Baltner,</hi> a Fiſherman and Fowler of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> who did very diligently obſerve, gather together, and cauſe to be painted all the birds frequenting the <hi>Rhene</hi> thereabouts, gives us no other bird of this kind but the <hi>Albellus,</hi> to which alſo he gives the title of <hi>White Nun.</hi>

                     <p>IN bigneſs it comes near to a <hi>Wigeon;</hi> weighing about twenty four ounces. From the point of the Bill to the end of the Tail, or of the Feet it was by meaſure eighteen inches and an half long: between the tips of the Wings extended twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeven inches broad. The Bill an inch and half, or near two inches long.</p>
                     <p>Its Head and Neck were white, excepting a black ſpot under the Creſt (which it hath hanging down backward from behind its Head) encompaſſing the Creſt, and ending in an acute angle below, and another on each ſide extending from the angles of the mouth to the Eyes. The Breaſt, Belly, and whole under-ſide is purely white. As for the upper ſide, all the Back is black. The long ſcapular feathers incumbent on the back are white. At the ſetting on of the Wing on each ſide there is a crooked line of black, half encircling the Neck juſt above the ſhoulders, and higher up the Neck, where the black we mentioned in the middle of the Neck begins, there is another ſuch like arcuate line on each ſide, reſembling half a collar.</p>
                     <p>The ten outmoſt quil-feathers of the Wings are wholly black; the tips of the next ten are white, of the hindmoſt in order more than the foremoſt. Then follow two half white, <hi>viz.</hi> on the outſide the ſhaft, the other half being black: The reſt of the feathers are cinereous: The number of all twenty ſeven. The feathers of the ſecond row growing on the middle of the Wing are black, only their utmoſt tips being white. Above, a broad and long ſpot or bed of white beginning from the baſtard wing reacheth to the twentieth quil-feather. The interiour baſtard wing is white. The ſide-feathers under the Wings variegated with tranſverſe waved black lines are very pleaſant to behold. The Tail is dusky, or between aſh-coloured and black, compoſed of ſixteen feathers, a quarter of a yard, or three inches and an half long, the middle feathers being the longeſt, the reſt on each ſide gradually ſhorter to the outmoſt.</p>
                     <p>The Bill is of a cinereous or lead colour, [but at the tip of each Mandible is a ſpot of ſorbid white] thicker at the Head, growing ſlenderer by degrees toward the point, narrower, and leſs than in the <hi>Duck-</hi>kind. The upper Mandible hooked at the end, toothed on the ſides: The Noſthrils oblong, open, at a good diſtance from the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: The Eves of a dark colour. The Legs and Feet of a cinereous or lead colour, the Toes being joyned by a dusky membrane. The foremoſt Toe and the back-Toe
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:63869:176"/>
have lateral appendant membranes, reaching their whole length.</p>
                     <p>The Wind-pipe at the divarication ends in a certain great, ſtrong, bony veſſel, which we are wont to call a Labyrinth; whence proceed the two branches tending to the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>This Bird hath not two blind guts, after the manner of other Birds, but only one ſhort blunt one, [yet in one bird of this kind we found two.] The Wind-pipe is faſtned to the upper angle of the Merry-thought by a tranſverſe ligament, and then aſcends upward to the Labyrinth. It feeds upon fiſhes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Albellus aquaticus</hi> of <hi>Aldrovand,</hi> as it ſeems to me, differs not from this bird, for both the figure, and all the marks he gives of it, agree; only he makes no mention of the creſt, perchance it was a young bird he deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>There is in this kind alſo ſo much difference between the Sexes, that the Writers of the Hiſtory of Birds have taken the Male and Female for different ſorts. The Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male is deſcribed by <hi>Geſner</hi> under the title of <hi>Mergus glacialis,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> Engliſheth the <hi>Lough-diver.</hi> It was ſent us by Mr. <hi>Dent</hi> from <hi>Cambridge</hi> by the name of a <hi>Smew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Female the whole Head and the Cheeks are red or fulvous: The Throat white. On the beginning of the Breaſt above the Craw there is ſeen as it were a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of a darker or brown colour: It hath no Creſt. All the upper ſide except the Wings is of a dusky aſh-colour or brown. About the middle of each Wing are two tranſverſe white lines. In other particulars it agrees well enough with the Male.</p>
                     <p>It hath a great Gall; oblong Teſticles: The Guts have many revolutions. The Stomach larger than in granivorous birds, leſs muſculous, filled with fiſhes, in the birds we opened.</p>

But theſe are idle ſtories and lies, proceeding from the credulity of theſe people.

From the make and conformation of its parts it moves with more eaſe and expedition under water, than either upon the ſurface of the water, or upon the Land. So ſoon as it is riſen above water it holds up its Head, looks about it, and with wonderful celerity plunges it ſelf under water again.

The Bill from the tip to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of the mouth was almoſt three inches long: The Tail two: The ſecond bone of the Leg four and a quarter; the third two and an half; the outmoſt fore-toe three inches and an half. The Tongue long, ſharp, having a tranſverſe bed of aſperities not far from the bottom, beneath which it is toothed on each ſide, as this figure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents. <figure/> In the Palate, on each ſide the fiſſure, are five rows of prickles or aſperities. The blind guts were three inches and an half long. Hence it manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, that the bird deſcribed by <hi>Cluſius</hi> was bigger than ours. But perchance <hi>Cluſius</hi> his was a Cock, ours a Hen. For thoſe I ſaw at Dr. <hi>Hewleys</hi> and Mr. <hi>Darleys</hi> were nothing at all leſs than that of <hi>Cluſius,</hi> ſent him by <hi>Hoierus.</hi> But what <hi>Hoier</hi> writes of them, that they cannot fly at all, is a miſtake; for though they never breed in <hi>England,</hi> yet in hard Winters they come over hither. I ſcarce believe they ſwim ſo far. Whence it is manifeſt, that they not only flie, but make great flights.</p>

                        <p>IN the Lake of <hi>Conſtance</hi> I hear there is taken, though but ſeldom, a certain bird congenerous to the aforeſaid, but bigger than a <hi>Gooſe,</hi> called <hi>Fluder,</hi> from its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth fluttering motion on the ſurface of the water, for that it can neither fly well, nor walk conveniently, unleſs it leans both upon Feet and Wings, as do alſo the other <hi>Douckers,</hi> by reaſon of the poſition of the Legs ſo turned backwards: That it hath a long, ſharp Bill: A loud, ſhrill cry, of a ſingular kind: That it dives exceeding deep, ſo that it is ſometimes taken twenty yards deep under water, <hi>viz.</hi> with a Net, or an Iron-hook baited with a fiſh: that they are commonly ſold for two drachms and an half of ſilver a piece.</p>

                           <hi>Leonard Baltner,</hi> a Fiſherman of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> deſcribes this bird thus. In bigneſs it equals a <hi>Gooſe:</hi> Its length from the point of the Bill to the end of the Toes is one <hi>Strasburgh</hi> yard and an half. Its Bill from the point to the Eyes is five inches long: The Legs from the Claws to the feathers (that is the bare part) ten inches: The ſpace of the Wings extended two yards and a quarter. The Stomach ſmall: It feeds upon fiſh: The Bill ſharp: The Feet broad, the toes web'd together. The upper ſide of the body is cinereous and black, the under-ſide white. The Tail three inches long. It dives very far, a Piſtol-ſhot before it riſes again. Its fleſh is commended for good meat, and is of no unpleaſant taſte.</p>

                        <p>IT is common among the <hi>Norwegians</hi> and <hi>Iſlanders,</hi> who in their own Country Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage call it <note n="*" place="margin">I ſuppoſe our Engliſh name <hi>Loon</hi> is borrowed of them.</note> 
                           <hi>Lumme. Carolus Cluſius</hi> mentions it in his <hi>Auctarium,</hi> pag. 367. It is an elegant bird, of the bigneſs of a <hi>Duck,</hi> with a black, ſharp Bill, two inches long. Its Head and Neck are covered with grey [cinereous] feathers, ending in a ſharp point, as if it had a Monks hood on its Back. Its Back and Wings are black, ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led over with ſquare ſpots of white, which yet are bigger on the Back than the Wings. Under the Neck is a ſquare oblong black ſpot like to a ſhield, five inches long, and two broad, compaſſed on all ſides with feathers variegated of black and white as with a <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Zona,</hi> a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or fringe,</note> Girdle. The whole Belly and lower parts of the Wings are white. The Legs are ſtretcht forth beſide the Tail [as if they grew out of the Vent] fitted not ſo much for walking as for ſwimming, not ſlender, but flat and broad. Each foot hath three Toes, that are black, and joyned together with black membranes, armed with ſharp and crooked Claws. The Thighs are alſo hid in the Belly. It is of the <hi>Mergi</hi> [Diver] or rather <hi>Colymbi</hi> [Doucker] kind. In diving it can hold its breath a long time, and no bird can plunge under water more nimbly and ſpeedily than it, as they experience who ſhoot them. For ſo ſoon as the powder flaſhes, it preſently ducks under water, before the bullet can come at it. It builds its Neſt ſo near the water, that it can, if need be, ſpeedily caſt it ſelf into it: But when it betakes it ſelf again to its Neſt, faſtning its Bill into the earth, it hangs its whole weight upon it, till it raiſes up its body, and ſo by degrees reaches its Neſt. It perceives before by a peculiar natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtinct when there are about to fall great ſhowers and ſhots of rain, and fearing leſt the flouds ſhould deſtroy its Neſt and Young, its makes a querulous noiſe and cry: On the contrary, when it preſages fair weather, it expreſſes its joy by chearful acclamations, and another more pleaſant note. It lays yearly three or four Eggs as big as <hi>Geeſe</hi> Eggs, of a <note n="*" place="margin">

They ſay, that at ſet times of the year they depart into hotter Regions, and return not until the Spring be well come on. Whence they think it ominous for any one to hear the cry of this bird firſt faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The <hi>Norwegians</hi> think it <note n="*" place="margin">Nefuc.</note> a ſin to kill or diſturb this Bird, which they account holy. They ſometimes catch it in their Neſts againſt their wills, and ſometimes ſhoot it with Guns. The <hi>Iſlanders</hi> becauſe they eat it, take it either with a ſnare, or with an angle-line. They faſten two ſtakes at the entrance of the Neſt, upon which they hang, and ſo accommodate the Snare, that the Bird going to her Neſt may thruſt her head into it. Or they croſs the Pool where ſhe frequents at its narroweſt part with a fiſhing line, ſo that one on each ſide holds it, raking therewith the ſurface of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till the bird fearing ſome danger towards dives down to the bottom; then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the place where ſhe is riſing up again by the circles there made in the water, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they direct and there hold a ſnare faſtned to the line, that coming up out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe may put her head into it, and ſo be caught by the Neck.</p>

                        <p>THis Bird, the biggeſt by much of all the <hi>Gulls</hi> we have hitherto ſeen, weighed four pounds and twelve ounces. Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail was twenty ſix inches: Its breadth from tip to tip of the Wings diſtended ſixty ſeven. Its Bill was yellow, compreſſed ſideways, more than three inches long, ſomething hooked at the end, and like in figure to thoſe of the reſt of this kind. The lower Mandible underneath bunched out into a knob, marked on each ſide with a double ſpot, the lower red, the upper black. The edges of the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids round about were of a Saffron colour. The Head great, flat-crowned. Both Head, Neck, Breaſt, Belly, and Tail white. The middle of the Back and the Wings, excepting the tips of the quil-feathers, were black. Each Wing had about thirty four feathers in the firſt row, all black, with white tips. Its Tail was ſix inches long, made up of twelve ſnow-white feathers: Its Legs and Feet white: Its Claws black. It had a ſmall back-toe; a wide Mouth, a long Tongue, a large Gullet. It preys up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fiſhes: For out of its ſtomach diſſected we took a <hi>Plaiſe</hi> entire. It had a great Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver divided into two Lobes, with a Gall adhering: Short and ſmall blind guts: A muſculous Stomach, and an oblong Spleen.</p>
                        <p>In another bird of this kind, (which was I ſuppoſe a young one) both the top of the Head and the Neck were particoloured of black and white: The Back and Wings paler than in that deſcribed. I ſuppoſe that this is the very ſame bird which <hi>Cluſius</hi> deſcribes in the fifth Book of his <hi>Exotics,</hi> Chap. 9. under the title of a <note n="*" place="margin">Larus ingens marinus.</note> 
                           <hi>huge Sea-gull,</hi> though his deſcription be not ſo full and exact, as being taken only from a Picture.</p>
                        <p>This Bird we ſaw and deſcribed at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> being not rarely found on the Sea-coaſts near that City. In the <hi>Feroe Iſlands</hi> it is called, The <hi>Swarth-back.</hi>

                        <p>IT is well nigh as big as a tame <hi>Duck:</hi> From tip of Bill to the end of the Toes twenty four or twenty five inches long, to the end of the Tail twenty two or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three: Between the terms of the Wings ſtretched out fifty, and in ſome fifty five inches broad. The weight was different in ſeveral birds, one weighing only twenty ſix ounces, another thirty, another thirty four. The Bill was yellow, two inches long, narrow, as in the reſt of this kind, but pretty deep: The lower Mandible not ſtreight, as in other birds, but the upper edges convex or arcuate; underneath it bunches out into an angle or knob, on the ſides of which is a large ſpot of red. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes were of a lovely yellow. The edges of the Eye-lids in ſome yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in ſome, (perchance theſe were Cocks) of a red-lead colour. The Legs in ſome yellow, bare of feathers for ſome ſpace above the knees, in others white, or of a pale fleſh-colour: The hind-toe ſmall: The Claws black: The inner edge of the middle Claw ſharp. Its Head, Neck, Rump, Tail, and whole under-ſide white: Its Back, the covert-feathers of its Wings, and the quil-feathers alſo, except the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt five, of a dark aſh-colour. The two outmoſt quils were marked with a white ſpot near the tip, the outmoſt with a greater, the inner with a leſſer, but the very tips of both were black. The tips of the fifth and ſixth were dusky. All the reſt had white tips. [Theſe colours in ſeveral Birds vary ſomething: Yet in general the quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers in all Birds of this ſort are particoloured of white, black and cinereous.] The Tail was about five inches long, not forked, made up of twelve feathers of equal length. The Wings when gathered up reached beyond the end of the Tail, and croſſed one another. It had a large Craw, a muſculous Stomach, in which were fiſh-bones. They ſay that is preys upon <hi>Herrings,</hi> whence it took the name <hi>Herring-gull.</hi> It lays Eggs as big as Hens Eggs, ſharp at one end, whitiſh, but ſpotted with a few black ſpots.</p>
                        <p>In the young ones the Back and Head are aſh-coloured, with black ſpots, the Bill black, but white at the tip.</p>
                        <p>This ſort, though it be very common with us, yet hath it not hitherto, that I know of, been deſcribed.</p>

                        <p>THat which I deſcribed was a Hen-bird. It weighed a full pound of ſixteen ounces: It was from the beginning of the Bill to the end of the Toes fifteen inches and an half long, to the end of the Tail ſixteen and an half. The tips of the Wings extended were forty one inches diſtant from each other. It is ſomething leſs than the greater <hi>Gull</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Aldrovand;</hi> like to the <hi>Herring-Gull,</hi> but much leſs. Its Bill was like to thoſe of the reſt of this kind, narrow, but deep, ſharp-pointed, of a whitiſh colour, but yellow toward the tip. The knob under the lower Chap ſmall, and ſcarce conſpicuous, the upper Chap ſomething hooked or bending at the point. The Tongue cloven: The Noſthrils oblong. The Eyes were great, and furniſhed with membranes for nictation; the <hi>Irides</hi> of a pale hazel-colour: The Ears of a mean ſize: The Feet of a pale green: The Claws black; that of the middle Toe ſharp on the inner ſide: The back-toe very ſmall, yet armed with a Claw. The membranes connecting the Toes reached as far as the Claws. The Head and upper part of the Neck were clouded with brown ſpots, the nether part white: The Back aſh-coloured, but the feathers covering the Tail white. The Throat and whole un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ſide of the body was as white as ſnow: The Tail alſo purely white. The Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and upper covert-feathers of the Wings aſh-coloured, the coverts of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide white.</p>
                        <p>In each Wing were about thirty quil-feathers; the firſt of which at the tip in the inner Web had a black ſpot, and on the outer edge a black line, ſcarce appearing, then followed a white bar about two inches broad, the reſt of the feathers to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom being black. The tip of the ſecond was white: Under the white a croſs bar of black, half an inch broad, beneath that a white bar of an inch breadth, the reſt of the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:63869:180"/>
feather to the bottom being black, but the very bottom aſh-coloured. The tip alſo of the third was white; from the tip the upper half of the feather was black, the lower aſh-coloured. The three next had alſo white tips, but the black part was ſtill ſhorter and ſhorter, or narrower and narrower in the following than the foregoing feathers, till in the ſixth it became ſcarce a quarter of an inch broad. All the reſt of the quils were aſh-coloured, with white tips. The Tail was ſix inches long, not forked, made up of twelve feathers.</p>
                        <p>The Liver was large, divided into two Lobes: The Gall yellow: The <note n="*" place="margin">Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread.</note> 
                           <hi>Pancreas</hi> great: The muſcles of the Gizzard not ſo thick and ſtrong as in granivorous birds; within which we found graſs and Beetles. It is a gregarious bird, frequenting Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and the banks of Lakes. That which we deſcribed we ſhot on the bank of the Lake of <hi>Bala</hi> in <hi>Merioneth-ſhire</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> commonly called <hi>Pimble-mear,</hi> through which the River <hi>Dee,</hi> on which <hi>Cheſter</hi> is built, runs, and they ſay mixes not its waters with thoſe of the Lake.</p>
                        <p>It differs from the <hi>Herring-gull,</hi> 1. In that it is leſs. 2. In the colour of the Bill: From <hi>Bellonius</hi> his aſh-coloured <hi>Gull,</hi> 1. In that it is bigger: 2. That it hath a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe armed with a Claw.</p>

The four outmoſt quil-feathers were above half way black: The two next to theſe had only black tips, being elſe white.

                        <p>IT is about the bigneſs of a tame <hi>Pigeon.</hi> That which we deſcribed weighed about ten ounces: Its length from tip of Bill to end of Tail was fifteen inches: Its breadth thirty ſeven. Its Bill was of a ſanguine colour, bending ſomething downwards, from the point to the angles of the Mouth two inches long. The Palate was of a red-lead colour: The Eyes hazel-coloured, The edges of the Eye-lids red: Both upper and lower Eye-lids towards the hind-part of the Head were compaſſed with white fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Head and Throat were black, but dilute. The middle of the Back aſh-coloured: The Neck, Tail, Breaſt, and Belly white: The number of quil-feathers in each Wing twenty nine: The tip and extreme edges of the firſt were white, the reſt of the feather black; the following feathers to the tenth had black tips, yet with ſome diverſity in ſeveral birds; elſe the whole Wings were aſh-coloured. The Tail all ſnow-white, of about five inches length, not forked, conſiſting of twelve feathers. The Wings gathered up reach beyond the end of the Tail. The Legs were of a dark ſanguine colour: The back-toe ſmall: The Claws little, and black. The Males differ little from the Females in colour or outward appearance. Near <hi>Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end</hi> a huge number of theſe birds frequent the River <hi>Thames.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We ſaw and deſcribed at <hi>Cheſter</hi> a Bird of this kind, which there they called the <hi>Sea-Crow,</hi> which differed from the precedent in ſome accidents of leſs moment, <hi>viz.</hi> The crown or top of its Head only was black, not its Throat. Each Wing had twenty eight quil-feathers, the outmoſt of which had its tip and exteriour edge black; the three next in order had their outer Webs white, their tips and interiour edges black; the three ſucceeding had only their tips black. [The third, fourth, and fifth, and in ſome alſo the ſecond feathers have a ſpot of white on their tips.] Of this kind alſo are thoſe birds which yearly build and breed at <hi>Norbury</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> in an Iſland in the middle of a great Pool, in the Grounds of Mr. <hi>Skrimſhew,</hi> diſtant at leaſt thirty miles from the Sea. About the beginning of <hi>March</hi> hither they come; about the end of <hi>April</hi> they build. They lay three, four, or five Eggs, of a dirty green colour, ſpotted with dark brown, two inches long, of an ounce and half weight, blunter at one end. The firſt Down of the Young is aſh-coloured, and ſpotted with black: The firſt feathers on the Back after they are fledg'd are black. When the Young are almoſt come to their full growth, thoſe entruſted by the Lord of the ſoil drive them from off the Iſland through the Pool into Nets ſet on the banks to take them. When they have taken them they feed them with the entrails of beaſts, and when they are fat ſell them for four pence or five pence apiece. They take yearly about a thouſand two hundred young ones: Whence may be computed what profit the Lord makes of them. About the end of <hi>July</hi> they all fly away and leave the Iſland.</p>
                        <p>Some ſay, that the crowns of thoſe Birds are black only in Spring and Summer. A certain friend of mine (ſaith <hi>Aldrovand)</hi> did ſometime write to me from <hi>Comachio,</hi> that the feathers on their Heads grow black in <hi>March,</hi> and that that blackneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues for three months, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo long as they are breeding and rearing their Young, and that the other nine months of the year they are white. Which thing if it be true (for to me indeed it ſeems not probable) no wonder that of one and the ſame <hi>Species</hi> of Bird deſcribed at ſeveral times of the year there ſhould be three or four made. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandus</hi> writes, that the deſcription of <hi>Geſner</hi> agrees in other things to his aſh-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured <hi>Gull,</hi> diſagreeing only in the colour of its Bill and Feet. But perhaps (ſaith he) the colour of the Bill and Feet may vary in birds of the ſame ſpecies, which I will not eaſily grant, unleſs they differ in Age or Sex.</p>

                        <p>THe skin of this ſtuft was ſent us by our learned and worthy friend Dr. <hi>Walter Needham,</hi> who found it hung up in a certain Gentlemans Hall. The Bird it ſelf living, or newly kill'd we have not as yet ſeen at hand. It is of the biggeſt of this kind, equal to, or bigger than a tame <hi>Duck.</hi> Its Bill is ſtronger, bigger, and ſhorter than in other great <hi>Gulls,</hi> black, hooked at the end, and ſeemed to be covered with a skin from the baſe to the Noſthrils, as in Land-birds of prey. Its Legs and Feet were black: Its Toes armed with ſtrong, crooked Claws, ſuch as we never before obſerved in any whole-footed Fowl. The colour of the Back is a ruſty cinereous or brown, like that of a <hi>Buzzards:</hi> Its Belly and underſide paler. The greater quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers of the Wings are black: The Tail alſo is black, about ſeven inches long, made up of twelve feathers, of which the two middlemoſt are ſomewhat longer than the reſt. The bottoms of the feathers as well of the Tail as Wing-quils are white. The length of the Bill from the tip to the angles of the Mouth was no more than two inches and an half. The angular prominence on the lower Chap is ſmall and ſcarce conſpicuous.</p>
                        <p>Hapning to read over the deſcription of <hi>Hoiers Skua</hi> in the <hi>Auctarium</hi> of <hi>Cluſius</hi> his Exotics, pag. 367. I find it exactly to agree with ours, ſo that I do not at all doubt but this Bird is the <hi>Skua</hi> of <hi>Hoier. Cluſius</hi> his deſcription being more full than ours I ſhall here ſubjoyn.</p>
                        <p>The Bird ſent me by <hi>Hoier</hi> was (ſaith he) of the bigneſs of a great <hi>Gull,</hi> from the bottom of the Neck to the Rump nine inches long. The compaſs of its body, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring under its Wings, was ſixteen inches. The Neck from the crown of the Head to the Back was ſeven inches long. The Head not very great, nor the Bill flat, but rather long and narrow, on the part next the Head rugged and rough, towards the point ſmooth, black, and crooked, almoſt like thoſe of rapacious birds or <hi>Gulls,</hi> not exceeding the length of two inches. The Wings were almoſt ſeventeen inches long, reaching ſomething further than the end of the Tail. The four greater quil-feathers of the Wings were black, not white at the tip, as <hi>Hoier</hi> wrote, unleſs perchance he had obſerved that mark in other birds of this kind. From the quill or naked part I found them to be white half way up the feather, as were alſo the three greater and uppermoſt Tail-feathers below where they were inſerted into the Rump, the upper
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:63869:181"/>
part being black as in the quil-feathers. As for the reſt of the feathers inveſting the body they were of a colour between black and cinereous, but the black predominant, and did nearly reſemble the feathers of a bald <hi>Buzzard</hi> or <hi>Kite.</hi> The Legs were placed backward, in the hindmoſt part of the body, at in moſt Water-fowl, above the Knee they were very ſhort, below the Knee down to the Foot almoſt three inches long. The Feet were flat, having three Toes and a ſhort Heel. The outmoſt Toe (next in length to the middlemoſt) conſiſted of four joynts; the middle (which was the longeſt) of three; the inmoſt (which was the ſhorteſt) of two; and the heel or back-toe of one. All ending in ſharp, crooked Claws, and joyned together by a black membrane or cartilage to the very Claws.</p>
                        <p>The characteriſtic notes of this ſpecies are, 1. The thickneſs and its Bill. 2. The uniform black colour of its Tail [as far as it appears beyond the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent feathers.] 3. The bigneſs and crookedneſs of its Talons.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hoier</hi> writes, that it preys not only upon fiſh, but on all kinds of ſmall birds.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Corniſh Gannet</hi> (as they told us) doth conſtantly accompany the ſholes of <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards,</hi> ſtill hovering over them in the Air. It purſues and ſtrikes at theſe fiſh with that violence that they catcht it with a ſtrange artifice. They faſten a Pilchard to a board, which they fix a little under water. The <hi>Gannet</hi> eſpying the <hi>Pilchard,</hi> caſts himſelf down from on high upon it with that vehemence, that he ſtrikes his Bill clear through the board, and daſhes out his brains againſt it, and ſo comes to be taken. We ſaw many of theſe <hi>Gannets</hi> flying, but could not kill one. They ſeem to be very ſtrong birds, long-winged, and fly ſwiftly.</p>

                        <p>IT comes near to the bird laſt deſcribed. It (ſaith he) exactly reſembles a <hi>Goſhawk.</hi> [to which our Bird alſo anſwers very well, both in bigneſs and figure, and in the colour of the upper ſide of the body,] ſo that you can ſcarce diſtinguiſh them; for on the upper ſide, like that, it is variegated with brown, white and yellow mingled; on the under ſide it is all white, ſpotted with brown, as the Picture ſhews. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo writes, that it is leſs than a <hi>Hawk,</hi> and that it hath a large and broad Throat or Gullet; which laſt note agrees exactly to my bird, though indeed other <hi>Gulls</hi> alſo have a wide throat as well as this. But I think <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> likened it to a <hi>Hawk,</hi> not only for its bigneſs, but becauſe it was alike ſpotted, and eſpecially becauſe it preys after the manner of a <hi>Hawk;</hi> and for that purpoſe is endued with a Bill for the bigneſs of its body very great and ſtrong, ſharp-pointed alſo, and the upper Chap more than ordinarily hooked. It is an inch thick, and of a deep black. The Neck alſo is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty long: The Head leſſer than in <hi>Gulls.</hi> The Wings in length are even with the Tail. The Tail is a Palm long, and black: The Hips covered with feathers to the Knees, which in other <hi>Gulls</hi> are not ſo, but bare a little higher. Its Legs, Feet, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening membranes cinereous: The Claws black, crooked, and ſmall.</p>
                        <p>It differs from our <hi>Catarracta</hi> chiefly, 1. In the colour of the underſide of the body: 2. In the colour of the Feet: 3. In the ſmalneſs of the Claws. But theſe things not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, perchance it may be the ſame. For <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> (as I gather from his words) took his deſcription from a Picture. But Painters are not wont to be very exact either in expreſſing of the colours, or delineating the parts.</p>
                        <p>This deſcription alſo doth in many things agree to that <hi>Gull</hi> which we ſhall next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe under the title of the <hi>Corniſh Wagel.</hi>

                        <p>The Bill is almoſt three inches long, all black, the upper Chap bending a little downward, and as it were hooked: The lower between the angle and the tip under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath bunches out into a knob. The Noſthrils oblong: The Eyes grey: The Neck ſhort: The Head great, which in walking or ſtanding ſtill it always draws down to its ſhoulders, as do alſo other <hi>Gulls,</hi> ſo that one would think they had no necks, of a whitiſh grey colour.

                        <p>The <hi>Corniſh</hi> men related to us for a certain truth, that this Bird is wont to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and terrifie the <hi>Sea-Swallows,</hi> and other ſmall <hi>Gulls</hi> ſo long, till they mute for fear; and then catches their excrements before they fall into the water, and greedily devours them as a great dainty: This ſome of them affirmed themſelves to have ſeen.</p>

                        <p>THe weight of this Bird was near five ounces: Its length from Bill to Tail ſix teen inches: its breadth from Wings end to Wings end thirty two inches.</p>
                        <p>It is a ſmall bird, ſlender, and long-bodied: Hath a forked Tail, whence it got the name of a <hi>Swallow:</hi> A black crown, the black being terminated by a line drawn from the Noſthrils through the Eyes to the Neck, ſo that above the Eyes the Head is black, under the Eyes white. The Cheeks, Chin, lower Belly, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Wings are all white: The Breaſt hath ſomething of cinereous ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The Rump is white: The Back and upper ſide of the Wings are of a dark aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour. Each Wing hath twenty nine quils; the outmoſt ten whereof have their outer Webs running out into ſharp points, the reſt their inner. The exteriour Web of the firſt or outmoſt feather is black, the ſhaft white, and of a notable thickneſs: The tips of the following till the tenth, and the inſide of all white, and moreover half the interiour Web of the four or five foremoſt. The Tail is compoſed of twelve feathers, the outmoſt being half a foot long and better, and having their exteriour Webs from cinereous inclining to black: The two middlemoſt ſcarce three inches
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:63869:183"/>
long and white: The reſt having their outer Webs cinereous, their inner white.</p>
                        <p>Its Bill is long, almoſt ſtreight, black at the tip, elſe red. Its mouth is red within: Its Tongue ſharp: Its Legs red; the back-toe ſmall: The fore-toes web'd together as far as the very Claws. The craw was large, out of which we took a <hi>Gudgeon:</hi> The Gizzard full of fiſh-bones: The Guts twenty inches long: The blind guts very ſhort.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Birds flock together, and build and breed on Iſlands uninhabited near to the Sea-ſhores many together in the ſame quarter. In the Iſland of <hi>Caldey,</hi> adjacent to the Southern ſhore of <hi>Wales,</hi> they call them <hi>Spurres;</hi> [a name (as appears by <hi>Baltner)</hi> common to them with the <hi>Germans</hi> about <hi>Strasburgh,]</hi> and that little Iſlet where they build <hi>Spurre</hi> Iſland. In other places of <hi>England</hi> they are called <hi>Scrays,</hi> a name, I conceive, framed in imitation of their cry: For they are extraordinarily clamorous. In the Northern parts they call them <hi>Terns,</hi> whence <hi>Turner</hi> calls them in <hi>Latine, Sternae,</hi> becauſe they frequent Lakes and great Pools of water, which in the North of <hi>England</hi> are called <hi>Tarns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They lay three or four Eggs, either upon the bare ground, or in a Neſt made of Reeds. Their Eggs are like the great Gulls Eggs, though much leſs: The Young are alſo ſpotted with black like theirs. They fly up and down over the water, intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their prey, and when they eſpy a fiſh, they caſt themſelves down with wonderful ſwiftneſs into the Water, and catching it up, fly away with it in a trice. They frequent Rivers far remote from the Sea, as for example, the <hi>Rhene</hi> about <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> where they were taken, deſcribed and painted by <hi>Leonard Baltner,</hi> by the title of <hi>Ein Speurer,</hi> who tells us alſo that they build in gravelly and ſandy places by the banks of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; ſo that if it happen there be a floud in their breeding time, their Eggs are marred, and Neſts deſtroyed.</p>
                        <p>This Bird for its long Wings, ſmall Feet, forked Tail, continual flying, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the figure of its whole body, is commonly, and not undeſervedly, called, the <hi>Sea-Swallow.</hi>

The membrane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necting the inmoſt and middle toes in the inmoſt is extended to the Claw, in the middle toe proceeds not beyond the firſt joynt; ſo the upper bone of the Toe is altogether free and looſe. That which joyns the outmoſt and middle Toes, though it begins in both from the very Claws, yet is it depreſſed in the middle, and as it were hollowed into the form of a Creſcent, whoſe horns are the Toes. The Claw of the middle toe on the inſide is thinned into an edge, Its cry is hardly diſtinguiſhable from that of the <hi>Sea-Swallow.</hi> It builds among the Reeds, and lays three or four Eggs, like to thoſe of other <hi>Gulls,</hi> of a ſordid green, ſpotted with black, compaſſed with a broad black girdle about the middle.

                           <p>THis Bird is much the biggeſt of all whole-footed Water-fowl with broad Bills. An old one we made trial of weighed twenty pounds: From the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail was fifty five inches long, to the end of the Feet fifty ſeven. The diſtance between the tips of the Wings extended was ſeven foot and eight inches.</p>
                           <p>The whole body is covered with a ſoft, delicate Plumage, in the old ones purely white, in the young ones grey. The quils of the greater Wing-feathers in this Bird are greater than in the <hi>wild Swan.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Bill in the young ones of the firſt year is of a lead colour, having a round nail as it were at the tip, and a black line on each ſide from the Noſthrils to the Head. From the Eyes to the Bill is a triangular ſpace, bare of feathers, of a black colour, the baſe whereof reſpects the Bill, the <hi>vertex</hi> the Eyes. In old ones the Bill is red, the hook or nail at the end being black. Above at the baſe of the Bill grows a great Lobe of tuberous fleſh of a black colour, bending forward or downward. The ſpace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Eyes always continues black. The Tongue is indented or toothed: The Feet
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:63869:185"/>
of a lead colour, bare a little above the knee. The inmoſt Toe hath a lateral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane appendant. The Claws are black.</p>
                           <p>The ſtomach is furniſhed with thick and ſtrong muſcles: The Guts have eight or nine revolutions, and are large. The Wind-pipe in this kind enters not the Breaſt-bone. Wherefore <hi>Aldrovand</hi> doth not rightly infer that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> never diſſected this Fowl, becauſe he makes no mention of this ingreſs, and of the ſtrange figure of the Wind-pipe. For this is proper to the <hi>wild Swan,</hi> not common to both kinds; we having not obſerved ſuch a conformation of the Wind-pipe in any of thoſe tame <hi>Swans</hi> we have diſſected. <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> therefore thinking there was but one kind of <hi>Swan, viz.</hi> that which he diſſected, did erroneouſly attribute what was proper to that one kind, to the <hi>Swan</hi> in general. We have opened two <hi>wild Swans,</hi> and in both have obſerved the Wind-pipe ſo to enter the cavity of the Breaſt-bone, and to be there ſo reflected as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> hath expreſſed both in words and figures: Of <hi>tame Swans</hi> we have anatomized many, and in all have obſerved the wind-pipe to deſcend ſtreight down into the Lungs without any ſuch digreſſion or reflection.</p>
                           <p>It is a very long-lived fowl, ſo that it is thought to attain the age of three hundred years: Which (ſaith <hi>Aldrovandus)</hi> to me ſeems not likely. For my part, I could eaſily be induced to believe it: For that I have been aſſured by credible perſons that a <hi>Gooſe</hi> will live a hundred years or more. But that a <hi>Swan</hi> is much longer-lived than a <hi>Gooſe,</hi> if it were not manifeſt in experience, yet are there many convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the ſame kind it is bigger: That it hath harder, firmer, and more ſolid fleſh: That it ſits longer on its Eggs before it hatches them. For, that I may invert <hi>Plinies</hi> words, Thoſe creatures live longeſt that are longeſt born in the Womb. Now incubation anſwers to geſtation. For the Egg is as it were an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Womb with the young encloſed, which in viviparous Animals are cheriſhed, and, as I may ſo ſay, hatched within the body, in oviparous Animals without the body, by the warmth of the old one ſitting upon them.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Swan</hi> feeds not upon fiſh, but either upon herbs growing in the water, and their roots and ſeeds, or upon Worms, and other Inſects, and ſhell-fiſh. <hi>Albertus</hi> writes truly, that its fleſh is black and hard. As the Bird it ſelf is far bigger than a <hi>Gooſe,</hi> ſo its fleſh is blacker, harder, and tougher, having groſſer fibres, hard of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, of a bad and melancholic juice: Yet for its rarity ſerves as a diſh to adorn great mens Tables at Feaſts and entertainments, being elſe in my opinion no deſirable dainty. It lays ſeven or eight Eggs, and ſits near two months before its young ones be hatcht.</p>
                           <p>They make uſe of the skin, the groſſer feathers pluckt off, and only the Down left, and ſo dreſt, as a defenſative againſt cold, eſpecially to cover and cheriſh the Breaſt and Stomach.</p>

                           <p>IT weighs leſs than a <hi>tame Swan,</hi> not exceeding two hundred ſixty five ounces, or ſixteen pound three quarters, Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Feet was ſixty inches, to the end of the Tail fifty ſix. The figure of the body is the ſame with the tame <hi>Swans:</hi> The colour white, yet not all over ſo white as the tame <hi>Swans:</hi> For the middle of the Back, and the ſmaller covert-feathers of the Wings are cinereous: Sometimes alſo here and there a brown feather is mixt with the white ones in the Back. Each Wing hath thirty eight quils. The firſt feather of the baſtard-wing is longer than ordinary, as in the tame <hi>Swan:</hi> The quils much leſs than in that. The Bill towards the tip, and as far as the Noſthrils, is black: Thence to the Head covered with a yellow membrane. [Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> deſcribes the Bill a little differently thus. The upper Mandible is moveable, from the Eyes to the Noſthrils bare, and of a fair yellow colour, beyond the Noſthrils black. The lower Mandible is black, but the membrane under the Chin yellow.] The Legs are bare of feathers a little above the knees, of a dusky yellow, as are alſo the Feet. The Wind-pipe after a ſtrange and wonderful manner enters the Breaſt-bone in a cavity prepared for it, and is therein reflected, and after its egreſs at the divarication is contracted into a narrow compaſs by a broad and bony cartilage, then being divided into two branches goes on to the Lungs. Theſe branches before they enter the Lungs are dilated, and as it were ſwoln out into two cavities.</p>

On the ſides of the Rump grow two huge glandules, out of which by a light preſſure may be ſqueezed a certain glutinous ſubſtance like to ear-wax, wherewith ſhe anoints and compoſes her feathers. But theſe glandules are not peculiar to this Bird, though perchance greater and more remarkable in her, but common to all. The Bird we deſcribed was a Female. The knot or bunch of Eggs was ſituate far within the body, between the very Lobes of the Lungs. The Wind-pipe enters the breaſt-bone, and comes out again below the <hi>Merry-thought:</hi> The ſtomach is very fleſhy, and furniſhed with thick muſcles. Above the Stomach the Gullet is dilated into a bag, thick-ſet, and as it were granulated within with many papillary glandules, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a kind of <hi>Saliva,</hi> which ſerves as a <hi>menſtruum</hi> to macerate the meat.</p>
                           <p>The Wind-pipe reflected in form of a Trumpet ſeems to be ſo contrived and formed by nature for modulating the voice. Hence what the Ancients have delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſinging of <hi>Swans</hi> (if it be true, which I much doubt) ſeems chiefly to agree to this bird, and not to the <hi>tame Swan.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For my part, thoſe ſtories of the Ancients concerning the ſinging of <hi>Swans, viz.</hi> that thoſe Birds at other times, but eſpecially when their death approaches, do with a moſt ſweet and melodious modulation of their voice, ſing their own <hi>Naenia</hi> or funeral ſong, ſeemed to me always very unlikely and fabulous, and to have been therefore not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly exploded by <hi>Scaliger</hi> and others. Howbeit <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> weighing on both ſides the Arguments and Authorities of learned men, hath (he ſaith) obſerved them to be equal; wherefore to caſt the ſcale, and eſtabliſh the affirmative, he thinks that wonderful ſtructure of the Wind-pipe, by him firſt obſerved, is of weight ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. But this Argument though it be very ſpecious and plauſible, yet doth it not conclude the controverſie. For we have obſerved in the Wind-pipe of the <hi>Crane</hi> the like ingreſs into the cavity of the Breaſt-bone, and reflection therein, or a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable one; yet no man, that I know of, ever commended the <hi>Crane</hi> for ſinging, or muſical modulation of its voice. But if you ask me, to what purpoſe then doth the Wind-pipe enter into the breaſt-bone, and is in that manner reflected there? I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly confeſs, I do not certainly and fully know. Yet may there be other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aſſigned thereof; as that which <note n="*" place="margin">

                              <hi>Aldrovand</hi> alledges in the firſt place, 1. That whereas ſometimes for almoſt half an hours ſpace the <hi>Swan</hi> continues with her heels up, and her head under water, ſeeking and gathering up her food from the bottom of the Pool or River ſhe ſwims in, that part of the Wind-pipe encloſed in the breaſt-bone may ſupply her with air enough to ſerve her all that while. So the uſe of it will be to be a ſtore-houſe of air, for the advantage of diving and continuing long under water. 2. This kind of ſtructure doth undoubtedly conduce much to the increaſing the ſtrength and force of the voice. For that the <hi>wild Swan</hi> hath a very loud and ſhrill cry, and which may be heard a long way off, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name <hi>Hooper,</hi> impoſed upon it (as I ſuppoſe) from its hooping and hollowing noiſe doth import.</p>
                           <p>Hence it appears how uncertain and fallacious a way of arguing it is from the final cauſe. For though Nature, Gods ordinary Miniſter, always acts for ſome end, yet what that is we are often ignorant, and it doth not rarely fall out to be far different from what we fancy: Nay we may be deceived when we think we are moſt ſure, and imagine it can be no other than what we have preſumed.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore I make more account of the teſtimonies he alledges; as of <hi>Frederick Pendaſius,</hi> that affirmed he had often heard <hi>Swans</hi> ſinging ſweetly in the Lake of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> as he was rowed up and down in a Boat. But as for the teſtimony of <hi>George Braun</hi> concerning flocks of <hi>Swans</hi> in the Sea near <hi>London,</hi> meeting, and as it were welcoming the Fleets of Ships returning home with loud and chearful ſinging, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt moſt falſe: We having never heard of any ſuch thing.</p>

                              <hi>Olaus Wormius</hi> of late confirms the opinion of <hi>Aldrovand,</hi> and the reports of the Ancients concerning the ſinging of <hi>Swans,</hi> producing the Teſtimonies of ſome of his familiars and Scholars who profeſſed themſelves to have heard their muſic. There was (ſaith he) in my Family a very honeſt young man, one Mr. <hi>John Roſtorph</hi> Student in Divinity, a <hi>Norwegian</hi> by Nation. This man did upon his credit, and with the interpoſition of an Oath ſolemnly affirm, that himſelf in the Territory of <hi>Dronten</hi> did once by the Sea-ſhore early in the Morning hear an unuſual and moſt ſweet murmur compoſed of moſt pleaſant whiſtlings and ſounds: Which, when as he knew not whence it came, or how it was made, for that he ſaw no man near which might be the author of it, looking round about him, and climbing up the top of a certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory, he eſpied an infinite number of <hi>Swans</hi> gathered together in a Bay of the Sea near hand, making that harmony; a ſweeter than which in all his lives time he
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:63869:186"/>
had never heard. By ſome Iſlanders, my Scholars, I have been told, that nothing is more frequent with them than this harmony, in thoſe places where there are <hi>Swans.</hi> This I therefore alledge, that it may appear that the report of thoſe famous ancient Authors concerning the ſinging of <hi>Swans</hi> is not altogether vain, but atteſted and proved by modern experiments. Thus far <hi>Wormius.</hi> Let the Readers judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his witneſſes be ſufficient.</p>

Its length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Tail, in that we meaſured, was thirty five inches and an half, to the end of the Feet thirty ſeven and an half: The Wings extended were ſixty inches and an half over. The length of the Neck from the tip of the Bill to the ſetting on of the Wings ſeventeen inches. The Bill it ſelf from the tip to the angles of the Mouth was two inches three quarters long, to the Eyes three and an half. The Tail was ſix inches and an half long, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of eighteen feathers, the outmoſt the ſhorteſt, the reſt by degrees longer to the middlemoſt, which are the longeſt. The colour in theſe, as in other tame Birds is various, in ſome brown, in ſome grey, in ſome white, in ſome flecked, or partico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured of white and brown. The Bill and Legs in young ones are yellow, in old ones for the moſt part red. The Bill is thick at the head, and ſlenderer by degrees to the point. Each Wing hath twenty ſeven quils or feathers in the firſt row. When it is angry it hiſſes like a Serpent. It is very long-lived. A certain friend of ours of undoubted fidelity told us that his Father had once a <hi>Gooſe</hi> that was known to be eighty years old, which for ought he knew might have lived the other eighty years, had he not been conſtrained to kill it for its miſchievouſneſs in beating and deſtroying the younger <hi>Geeſe.</hi>

For in this the Chin and Cheeks are white, in that the whole Head and Neck black, ſave only a black line on each ſide the Neck; which in the <hi>Bernacle</hi> are wanting. Beſides, the <hi>Bernacle</hi> ſeemed to us bigger, and much fairer, for thoſe cinereous and black colours alternately diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the feathers of the Back and Wings make a very lovely ſhew.</p>
                           <p>This alſo ſeems to be the ſame with the <hi>Brenta</hi> or <hi>Bernicla</hi> of <hi>Geſner,</hi> although his deſcription be not very exact.

                           <p>What is reported concerning the riſe and original of theſe birds, to wit, that they are bred of rotten wood, for inſtance, of the Maſts, Ribs, and Planks of broken Ships half putrified and corrupted, or of certain Palms of trees falling into the Sea, or laſtly, of a kind of Sea-ſhels, the figures whereof <hi>Lobel, Gerard,</hi> and others have ſet forth, may be ſeen in <hi>Aldrovand, Sennertus</hi> in his <hi>Hypomnemata, Michael Meyerus,</hi> who hath written an entire book concerning the <hi>Tree-fowl,</hi> and many others. But that all theſe ſtories are falſe and fabulous I am confidently perſwaded. Neither do there want ſufficient arguments to induce the lovers of truth to be of our opinion, and to convince the gainſayers. For in the whole <hi>Genus</hi> of Birds (excepting the <hi>Phaenix</hi> whoſe reputed original is without doubt fabulous) there is not any one example of equivocal or ſpontaneous generation. Among other Animals indeed the leſſer and more imperfect, as for example many Inſects and Frogs, are commonly thought either to be of ſpontaneous original, or to come of different ſeeds and principles. But the greater Animals and perfect in their kind, ſuch as is among Birds the <hi>Gooſe,</hi> no Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher would ever admit to be in this manner produced. Secondly, thoſe ſhells in which they affirm theſe Birds to be bred, and to come forth by a ſtrange <hi>metamorphoſis,</hi> do moſt certainly contain an Animal of their own kind, and not tranſmutable into any other thing: Concerning which the Reader may pleaſe to conſult that curious Naturaliſt <hi>Fabius Columna.</hi> Theſe ſhells we our ſelves have ſeen, once at <hi>Venice</hi> growing in great abundance to the Keel of an old Ship; a ſecond time in the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi> Sea, growing to the back of a <hi>Tortoiſe</hi> we took between <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Malta. Columna</hi> makes this ſhell-fiſh to be a kind of <hi>Balanus marinus.</hi> Thirdly, that theſe <hi>Geeſe</hi> do lay Eggs after the manner of other Birds, ſit on them, and hatch their Young, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in their Northern Voyages affirm themſelves to have found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>

                           <p>IT is a little bigger than a <hi>Duck,</hi> and longer-bodied. The Head, Neck, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Breaſt are black. But about the middle of the Neck on each ſide is a ſmall ſpot or line of white, which together appear like a ring of white. The Back is of the colour of a common <hi>Gooſe,</hi> that is, a dark grey. Toward the Tail it is darker coloured: But thoſe feathers which are next and immediate to the Tail are white. The lower Belly is white: The Breaſt of a dark grey: The Tail and greater quils of the Wings black, the leſſer of a dark grey. The Bill is ſmall, black, an inch and half long, thicker at the head, ſlenderer toward the tip: The Eyes hazel-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured: The Noſthrils great: The Feet black, having the back-toe.

                           <p>IT is bigger than the common Duck. Its Bill is broad and ſhort, yellow on both ſides, black in the middle, with a red hook at the tip.

All the reſt of the body is black, ſaving a croſs line of white in the middle of the Wings, and a white ſpot behind each Eye. The feathers of the whole body are ſo ſoft and delicate as nothing more, ſo that it might be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly called the <hi>Velvet-Duck.</hi> In the Stomach and Guts, almoſt down to the ſtreight Gut, I found ſmall indigeſted fragments of <hi>Cockle</hi> and <hi>Periwinkle-</hi>ſhells: But in the ſtreight gut they were all concocted, and reduced into a fine powder or ſand.

Of the ſame colour are thoſe long feathers growing at the ſetting on of each Wing, and covering the Back: Above which appear in the Back two broad white ſpots of the figure of the ſegment of a circle.

The Legs and Feet, as in other birds of this kind, red, yet here and there, eſpecially about the joynts, clouded with ſable. The membranes connecting the Toes, and all the ſoals of the Feet black. The Bird I deſcribed was a Cock, and had a Labyrinth at the divarication of the Wind-pipe. The Wind-pipe it ſelf was greater at the head, ſlenderer in the middle, and above the Labyrinth again ſwoln into a greater tube. Its Stomach or Gizzard very large, and provided with very thick and ſtrong muſcles, filled with very ſmall ſtones mingled with graſs. Its Liver pale; Gall-bladder little, blind guts long.</p>
                           <p>This Bird I found in the Market at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhot, I ſuppoſe, upon the Sea-coaſt. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hapned to ſee it elſe where, neither do I find any deſcription of it, or ſo much as any mention made of it in any book. Where it lives and breeds I know not.</p>

                           <p>IT is ſomewhat leſs than the common <hi>Duck,</hi> about two foot long. Its Bill is broad, and blue; the upper Mandible much broader than the nether. The Head and part of the Neck are of a black green: The Breaſt and underſide of the Neck black, the lower part of the Neck hath ſomething of white mingled. The Belly is white, with a ſprinkling of yellow in its lower part, about the Vent of black. The upper part of the Back is of a ſooty or ſable colour; the middle white, waved with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe lines of brown; the lower, together with the Tail, brown. The Tail is ſcarce two inches long: The Wings brown, adorned on the upper ſide with white ſpots, having alſo a croſs line of white. The Legs and Feet, together with the Web and Claws, are of a dusky blue colour.</p>
                           <p>This Bird is called the <hi>Scaup-duck,</hi> becauſe ſhe feeds upon <hi>Scaup, i. e.</hi> broken ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh: She varies infinitely in colour, eſpecially in Head and Neck, ſo that among a pack of forty or fifty you ſhall not find two exactly alike: A thing not uſual in this kind.</p>

                           <p>THe Bill from the tip to the corners of the Mouth is about two inches long, broad, of a pale blue colour all but the tip, which is black. The feathers on the forehead deſcend down the middle of the Bill in a peak or angle. The Noſthrils are great, at a pretty diſtance from the Plumage. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes of a yellow or gold colour: The Ears ſmall, as perchance in all Water-ſowl. The Head, eſpecially the crown, of a dark purple inclining to black, or rather black with ſome mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of purple; whence at <hi>Venice,</hi> and elſewhere in <hi>Italy,</hi> it is called, <hi>Capo negro.</hi> It hath a creſt or cop hanging down backwards from the Head, of an inch and halflong.

                           <p>The Wings are ſhort, all the covert feathers black: The four outmoſt quils of the ſame colour with the body; the ſucceeding little by little whiter, the ſubſequent than the antecedent.

The nether ſide of the Neck and forepart of the Breaſt are black, the reſt of the Breaſt and Belly, as far as the Vent, of a white or ſilver-colour, the lower the darker. Behind the Vent it is black. The lateral feathers covered by the Wings when cloſed, thoſe on the Thighs, and the under-coverts of the Wings are white. The interiour baſtard-wing conſiſts of ſix white feathers.</p>
                           <p>The Legs are ſhort and ſituate backwards: The Feet of a livid or dark blue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the Web black: The Toes long.</p>

                           <p>In the angle of the lower Mandible ſome have a white ſpot, which in others is wanting.</p>
                           <p>The Wind-pipe hath its labyrinth. The Liver is divided into two Lobes, having a Gall annexed. The Gizzard is compoſed of thick muſcles: Therein we found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſmall ſtones and Sea-wrack.</p>
                           <p>We ſaw a Bird very like this, perchance the ſame, in his Majeſties Pools in S. <hi>James</hi>'s Park.</p>
                           <p>Its Bill and Legs were of a lead-colour: Its Head black. Its Wings little, but above the Wings the ſides white. A long creſt hangs down backward from behind the Head.

                           <head>§. X. <hi>The black Diver or Scoter:</hi> Anas niger minor.</head>
                           <p>IT is almoſt as big as the common <hi>Duck,</hi> but rounder-bodied. The whole body all over is of a black or ſable colour. From the Shoulders in ſome birds ſpring blacker feathers. In the Chin and middle of the Breaſt ſome aſh-coloured or whitiſh fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are mingled with the black. The Wings are of the ſame colour with the body, without any diverſity of colours at all. The Bill ſuch as in the Duck-kind, yellow about the Noſthrils, elſe black; pectinated about the ſides, yellow within, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any bunch in the upper Mandible. Its Feet are black. This deſcription is of a Hen.</p>
                           <p>In the year 1671. I found the Male of this kind at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> killed on the Sea-coaſts thereabouts, and bought in the Market by my Lord Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi> his Steward, and deſcribed it in theſe words.</p>
                           <p>It is ſomething leſs than a tame <hi>Duck,</hi> ſhort-bodied for its bigneſs, and broad; all over black both upper and under-ſide: Only the Head had a dark tincture of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the under-ſide of the firſt, ſecond, and third rows of Wing-feathers inclined to cinereous. The wings were ſhort; the quils in each twenty five. The Tail more than an hand-breadth long, conſiſting of ſixteen feathers, the outmoſt of which were the ſhorteſt, the reſt in order longer to the middlemoſt, which were the longeſt, ſo that the Tail runs out into an acute angle, more acute than I remember to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in other <hi>Sea-ducks;</hi> and each ſingle feather is very ſharp-pointed.</p>
                           <p>The Bill in this Bird is eſpecially remarkable, being broad, blunt, as in the reſt of this kind, of about two inches length, having no <hi>Appendix</hi> or nail at the tip, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the manner of other <hi>Ducks.</hi> The upper Mandible above the Noſtrils, next the forehead, bunches out into a notable protuberance, being ſo divided in the middle as to reſemble Buttocks, diſtinguiſhed by a yellow intercurrent line. Now the colour of this upper Mandible is black about the ſides, yellow in the middle, the yellow part being ſo broad as to contain the Noſthrils, and about an inch long. The Tongue is very great. The Eye-lids yellow. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes dark. The Legs and Feet dusky: The Toes very long, and web'd together, ſo that its oars are broad and large. The ſhorter Toe hath a membranous border extant along its outſide. This had no labyrinth on its Wind-pipe. The blind-guts for a bird of this kind were very ſhort: The Gall great. It weighed two pounds and nine ounces: Its length from Bill to Tail was twenty two inches: It breadth from Wings end to Wings end thirty four and an half.</p>
                           <p>This Bird hath not as yet been deſcribed by any Author extant in Print that we know of. It abides conſtantly at Sea, gets its living by diving, and is taken in Nets placed under water. In the waſh in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> it is found plentifully. Its Caſe

It is bigger than the common <hi>Wigeon,</hi> and for its bigneſs ſhorter and thicker. The leſſer covert-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Wings, and thoſe on the middle of the back are moſt elegantly variega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with dark brown and cinereous waved lines [or aſh-coloured, with very narrow, waved, croſs, dusky lines.] The Rump and feathers under the Tail are black, ſo that the Tail is compaſſed with a ring of black. The lower part of the Neck is likewiſe black, ſo that the forepart of the body ſeems alſo to be encircled with a ring or ſwathe of black. The Head and almoſt the whole Neck are of a deep fulvous or red colour: the middle part of the Breaſt white, the ſides and lower part, and Belly all of the ſame colour with the Back, and varied with the like tranſverſe undulated lines, but both colours paler: Toward the Vent it is by degrees darker coloured. The Tail is very ſhort, not exceeding two inches, made up of twelve feathers, of a dark grey, the outmoſt the ſhorteſt, the reſt gradually longer to the middlemoſt; yet the exceſs is not conſiderable, ſo that notwithſtanding it is not to be reckoned among thoſe that have ſharp Tails. The quils of the Wings are about twenty five, all of one colour, <hi>viz.</hi> a dark cinereous, though if they be carefully heeded, there will appear ſome diverſity, for the tips of the exteriour and greater feathers are marked with black, of the middle ones with white. The interiour baſtard-wing and leſſer covert-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the underſide of the Wings are white.</p>
                           <p>The Bill is bigger and broader than in the <hi>Wigeon.</hi> The feathers divide the middle of the upper Mandible coming down from the forehead in form of a peak or acute angle. The upper Mandible is of a lead-colour, but its tip black: The nether is wholly black. The <hi>Irides</hi> of the Eyes are of a very beautiful colour, from yellow inclining to a ſparkling red: The Feet lead-coloured: The membranes connecting the Toes black: The inmoſt toe the leaſt, having a membranous border annexed to its outſide. The back toe hath likewiſe an appendant membrane or fin.</p>
                           <p>The characteriſtic note of this Bird, is one uniform colour of its Wings, without any feathers of different colour in the middle of the Wing, as is uſual in moſt Birds of this kind.</p>
                           <p>In another Bird of this kind, (which we take to be the Female of this) the Bill was black with an aſh-coloured ſpot of the form of a creſcent a little above the tip.

The Tail is very ſhort, the middle feathers which are the longeſt being about two inches and a quarter in length, the outmoſt ſhorter; of a brown or dusky colour, the number of feathers fourteen. The Breaſt below the ring down to the Merry-thought is red, which colour above alſo reaches to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Shoulders. The reſt of the Breaſt and the upper Belly is white, the lower to the Vent dusky or dark grey. The feathers under the Tail are white, thoſe long ones on the thighs red.

The Wings are ſmall for the bigneſs of the Bird, their feathers being ſhort. The Tail is made up of ſixteen feathers, and is for this kind long. The Bill is ſhorter and narrower than that of the <hi>tufted Duck,</hi> thick at the head, ſharper toward the tip, the extreme hook or nail being black, and encompaſſed by a broad yellow ſpace, very elegant to behold; the reſt of the Bill black. The Eyes were of a lovely yellow or gold-colour. The Feet large, ſituate backwards, of a yellowiſh red colour, the Web of the Feet dusky; the ſoal black. I obſerved no labyrinth on the Wind-pipe, It hath a ſmall Gall-bladder of an oval figure. In the Craw we found a Crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh.</p>
                              <p>Since the finiſhing of the <hi>Latine</hi> Hiſtory we have been informed that this Bird is no diſtinct kind, but only the Female <hi>Golden-eye.</hi> And truly, the ſhape of the body, the make of the Bill, the length, number of feathers, figure and colour of the Tail, the faſhion and colour of the Feet, and other accidents induce us to think ſo, neither is there more difference in weight than is uſual between different Sexes. Beſides that, this was a Female the want of the labyrinth proves; but in the next Article I ſhall ſhew ſome reaſon to doubt whether of the <hi>Golden-eye</hi> or not. Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> alſo was ſuſpicious that it might be the Hen <hi>Golden-eye.</hi>

Each Wing hath about twenty ſix quils; of which the outmoſt ten are black, the tip of the eleventh white; in the ſucceeding the white increaſes, till after three or four it reaches to the bottom. The twentieth or twenty firſt hath its exteriour half white, its interiour black. [There is ſome variety in ſeveral Birds in the colours of theſe feathers.] The feathers immediately above the white feathers are alſo white: Beſides, in the leſſer covert-feathers is a great ſpot of white in ſome birds, of grey in others. The Legs and Feet are of an obſcure, fordid yellow, but about the joynts black. The web of the Foot is alſo black. The Legs are ſituate backwards, as in the reſt of this kind, feathered down almoſt to the knees, the Shanks ſhort, but the Feet large: The inmoſt Toe hath a membrane bordering on the outſide of it.

Its Bill is three inches long, coal-black, much broader toward the tip than at the baſe, exca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated like a Buckler, of a round Circumference. At the end it hath a ſmall crooked hook or nail. Each Mandible is pectinated or toothed like a comb, with rays or thin plates inſerted mutually one into another when the mouth is ſhut.

The leſſer covert-feathers of the Wing, excepting thoſe on the outmoſt bone, are of a pleaſant pale blue, inclining to aſh-colour. The Tail is about three inches and an half long: conſiſts of fourteen feathers, particoloured of white and black, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt feathers being wholly white, the middlemoſt, except the extreme white edges, wholly black, the reſt black in their middle parts, white about the borders or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>

The Legs are feathered down to the Knees. In the <hi>Mallard</hi> the Head and upper part of the Neck are of a delicate ſhining green: then follows a ring of white, which yet fails of being an entire circle, not coming round behind. From the white ring the Throat is of a Cheſnut colour down to the Breaſt. The Breaſt it ſelf and Belly are of a white aſh-colour, bedewed or ſprinkled with innumerable dark ſpecks, as it were ſmall drops. Under the Tail the feathers are black. The upper ſide of the Neck from cinereous is red, ſprinkled in like manner with ſpots. The middle of the Back between the Wings is red, the lower part black, and ſtill deeper on the Rump, with a gloſs of purple. Theſides under the Wings, and the longer feathers on the Thighs are adorned with tranſverſe brown lines, making a very fair ſhew. In them the white colour ſeems to have a mixture of blue.</p>

The tip of the twenty firſt is white, the exteriour Web of a dark purple: The middle part of the twenty ſecond is a little ſilver-coloured: The twenty third is wholly of a ſilver-colour, yet the edges on each ſide are black: The twenty fourth is likewiſe of a ſilver-colour, only the exteriour border black. The outmoſt covert-feathers are of the ſame colour with the quils; but thoſe immediately incumbent on the purple-blue quils have black tips, and next the tips a broad line or croſs bar of white, ſo that the blue ſpot is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with a double line, firſt black, and above that white.

AB, CD are Nets extending a great length in form of a wall or hedge, inclining one to another, at the further end of which, before they concur in an angle are placed 1, 2, 3, or more conoideal Nets, like tunnelling Nets for <hi>Partridges.</hi> Which things being ſo prepared, and the day for fowling ſet, there is a great concourſe of men and boats. Theſe drive the Birds, now unable to fly, into the grounds encloſed in the Nets with long Staves and Poles, and ſo by degrees into thoſe Conoideal Tunnels, 1, 2, 3, diſpoſed, as we ſaid in the angle. By the way many are knocked down by the Boatmen and other Rabble with their Poles, others and more are driven upon the ſide Nets AB, CD. Theſe belong to them who own the Nets (for the Nets for the moſt part have ſeveral owners) thoſe fall to their ſhares that killed them. Thoſe which are cooped up, and driven into the end-tunnels 1, 2, 3, belong to the Lord of the Soil. To one Fowling ſometimes you ſhall have four hundred Boats meet. We have heard that there have been four thouſand Mallards taken at one driving in <hi>Deeping</hi> Fen.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Mallards</hi> change their feathers (we call it <hi>Moulting,</hi> a word derived from the Latine, <hi>muto,</hi> ſignifying to change) when the Hens begin to ſit; the Ducks not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their young ones are grown up and ready to fly, at what time they come hither for that purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Mallards</hi> about the end of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Ducks</hi> not before the end of <hi>June,</hi> when the <hi>Mallards</hi> have recovered their feathers and begin to fly again. The Cock<hi>-Teal</hi> and <hi>Wigeons</hi> accompany the <hi>Ducks,</hi> and moult together with them. The Hens of theſe Birds moult ſomething later. So that this kind of ſport or (if you pleaſe) exerciſe laſts from the middle of <hi>June</hi> till the end of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> In a Weeks time all the old feathers fall off; the new ones come not to their full growth in leſs than three Weeks ſpace. When they begin to moult they are all very fat and fleſhy; but before their feathers be perfectly grown, they become lean. The <hi>Ducks</hi> and <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard</hi> are called <hi>whole fowl;</hi> the <hi>Wigeons</hi> and <hi>Teal half fowl,</hi> becauſe they are ſold for half the price of the other.</p>
                           <p>Here it may be worth the while to enquire, why Birds do yearly moult their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> ſuppoſes that there is the ſame cauſe of the caſting the feathers in Birds, that there is of the falling off of the hair in Men and other Animals upon recovery from a Fever or other diſeaſe, or upon refection after long abſtinence. For in Cock-birds the heat and turgency of luſt, is, as it were, a kind of Fever, and ſo in the Spring-time their bodies being exhauſted by the frequent uſe of Venery, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lean: But in the Hens the time of ſitting and bringing up their Young anſwers to a diſeaſe or long abſtinence, for at that time they macerate themſelves by hunger and continual labour. When theſe times are over, both Sexes returning to mind their own bodies and feed for themſelves, do in a ſhort time recover their fleſh and grow fat again, whereupon the pores of the skin being dilated the feathers fall off.</p>
                           <p>Our Country-men (imitating, as I ſuppoſe, the <hi>Low Dutch,</hi> who were Authors of the invention) in maritime and fenny places, in Pools prepared by a new Artifice and fitted with their Channels and Nets, and ſtored with Coy-Ducks, take yearly in, the Winter-time <hi>Duck</hi> and <hi>Mallard, Wigeon, Teal,</hi> and other Birds of the Duck-kind in great numbers.</p>
                           <p>A place is to be choſen for this purpoſe far remote from common High-ways, and all noiſe of people, and in which thoſe Birds are wont in great numbers to frequent. Having pitch'd upon a convenient place, prepare a large Pool A, ſet round with Willows and Reeds. On the South ſide N, or <figure/> the North ſide S of this Pool draw as many Ditches or Channels 1 1 1 (Pipes they call them) as you pleaſe or think needful; let them be broad at the Pool, and by degrees narrower till they end in a point. Along theſe Channels on each ſide at little diſtances thruſt into the banks rods or wands of wood, and bending them over-head bind them two together by pairs all along in form of an Arch or Vault from the beginning of the Channel to the end. As the Channels grow nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower and narrower ſo the bows are made lower and lower. The Poles thus bent in faſhion of Bows are to be covered with Nets caſt over them, and ſo the Pipes are made: Theſe Arches or Vaults end in long Cylindrical Nets kept ſtretcht by hoops like bow-nets, that end which reſpects the Arch being open, the other ſhut. Along the banks of the Pipes are made many hedges or walls n n n of Reeds woven thick toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, parallel to each other, but ſtanding obliquely to the Bank, the acute angles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Pool, and along the bank of the Pool, at the <hi>exit</hi> of the Pipes is likewiſe a
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:63869:194"/>
hedge of Reeds (l m) to be drawn. The <hi>Coy-Ducks</hi> are to be fed at the mouth or entrance of the Pipes, and to be accuſtomed at a token given them by a whiſtle to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to the Fowler. The Fowler firſt walks about the Pool, and obſerves into what Pipe the Birds gathered together in the Pool may moſt conveniently be enticed and driven, and then caſting Hemp-ſeed, or ſome ſuch like thing at the entrance thereof, calls his <hi>Coy-ducks</hi> together by a whiſtle. The wild fowl accompany them, and when the Fowler perceives them now entred into the Pipe, he ſhews himſelf behind them through the interſtices of the hedges n, n, n, which being frightned, and not daring to return back upon the man, ſwim on further into the <hi>Pipe,</hi> then by other interſtices the Fowler ſhews himſelf again behind them, till at laſt he hath thus driven them into the Cylindrical Nets. If any Birds riſe and endeavour to fly away, being beaten back by the Nets ſpread over the Pipe they fall down again into the Channel. The whole art conſiſts in this, that the Birds within the Pipes may ſee the Fowler, thoſe in the Pool not ſeeing him. So thoſe only ſeeing him, theſe notwithſtanding often enter the <hi>Pipes,</hi> and ſo ſometimes beſides thoſe the Fowler drives before him there are others taken the ſecond or third time. The <hi>Coy-ducks</hi> go not into the Cylindrical Nets, but ſtay without and entice others. Some train up a Whelp for this ſort of fowling, teaching him to compaſs the hedges, and ſhew himſelf behind the Birds, to which purpoſe there are holes made in the hedges for him to paſs freely. The Whelp in compaſſing the hedges ought always to keep his tail directed toward the Pool, his Head toward the Pipe, and ſo he terrifies the Birds before him, and drives them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Thoſe behind him he allures and tolls forward, they following him to gaze at him as a new and ſtrange object. When the wind blows ſideways the Birds are more eaſily driven whither the Fowler pleaſes, than when its blows <note n="*" place="margin">Lies in their faces, or on their backs.</note> directly contrary to them, or with them. For when it is directly contrary the Birds are very hardly dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to bear up againſt it: When it blows juſt behind them, it brings the ſent of the Man or the Whelp into their Noſthrils. Wherefore (as we ſaid) the Channels are drawn either on the North or South end of the Pool, becauſe the Weſt-wind with us as it is the moſt boiſterous, ſo is it by far the moſt frequent of all.</p>
                           <p>Of the <hi>Coy-ducks</hi> ſome fly forth and bring home with them wild ones to the Pool, others have the outmoſt joynt or pinion of their Wings cut off, ſo that they cannot, fly, but abide always in the Pool. The Fowlers houſe is to be covered with trees and reeds, and hid as much as poſſible.</p>

It is long-bodied: Its whole Rump black: Its Back brown, the edges of the feathers being of a whitiſh red: Its Chin and Cheeks white, ſpeckled with ſmall brown ſpecks. Its head from blue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to black, the edges of the feathers being of an aſh-colour in the Throat, and of a whitiſh red near the Breaſt. The lower part of the Neck and upper part of the Breaſt and Shoulders are covered with a moſt beautiful Plumage particoloured of black and white. The extreme edges and as it were fringes of the feathers are red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, then a black line of a ſemicircular figure encompaſſes the tip of the feather, running parallel to its edges; within this is included another ſemicircular white line parallel to it, and in the white again a black. The Breaſt is white: The Belly darker, with tranſverſe black ſpots. Under the Tail the feathers are croſſed with brown. The leſſer covert-feathers under the Wings and the interiour baſtard Wing are purely white. The ſides are curiouſly variegated with alternate black and white lines. The Tail is ſhort, ſcarce appearing beyond the feathers incumbent on it, round-pointed, made up of ſixteen feathers with ſharp tips, of a white colour, eſpecially on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſide, for the two middle ones above are of a dark aſh-colour: In the reſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the outmoſt, there is ſomething of red mingled with the white: The edges of all are whitiſh.</p>
                           <p>Each Wing hath twenty ſix quils, of which the firſt ten are brown; the three next tipt with white: The four following have their outer Webs black, their tips alſo being whitiſh: In the three ſucceeding the inner Web of the feather is wholly white:
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:63869:194"/>
The four next the body are of a cinereous or reddiſh brown. The feathers of the ſecond row, incumbent on the white quils, have their exteriour Webs of a black pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh ſhining colour. In the third row are ſpots of red ſcattered.</p>
                           <p>Its Bill is like that of the common <hi>Duck</hi> or <hi>Teal,</hi> flat, broad, with a hook or nail at the end: The lower Mandible inclines to a Saffron colour; of the upper the ſides are of the ſame colour, the middle part black: The Noſthrils great.</p>

                           <p>The Female hath the ſame ſpots in the Wings, but far duller colours; wants the black colour on the Rump, the feathers there growing having pale red edges; as have alſo thoſe on the Back and Neck. It wholly wants thoſe elegant ſemicircular black and white lines and ſpots in the Neck and Breaſt feathers, and the ſtrakes under the Wings.</p>

                           <p>IT weighs twenty two ounces: Its length from Bill to Feet is twenty inches. The Head and upper end of the Neck are red. The crown towards the Bill is of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute colour, from red inclining to a yellowiſh white. The upper part of the Breaſt and ſides as far as the Wings is beautified with a very fair tincture of a red Wine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, with ſmall tranſverſe black lines. The ſcapular feathers, and thoſe on the ſides under the Wings are very curiouſly varied with narrow tranſverſe black and white waved lines. The middle of the Back is brown, the edges of the feathers being cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous, eſpecially towards the Tail. The feathers behind the Vent, next the Tail are black: The Breaſt and Belly white, with a little mixture of yellow. On both ſides under the Legs are ſpots of a reddiſh brown: Under the Tail are white feathers alike ſpotted, mingled with the black. The Tail is ſharp pointed, and conſiſts of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen feathers, of which the ſix outer on each ſide are brown, their exteriour edges being whitiſh; the two middle ones are black, with a mixture of aſh-colour.</p>
                           <p>Of the quil-feathers the ten outmoſt are brown: The next ten have white tips, and among them the fifteenth, ſixteenth, ſeventeenth, and eighteenth have their outer webs firſt of a black purpliſh colour, then as far as they appear beyond the covert-feathers of a lovely blue. In the eighteenth feather the exteriour half of the outer web is of a purpliſh black, the interiour toward the bottom is cinereous: But along the border of the black are ſmall white ſpots from the white tip to the bottom. The twentieth feather is all of a pale or white aſh-colour: The twenty firſt and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:63869:195"/>
twenty ſecond are white about the edges, black in the middle along the ſhaft. The ſmall covert-feathers of the Wings are of a light brown or dark aſh-colour; but thoſe that cover the quils from the tenth to the twentieth are particoloured of brown, white, and cinereous.</p>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> in this and other Birds is, in my opinion, more particular and minute in deſcribing the colours of each ſingle feather of the Wings and Tail than is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; ſith in theſe things nature doth as they ſay ſport her ſelf, not obſerving exactly the ſame ſtrokes and ſpots in the feathers of all Birds of the ſame ſort.</p>
                           <p>In the ſtructure of the Mouth, Tongue, and Head, it differs little from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wild <hi>Duck,</hi> unleſs perchance the Head be leſs in proportion to the body. The upper Mandible of the Bill is of a lead-colour, with a round black nail at the end. The Feet from a dusky white incline to a lead-colour. The Claws are black: The outmoſt Toe longer than the inmoſt: The back-toe ſhort.</p>
                           <p>It feeds upon graſs and weeds growing in the bottoms of Rivers, Lakes, and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of water, alſo upon Whilks, Periwinkles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it finds there.

                           <p>IT is of the bigneſs of the common <hi>Wigeon;</hi> of twenty four ounces weight: twenty eight inches long from Bill to Tail: From tip to tip of the Wings extended thirty ſeven inches broad.</p>
                           <p>Its Head is ſlender, its Neck long for this kind: Its Bill from the tip to the angles of the mouth two inches and an half, of equal breadth almoſt throughout; the nether Mandible wholly black, the upper partly blue, partly black, <hi>viz.</hi> black in the middle, on the ſides beneath the Noſthrils blue: Black alſo at the corners of the mouth, at the very tip, and in the lower edges near the tip. The colour of the Plumage on the whole Head is ferrugineous or brown, behind the Ears tinctured with a light pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Beyond the Ears on each ſide from the hinder part of the Head begins a line of white which paſſes down the ſides of the Neck to the Throat. All the feathers between or adjacent to theſe lines are black: Under the black the Neck is aſh-coloured, then curiouſly varied with tranſverſe black and white lines, as is alſo almoſt the whole Back. The long ſcapular feathers are black in their middle parts, but the exteriour have their outer Webs almoſt to the ſhafts black, their inner (which are much the narrower) varied with white and black [brown] lines. All the nether part, Neck, Breaſt, Belly, to the very Vent is white. Yet in the lower Belly the white is a little darkned with a mixtue of cinereous. The feathers under the Tail are black.</p>
                           <p>As for the Wings, the ten outmoſt quils and moſt of the covert-feathers are of a dark cinereous [In ſome Birds the interiour edges of the ſeventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth quils are white.] The ſecond decad of quils is particoloured; for the tips of all are white, [or from white red] then in the outer Web ſucceeds a black line, the remaining part thereof, as far as appears beyond the incumbent feathers being of a gliſtering purple, or purpliſh blue colour: The interiour Webs of all are of the ſame colour with the reſt of the feathers. Of the following the exteriour Webs are cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous, the interiour black. The covert feathers of the ſecond row immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on the ſecond decad of quils have their tips of a fair red or <hi>Lion-</hi>colour. The long feathers covering the Thighs are elegantly varied with black and white tranſverſe lines, beneath which the Plumage is yellow.</p>
                           <p>The Tail is made up of ſixteen feathers, all aſh-coloured excepting their exteriour edges, which are whitiſh. The two middlemoſt run out into very long and ſharp points, being produced two inches and an half beyond the reſt: Whence alſo this Bird is in ſome places of <hi>England</hi> called the Sea-pheaſant.</p>
                           <p>Its feet are of a lead-colour, darker about the joynts. It hath a ſmall Labyrinth, and a great Gall.</p>
                           <p>The Hen is like in colour to the common <hi>Wild-Duck,</hi> but fairer, and variegated with more full and lively white and brown colours. The Wing-feathers agree in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour with thoſe of the Cock, ſave that they are duller and leſs lively. The Belly is

reddiſh, the middle part of each ſingle feather being black. The Chin is white, with a tincture of red. The Back of a dark brown, with tranſverſe lines and beds of a pale red. The Breaſt of a ſordid white, and the Belly yet darker.</p>
                           <p>This Bird may be diſtinguiſhed from all others of the <hi>Duck-</hi>kind by the length of the middle feathers of its Tail as by certain and characteriſtic note.</p>

                           <p>THis, next to the <hi>Summer-Teal,</hi> is the leaſt in the <hi>Duck-</hi>kind; weighing only twelve ounces, extended in length from the tip of the Bill to the end of the Feet fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen inches; in breadth, meaſuring between the ends of the Wings ſpread, twenty four. Its Bill is broad, black, at the end ſomething reflected upwards: The Eyes from white incline to hazel-coloured. The Noſthrils are of an oval figure. The top of the Head, Throat, and upper part of the Neck of a dark bay or ſpadiceous co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. From the Eyes on each ſide to the back of the Head is extended a line of a dark, ſhining green. Between theſe lines on the back of the Head a black ſpot inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes. Under the Eyes a white line ſeparates the black from the red. The feathers inveſting the lower ſide of the Neck, the beginning of the Back, and the ſides under the Wings are curiouſly varied with tranſverſe waved lines of white and black. The region of the Craw in ſome is yellowiſh, elegantly ſpotted with black ſpots, ſo ſituate as ſomewhat to reſemble ſcales. The Breaſt and Belly are of ſordid white or grey colour. Under the Rump is a black ſpot encompaſſed with a yellowiſh colour.</p>
                           <p>Each Wing hath above twenty five quils. Of theſe the outmoſt ten are brown; the next five have white tips; under the white the exteriour Web of the Feather is black: In the ſixteenth begins the green, and takes up ſo much of the feather as we ſaid was black in the precedent three, The exteriour Web of the twenty third is black, with ſome yellowneſs on the edges. The covert-feathers of the black quils have white tips, of the green ones have tips of a reddiſh yellow: Elſe the Wings are all over brown [dusky.] The Tail is ſharp-pointed, three inches long, made up of ſixteen feathers, of a brown or dusky colour.</p>
                           <p>The Legs and Feet are of a pale dusky colour, the membrane connecting the Toes black: The inmoſt Toe the leaſt. The Back-toe hath no fin annexed. The Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe in the Cock is furniſhed with a Labyrinth: in the Hen we found none.</p>
                           <p>The Female differs from its Male in the ſame manner almoſt as the <hi>wild Duck</hi> does from the <hi>Mallard,</hi> having neither red nor green on the Head, nor black about its Rump: Nor thoſe ſine feathers variegated with white and black lines on the back and ſides.</p>
                           <p>This Bird for the delicate taſte of its fleſh, and the wholſom nouriſhment it affords the body, doth deſervedly challenge the firſt place among thoſe of its kind.</p>

The Cheeks beneath theſe white lines and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Throat were of a lovely red colour, as if daſhed with red wine, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving white ſpots or lines along the middle of each feather about their ſhafts. Under the Chin at the riſe of the lower Mandible is a great black ſpot. The whole Breaſt is curiouſly varied with black and duſty, tranſverſe, arcuate [elliptical] waved lines in each feather. The Belly in ſome is white, in others tinctured with yellow: But

toward the Vent are brown lines, and bigger ſpots under the Tail. The colour of the Back is brown, with a purpliſh gloſs. The Thighs are covered with feathers handſomly variegated with tranſverſe black and white lines.

                           <p>The Tail is ſhort [three inches] and when cloſed ending in a ſharp point, of a dusky or dark brown colour, conſiſting of fourteen feathers; the outmoſt feathers are varied with ſpots of a pale or whitiſh red. The ſoal of the foot is black.</p>

                           <p>This kind (ſo he proceeds) I think is alſo found in our Lakes, for I ſaw not long ſince a ſmall ſort of <hi>Duck</hi> taken in the beginning of <hi>January,</hi> little bigger than a <hi>Dob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chick,</hi> brown all over, having the Bill of a <hi>Duck,</hi> that is broad and brown: Alſo dusky coloured Legs and Feet; the Neck an hand-breadth long, the reſt of the body ſix inches.

It differs from our Country <hi>Ducks</hi> in theſe particulars: 1. That it is bigger. 2. It hath indeed a <hi>Ducks</hi> Bill, but black and hooked at the end. 3. Upon [or above] the Bill it carries a fleſhy creſt, broad, and almoſt round, of a black colour, remarkably ſpotted with white. The Creſt is of equal height. Between the Creſt and the Bill <hi>(viz.</hi> on the top of the Bill) is a tranſverſe hole of the bigneſs of a Peaſe, conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous on both ſides, which ſerves inſtead of Noſthrils. 4. The colour of the Legs and Feet is not red, but of a dusky aſh-colour. It is full of fleſh, and good meat. It is found every where about the Rivers.</p>
                           <p>I had another in all things like this, excepting that thoſe long feathers in the Wings were of a ſhining brown colour. I ſuppoſe this is the Male, the other the Female.</p>

                              </gap>, ſignifying, to ſwim: As <hi>Anas</hi> alſo by <hi>Varro</hi> is derived from <hi>no, nas,</hi> to ſwim. It is a Bird every where known, and therefore it would not be worth while to beſtow many words in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly deſcribing it. It is leſs than a <hi>Gooſe,</hi> almoſt as big as a <hi>Hen,</hi> but much lower, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a broad, flat Bill, a broad Back, ſhort Legs, ſituate backward, <hi>that in ſwimming it may more ſtrongly ſtrike the water with the finny oars of its Feet: As Ariſtotle</hi> rightly. Hereupon they become leſs convenient for walking, ſo that this Bird goes but ſlowly, and not without ſome difficulty. <hi>Ducks</hi> vary infinitely in colours, as do <hi>Hens,</hi> and other tame fowl.</p>
                           <p>Between the <hi>Duck</hi> and the <hi>Drake</hi> there is this difference, that he hath growing on his Rump certain erect feathers reflected backwards toward the Head, which ſhe hath not. The <hi>Duck</hi> lays twelve, fourteen, or more Eggs as big as <hi>Hens</hi> Eggs, and white, with a light tincture of blue or green, the Yolk being of a deeper and redder colour.</p>
                           <p>The beſt Phyſicians (ſaith <hi>Aldrovand)</hi> diſallow the fleſh of theſe Birds, becauſe they are hard and of difficult concoction, and agree not with the ſtomach: We rather think them diſagreeable to the ſtomach, for their moiſtneſs and clammineſs than for their hardneſs, whence alſo they are apt to produce excrementitious, groſs, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholic humours. The fleſh of wild <hi>Ducks</hi> is preferred before that of tame, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſavoury and wholſom.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Drake</hi> hath a certain bony veſſel or buble at the divarication of its Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, which we are wont to call a labyrinth; of the uſe whereof we have ſaid as much as we thought fit, in the firſt Book at the end of the ſecond Chapter.</p>

                           <p>IT is in this kind the biggeſt of all we have hitherto ſeen. The colour both of Male and Female is for the moſt part a purpliſh black.

                           <p>THeſe <hi>Ducks Aldrovand</hi> thus briefly deſcribes. They exceed ours in bigneſs of body. The Male alſo in this kind is bigger than the Female. It Bill where it joyns to the Head is very thick and tuberous; thence to the very tip it is continuedly narrower, till it ends in a ſharp and crooked hook: It is of a black colour excepting toward the end, where it hath a good large red ſpot, and in its beginning another ſmall one of the ſame colour, but more dilute. Its Head was black and tufted: Its Throat juſt under the Bill was powdered with whitiſh ſpecks. The Eyes yellow, wherein appeared many little ſanguine veins. The whole body almoſt was alſo black. The fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Back in the beginning, and alſo in the middle, were black, in the end green, or at leaſt black, with a tincture of green. In the Wings alſo and in the Tail were ſome green feathers to be ſeen, and one or two white ones, which made a kind of white ſpot. The Legs were very ſtrong, but ſhort, coming near to a Cheſnut colour, as did alſo the feet. The Female was leſs than the Male, and had a leſs tube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Bill, where it was joyned to the Head, marked with a pretty broad line, partly white, and partly red. Beſides, that ſpot we mentioned, which in the Bill of the Male was red, in the Bill of this was of an aſh-colour, wherewith ſomething of red was mixt: Elſe it was of a colour from black inclining to cinereous, if you except two whitiſh ſpots, which in the middle of the Bill turning one to another, each by it ſelf formed the letter C. It had no tuft on its black Head. Its Breaſt alſo was of the ſame colour, ſpotted with white pricks. The Back as in the Male, but the Wings were much greener than his, and ſpotted alſo with two white ſpots. In other particulars it diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red little or nothing from him.</p>

                           <p>THis kind of Duck <hi>Bellonius</hi> thus deſcribes. A few years agone a certain kind of <hi>Ducks</hi> began to be kept in <hi>France,</hi> of a middle ſize, between a <hi>Gooſe</hi> and a <hi>Duck,</hi> having a broken voice, as if it had diſtempered or ulcerated Lungs. Now there is ſo great plenty of them in our Country, that they are every where kept in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and publicly expoſed to ſale: For at great entertainments and Marriage Feaſts they are ſought for and deſired. They have ſhort Legs: The Male is bigger than the Female; and, as is uſual in other Birds, of a different colour, ſo that it is hard to aſcribe any certain colour to it, unleſs one would ſay that it comes near to a <hi>Duck-</hi>colour. They are for the moſt part either black or particoloured. They have a Bill in a
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:63869:198"/>
manner different from <hi>Geeſe</hi> and <hi>Ducks,</hi> hooked at the end, alſo ſhort and broad. In the Head riſes up ſomething of a red colour like a Creſt, but much different from a Cocks Comb. For it is a certain tuberous eminency, ſituate between the Noſthrils, exactly reſembling the figure of a red Cherry. The Temples near the Eyes are without feathers, the skin ſhewing like a red hide; of the ſame ſubſtance with that Cherry-like bunch between the Eyes: By which Marks I think it may be certainly known and diſtinguiſhed from other Birds. But this one thing may ſeem very ſtrange in this Bird, that it hath ſo great a privy member, that it is an inch thick, and of four or five inches length, and red like bloud. If it were not very chargeable many more of them would be kept than are: For if you give them but meat enough they will lay many Eggs, and in a ſhort time hatch a great number of Ducklings. Their fleſh is neither better nor worſe than that of a tame <hi>Gooſe</hi> or <hi>Duck.</hi>

Its Head is red like bloud, and ſo is a good part of the Neck adjoyning, on the back-ſide. All that red is a callous fleſh, and divided by inciſures; and where it ends at the Noſthrils, it lets down a Caruncle of a different figure from the reſt of the fleſh, like that of a <hi>Swans,</hi> contiguous [or joyned] to the Bill. Its Head is bare of feathers, and that part alſo of the Neck which is red, ſave that on the top of the Head, through the whole length of it, there is a creſt or tuft of feathers, which when it is angry it ſets up. Under the Eyes at the beginning of the Bill the skin is ſpotted with black ſpots placed in no order: Above the Eye alſo are one or two ſpots tending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The Eye is yellow, ſeparated from the reſt of the Head by a circle of black. Under the further end of the Eye backwards is a ſingular ſpot ſeparated from the reſt. The whole Bill is blue, only it hath a black ſpot at the tip. The feathers all along the reſt of the Neck are white. At the ſetting on of the Neck is a circle of black, ſpotted with a few white ſpots, and unequal, narrower below, broader above. Behind this circle the Plumage of all the lower Belly is white, of the upper ſide of body brown, but the white Plumage is divided at the top by that black circle. The ends of the Wings and the Tail are of a ſhining green like <hi>Cantharides.</hi> The skin of the Legs is brown, with light, circular inciſures. The membrane between the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of the Toes is more pale, ſprinkled with two or three brown ſpots, placed in no order, except in the left foot, where there are ſix ſet in arrow alongſt the outmoſt Toe. It walks ſoftly by reaſon of the heavineſs of its body. Its voice is not like that of other <hi>Ducks,</hi> but hoarſe, like a mans that hath his Jaws and Throat ſwoln with a cold. The Cock is bigger than the Hen. The Hen is like the Cock, but hath not ſuch variety of colours. It gets its living out of muddy waters, and delights in ſuch other things as the common <hi>Duck</hi> doth.</p>

                              <hi>There are many things in this deſcription, which do perſwade me, that this Bird alſo is no other than our</hi> Muſcovy Duck: <hi>As, equal bigneſs, naked tuberous fleſh about the Bill, a hoarſe voice, the Cock being bigger than the Hen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nor is the diverſity of colours a ſufficient argument of the contrary: For that they (as we have often ſaid) in tame Birds of the ſame kind vary infinitely.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Bird is deſervedly famous for its notable folly. It is not afraid of them that go to catch it, but ſits ſtill with a great deal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence till they lay their hands upon it, not offering to fly away, but only ſeeming to wonder what they intend to do. It is a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowl, and feeds upon fiſh. It hath the cry of a <hi>Jay;</hi> is of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a <hi>Mag-pie,</hi> of the ſhape and colour of the <hi>Gull,</hi> excepting that part of the forehead next the Bill, which is cinereous; whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed. Its Bill is three inches long, ſlender, round, and ſtreight, only a little crooked near the tip: Its Legs and Feet (which are like thoſe of other whole-footed Birds) black: Its Pupil is alſo black, but the membrane about the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil grey.</p>
               <p>The tameneſs of the Birds of the Iſland <hi>Cerne</hi> is well known and celebrated. They alight upon the heads and ſhoulders of the Mariners that go aſhore there, as it were upon trees, and ſuffer themſelves without difficulty to be caught, coming readily to hand.</p>

                  <hi>Of the Bird called</hi> Daie <hi>laying great Eggs.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Bird called <hi>Daie</hi> is remarkable for the extraordinary and unuſual nature or manner of its Eggs and Young. It is not bigger than a <hi>Pigeon,</hi> and tolerable good meat. For its Neſt it ſcrapes a hole with its Feet and Tail in ſandy grounds four ſpans deep; where when the rains fall it lays its Eggs, (which are bigger than Gooſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eggs, almoſt as broad as ones fiſt, called by the Natives <hi>Tapun)</hi> fifty or more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, being of a groſs and fat ſubſtance, without any Yolk in them, which roaſted or boiled are good wholſom food, but fried <note n="*" place="margin">Coarſe.</note> tough, bad, and of hard concoction.</p>
               <p>It is very ſtrange [more ſtrange I dare ſay than true] that ſo little a Bird ſhould lay ſo great Eggs, and ſo many together, and in ſuch deep vaults under ground, and that being there hidden they ſhould be hatched without being ever ſitten upon or che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the old ones, and that the Young once hatched ſhould of themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fly away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I dare boldly ſay that this Hiſtory is altogether falſe and fabulous. For though ſome Birds lay very great Eggs (as for example,</hi> Puffins, Guillemots, Razor-bills, <hi>&amp;c.) ſome alſo build in holes under ground. Yet ſuch lay but one Egg, not a great many before they ſit. Neither do I think that there is any Bird in the world whoſe Eggs want the white.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>A Little body contains a great ſpirit and courage. There is a very ſmall Bird <hi>(Guitguit</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> call it) like the <hi>Wren,</hi> of a green colour, and ſweet-taſted fleſh. Such is the wonderful force of nature, that this Bird, as little as it is, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:63869:200"/>
next to nothing, dares ſet upon and purſue whole flocks of <hi>Ravens,</hi> and forces them to hide themſelves from it, and to take ſhelter among the Reeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſuppoſe that this ſtory is feigned in imitation of what the Ancients have delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the</hi> Wren, viz. <hi>that with great courage [indeed fool-hardineſs] ſhe dares enter combat with the</hi> Eagle.</p>

                  <hi>HEatototl</hi> or the Wind-bird is alſo worthy to be beheld. It is adorned with a great orbicular creſt, ſtanding up like a crown, and a little whitiſh. Its Breaſt from brown inclines to cinereous: Its Belly is white, and Feet flat: Its Legs and the feathers growing about them fulvous. Its Tail is round underneath varied with white and a ſooty colour, but above brown: Its Wings underneath are white, aſh-coloured and ſooty, above black, yet with ſome white feathers interſperſed. In other reſpects it is of the ſame nature with other Water-fowl, and like to the other <hi>Heatototle,</hi> which is ſomething leſs then a <hi>tame Duck,</hi> with a black, ſlender round Bill, and near the end wreathen: Its feathers underneath white, but above near the Thighs fulvous.

They have by the inſtinct of nature ſuch knowledge of their riches, that once ſticking to the Birdlime, they remain ſtill and quiet, not ſtrugling at all, that they may not mar or injure their feathers. The beauty whereof they are ſo in love with, that they chuſe rather to be taken and killed, than by endeavouring to get their liberty do any thing that may deface or prejudice them.

               <p>I Saw, heard, and admired a ſmall Bird brought to <hi>Madrid,</hi> the Queen of all ſinging Birds, that could command any voice or tune. The Indians from its multiplicity of notes call it <hi>Cencontlatolli</hi> or four hundred tongues. It is not bigger than a <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> white underneath, brown above, with ſome black and white feathers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt; eſpecially next the Tail, and about the Head which is encircled with the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſilver crown. It is kept in Cages to delight the ear, and for a natural rarity or rather wonder. It excells all Birds in ſweetneſs and variety of Song, and perfect command of its voice; imitating the note of any ſort of Bird whatſoever, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling its exemplar. It goes far beyond the <hi>Nightingale.</hi> I my ſelf kept it a long time, It is content with any meat; it loves hot Countries, but can abide temperate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tzaupan</hi> is like to this. Some ſuſpect that it is only the Hen of the ſame ſort, they being equal in bigneſs, ſinging alike, and agreeing in ſhape, ſaving that the feathers underneath are white, cinereous, and black, thoſe above ſad-coloured, black and white.</p>

It lives in the Mountains, and flies low: Being kept in a Cage it prattles or chatters prettily. It is eaſily brought up, for it is wont to feed upon bread made of <hi>Tlaolli,</hi> Worms, Gnats, and other Inſects. It is taken both in hot and cold Countries; it feeds fat, and affords no contemptible nouriſhment.

               <p>
                  <hi>THe Birds of the firſt and ſecond Claſſis are inſerted already into this work in their proper places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third <hi>Claſſis</hi> or rank <hi>(ſaith the Author)</hi> I place three Species different in ſhape, but in this quality very near of kin that they preſage ſtorms and tempeſts, and abide only far out at Sea. The biggeſt of theſe is much about the bigneſs of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Pullet, [or middle-ſized Hen,] of the ſhape of a <hi>Falcon.</hi> It is commonly, and not improperly, called <hi>Haffhert, i. e.</hi> The <hi>Sea-horſe.</hi> It is all over of an aſh-colour, and every where ſpotted with white; it hath a crooked Beak like a <hi>Falcons,</hi> but ſhorter. At the ſight thereof the Fiſhermen are horribly afraid, as they are alſo at the appearance of the two following, and make to the Shoar as faſt as they can, being ſure that there is a dangerous tempeſt at hand.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, called <hi>Stormfinck,</hi> is a little bigger than a <hi>Sparrow.</hi> This alſo is all grey, but without ſpots, having a very ſlender Bill. You might with better reaſon term this <hi>Pegaſus</hi> than the former: For that you ſhall to admiration ſee it with incredible velocity run upon the very Waves, croſſing of them as ſwift as the Wind, being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on like a ſtorm, as its name imports. If flocks of theſe draw near to any Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels at Sea; experienced Mariners know they muſt preſently lowr their Sails. This Bird ſeems to have ſome affinity with that which <hi>Oviedus</hi> mentions in his fourteenth Book of the <hi>natural and general Hiſtory of the Indies,</hi> about the beginning of the firſt Chapter, telling us, that the Mariners call it <hi>Patines:</hi> It being of equal velocity in flying even in a troubled and tempeſtuous Sea, ſo that one would think it ran with a ſwift courſe over the tops of the Waves.</p>
               <p>The third Species named <hi>Barnfiard,</hi> is equal to a <hi>Sparrow,</hi> white under the Breaſt, with the Neck and Back black: Its Beak is alſo black, and ſomewhat broad: Its Feet red: This is as ſwift in ſwimming as the <hi>Stormfinck</hi> in running. Where theſe three kinds breed their Young is not known. Whence, in my opinion, among all that we have enumerated they ſeem to come neareſt to the deſcription of the <hi>Halcyon;</hi> though in colour they do not altogether agree with <hi>Plinies</hi> deſcription.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the fifth rank remain to be deſcribed two different ſorts of <hi>wild Geeſe;</hi> the former whereof, called <hi>Helſingegnaas,</hi> hath a black Head and Neck encompaſſed with a white ring, a white Breaſt, grey Wings, a blue Back, and red Feet. In bigneſs it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to a Duck: The other ſort <hi>[Erandgaas]</hi> is a little leſs than a <hi>wild Gooſe.</hi> Its Head is grey: Its Neck compaſſed with a circle of red: Its Breaſt grey, in like
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:63869:205"/>
manner its Wings and Neck: Its Feet red. Theſe kinds of <hi>Geeſe</hi> are very rarely ſeen in the <hi>Ferroyer</hi> Iſlands, nor do they breed there. Whence they come, and whither they go no man knows. But the Inhabitants have a ſuperſtitious conceit, grounded upon long experience, that when they do appear they portend a change of Magiſtracy of Government. Beſide theſe here is alſo plenty of common <hi>wild Geeſe.</hi>

                  <hi>Geſners Wood-Crow. Aldrov.</hi> lib. 19. cap. 57.</head>
               <p>OUr <hi>Wood-crow</hi> is of the bigneſs of a Hen, black all the body over, if you behold it at a diſtance. But if you view it near hand, eſpecially in the Sun, the black ſeems to be mingled with green. Its Feet are almoſt like a Hens, but longer: Its Toes divided: Its Tail not long. It hath a Creſt hanging down backwards from the Head, which I know not whether it be in all Birds of this ſort, and always. Its Bill is red, long, and fit to thruſt into the narrow chinks and holes of the Earth, Trees, Walls, and Rocks, to fetch out Grubs and Inſects lurking there, upon which it feeds. Its Legs are long, and of a dark red. I hear that it feeds upon Graſhoppers, Crickets, little Fiſhes, and Frogs. It builds for the moſt part in the high Walls of demoliſhed or ruinous Towers, which are common in the mountainous parts of <hi>Switzerland.</hi> In the ſtomach of one diſſected, beſides other Inſects I ſometimes found very many of thoſe which eat the roots of corn, eſpecially <hi>Millet;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> call them <hi>Curtillas,</hi> our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen [the <hi>Germans] Tuaren,</hi> from the ſite of their Feet, as I conjecture. They eat alſo thoſe Grubs of which the <hi>May-flies</hi> are bred. They flie very high: They lay two or three Eggs. The firſt of all (as far as I know) fly away about the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> if I be not miſtaken. Their Young taken out of the Neſt before they can fly may eaſily be fed, and made ſo tame, as to fly out into the fields and return of their own accord. The young ones are commended for good meat, and counted a dainty: Their fleſh is ſweet, and their bones tender. Thoſe that take them out of the Neſts are wont to leave one in each, that they may the more willingly return the following year. They are called by our Country-men, <hi>Wald-rapp,</hi> that is <hi>Wood-Crows,</hi> becauſe they are wont to live in woody, mountainous, and deſert places: Where they build in Rocks, or old forſaken Towers: Wherefore alſo they are called <hi>Steinrapp,</hi> and elſewhere [in <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Stiria] Clauſzrapp,</hi> from the Rocks, or Crags, and ſtraits between Mountains, which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>Clauſen,</hi> that is, encloſed places, wherein they build their Neſts.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> ſuſpects this Bird to be no other than the <hi>Coracias</hi> or <hi>Pyrrhocorax:</hi> But if it be rightly deſcribed its bigneſs and the creſt on its head forbid it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Some general Rules and Obſervations for a Falconer or Oſtrager to remark and practiſe, collected out of</hi> Carcanus <hi>and other Authors.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. A Falconer out to learn and mark the quality and mettle of his Hawks, to know which he ſhall fly with early, and which late.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He muſt be fond of his Hawk, patient with her, and careful to keep her clean of Lice and Mites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He muſt rather keep his Hawk high and full of fleſh than poor and low, being when poor much more ſubject to infirmities.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Every night after flying he muſt give her Caſting, ſometimes Plumage, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pellets of Cotton, or the like: Sometimes alſo he muſt give her Phyſic, as by her caſting and mewts he ſhall perceive her to need it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Every night he muſt make the place very clean under her Pearch, that he may know aſſuredly whether ſhe hath caſt or not; and by her caſting whether ſhe needs ſcouring, Stones, or the like.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He muſt remember every day to weather his Hawk in the Evening; excepting ſuch days wherein ſhe hath bathed; after which in the Evening ſhe ſhould be put in a warm room, on a Pearch with a Candle burning by her, where ſhe muſt ſit unhooded if ſhe be gentle, to the end ſhe may trick her ſelf, and rejoyce by enoiling her after the water, before ſhe fly again. In the morning early he muſt alſo ſet her out to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where ſhe may caſt, if ſhe hath not done it already, and there keep her hooded till ſuch time as ſhe goes into the field.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In feeding his Hawk he muſt beware of giving her two ſorts of meat at one time; and have a care that what he give her be perfectly ſweet.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If he have occaſion to go abroad, let him not leave his Hawk tied on too high a Pearch, for fear of bating and hanging by the heels, whereby ſhe may ſpoil her ſelf. Two Hawks muſt not be ſet ſo near as to approach one another, for fear of crabbing.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. He ought to carry into the field with him mummy in powder, with other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; for frequently the Hawk meets with many accidents, as bruiſes at encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor muſt he be unfurniſhed with Aloes waſht, Cloves, Saffron, Caſting, Cryance, and ſuch like neceſſary implements, as coping Irons to cope the Beak and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, if need be.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. He muſt be able to make his Lures, Hoods, Jeſſes, Bewets, and other needful furniture.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>A Falcon newly taken ſhould be ſeel'd in ſuch ſort, that when the ſeeling begins to ſlacken, ſhe may ſee forwards the meat that is ſtreight before her, for ſhe is better content when ſhe ſees it ſo, than if ſhe ſaw it ſideways, or looking back. And ſhe ſhould not be ſeel'd too ſtreight.</p>
                     <p>Such a Hawk ſhould have all new furniture, as new Jeſſes (maild) a Leaſe made with a button at the end, and new Bewets. You muſt alſo have a little round ſtick hanging in a ſtring, with which you muſt frequently ſtroak your Hawk. For the more ſhe is handled, the ſooner and better will ſhe be reclaimed and manned, ſhe muſt have two good Bells, that ſhe may the better be found and heard when ſhe ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth or ſcratteth. Her Hood muſt be well faſhioned, raiſed and boſſed againſt her Eyes, deep, and yet ſtreight enough beneath, that it may better abide on her head without hurting her. You muſt alſo a little cope her Beak and Talons, but not ſo near as to make them bleed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="401" facs="tcp:63869:207"/>
The <hi>Soar Falcon,</hi> which hath been timely taken, and already paſſed the Seas, is held by ſome to be the beſt <hi>Falcon,</hi> and alſo hard to be won and manned: Such an one you muſt feed with warm meat, as Pigeons, and ſuch like quick birds, until ſhe be full gorged, twice a day for three days. For you muſt not all at once break her off her accuſtomed diet, which was warm meat.</p>
                     <p>When you feed her you muſt whoop and lure as you do when you call a Hawk, that ſhe may know when you will give her meat.</p>
                     <p>You muſt unhood her gently, giving her two or three bits, and putting on her Hood again give her as much more. Be ſure that ſhe be cloſe ſeeled. After three days, if you perceive her feed with a good appetite, begin to abate her meat, giving her but little at once and often till Evening, and bear her late on your fiſt before you go to bed, ſetting her near you, that you may wake her often in the night. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day take her on your fiſt again, with ſome quick bird. After two or three nights, when you find ſhe begins to grow gentle, and feed eagerly on good meat, change her diet, giving her ſheeps heart, often, but little at once.</p>
                     <p>Late at Even let her ſeeling thread a little looſe, ſpouting water in her face, that ſhe may jeouk the leſs, and watching her all night hold her upon your fiſt unhooded. But if ſhe ſee any thing ſhe miſlikes, and makes ſhew of being afraid, carry her into ſome dark place, where you have no more light but to hood her again. Afterwards give her ſome beaching of good meat; and watch her divers nights together till ſhe be reclaimed, and jeouk upon the fiſt by day. Although to let her jeouk alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the night will make her the ſooner manned. In the Morning by break of day give her warm meat. When ſhe begins to be acquainted you may unhood her in the day time far from company; at taking off, and after putting on the Hood, giving her a bit or two of meat. For to unhood her in a place where ſhe may be frayed is enough to mar her at firſt. When ſhe begins to be acquainted with company, and is ſharp-ſet, unhood her, and give her a bit or two, holding her right againſt your face, for that will cauſe to dread no company. At night cut the thread wherewith ſhe was ſeeled. You need not watch her, but only ſet her by you, and wake her two or three times in the night. For over-watching is not good, if ſhe may be reclaimed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. When you have brought her thus far, then give her waſht meat, laid in clear water half a day, and beach her in the morning, that ſhe may always have ſomewhat in her gorge. Cauſe her to feed in company, giving her about Sun-riſing the wing of a Hen or Pullet, and at Evening take the foot of a Hare or Coney, chopt off above the joynt, and flay it, cutting away the Claws; ſteep the skin in fair water (preſſing and wringing it a little) the which you ſhall give her with the joynt of the pinion of a Hens wing. Give your Hawk no feathers till ſhe be throughly reclaimed: For till then ſhe dares not caſt on the fiſt: and on the fiſt you muſt bear her till ſhe be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manned. When ſhe makes ſemblance to caſt, unhood her gently by the taſſel of the hood. [You may give her two days waſht meat, and the third Plumage, as ſhe is clean or foul within.] When ſhe hath caſt, hood her again, giving her nothing to eat till ſhe hath gleamed after her caſting; but when ſhe hath caſt and gleamed give her a beaching of hot meat in company, by two or three bits at once: And at Evening make her plume a Hens wing, being in company alſo.</p>
                     <p>If the feathers of her caſting be foul or ſlimy, and of a yellowiſh colour, be ſure to cleanſe her with waſht meat and caſting: If ſhe be clean within, give her not ſo ſtrong caſting as Hares feet, but the pinion of an old Hens wing, or the neck-bone chopt four or five times between the joynts, waſhed and ſteeped in fair water.</p>

                     <head>§. II. <hi>How to lure a Hawk lately manned.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HAving well reclaimed her, throughly manned her and made her eager and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, then you may venture to feed her on the lure.</p>
                     <p>But before you ſhew her the lure you muſt conſider theſe three things: 1. That ſhe be bold and familiar in company, and no ways afraid of Dogs and Horſes. 2. That ſhe be ſharp-ſet and hungry, regarding the hour of the Morning and Evening when you will lure her. 3. That ſhe be clean within. The Lure muſt be well garniſhed with meat on both ſides, and you muſt abſcond your ſelf when you would give her the length of the Leaſe. You muſt firſt unhood her, giving her a bit or two on the Lure, as ſhe ſitteth on your fiſt: Afterwards take the Lure from her, and ſo hide it that ſhe ſee it
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:63869:208"/>
not; and when ſhe is unſeized, caſt the Lure ſo near her that ſhe may catch it within the length of her Leaſe; uſe your voice according to the cuſtom of Falconers, and feed her upon the Lure on the ground, with the heart and warm thigh of a Pullet. Having ſo lured her at Evening give her but a little meat, and let this luring be ſo time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that you may give her Plumage, and the jack of a joynt.</p>
                     <p>In the Morning betimes take her on your fiſt, and when ſhe hath caſt and gleamed give her a little beaching of warm meat. Afterwards when it is time to feed her, take a Creance, and tie it to her Leaſe, and go into ſome pleaſant field or meadow, and give her a bit or two on the Lure; and if you find that ſhe is ſharp-ſet, and hath ſeized eagerly on the Lure, then give her ſome one to hold, to let her off to the Lure. Then unwind the Creance, and draw it after you a good way; and let him which holds the Hawk hold his right hand on the Taſſel of the Hawks hood in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo that he may unhood her as ſoon as you begin to lure: And if ſhe come well to the Lure, and ſtoop upon it roundly, and ſeize it eagerly, then let her eat two or three bits thereon. Then unſeize her and take her off the Lure, hood her, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her again to him that held her, and going further off lure her, feeding her as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the accuſtomed voice. Thus lure her every day further and further off, till ſhe is accuſtomed to come freely and eagerly to the Lure. After this lure her in company, but have a care that nothing affright her and when you have uſed her to the Lure on foot, then lure her on horſeback, which you may effect the ſooner, by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing horſemen to be about you when you lure her on foot: Alſo you may do it the ſooner by rewarding her upon the Lure on horſe-back among horſemen. When this way ſhe grows familiar, let ſome body on foot hold the Hawk, and he that is on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back muſt call and caſt the Lure about his head. Then muſt the holder take off the hood by the Taſſel: And if ſhe ſeize eagerly upon the Lure, without fear of man or horſe, then take off the Creance, and lure her looſe at a greater diſtance. And if you would have her love Dogs as well as the Lure, call Dogs about you when you feed her, or give her Tiring or Plumage.</p>

                     <head>§. III. <hi>Of bathing a Falcon lately reclaimed, and how to make her flying, and to hate the Check.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HAving weaned your Hawk from her ramageneſs, ſhe being both ways lured, throughly reclaimed, and likewiſe in good caſe, offer her ſome water to bathe her ſelf in, in a Baſon, wherein ſhe may ſtand up to the thighs, chuſing a temperate, clear day for that purpoſe. Having lured your Hawk, and rewarded her with warm meat, in the Morning carry her to ſome bank, and there hold her in the Sun till ſhe hath endewed her gorge, taking off her hood, that ſhe may preen and pick her ſelf: That being done hood her again, and ſet her near the Baſon, and taking off her hood let her bathe as long as ſhe pleaſes: After this take her up, and let her pick her ſelf as before, and then feed her. If ſhe refuſe the Baſon to bath in, ſhew her ſome ſmall Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Brook for that purpoſe. By this uſe of bathing ſhe gains ſtrength and a ſharp appetite, and thereby grows bold: But that day wherein ſhe batheth give her no waſht meat.</p>
                     <p>If you would make your Falcon upwards, the next day after ſhe hath bathed get on horſe-back, either in the Morning or Evening, and chuſe out ſome field wherein are no Rooks or Pigeons: Then take your Lure well garniſhed on both ſides, and having unhooded your Hawk give her a bit or two on the Lure, then hood her: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards go leiſurely againſt the Wind, then unhood her, and before ſhe bate, or find any Check in her eye, whiſtle her off from your fiſt fair and ſoftly. As ſhe flieth about you trot on with your horſe, and caſt out your Lure, not ſuffering her to fly long about you at firſt: Continue thus doing Morning and Evening for ſeven or eight days. But if you find your Hawk unwilling to fly about you, or ſtoop to the Lure, then muſt you let her fly with ſome Hawk that loves the company of others, and will not rove at any Change or Check: And that muſt firſt be done at a <hi>Partridge,</hi> for they will not fly far before the Hawk. If ſhe hath flown twice or thrice, caſt out the Lure, and reward her on horſe-back, feeding her up to a full gorge, on the ground, with good hot meat, to make her more couragious and reſolute in flying, and to return to you with a better will. If the fowl you flew her at be killed by another Hawk, let her feed with him a little, and then further reward her on the Lure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="403" facs="tcp:63869:208"/>
If you would have your Hawk prove upwards and high-flying, you muſt let her fly with ſuch as are ſo qualified. If ſhe love the company of others, and is taught to hold in the Head, then if the Fowl be in Pool, Pit, or Plaſh, caſt off your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flying Hawk, and let him that hath your new-lured Hawk get under the Wind, and when he ſeeth his advantage let him unhood her, and if ſhe bate, it is out of deſire to get up to the other Hawk. Let him then caſt her off, and before ſhe get up to the other, now near his full pitch, lay out the Fowl. If ſhe kill her Game reward her with the heart, and let her partake of the Breaſt with the other Hawk.</p>
                     <p>To take your Falcon from going off to any <hi>check,</hi> thus you muſt do. If ſhe hath killed a <hi>check,</hi> and hath feed thereon before you could come in, rebuke her not ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at firſt, but take her down to the Lure, give her a bit or two, hood her, and fly her not in three or four days; and if you do, let it be where no <hi>checks</hi> are: But if you come in before ſhe hath taſted the <hi>check</hi> ſhe hath killed, then take the Gall of a Hen and anoint the breaſt of the fowl ſhe hath killed [any other bitter thing will do, but you muſt not put on too much] and this will make her hate to go at <hi>Check</hi> again, hving little liſt to fly at ſuch a fowl.</p>

                     <head>§. IV. <hi>How to enſeam and make a Falcon, with her caſtings and ſcowrings,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>THe longer a Falcon hath been in the Falconers hands the harder ſhe is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeamed: Becauſe a Hawk that preyeth for her ſelf feeds cleaner and better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her nature; and hath the benefit of open air, and more exerciſe. When you draw your Hawk out of the Mew, if ſhe be greaſie, (which you ſhall know by the roundneſs of her thighs, and fulneſs of her body, the fleſh being round, and as high as her Breaſt bone,) and if ſhe be well mew'd, and have all her feathers full ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, then give her in the Morning a bit or two of hot meat: at night give her but little, unleſs it be very cold. If ſhe feed well and freely, then give her waſht meat thus prepared: Take the Wings of a Hen or Pullet for her dinner, and waſh them in two waters; and if you give her Hares fleſh or Beef, let it be waſhed in three wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: On the morrow give her the Leg of a Hen very hot, and at Noon meat tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately warm, a good gorge, then let her faſt until it be late in the Evening; and if ſhe have put over her meat, then give her a little warm meat, as you did in the Morning, and thus let her be dieted till it be time to give her Plumage: Which you ſhall know by three tokens. 1. By the tenderneſs and ſoftneſs of the fleſh at the end of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Wing, above what it was before ſhe eat waſht meat. 2. By the mewts being clean and white, the black thereof being right black, and not mingled with any foul thing or colour. 3. If ſhe be ſharp-ſet and plume eagerly. You may give her caſting of a Hares or Conies foot, as was before preſcribed, or the ſmall feathers on the pinion of an old Hens Wing.</p>
                     <p>Having ſet her on the Pearch, ſweep clean underneath, that you may ſee whether the mewt be full of ſtreaks, or skins, or ſlimy: If it be, then continue this ſort of caſting three or four nights together; but if you find the feathers digeſted and ſoft, and that her caſting is great, then take the Neck of an old Hen, and cut it between the joynts; then lay it in cold water, and give it your Falcon three nights together: In the day-time give her waſht meat after this caſting or plumage, as you ſhall ſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite: And this will bear all down into the pannel.</p>
                     <p>When you have drawn your Falcon out of the Mew, and her principal feathers be not yet full ſummed, but ſome in the quill, do not give her waſht meat, but quick birds, and good gorges thereof, and ſet her as much as may be in open places, for otherwiſe her feathers may chance to ſhrink in the quil and come to nothing.</p>
                     <p>When you feed your Falcon call and lure as if you called her to the Lure, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day profer her water, and every night give her caſtings accordingly as ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deweth. Take off her hood frequently in company, that you may hinder her from bating, holding the hood always ready by the Taſſel in your hand.</p>
                     <p>In the Evening by Candle-light take off her hood among company, till ſhe rowze and mewt; then ſet her on the Pearch, and not before, ſetting a light before her.</p>
                     <p>Every Falcon ought to have a <hi>Make-Hawk</hi> to teach her to hold in the head: If that will not do, cut off ſome part of her two principal feathers in each Wing, the long one, and that next to it, which will force her to hold in.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="404" facs="tcp:63869:209"/>
Be ſure to reward your Hawk well at the beginning, and let he feed well on the Quarry, which will ſo encourage her that ſhe will have no fancy to go out to the Check. When ſhe is well in bloud and well quarried, then let her fly with other Hawks.</p>
                     <p>If you would make your Falcon to the Crane, her Lure ſhould be a counterfeit Crane. If you would make her to the Hare, her Lure ſhould be then a Hares Skin ſtuft with ſome light matter: When ſhe is well lur'd, and you would enter her, tie the Hares Skin ſo ſtuft to the end of a Creance, and faſten it to your Saddle-pummel, by which means when you gallop it will reſemble a running Hare: Then unhood your Hawk, and cry, <hi>Back with the Dogs, Back with the Dogs.</hi> When you find ſhe hath ſeized it, let go your Creance, and ſuffer her to faſten thereon; then inſtantly reward her upon it, and encourage her as much as is poſſible.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe is well entred after this manner, take a living Hare and break one of her hinder Legs, and having before well acquainted your Falcon with your Dogs by cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual feeding among them, I ſay then put your Hare out in ſome fair place with your Dogs, and the Falcon will ſtoop and <hi>ruff</hi> her until the Dogs may take her; then take the Hare from the Dogs, and caſt her out to the Falcon, crying, <hi>Back, back there.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you would make your Hawk flying to the Partridge or Pheaſant after ſhe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and made, then every time you lure her caſt your Lure into ſome low Tree or Buſh, that ſhe may learn to take the Tree or <hi>Stand:</hi> If ſhe take the Stand before ſhe ſees the Lure, let her ſtand a while, and afterwards draw the Lure out before her, and cry with what words you have acquainted her to underſtand you by, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her well. After this manner ſhe will learn to take <hi>ſtand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Feed her always on the ground, or in ſome thick place, for in ſuch places ſhe muſt incounter with the Pheaſant at Pearch.</p>
                     <p>At firſt fly with her at young Pheaſant or Partridge, to encourage her by advantage, and afterwards at the old.</p>
                     <p>If a Falcon will not take <hi>ſtand,</hi> but keep on the Wing, then muſt you fly her in plain places where you may always ſee her upon you.</p>
                     <p>Draw your Falcon out of the <hi>Mew</hi> twenty days before you <hi>enſeam</hi> her: If ſhe <hi>truſs</hi> and <hi>carry,</hi> the remedy is to cope her <hi>Talons,</hi> her <hi>Powlſe</hi> and <hi>petty-ſingle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Never reward your Hawk upon River-fowl, but upon the Lure, that ſhe may the better know, love, and eſteem thereof.</p>
                     <p>The Crane ought to be flown at before Sun-riſing, for ſhe is a ſlothful Bird, and you may caſt off to her a <hi>Caſt</hi> or <hi>Leaſe</hi> of Falcons, or a Goſhawk from the Fiſt, without Dogs. You muſt fly but once a day at the Crane, after which you muſt reward your Hawk very well, ever ſuccouring her with the Greyhound, which is the beſt of Dogs for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Give your Falcon a Beaching very early in the Morning, and it will make her very eager to fly when it is time for it.</p>
                     <p>If you would have her a high-flying Hawk, you muſt not feed her highly, but ſhe ſhould be fed nine days together before Sun-riſing, and at night late in the cool of the Evening.</p>
                     <p>The Falcon will kill the Hern naturally if ſhe be a Peregrin or Traveller: Yet you will do well to give her <hi>Trains.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Falcon may fly ten times in a day at a River, if the Seaſon be not extreme, but more is inconvenient.</p>
                     <p>A Hawk ought to have forty Caſtings before ſhe be perfectly made. And indeed all Hawks ought to have Caſtings every night, if you would have them clean and ſound: For Hawks which have not this continual nocturnal Caſting will be ſurcharged with abundance of ſuperfluous Humours, which aſcending to the Brain, breed ſo great a diſturbance that they cannot fly ſo high as otherwiſe they would. And it is good to give them Tiring or Plumage at night, eſpecially Field-Hawks, but not Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Hawks, for fear of weakning their Backs.</p>
                     <p>When your Hawk hath flown or bated, feed her not ſo long as ſhe panteth, (but let her be firſt in breath again;) otherwiſe you may bring her into a diſeaſe called the <hi>Pantas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If a Falcon or other Hawk will not <hi>ſeiſe</hi> nor <hi>gorge,</hi> take the Quill of a Wild-gooſe, and tie it under her long<hi>-Single;</hi> then will ſhe <hi>ſeiſe</hi> and <hi>gripe.</hi> When ſhe beginneth to ſeiſe, take away the ſaid Quill, and ſhe will ſeiſe long afterwards.</p>
                     <p>If you cannot give Covert to your Falcon or Goſhawk, then caſt her off with the Sun in her back.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>How to man, hood, and reclaim a Falcon according to an Italian Falconer, quoted by</hi> Turbervile.</head>
                  <p>LEt his <hi>Jeſſes</hi> and <hi>Bewets</hi> be of good Leather, having Bells big and ſhril according to the proportion of the Hawk, with a Hood that is boſſed at the Eyes, and ſizable for the Head.</p>
                  <p>He muſt uſe his Hawk in ſuch manner that he may make her grow familiar with him alone, or in company, and to that end he muſt often unhood and hood her again.</p>
                  <p>In nine nights the Falconer ought not to let his Hawk <hi>jouk</hi> at all, nor ſuffer her to pearch, but keep her during that time continually on his Fiſt.</p>
                  <p>When the Falconer would call his Hawk, let him ſet her on the Pearch, unhood her, and ſhew her ſome meat within his Fiſt, call her ſo long till ſhe come to it, then feed her therewith: If ſhe come not, let her ſtand without food till ſhe be very ſharp ſet. Obſerve this order for about nine days.</p>
                  <p>When you would lure her, give her ſome man to hold, and call her with a Lure well garniſhed with meat on both ſides, and give her a bit: Uſe her to this ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days, then cauſe her to be held farther from you, and caſt the Lure about your head, and throw it on the ground a little way from you: if ſhe come to it roundly, reward her bountifully, walking ſoftly about her while ſhe is feeding on the Lure, and uſing your voice. Having uſed her to this ſome certain days, take your Lure gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as aforeſaid, and every day call her to you as far as ſhe may well ſee or hear you, and let her be looſe from all her furniture, without <hi>Loins</hi> or <hi>Creance.</hi> If ſhe come free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reward her, and ſtop her now and then in her feeding, for that will make her come the better. Call her alſo ſometimes on horſeback. After you have thus uſed her a month, or till ſhe will come freely to you, you may do well to ſtop the Lure upon her ſometimes, and let her fly upon you. Here note, it is requiſite to bathe her before you take this courſe, leſt when ſhe is at liberty ſhe <hi>rangle</hi> to ſeek water, and in the mean time you loſe your Hawk; wherefore bathe her every ſeven or eight days, for her nature requireth it.</p>
                  <p>When you have thus manned, reclaimed, and lured your Hawk, go out with her into the Fields, and whiſtle her off your Fiſt, ſtanding ſtill to ſee what ſhe will do, and whether ſhe will <hi>rake</hi> out or not: But if ſhe fly round about you, as a good Hawk ought to do, let her fly a Turn or two, and fling her out the Lure, and let her <hi>foot</hi> a Chicken or Pullet, and having killed it, let her feed thereon.</p>
                  <p>Unhood he often as you bear her, continue ſo doing till ſhe hath endewed and mewted ſufficiently.</p>
                  <p>Your Hawk being thus made and mann'd, go abroad with her every Morning when it is fair, and let the place where you intend to fly her be plaſhy, or ſome narrow Brook; and when you caſt her off, go into the Wind ſo far that the Fowl may not diſcover you. When ſhe is caſt off, and beginneth to recover her <hi>Gate,</hi> make then to the Brook or Plaſh where the Fowl lie, always making your Hawk to <hi>lean</hi> in upon you: And when you ſee her at a reaſonable pitch, (her Head being in) lay out the Fowl, and land it if you can; and if you cannot, take down your Hawk, and let her kill ſome <hi>Train,</hi> to which end you muſt always carry ſome live Fowl with you, as a Duck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And having ſlipt one of her Wing-feathers, thruſt it through her <hi>Nares,</hi> and caſt her up as high as you can underneath your Hawk, that ſhe may the better know your hand. Never fly a young Hawk without ſome <hi>Train,</hi> that if ſhe fail to kill the wild Fowl, you may make her kill that.</p>
                  <p>If you would have your Hawk fly at one particular Fowl more than at another, you wuſt then feed her well upon a <hi>Train</hi> of the ſame kind, as thus: Take a Creance and tie that Fowl you would accuſtom her to fly to by the Beak, with meat on her back, and cauſe one to ſtand cloſe that ſhall hold the Creance; then ſtanding a far off unhood your Hawk, and let the Fowl be ſtirr'd and drawn with the Creance until your Hawk perceive it ſtir; and if ſhe <hi>foot</hi> it, make another <hi>Train</hi> thus: Take a living Fowl that can fly, half <hi>ſeel</hi> it, and caſt it out; then let your Hawk fly to it; and if ſhe kill it, reward her well upon it.</p>

                     <p>After they are entred to theſe and well in bloud, you may make them to the River going into ſome large field, where there be Crows, or ſome other great Fowl, with your Hawk on your fiſt; looſe her hood in a readineſs, drawing as near the Fowl as you can; and the firſt fowl that ſprings unhood her and let her fly from the fiſt to it; that it may draw the Hawk upwards. When ſhe is at a reaſonable pitch, throw her out a Duck or Mallard ſeel'd, with a feather through the <hi>Nares,</hi> and if ſhe kill it, then reward her well, and feed her upon it with as much favour as you can, always luring and crying to her to encourage her.</p>

                     <p>IF a Falconer chance to recover a Ramage-Hawk that was never handled before, let him immediately ſeel her, and at that inſtant put on her Jeſſes made of ſoft Leather, at the end thereof fix two Varvels, the one may bear your Coat of Arms, the other your Name, that if ſhe chance to be loſt, they that take her up may know where to return her: Put her on alſo a pair of Bells with two proper Bewets. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus furniſhed her, you muſt begin her manning by gentle handling. To avoid the danger of her Beak, you muſt have a ſmooth ſtick about half a foot in length, with which you muſt ſtroak your Hawk about the Pinions of her Wings, and ſo downwards thwart her Train. If ſhe offer to ſnap at the Stick, withdraw not your hand, and let her bite thereon, the hardneſs whereof will ſoon make her weary of that ſport.</p>
                     <p>If you would man her well, you ſhould watch all the night, keeping her continually on your Fiſt.</p>
                     <p>You muſt teach her to feed ſeel'd; and having a great and eaſie Rufter-hood, you muſt hood and unhood her often, ſeel'd as ſhe is, handling her gently about the Head, <hi>coying</hi> her always when you unhood her, to the intent ſhe may not be diſpleaſed with her Keeper.</p>
                     <p>Let her plume and tire ſometimes upon a Wing on your Fiſt, keeping her ſo day and night, without perching, until ſhe be weary, and will ſuffer you to hood her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtirring.</p>
                     <p>If your Hawk be ſo rammage that ſhe will not leave her ſnapping or biting, then take a little <hi>Aloes ſocotrina,</hi> and when ſhe offers to ſnap, give it her to bite; the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs whereof will quickly make her leave that ill quality.

                     <p>HAving ſeel'd your Hawk, fit her with a large eaſie Hood, which you muſt take off and put on very often, watching her a night or two, handling her frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gently about the Head as aforeſaid. When you perceive ſhe hath no averſion to the Hood, unſeel her in an evening by Candle-light, continue handling her ſoftly, often hooding and unhooding her, until ſhe takes no offence at the Hood, and will pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endure handling.</p>

                        <pb n="407" facs="tcp:63869:210"/>
Take this Obſervation by the way, that it is the duty of a Falconer to be endowed with a great deal of Patience; and in the next place he ought to have a natural love and inclination to Hawks: without theſe two qualifications all the Profeſſors of this Art will prove <hi>Mar-Hawks</hi> inſtead of good Falconers.</p>
                     <p>But to return where I left off: If your ſeeled Hawk feeds well, abides the Hood and handling without ſtriking or biting, then by Candle-light in an Evening unſeel her, and with your finger and ſpittle anoint the place where the Seeling-thread was drawn through; then hood her, and hold her on your Fiſt all night, often hooding, unhooding, and handling her, ſtroaking her gently about the Wings and Body, giving her ſometimes a bit or two, alſo Tiring or Plumage. Being well reclaimed from ſtriking and biting at your hand, let her ſit upon a Pearch; but every night keep her on the Fiſt three or four hours, ſtroaking, hooding, and unhooding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: And thus you may do in the day-time, but in a Chamber apart, where ſhe may ſee no great light, till ſhe feed ſurely and eagerly without dread.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>HAving mann'd your Hawk ſo that ſhe feeds boldly, acquaint her with your Voice, Whiſtle, and ſuch words as Falconers uſe: You may do it by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeating them to her as ſhe is feeding on your Fiſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I think the beſt way of making her acquainted with them is by your experience and practice. If your Hawk be not eager or ſharp-ſet, waſh her meat ſometimes in fair water, and other whiles in Urine, wringing it a little, and feeding her with it for two or three gorges, intermitting a day or two.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe feeds boldly, and knows your Voice and Whiſtle, then teach her to know her Feeding, and to bate at it, in this manner. Shew her ſome meat with your right hand, crying and luring to her aloud: if ſhe bate or ſtrike at it, then let her quickly and neatly foot it, and feed on it for four or five bits. Do thus often, and ſhe will know her Feeding the better.</p>
                     <p>After this give her every night ſome Caſting either of Feathers, or Cotton with Cloves or Aloes wrapt up therein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Caſtings make a Hawk clean and eager.</p>

                     <p>IN the firſt place, to make her hardy, you muſt permit her to plume a Pullet or large Chicken in a place where there is not much light: Her Hood in a readineſs, you muſt have either of the aforeſaid alive in your hand; then kneeling on the ground, luring and crying aloud to her, make her plume and pull the Pullet a little; then with your teeth drawing the Strings, unhood her ſoftly, ſuffering her to pluck it with her Beak three or four times more; then throw out the Pullet on the ground, and encourage her to ſeiſe it. When you perceive ſhe breaks it and takes bloud, you muſt lure and cry aloud to her, encouraging her all the wayes imaginable: Then hood her gently, and give her Tiring of the Wing or Foot of the ſaid Pullet.</p>

                     <p>Having faſtned a Pullet unto your Lure, go apart, giving your Hawk unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who muſt draw looſe the ſtrings of her Hood in readineſs: Being gone a little way, take half the length of the String, and caſt it about your Head, luring with your voice at the ſame time; then let your Hawk be unhooded as you are throwing your Lure a little way from her, not ceaſing luring all the while. If ſhe ſtoop to the Lure and ſeize, ſuffer her to plume the Pullet, ſtill <hi>coying</hi> and luring with your voice; then let her feed on the Pullet upon the Lure: After that take her on your Fiſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>WHen your Hawk or Haggard-Falcon will come and ſtoop to the Lure round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any fear or coyneſs, you muſt put her on a great pair of Luring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells; the like you muſt do to a Soar-Hawk: By ſo much greater muſt the Bells be by how much your Hawk is giddy-headed, and apt to <hi>rake</hi> out at <hi>Check.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That being done, and ſhe ſharp ſet, go in a fair morning into ſome large. Field on Horſeback, which Field muſt be very little incumbred with Wood or Trees: Having your Hawk on your Fiſt, ride up into the wind, and having looſned her Hood whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſoftly, to provoke her to fly; and then you will obſerve ſhe will begin to bate, or at leaſt to ſlap with her Flags and Sails, and to raiſe her ſelf on your Fiſt: Then ſuffer her until ſhe rouze or mewt: When ſhe hath done either of them, unhood her, and let her fly with her Head into the wind, for thereby ſhe will be the better able to get upon the Wing; then will ſhe naturally climb upwards, flying in a circle.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe hath flown three or four Turns, then cry and lure with your voice, caſting the Lure about your head, unto which you muſt firſt tie a Pullet: And if your Falcon come in and approacheth near you, then caſt out the Lure into the wind; and if ſhe ſtoop to it, reward her as before.</p>
                     <p>There is one great fault you will often find in the making of a Hawk flying, and that is, when ſhe flieth from the Fiſt ſhe will not get up, but take ſtand on the ground; a frequent fault in Soar-Falcons. You muſt then fright her up with your Wand, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in to her; and when you have forced her to make a Turn or two, take her down and feed her. But if this do no good, find out ſome Chough, Starling, or ſuch like bird, and making ready your Hawks Hood, draw as near them as you may till they riſe. Then unhood your Hawk, and no doubt if ſhe will fly them, they will train her well upwards. Then you muſt have in readineſs a Duck ſeel'd ſo that ſhe may ſee no way but backwards, and that will make her mount the higher. This Duck you muſt hold by one of the Wings near the body in your right hand, then lure with your voice to make your Falcon turn the head: When ſhe is at a reaſonable pitch, caſt up your Duck juſt under her, that ſhe may perceive it: If ſhe <hi>ſtrike, ſtoop,</hi> or <hi>truſs</hi> the Duck, permit her to kill it, and reward her, giving her a reaſonable Gorge. Uſe this cuſtom twice or thrice, and your Hawk will leave the Stand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting on the Wing, and will become very obedient.</p>
                     <p>Here note, that for the firſt or ſecond time it is not convenient to ſhew your Hawk great or large Fowl, for it often happens that they ſlip from the Hawk into the wind; the Hawk not recovering them, <hi>raketh</hi> after them, which puts the Falconer to much trouble, and frequently occaſions the loſs of his Hawk.</p>
                     <p>But if it ſo chance that your Hawk ſo <hi>rake</hi> out with a Fowl that ſhe cannot reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, but gives it over, and comes in again directly upon you, then caſt out a ſeeled Duck; and if ſhe ſtoop and truſs it, croſs the Wings, and permit her to take her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, rewarding her alſo with the Heart, Brains, Tongue, and Liver. For want of a quick Duck, take her down with the dry Lure, and let her plume a Pullet, and feed her upon it.</p>
                     <p>By ſo doing your Hawk will learn to give over a Fowl that <hi>rakes out,</hi> and hearing the Lure of the Falconer, will make back again to the River, and know the better to hold in the Head.</p>

Sometimes a Haggard out of pride and a gadding humour will <hi>rangle</hi> out from her Keeper: Then clog her with great Luring-bells, and make her a Train or two with a Duck ſeel'd, to teach her to hold in and know her Keeper: Take her down often with the dry Lure, and reward her bountifully, and let her be ever well in bloud, or you may whoop for your Hawk to no purpoſe.</p>

                     <head>§. XIII. <hi>How to keep a Hawk high-flying.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IF your Hawk be a ſtately high-flying Hawk, you ought not to ingage her in more Flights than one in a morning: For often flying brings her off from her ſtately pitch. If ſhe be well made for the River, fly her not above twice in a morning; yet feed her up though ſhe kill not.</p>
                     <p>When a high-flying Hawk, being whiſtled to, gathers upwards to a great Gate, you muſt continue her therein, never flying her but upon broad waters and open Rivers; and when ſhe is at the higheſt, take her down with your Lure; where when ſhe hath plumed and broken the Fowl a little, then feed her up; And by that means you ſhall maintain your Falcon high-flying, inwards, and very fond of the Lure.</p>
                     <p>Some will have this high-flying Falcon ſeldom to kill, and not to ſtoop: Yet if ſhe kill every day, although ſhe ſtoop from a high Gate, yet if ſhe be not rebuked or hurt therewith, ſhe will, I can aſſure you, become a higher Flier every day than other; but ſhe will grow leſs fond of the Lure. Wherefore your high-flying Hawks ſhould be made inwards, it being a commendable quality in them to <hi>make in</hi> and turn Head at the ſecond or third toſs of the Lure, and when ſhe poureth down upon it as if ſhe had killed.</p>
                     <p>And as the teaching of a Falcon, or any other Hawk, to come readily to and love the Lure, is an Art highly commendable, becauſe it is the effect of great labour and induſtry: So it is the cauſe of ſaving many a Hawk, which otherwiſe would be loſt irrecoverably.</p>
                     <p>Mark this by the way, that ſome naturally high-flying Hawks will be long before they be <hi>made upwards,</hi> ſtill <hi>fiſhing</hi> and playing the ſlugs: And when they ſhould get up to cover the Fowl, they will ſtoop before the Fowl be put out. And this may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from two cauſes. In the firſt place, ſhe may be too ſharp ſet; and in the next place, it may be ſhe is flown untimely, either too ſoon, or too late.</p>
                     <p>When you ſee a Hawk uſe thoſe evil <hi>Tatches</hi> without any viſible cauſe, caſt her out a dead Fowl for a dead Quarry, and hood her up inſtantly without Reward, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage her from practiſing the like another time: Half an hour afterwards call her to the Lure and feed her, and ſerve her after this manner as often as ſhe fiſheth in that faſhion.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, to correct this error, the Falconer ought to conſult the natures and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Hawks, and ſhould carefully obſerve which fly high when in good plight, and which beſt when they are kept low, which when ſharpeſt ſet, and which on the contrary in a mean between both, which early at Sun-riſing, which when the Sun is but two hours high, which ſooner, and which later in an evening.</p>
                     <p>For know that the natures of Hawks are different; ſo are the times to fly each one: For to fly a Hawk in her proper time, and to fly her out of it, is as diſagreeable as the flight of a Gerfalcon and a Buzzard. Therefore the Oſtrager muſt fly his Hawks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their natures and diſpoſitions, keeping them always in good order.</p>
                     <p>Where by the by take notice, all Hawks, as well Soar-Hawks as Mew'd-Hawks and Haggards, ſhould be ſet out in the evening two or three hours, ſome more, ſome leſs, having reſpect to their nature as it is ſtronger or weaker; and in the morning alſo according as they caſt, hooding them firſt, and then ſetting them abroad a weathering, until you get on Horſe-back to proſecute your Recreation.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THis Flight hath leſs of Art in it than pleaſure to the beholders; and to ſay the truth, the Flight is ſtately and moſt noble.</p>
                     <p>As it is leſs difficult to teach a Hawk to fly at Fowl than it is to come unto and love the Lure, the firſt being natural, and not the laſt; ſo there is leſs induſtry to be uſed in making a Hawk fly the Hern than Water-Fowl. To the firſt ſhe is inſtigated by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural propenſity and inclination; to the latter ſhe is brought with Art, pains, and much diligence.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning of <hi>March</hi> Herns begin to make their Paſſage: If therefore you will adapt your Falcons for the Hern, you muſt not let them fly longer at the River, and withal you muſt pull them down to make them light: which is done by giving them Hearts and fleſh of Lambs and Calves, alſo Chickens: But give them no wild meats.</p>
                     <p>To the intent you may acquaint them one with the other, ſo that they may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fly the Hern and help one another, you muſt call a <hi>Caſt</hi> of them to the Lure at once; but have a care they <hi>crab</hi> not together, for ſo they may endanger one another in their flight.</p>
                     <p>When your Hawk is ſcoured and clean and ſharp ſet, you muſt then get a live Hern, upon the upper part of whoſe long ſharp Bill you muſt place a joynt of a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Cane, which will prevent her from hurting the Hawk: That being done, tie the Hern in a Creance; then ſetting her on the ground, unhood your Hawk, who will fly the Hern as ſoon as ſhe ſees her. If ſhe ſeiſe her, make in apace to ſuccour her, and let her plume and take bloud of the Hern: Then take the Brains, the Marrow of the bones, and the Heart, and laying it on your Hawking-glove give it your Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. After this rip her Breaſt, and let your Hawk feed thereon till ſhe be well gorg'd: This being done, hood her up upon the Hern, permitting her to plume at her pleaſure; then take her on your Fiſt, and let her tire on the Foot or Pinion.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe Herns are not very plentiful, you may preſerve one for a Train three or four times, by arming Bill, Head, and Neck, and painting it of the ſame colour that the Hern is of: And when the Falcon ſeiſeth her, you muſt be very nimble to make in; and deceive by a live Pigeon clapt under the Wing of the Hern for the Falcon, which muſt be her Reward.</p>
                     <p>The Hawk having thus ſeveral times taken her Train without diſcovery of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, you may then let the Hern looſe in ſome fair Field without a Creance, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arming her: When ſhe is up of a reaſonable height, you may caſt off your Falcon; who if ſhe <hi>bind</hi> with the Hern and bring her down, then make in apace to reſcue her, thruſting the Herns Bill into the ground, and breaking his Wings and Legs, that the Hawk may with more eaſe plume and foot him. Then reward her as before, with the Brains, Marrow of the bones, and Heart, making thereof an <hi>Italian Sop.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus much of a <hi>Train-Hern.</hi> Now to fly the wild Hern it is thus: If you find a wild Hern at <hi>Siege,</hi> win in as nigh to her as you can, and go with your Hawk under the wind; and having firſt looſed her Hood in a readineſs, as ſoon as the Hern leaveth the Siege, off with her Hood, and let her fly. If ſhe climb to the Hern and bring her down, run in (as I ſaid before) to reſcue her, thruſting her Bill into the ground, breaking her Wings and Legs, and rewarding her as aforeſaid on your Hawking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glove.</p>
                     <p>Now if your Falcon beat not down the Hern, or do give her over, then never fly your Falcon again at a Hern unleſs with a <hi>Make-Hawk</hi> well entred; for the coward by this means, ſeeing another fly at the Hern and <hi>bind</hi> with her, takes freſh courage. And if they kill the Hern flying both together, then muſt you reward them together while the Quarry is hot, making for them a <hi>Soppa</hi> as aforeſaid. This is the only way to make them both bold and perfect Herners.</p>

                     <p>FAlcons may be flown with till St. <hi>Georges</hi> day; then they muſt be ſet down: And be ſure to ſearch them for Lice, and if they have any pepper them well. Scowr them alſo before you caſt them into the Mew.</p>
                     <p>There are two ſorts of Mewing: 1. At the <hi>ſtock</hi> or <hi>ſtone.</hi> 2. <hi>Looſe,</hi> or at <hi>large.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Stock,</hi> the place ſhould be a ground-room, far from all noiſe or concourſe of people. Place therein (upon Treſſels two or three foot high) a Table, for length according to the number of your Falcons, and five or ſix foot broad, with little thin boards of four fingers high nailed along the ſides and ends. Fill the Table with great ſand, that hath ſmall pebble ſtones in it, and in the middle place ſome great free-ſtones, a cubit high, made taper-wiſe, but plain and ſmooth above. Then take a Cord of the bigneſs of a large Bow-ſtring, put it through a ring, and bind it about the ſtone, in ſuch ſort that the ring or ſwivel may go round the ſtone without any let: And thereunto tie the Leaſe of the Falcon. If you mew more Hawks than one, you muſt ſet your ſtones at that diſtance, that when they bate they may not reach one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, for crabbing. The great ſtones for their coolneſs the Hawks will delight to ſit on: The little gravel-ſtones are for them to ſwallow. The ſand is of uſe, that when they bate they mar not their feathers, and for the better cleanſing their mewts: The Cord and Ring, that when the Hawks bate this way or that way they may never tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, the Ring ſtill following them. All day let your Falcons ſtand hooded upon the ſtone, only when they would feed you muſt take them on the Fiſt. At night off with their Hoods. To avoid and remedy all ill accidents and inconveniences it were well that the Falconer had his bed in the Mew.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If you would mew at large you can mew but one in a room, unleſs it be ſo big that you may divide it into ſeveral partitions. Twelve foot ſquare is ſcope enough for one Falcon, with two Windows a foot and an half broad apiece, each fitted with its ſhut, one toward the North, for cool air, the other toward the Eaſt, for the heat and comfort of the Sun. If your Hawk be a great bater your Mew were beſt be a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, which if it be, you muſt cover the floor with groſs ſand four fingers thick, and thereupon ſet a ſtones as aforeſaid. Beſides, you muſt make her two handſom Pearches, near each Window one, that ſitting on the one ſhe may have the comfort of the Sun, on the other the benefit of the freſh air.</p>
                     <p>Every Week, or at leaſt every Fortnight, ſet her a Baſon of water, that your Hawk may bathe if ſhe deſire it, and if ſhe doth, then take it away the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                     <p>Your Mew muſt alſo have a Portal with a little hole below, to convey in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice whereon their meat is ſerved, called among Falconers the <hi>Hack.</hi> And that muſt be made on this faſhion. Take a piece of thick board, a foot and half long, and a foot broad or thereabout, under the which faſten two little Treſſels, three or four fingers high. Let them be faſt pinned or nailed to. Then bore two holes on each ſide thereof, and through each of theſe put a ſhort. Cord of the bigneſs a Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, with the ends downward, and knots faſt knit on them under the button of the board, ſo ſtreight that you cannot raiſe the Cord above the board above a fingers breadth or thereabouts. And when you would give your Hawks meat, take a little ſtick ſomewhat longer than the <hi>Hack,</hi> and as big as your finger, but let it be of ſtrong wood, as Crab-tree, Holly, or ſuch like, and upon that ſtick bind your Hawks meat, and put the ends of the ſtick under the cords upon the <hi>Hack,</hi> and ſo convey it into the Mew to your <hi>Hawks,</hi> that the Hawk may not truſs or drag away her meat into the Mew, but, and as ſoon as ſhe hath fed and gorged her ſelf, take it away again. It is good to keep one ſet hour of feeding your Hawk, for ſo ſhe will mew ſooner and better.</p>
                     <p>This Author prefers mewing at the ſtock or grate before mewing at large. His reaſon is, becauſe in that kind of mewing we take our Hawks on the Fiſt every day, and ſo may ſee in what ſtate they be; and if they fall into any ſickneſs or infirmity, may give them proper medicines, which cannot be done when you mew at large. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if we happen upon Hawks that have preyed for themſelyes, it will be needful to bear them often in the cool air in the morning till mid <hi>July</hi> or thereabout, yea, and to call them to the Lure, and to ride abroad with them ſometimes an hour or two.</p>

Mr. <hi>Latham</hi> is of opinion, that it is better to mew at large, and diſapproves mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſtock. For (ſaith he) when ſhe is at large ſhe hath the exerciſe of her Wings in flying up and down, which muſt needs be good for her. Alſo ſhe may go to the water if ſhe be diſpoſed, and takes ſtones at her pleaſure. She may do all things at her own liking, whereas ſhe can do nothing at the ſtock when ſhe would: Neither can you give her that is fitting to her own content but by gueſs and imagination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are many times deceived. <hi>And truly upon theſe conſiderations I am of his opinion, that it is better to mew at large, than at the ſtock or ſtone.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Haggard-Falcon</hi> is now-adays moſt eſteemed, not being (as ſome write) a choice and tender Hawk to endure wind and weather, but for hardineſs far before the <hi>Falcon-gentle.</hi> It is a bird of great ſpirit and mettle, like a Conquerour in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, keeping in aw and ſubjection moſt Fowl that flie, in ſo much that the young ones will venture upon <hi>Brants</hi> and <hi>Wild-geeſe,</hi> till being ſoundly bruſht and beaten by thoſe ſtrong birds, they learn their error, and deſiſt to meddle with ſuch unwieldy game.</p>
                     <p>She reſts no day, but toils continually, unleſs hindred by extremity of weather. Hence he infers that it is an error in Falconers after a day or two's flying to give their young Hawks a day or two's reſt, and concludes that whoſoever can fly his Hawk every day, ſhall have every day a good and perfect Hawk, but he that covets to fly upon reſt ſhall ſeldom have a good and ſtaid Hawk.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe hath ſlain and ſeiſed her prey, if it be a Dove, as ſoon as ſhe hath broken its neck ſhe preſently goes to the place we abhor our <hi>Hawks</hi> ſhould ſo much as touch, which is the Crop, and takes her pleaſure of what ſhe finds there, eſpecially mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard or carlock ſeed, which he conceives ſhe uſes by way of Phyſic to preſerve her health.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>HAving taken or purchaſed one of theſe birds, whether ſhe be full or empty, ſet her down as ſoon as you can, and let her reſt quietly the firſt night, either ſeeld, or in a rufter-hood. The next day taking her up gently, carry her continually on your Fiſt, uſing a feather to ſtroke her withal inſtead of your hand. When ſhe will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be toucht without ſtarting, pluck off her Hood, and quickly and gently put it on again, holding this courſe till ſhe begin to feed. Then profer her meat, but ſuffer her to take but little at a time, never hooding and unhooding her without a bit or two to quiet her, and win her love to the Hood and your ſelf. Uſe your voice
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:63869:214"/>
to her before you take off her Hood, and all the while ſhe is feeding, and no longer, that as ſhe reclaims ſhe may learn to know, that when ſhe hears your voice ſhe ſhall be fed.</p>
                     <p>When you have brought her to feed boldly, then teach her to jump to your Fiſt in this manner. Set her on a Pearch breaſt-high [if it be lower, you muſt be on your knees; for being ſo high above her at firſt, till ſhe be better acquainted, will be apt to fright her.] Then unſtrike her Hood, and lure her, uſing your voice, with a bit or two of meat beſtowed on her as ſhe is unhooded, which will make her to love your voice, being careful that ſhe take no ſudden fright or diſlike; for it is hard to work ſuch impreſſions out again. Be ſure to keep her ſtomach perfect, ſharp, and well edged. For <hi>venter magiſter artis,</hi> it is that only that guides and rules her; That is the curb and bridle that holds her in ſubjection to the man, and it is the ſpur which pricks her forward to perform her duty.</p>
                     <p>By this time you may pull off her Hood, and let her ſit bare-faced, keeping your ſelf as yet cloſe by her. And as you perceive any untoward humour in her, profer her a bit of meat with your hand, and uſe your voice to her, to draw her to you, till you have brought her boldly to attend, willingly to receive bits at your hand, and jump readily to your Fiſt: Then ſet her to the <hi>Lure</hi> garniſht with meat, to which when ſhe will readily come in the <hi>Creance:</hi> ſtay not long in that kind, for ſhe will ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſcorn it, and look another way: But let her ſee a live <hi>Dove</hi> at the Lure, and lure her to it: Which when ſhe hath killed, and eaten up the head, take her up very gently with a bit of meat, and put on her Hood: Then lure her again to the dead pelt, and ſo uſe her two or three times, and no more; for ſhe will quickly grow loth to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and her deſire to keep the pelt will cauſe her to drag and carry it from you, than which there cannot be a worſe quality in a <hi>Hawk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Often luring at one time at her firſt entring is good to make her perfect quickly; but uſe it not longer than I have directed, eſpecially to a Field-hawk: For the reaſon given.</p>
                     <p>Now it is full time to lure her looſe to live Pigeons, which you muſt let her ſee at your Lure (to draw her you with love and courage) and alſo let her ſeize on them, and kill them at your foot, one after another, for ſix days together, being ſure that he that holds her have skill to let her in with her head right towards you; and lure not far till her ſtomach be perfect, for otherwiſe ſhe may ſpy ſomething by the way which ſhe hath more liking to, and ſo for that time be loſt, which would be very hurtful to her though ſhe ſhould be recovered again.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe forget not all this time of her making (while ſhe is on the ground either pluming or feeding) to walk round about her, uſing your voice, and giving her many bits with your hand, till you have won her even to lean and bend her body to your hand, and to bring what ſhe hath in her foot toward you. By this time it will not be amiſs to ſpring her up ſome live <hi>Doves,</hi> as ſhe comes unto you between the man and the Lure: And be ſure they be given in a long Creance, that ſhe may not kill them far from you, but that always ſhe may truſs them over your head, and fall near you: For otherwiſe it may ſtrike a timorous conceit into her, making her ſit and ſtare at you, or carry from you, and ſometimes forſake what ſhe hath got, and go her way, when ſhe ſhall ſee you coming ſo far from her.</p>
                     <p>By this time you may be bold (at a convenient hour in the Evening, when ſhe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth your voice, and hath you in her ſight) to hold in your Lure, and ſuffer her to fly about you, holding her with your voice and lure as near you as may be, to teach her to do her buſineſs, and work it on your head. Then caſt her up a <hi>Dove</hi> with a loud voice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>THe reaſon of the Hawks carrying is not the lightneſs of the <hi>Dove,</hi> as ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, but the unskilfulneſs or negligence of the Keeper in not dealing gently and kindly with them in their reclaiming, or giving them little or no content in their luring, giving them for a reward only the pelt of a <hi>Pigeon,</hi> or ſome other dead thing, whereas their delight is in ſuch as are living. For the prevention of this coyneſs or fugitive deſire in your Hawk, at her firſt luring unto live <hi>Doves,</hi> you muſt reſtrain her, and draw her gently to you with your Lure or Creance, not ſuddenly or raſhly, but

                     <p>I My ſelf (ſaith my Author) have had very few <hi>Haggards</hi> that would ever bathe at all, ſo long as they continued ſound: But whenſoever I proved them bare-fac'd abroad, having fitted them with a reaſonable gorge, they did themſelves more harm by bating, than bathing would have done them good. Therefore if you find your Hawk not diſpoſed to bathing, you were better keep her on your Fiſt. But after two or three mews, in their declining age, through unnatural heats and ſurfets they will deſire bathing; and then you are not to neglect the occaſion; but when the weather will permit, ſhew her the water, and if ſhe do bathe, let her dry her ſelf abroad if it be fair, and the weather temperate; otherwiſe let her have the air of the fire with meaſure, and come no more abroad that day nor night, but ſet her upon a very warm Pearch, and from the air.</p>

                        <hi>Note.</hi> This kind of Hawks though you labour them carefully the firſt year in their making, having brought them to be ſo familiar, that they will ſit abroad bare-fac'd hard by you when they are empty; yet if you ſhall abſent your ſelf for trial, you ſhall find when you come to them again they will be unquiet, and by bating and ſtriving do themſelves much harm, if they be full.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>EYas</hi> Hawks are much ſubject to heat, and therefore much addicted to weathering and bathing, and will almoſt never refuſe the water. You may boldly ſet abroad theſe Hawks at any time of day unhooded to take the air: For in regard of their fondneſs of, and familiarity with the man, they will take no occaſion to bate, thereby to hurt themſelves when they are full-gorged.</p>

But your <hi>Haggard</hi> Falcon, if you intend to weather her, you muſt do it in the morning, or elſe in the evening before ſhe be fed, alſo you muſt remain cloſe by her with meat clean and ready dreſt, to take her to your Fiſt withall. But I rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe all Falconers to weather her in her Hood, which can do her no harm, but is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a means to prevent her bating and ſtriving, by which her ſpirit and courage is taken away.</p>

                     <p>ABout Lady-day, or ſomewhat before, is the time when theſe <hi>Hawks</hi> leave ours and other ſtrange Countries. They begin to draw together, and to diſpoſe themſelves thereunto a month before: The reaſon is, becauſe at that time of the year being moved by their luſt they repair to their breeding places. Therefore the old <hi>Haggard</hi> muſt needs then be ſet down, and fed up with hot and bloody meat: The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termewed <hi>Haggard</hi> is more able to reſiſt the courſe of nature, being not ſo violent in her, therefore you may fly her ſomewhat longer. The <hi>Paſſenger-ſoar-Falcon</hi> may be flown a month longer than any of the other. All of them will upon a ſmall occaſion be apt at that time to fly quite away; the inclination to cawking and procreating Young, being then ſo ſtrong in them, as to deface and obliterate, or at leaſt over-rule all artificial impreſſions of ſubjection and obedience.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>YOu muſt beware, when you purpoſe to feed up your <hi>Hawk,</hi> and put her in fleſh, that ſhe be not her own carver in her diet, and that you do not give her too great a gorge your ſelf: For if you do. it is ten to one but ſhe will over-feed, and ſurfeit of the ſame. The reaſon is becauſe ſhe wants exerciſe to digeſt it. Your beſt way therefore is, to keep your <hi>Hawk</hi> all the flying time as clean as you can; and at her ſetting down, keep your wonted courſe of feeding twice a day, and as near as you can with hot and bloudy meat, and no more in quantity than you find her well able to endue and put away: And if after a week or fortnights ſpace you find ſhe is mended, then you may be bold to begin to feed her once a day; and if it be poſſible at firſt let her have young <hi>Pigeons:</hi> But if you give her old birds, her firſt gorges muſt be leſs. Thus obſerving how ſhe mends by feeding once a day, and the eagerneſs of her ſtomach doth abate, you may order her accordingly, and you will find her ſhortly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in her fleſh, and ſetled in her health, and fit for the Mew.</p>

                     <p>BEfore you put her in, be ſure ſhe be free from Mites and Lice: Which elſe will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe upon her there, and hinder her thriving.</p>
                     <p>Alſo take off her old Jeſſes, and put her on a pair of new and ſtrong ones, that may laſt till the time of her drawing, that you be not forced to hold her, and ſtrive with her too long, to heat her when ſhe is in the prime of her greaſe, which may do her much harm.</p>
                     <p>Keep your Mew aways ſweet, and clean with ſweeping.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve how your Hawk thrives by her caſtings and mutes, for ſo you may know how to diet her, continuing or altering her uſage accordingly.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not fail to let your Hawk have fair water always ſtanding by her, which muſt often be ſhifted.</p>
                     <p>Be ſure never to let her be without ſtones lying by her in gravel. <hi>He adviſes alſo to gather up the ſtones ſhe caſts, and waſh them, and lay them for her to take again: But I ſuppoſe it would be better to give her freſh ſtones. For thoſe ſtones which ſhe hath taken and caſt up, are by mutual attrition in the ſtomach worn ſmooth, and ſo become leſs fit for the grinding of the meat, which is the reaſon why ſhe caſts them up. Wherefore (as we have noted before) Poultry before they ſwallow ſtones try them with their tongues whether they be rough or not.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>WHen you draw your <hi>Hawk,</hi> be careful not to ſtrive long with her, or heat her by ſtrugling and bating, but with all poſſible expedition ſet her down upon a Pearch, to reſt quietly, till her anger and turbulent humour be aſſwaged; and ſo let her ſit among company, and in their hearing, without any occaſion of diſturbance as near as you can. Then when you think it convenient, take her gently upon your Fiſt, and carry her up and down, ſtroaking her with a feather lightly and gently: And if you perceive her begin to ſtir or grow unquiet, ſet her down again, and thus uſe her until by degrees you have drawn her to ſome reaſonable familiarity, and that ſhe will begin to feed: Then give her more carriage, and uſe her to it more and more, and be ſure ſtill to keep her as quiet as may be, and by all means prevent bating. For there is more danger in ſome one Hawk that is to be reclaimed and inſeamed from the Mew, than in many other Hawks that have been newly taken in <hi>England,</hi> or from the Cage: The reaſon is, becauſe by reaſon of her eaſe and full feeding, and want of exerciſe in the Mew, no crammed Fowl will be more fat and full than ſhe, and ſo ſhe will be apt to receive much harm by bating or any ſudden heat: Whereas the wild <hi>Hawk,</hi> coming from the labour of her body, and exerciſe of her Wings: And the <hi>Cage-Hawk</hi> being toſſed and tumbled in her voyage, are ſeldom over-fat, and ſo in leſs danger of over-heating themſelves by bating or otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>When you have brought her to eat, you muſt feed her twice a day, and ſo order and diet her continually, and it muſt be with new and good meat, which you muſt dreſs and waſh clean, wringing out the bloud with fair water, that ſo ſhe may ſooner come to a ſtomach: And for the quantity thereof let it be as much as the Wing of an old <hi>Dove</hi> at once, or as you ſhall find her, to put away the one meal, and make her ſelf fit and ready for the other. And for the firſt week or ten days after ſhe begins to feed, give her neither caſting nor ſtones, but the week after give her half a dozen ſtones every night, after ſhe hath put away her ſupper from forth her gorge, which you ſhall find ſhe will caſt you up again in the morning very early. The third week approaching you muſt give her every night a caſting, continuing your former manner of diet till your Hawk be flying, and all her flying time, only adding unto her meals ſomewhat in quantity, and forbearing to waſh altogether ſo hard, with reſpect to the mildneſs and hardneſs of the weather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then prepare your ſelf to lure her, and let her exerciſe and have the benefit of her Wings.</p>
                     <p>If you give your Hawk a piece of Flannel or Cotton for caſting, he adviſeth that it be perfectly clean waſht; and that when you give the lighteſt and eaſieſt ſuppers, and ſome Plumage with it, but never upon a great gorge to the ſoundeſt <hi>Hawk</hi> that is. Alſo in a morning, when your <hi>Hawk</hi> makes a looſe and unwrapped caſting of Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, it is good to give a little knot with ſtones, to bring away looſe or ſtraggling feathers out of the Pannel. Many ſound Hawks will never brook a woollen caſting; and therefore my Author adviſes not to give your Hawk any ſuch, unleſs it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for trial, but to give her only caſting of Plumage; and ſo you ſhall be ſure to preſerve and keep her ſafe, and in continual caſe to do her buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Here my Author enters into a long diſcourſe about giving of ſtones, giving many reaſons why it is better to give them over night than in the morning; which, becauſe I am not of his opinion concerning the uſe of ſtones, and think that they may be indifferently given either at night or in the morning, when the Hawk is willing to take them, and that it matters not much how long ſhe keeps them, I ſhall omit. Only I ſhall ſet down ſome of his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental obſervations.</hi> I have (ſaith he) ſeen a <hi>Hawk</hi> in the time of her flying, that hath taken a dozen or more ſtones of her ſelf in a morning, and hath kept half of them till next morning: The ſame <hi>Hawk</hi> when they were given her would not miſs at her feeding time, or at the ſight of meat to caſt half of them, and keep the reſt till the next day. <hi>This he obſerved many Hawks to do.</hi>

Another Hawk when I came into the Mew with her dinner did caſt up ſome few ſtones at the ſight of the meat, and when ſhe had eaten up the ſame (being a young <hi>Pigeon)</hi> ſhe preſently took above a dozen more, which ſhe kept till the next day. The like ſtory he relates of a <hi>Tarcel gentle,</hi> that after he had eaten a whole young Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon took preſently fifteen or ſixteen ſtones, and made it ſomething late the next day before he caſt them. This <hi>Hawk</hi> alſo at the ſight of his meat would not fail to caſt ſome of his ſtones.</p>
                     <p>No ſuch Phyſic (ſaith he) for a Hawk as to give her ſtones in due time. Here he takes a great deal of pains to prove that ſtones do not, according to the commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinion, cool, but rather at preſent heat, their uſe being in his judgment to melt and waſte the glut and fatneſs, and to empty and evacuate thoſe gorgitive and ſtuffing humours, and ſo to inſeam and make her clean. <hi>But this I omit, becauſe, as I ſaid before, I think the main uſe of the ſtones is to aſſiſt the ſtomach in comminution and grinding of the meat, thereby cauſing a more ſpeedy and perfect concoction, and ſo they conduce much to the preſervation and recovery of health; the ſtomachs not performing its office well being the foundation and original of moſt diſeaſes in Hawks and other animals, ſith an error in the firſt concoction is not amended in the ſubſequent.</hi>

                     <p>One remarkable obſervation he hath, which may ſeem to argue that ſtones have a purgative quality in them, which is this, That upon giving ſtones after forbearance a while, a Hawk will oftentimes at her beginning to caſt before the ſtones, in the midſt, and at the end of them, guſh out abundance of wateriſh, and yellowiſh greaſie ſlime and glut from forth her body: Which before, though ſhe had caſting daily, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not forth.</p>
                     <p>He adviſe at the beginning to make your Hawk perfectly clean, and ſo to keep her without pampering with great meals, and to have her empty, and with a good ſtomach when ſhe flies: For if ſhe be flown full, it may endanger her life; and beſides, ſhe will never fly with regard and attention to her Keeper, if her ſtomach be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For proof whereof, Take any young Hawk out of the Neſt (though newly diſcloſed) and breed her up as familiarly as you can deviſe: Yet when you ſhall come afterwards to fly her, ſhe muſt be altogether governed by her ſtomach. For let her fail of that never ſo little, and every puff of wind will blow her from you; nay, if there be no wind ſtirring, yet ſhe will wheel and ſink away from him and from his voice, that all the time before had lured and trained her up. Contrariwiſe, if it be his hap to find her again when ſhe is hungry, though ſhe would ſtarve before ſhe would prey for her ſelf, yet then will ſhe own him or any other man: Nay, ſhe will be ready to take his Cap from him before ſhe will either leave or loſe him.</p>
                     <p>Note well, that what ſhew of cleanneſs ſoever you find in your <hi>Hawk</hi> by her caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mutes, or otherwiſe, although you have taken never ſo much pains with her, by caſting, clean feed, and ſtones to purge and cleanſe her inwardly; yet will ſhe not be perfectly inſeamed till ſhe come to the exerciſe of her Wings, and labour of her body, after which ſhe will break greaſe, and by degrees inſeam throughly. And be ſure that her labour at firſt be not immoderate, for if it be, it will ingender grief. Alſo you muſt give her liberty by degrees to ſtir her Wings, and uſe her body, that there may be no heat exceſſively taken, until ſhe be throughly inſeamed, and then ſhe may be weary with flying, but ſhe will never take harm.</p>

                     <p>When you have uſed this courſe, at your next coming to the brook, let your <hi>Make-Hawk</hi> be flown, and when ſhe hath ſtooped and is wrought to her place again, at your next ſhewing, let your Hawk ſee the Fowl thrown in, and fly for the killing of it her ſelf with the other <hi>Hawk.</hi> Mark the manner of that flight; For if ſhe hotly and kindly entertains the advantage offered her, and with attentive eagerneſs follows the Fowl ſhe ſaw thrown in, flying round upon that and your ſelf, and with good hap enjoys the Fowl ſhe may make you a good <hi>Hawk:</hi> But if this courſe ſtay her not, there is no hope of her for the River.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Ger-falcon, Turbervile</hi> ſaith, is of a fierce and hardy nature, and therefore difficult to be reclaimed, but being once won, proves an excellent Hawk<hi>-Latham</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Ger-falcons</hi> are for the moſt part very kind and loving Hawks, and will ſuddenly be reclaimed and made to love the man. Their Tercels or Males are called <hi>Jerkins.</hi> Theſe Hawks do not fly the River, but always from the Fiſt they fly Herons, Shovelers, forked-tail'd Kites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In going up to their gate they hold not that courſe which other Falcons do. For they climb upon the Train when they find any Fowl, and as ſoon as they have reacht her, they pluck her down, if not at the firſt, yet at the ſecond or third encounter. The Haggard of this kind is moſt commendable, and eaſieſt to be made for any pleaſure. To reclaim and make her fit to be ſet to the Lure, you muſt take the ſame courſe as is preſcribed for the Haggard ſleight Falcon.</p>
                  <p>When ſhe ſhall come to be lured looſe, then would ſhe firſt of all be taught to come unto the Pelts of Hens, Herons, or any ſuch like thing, ſo it be dead; for thereby ſhe will not be over-hot or eager of it, neither muſt you ſuffer her to touch any part of the fleſh, to draw her love from your voice and your hand, but to ſpend only her time on it in pluming. All this time you muſt be cloſe by her, and on your knees uſing your voice to her, with her dinner or ſupper clean dreſt and waſht, giving ſtill unto her ſome part thereof in bits with your hand, that from thence only ſhe may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and her whole delight be in that, accounting the other in her foot but as a ſtand or means to ſtay her by you, while ſhe receives her full reward at your hands. And in uſing this courſe often to her, ſhe being a Hawk of never ſuch ſtrength and ableneſs to carry, it will in the end ſo reclaim and win her to your ſelf, that ſhe will quite forget the ſame: And after if you liſt to train her with Doves, ſhe will not carry one feather from you, but draw towards you, and ever deſire to have her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at your hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:63869:217"/>
It is a ſpecial point in a Falconer to take good time at the firſt making of his Hawk, and not poſt her to another thing till ſhe be perfect in one.</p>
                  <p>Before you ſpring her up any Doves, it is meet you let her kill half a dozen at your Lure, cloſe by your foot, having a pair of ſhort Creances at your Lure: For it may be at the firſt ſeeing of the Dove to ſtir and flutter, ſhe may come royſtingly to twitch or take it away, ſo far as ſhe is able: Which if ſhe ſhould do, you have a remedy by reſtraining her gently with your Creance, ſo that there ſhall be no offence commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Then ought you to get gently into her, and as beforeſaid with bits of meat clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreſt and beſtowed on her you ſhall pleaſe her at the full, and take her to the Fiſt again.</p>
                  <p>The Heron and the ſtately flight and mountee thereto is the thing for which theſe Hawks are moſt deſired and accounted of: For which purpoſe your intermew'd Hawks are fitteſt and moſt eſteemed. <hi>N. B.</hi> Remember to be favourable to them the firſt year of their making, [and not to put them to any toil, but to train them gently with ſuch Herons as you are ſure cannot go from them, nor cauſe them to labour much before they maſter them,] and ever after at the drawing: And take good time with them in the inſeaming: For theſe times as yet have ever ſhortned their lives and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them. No man (he ſaith) can make one of theſe <hi>Hawks</hi> from the Mew rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be lured under ſix weeks at the leaſt, but he ſhall hazard her life if ſhe take any heat at all. They are prepared for the Mew, and mew'd in like manner as the ſleight Falcon. Let her have in the Mew Sods or Turfs to ſtand on, and thoſe often ſhifted, that they grow not too hard and dry: For ſhe is a very heavy Hawk, and very ſubject to infirmity on the bottom of her feet. He diſallows mewing of them at the ſtock, and approves of mewing them looſe. She ought alſo to have very often given to her Plumage, bones, and ſtones, to purge and cleanſe her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Turbervile</hi> ſaith, they covet to keep their caſtings long through ſloth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adviſes not to give them caſting of Cotton, but of Tow, Hazel or hard things.</p>
                  <p>When ſhe is mew'd, <hi>Latham</hi> ſaith, that you ought at the leaſt three weeks before you take her to your Fiſt, to inſeam her with waſht meat and ſtones: For then is the danger of ſhortning her life, whereas by good ordering they are as hardy as the Lanner, and will laſt as long: He ſaith, he hath known one hold out and continue her goodneſs twenty years.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Lanners</hi> of all Hawks are fitteſtfor young Falconers, becauſe they will hardly take ſurfeit, and ſeldom be over-flown, or melt their greaſe.</p>
                  <p>Mew'd <hi>Lanners</hi> [and <hi>Sacres]</hi> are hardly known from the Soar-hawks, becauſe they do not change their plume.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Turbervile</hi> ſaith, that with this Hawk you may fly the River. <hi>Latham</hi> ſaith, he hath not known any Lanner made for the River, yet preſcribes a way to make them.</p>
                  <p>They are very ſlothful and hard-metled, ſo that unleſs you keep a hard hand over them they will do littlegood.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall not lightly ſee a <hi>Lanner</hi> lie upon the Wing, after ſhe hath flown to mark, but after one ſtooping ſhe maketh a point, and then waits for the Fowl after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Goſhawk,</hi> ſhe is ſo ſlothful and dull; and therefore doth commonly uſe upon the queſting or call of the Spaniels to attend very diligently, and ſo to prey at her pleaſure. As the <hi>Eyaſs</hi> of this kind exceeds other Hawks in gentleneſs and love to her Keeper, ſo the <hi>Haggard</hi> paſſes all others in wildneſs, and is very hard to be reclaimed. She muſt be managed and ordered in all reſpects like the <hi>Haggard</hi> ſleight <hi>Falcon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ramage Lanner</hi> is alſo a coy Hawk, and muſt be ordered as the Haggard Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con; only her diet muſt be with hard-waſhed meat and ſtones more or leſs as you ſhall find her natural inclination.</p>

Above all you muſt uſe your utmoſt skill and pains to keep her from dragging or carrying any thing from you; which ill quality no Hawk is more ſubject to than ſhe. To prevent which, firſt you muſt beware, that if ſhe but once only knoweth the Lure, that you lure her no more than once at one time, though you take the more time to make her: Elſe you hazard the ſpoiling of her. For as ſoon as ſhe knows the Lure ſhe will ſettle her love on it, and deſire to hold it, and be loth to be taken up from it to be lured again; and out of fear leſt you ſhould deprive her of it, will quickly fly you, and drag and carry it from you. Secondly, During the time of her luring and training let her have her reward at your hand for the moſt part in bits, reſerving ſome ſmall quantity to take her to your Fiſt withal. Thirdly, All this while have your Spaniels by you as ſhe is on the ground: For theſe be Hawks of all other moſt coy and fearful to have any Dogs come near them: And therefore at her firſt entring you ought to have but few Dogs, and they ſuch as be both cool and gentle, till ſhe be well entred and acquainted. For if ſhe ſhould chance to take any ſudden fright with a Dog, ſhe would never abide them again: And ſo ſhe will be for ever married; for being able to carry away her prey, whenever ſhe ſhall have a Patridge in her foot, ſhe will ſuffer neither Man nor Dog to come near her, but carry it away, and prey upon it. Which if ſhe do but once, it is as good as an hundred times, for ſhe will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be reclaimed from it.</p>

                     <p>She is a couragious and hardy Hawk, flying with greater fierceneſs and more hotly than any other bird of prey; ſo that ſhe will venture to fly the Partridge, Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powt and other birds bigger than her ſelf, and purſue them eagerly even into Villages and Towns.</p>
                     <p>They are ſuch buſie and unruly things, as oftentimes they eat <note n="*" place="margin">This my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor upon his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence denies.</note> off their own Feet and Talons very unnaturally, ſo as they die of; which is the true cauſe why you ſhall ſeldom or never ſee an entermew'd <hi>Merlin:</hi> For that in the Mew they ſo ſpoil themſelves.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Merlin</hi> may be made both to the Fiſt and to the Lure. When you have made her to the Lure in manner <note n="†" place="margin">For the Falcon.</note> before deſcribed, make her a train with a <hi>Partridge,</hi> or other livebird: If ſhe foot and kill it, reward her, ſuffering her to take her pleaſure on it. This done, fly her at the wild <hi>Partridge,</hi> if ſhe take it at the firſt flight, or if ſhe take it at the ſecond flight, being retrived by the Spaniels, feed her upon it with a reaſonable Gorge, chearing her with your voice, that ſo ſhe may know it. If ſhe prove not hardy at the firſt train, prove her with another before you fly her at wild Game. If at the ſecond train ſhe prove not hard, it is a ſign ſhe is nothing worth.</p>
                     <p>It is very good ſport to fly with a caſt of <hi>Merlins</hi> at the <hi>Lark</hi> or <hi>Linnet;</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they love to fly in company, it is pleaſant to ſee the one climbing to the mountee above the Lark, and the other lying low for her beſt advantage, the one ſtriking the bird at the ſtooping, the other at her down-come. When you have found the birds go as near as you can into the wind to the bird; and as ſoon as the bird riſeth from the ground unhood your caſt of <hi>Merlins,</hi> and caſt them to fly until they have beaten down the Lark or Linnet, and let them feed on her for their labour indifferently. He adviſes not to fly your <hi>Merlin</hi> at Cut-Larks, becauſe they not mounting upward, but flying ſtreight foward, they afford you but little ſport, and beſides endanger the loſs of your Hawk.</p>

                     <p>HAwks of all Creatures are moſt fearful of man, and the <hi>Goſhawk</hi> as coy, nice, and hard to be dealt with as any. She may be won by gentle uſage; and will as ſoon perceive and unkindly reſent any rough or harſh behaviour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Oſtringer</hi> muſt bring his Hawk to love and be familiar with the Spaniel.</p>
                     <p>Some <hi>Goſhawks</hi> are ſwift of flight, which in purſuing and catching their prey truſt to the ſwiftneſs of their Wings, others fly ſlow, and win what they get by policy: None of them but by induſtry may be trained up to, and made good for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Goſhawk</hi> is of a hotter temper and ſtronger conſtitution than any other Hawk; the firſt appears, in that her mutings are always liquid; the ſecond, in that ſhe is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom troubled with thoſe diſeaſes, which be incident to moſt other Hawks, <hi>viz.</hi> to be liver-ſhotten, and to the Filanders. And though the <hi>Lanner</hi> be accounted the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt Hawk in uſe among us, and longeſt-lived; yet the reaſon is not the firmneſs of her conſtitution above the <hi>Goſhawks,</hi> but becauſe the <hi>Goſhawk</hi> in time of her pride and fulneſs is a froward and unruly bird, and when ſhe is inſeamed very prone to extreme bating (wherefore ſhe requires more labour and attendance of her Keeper than any other Hawk) and by theſe extremes ſhe often ſhortens her days: Whereas the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> is a meek and gentle Creature, and will ſeldom bate or be unruly in the time of her inſeaming; which is the reaſon ſhe laſts longer.</p>

Then draw her, having a rufter-hood in readineſs very ſit for her, from which time ſhe muſt be continually fed on the Fiſt, and have caſting every night.

                     <p>FEw of theſe are ſo fat or full-bodied as to take harm by any reaſonable bating.</p>
                     <p>Give your Hawk ſweet meat, clean dreſt, and reaſonably waſht, and moderate gorges of the ſame: By this diet you muſt bring her to a good ſtomach before you profer her caſting, and then ſhe will not be nice or curious in taking it. Let it be no more than ſhe may well and eaſily ſwallow, and when ſhe hath done ſo, preſently put on her Hood, then ſuddenly give her one bit or two of meat to pleaſe her withal; then make a little ſtay, until you perceive aſſuredly that ſhe hath put it down into her Pannel, which being perceived put on her Hood again, and give her a reaſonable ſupper. By this courſe taken, the Hawk will ſoon come to be in love with her caſting, haſting to take it without niceneſs in expectation of her ſupper.</p>

                        <pb n="423" facs="tcp:63869:218"/>
For my own part (ſaith my Author) when my Hawk is well inſeamed, and in fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I give her Plumage every night when I feed her up: When ſhe reſts I feed her very clean, without any caſting at all, and ſo ſet her up to reſt, and in the morning very early give a woollen caſting, faſhioned and ſoak'd all night in fair water, which ſhe will willingly take being uſed to it: And in an hour or thereabouts her appetite to her breakfaſt will provoke her to caſt it up again. <hi>So he diſapproves the giving a wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len caſting at night:</hi> But if any will needs give it, then he adviſes it be with ſmall ſtore of meat, and ſome Plumage with it. Alſo he diſapproves of ſtones given with Celandine, and caſtings of hazel, unleſs much underſized, becauſe of their ſwelling. When ever he found his Hawk to diſtaſte unnatural Cotton caſtings, he ſuddenly left them and betook himſelf to Jukes, and ſometimes to <hi>Hares</hi> or <hi>Conies</hi> feet, the bones and wooll well broken together, which he never found to diſagree with her, but always wrought to good purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>He condemns the giving of bloudy meat, becauſe the Hawk will not therewith be reclaimed. And therefore, ſaith he, the unreclaimed and unclean <hi>Hawk</hi> of this or any other kind ought to be reclaimed, inſeamed, and made to fly with good meat, clean dreſt and waſhed, and for theſe Hawks the water dried out again with a fair cloth. And this courſe to be held all flying time, unleſs there be juſt cauſe for the contrary. As to a ſick and craſie Hawk, with due reſpect unto the eyes, or to a hot and eager mettled Hawk, as alſo to the ſoundeſt and hardeſt Hawk that is, when ſhe ſhall have continual hard flying, and kills oft, you may with diſcretion in the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty give bloudy rewards, and three or four times in the week ſuppers of the ſame, as Pheaſants and Partridges heads and necks: Always being mindful in time of reſt to feed with meat clean dreſt, hard waſhed and dried again, to hold the ſtomach right and ſharp withal, elſe no ſubjection to be looked for abroad when ſhe is at liberty.</p>
                     <p>All the flying time, but eſpecially when you fly to the covert, (it being then uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cold weather) ſuffer not your <hi>Goſhawk</hi> to be too long faſting, for it breedeth much wind in her, and is a ſpecial means, with cold adjoyned, to take down her fleſh, which at that time will not very eaſily be put on again. Therefore for every Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day provide a reaſonable meal of clean-dreſt meat, the which you muſt keep in a fair cloth: Then in the morning, ſuddenly after ſhe hath caſt, give one bit when her Hood is on. Alſo if you chance to ſpend an hour more before you find your flight, give her another bit, and ſo after this manner, proportioning her meat to the time of her being abroad, that ſhe never be over-empty, and yet have a perfect appetite and good courage to fly.</p>
                     <p>When ever you feed with cold meat you need not waſh it: But I would adviſe you to uſe it as ſeldom as you may, for a continuance of it breeds poverty and many diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>Whenever you have ſet down your Hawk off your Fiſt hooded or unhooded, come not to take her up again without uſing your voice in whiſtling or chirping to her, alſo without ſome bit of meat, or a ſtump to pleaſe her withal; for ſo you ſhall work in her an everlaſting love and deſire of your coming and company.</p>
                     <p>Alſo when you ſet her on your Pearch hooded, let her not know where it ſtandeth, if ſhe do, ſhe will have a longing to be there, and will not reſt quietly on the Fiſt after ſhe is once within doors: Whereas till ſhe be throughly reclaimed and flying, and till ſhe hath been well flown, your Fiſt for the moſt part muſt be her Pearch, and ſhe muſt know no other. For theſe be <hi>Hawks</hi> that in their firſt making with a little reſt will quickly forget what they were formerly taught, and return to their wildneſs again.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe is untowardly or frowardly diſpoſed, endure her unquietneſs with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and gentleneſs, and evermore have ſome ſtump in a readineſs to appeaſe her anger.</p>
                     <p>In the time of her inſeaming and reclaiming give her not her dinner at any time all at once, for thereby you ſhall prolong the time of her making: For her ſtomach once full ſhe will mind you no more, therefore divide it in the forepart of the day, and let her jump often to the Fiſt for it.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe is firſt to be entred put her upon the higheſt pin of hunger, and then ſhe will ſhew all the mettle that is in her, and when ſhe hath once taken her prey rather die than forſake it: Whereas if her ſtomach be imperfect, the leaſt occaſion that may be, as the approach of her Keeper, or any other man, the appearance of either Horſe or Dog, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be ſufficient to cauſe her to forſake it and go her way.</p>

                     <head>§. IV. <hi>How to make a Goſhawk like the Hood, that hath with ill uſage been beaten out of love with it.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>CArry a Hood of ſome notable colour on your finger, that may well be ſeen and viewed by her as it hangeth there, and ſo as ſhe may feed cloſe by it for a week together, but beware you do not as yet ſhew it her with your other hand. But then take it gently in your other hand, and move and ſtir it about her meat, that ſhe may touch it as ſhe eats. This do another week, ſtill letting the Hood reſt on your little in her ſight between feeding times. Uſe this courſe till without fear ſhe will but thus endure it. Then you muſt hold your meat in the hand ſhe ſits on, and with the other hand hold the Hood by the Taſſel upon the meat, moving and ſtirring it as though you would keep her from feeding; but it muſt be done ſoftly and gently: When you ſhall perceive that ſhe will ſtrive to feed beſide it, you ſhall hold it by the Taſſel juſt over the meat, ſo that ſhe muſt needs eat clean through it. Do thus ſo long as till you ſee that ſhe will feed and ſearch boldly through the hood for her meat, and eat it without any ſnatching or fear. Then as ſhe is feeding, and doth thruſt through the Hood for her meat, do you bear the Hood a little againſt her, and ſhe will hood and unhood herſelf as often as you would have her. When ſhe hath with your aſſiſtance put on her Hood, let her eat freely until ſhe hath done, and take it off no more till feeding time again. In this manner, within a month and leſs ſhe will be brought to hood her ſelf with the leaſt ſtump you carry about you, as often as you ſhall have occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Practiſe not this till ſhe be come to a perfect ſtomach, for if you do, you mar your Hawk for ever.</p>
                  </div>

                     <head>§. V. <hi>To reclaim a Goſhawk from the Cage.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>GIve her a fortnights carriage or more in her rufter-hood, always ſtroaking her with your hand or a feather. Be careful to feed clean with waſhed meat, for ſo ſhe will be the ſooner brought to a good ſtomach, and be gentle and well pleaſed to be handled. This obtained (which you ſhall perceive by her liſtening to your voice, or eager feeding) ſome evening waſh and pepper her well. Then take off her rufter-hood, having another ready to put on: As ſhe grows to be a little dry put on her Hood, and give her a bit of good meat upon it to pleaſe and refreſh her. Hold this courſe to hood gently, and unhood now and then, not forgetting her reward ever after it is on, untill ſhe be throughly dried, and afterwards the moſt part of the night: Then you may ſet her down bare-faced to have two or three hours reſt; and be ſure it be in a ſpecial warm place, and on a dry and warm Pearch on high, for theſe kind of Hawks are very ſubject to take cold, and apt to have the cramp on ſuch occaſions.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe and your ſelf have taken a little reſt, go ſoftly to her with ſhew of meat in your hand, withal chirping or whiſtling to her, and take her gently on your Fiſt, and dividing her meat into ſeveral parts beſtow it on her for the moſt part when her Hood is put on: This will make her love and look for the Hood expecting to be fed; if ſhe be nice in ſuffering your hand or the Hood to come near her head, you muſt ſeldom do it in the day time, but at her feeding, and late at night, when ſhe will be more willing to take it.</p>
                     <p>Next teach her to jump and come to the Fiſt. For though other Hawks are uſed to come to the Lure thrown ſome diſtance from the man; yet ſhe being a Hawk of the Fiſt, muſt be taught and uſed to come boldly to the hand, and without fear to ſeize and ſit upon it during your pleaſure, which ſhe will never be brought to do with all the Art in the world, if her ſtomach be any way imperfect.</p>
                     <p>This obtained, let her be called a little further off, <hi>viz.</hi> twenty or forty yards at moſt: By dividing one meal (as I ſaid) let her come oftentimes in a day if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: Which will quickly make her perfect, that ſhe will never check at the Fiſt, but will come and draw at any time of the day: Whereas uſing her to one hour for her meal, cauſes her not to come or draw till that time; which is an ill quality.</p>
                     <p>

[He wiſhes not to be too haſty in flying Goſhawks before they be throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and taught, but to take ſufficient time to teach them. And he affirmeth, that if a Hawk be too much impoveriſhed and her fleſh taken off, ſhe will loſe her ſpirit and mettle, how good ſoever ſhe was, and will neither fly well, nor ever laſt healthful.]</p>
                     <p>Now it will be good time to call her looſe. In doing which ſhun all places near Houſes and Towns, to avoid the inconveniences of her being tempted aſide by Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Dove-houſes, and ſuch like places, which all theſe Hawks are ſubject to; and having once caught ſuch an ill property they will ſeldom or never be reclaimed from it, how far ſoever from any Town they ſhall be flown: Walk therefore with her to the young Woods betimes in the afternoon, having before prepared her ſtomach, and there put her up into a tree, walking along from her, uſing your voice ſoftly as though you had Spaniels with you, but chiefly to her in chirping and whiſtling: By which means no doubt ſhe will draw and follow after you with little noiſe, Then ſuffer her not too long, but call her to your fiſt again, and reward her with ſome bit of meat, or Leg of a Pigeon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to pleaſe her. Then put her up again, and by your ſofteſt voice or whiſtle draw her after you again. To uſe a loud voice would be a means to make her ſit and loiter behind you ſo far as ſhe can hear you, which is an ill quality: And beſides, to make your Spaniels range far off, and ſpring out of the way far from you, which muſt needs be much diſpleaſing both to Man and Hawk.</p>
                     <p>To make your Hawk familiar with your Dogs, firſt feed her amongſt them all very oft upon your Fiſt: Then throw oftentimes from you among the thickeſt of them the dead Pelt of a Pullet or Hen in a ſhort Cruce, that ſhe may fly from your Fiſt, and eagerly chop among them, and ſeiſe upon the ſame, ſuffering her to plume a while: then take her to your Fiſt with a ſtump. This courſe you muſt uſe every day often, till you find that ſhe will venture boldly among them all. She will ſoon perceive and underſtand by the Dogs giving way with fear unto her, that ſhe hath even got the upper hand of them, and ſo will never fear them in the field or covert, or be beaten off her Game by them, as otherwiſe ſhe would.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>PRovide three or four hand-Partridges, with a companion, and one couple of ſtaunch Spaniels; then go into the field, having prepared your Hawk with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and courage to fly. Then one of you ſhall go near hand from the other unto ſome buſhes or other covert, whereas he ſhall ſpend his voice to the Dogs after the accuſtomed manner, and uſing ſome blows with his Pole, he ſhall ſecretly let the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge ſpring as from forth the ſame, with ſuch judgment in the delivery as that the Hawk may ſee it, crying with a loud voice, <hi>Howe, Howe, Howe,</hi> that ſhe may learn to know the word of warning, when ſhe ſhould at any other time look about her, and be watchful at an inſtant to take her advantage. This done, and your Hawk flying after it with ſpirit, and taking it, be ſure with all expedition to get in to her, that no Dog or other thing may fright her, or deprive her of it: But ſuffer her to plume and take her pleaſure on it, and further to take bloud thereon, ſtill having the Spaniels in ſight cloſe by her. Then you muſt teach her to take the head in her foot, and eat it on the ground: And when ſhe hath ſo done, and looketh about her, having your Spaniels by you, through the Partridges pelt (as before in her firſt teaching) once among the Dogs, and let her take it being in her Leaſh, that ſhe may not carry it from you: And whilſt ſhe ſits there and plumes make her ſupper ready; take her gently to your Fiſt, and there content her. By thus ordering and uſing of her, you will without doubt very ſuddenly have an excellent Hawk: And by all means fly her to the field all the firſt year, and let her not ſee the <hi>Pheaſant</hi> at all, for that will draw her love from the <hi>Partridge,</hi> and make her give them over; being a ſhorter flight.</p>
                     <p>When you have thus entred and blouded her, and alſo killed three or four <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges</hi> more from the mark at the retrive, and perceive that ſhe knows a <hi>Partridge</hi> by ſight, and the accuſtomed terms, and will go readily from the Fiſt thereto; be ſure, that all the fore-part of the year you let her go no more one flight in ten, near to the riſing of her Game, for that will make her ſlothful; the <hi>Partridge</hi> being then weak,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:63869:220"/>
and ſhe taking them eaſily at the ſowce in a ſhort ſpace, ſhe will afterward remember it, and look for the ſame order, and without it will not fly towards the latter end of the year, but if the <hi>Partridge</hi> be ſprung far from her, will make as if ſhe ſaw it not, and fly to the next tree ſhe meets with.</p>
                     <p>Some <hi>Hawks</hi> have an ill property, that when they have flown a <hi>Partridge</hi> hard to any covert, and take it not at the firſt flight, there will they ſit ſtill on the ground, and not get up to any ſtand for their better advantage. To amend which fault, when your Hawk hath flown a <hi>Partridge,</hi> make after her with all the ſpeed you can, taking your Dogs with you by your command, and when you have found her, be ſure to take her up, but not on your Fiſt by any means, if there be either hedge or tree near hand, but take her by the body or ſhoulders ſuddenly with both your hands, and throw her upon either hedg, buſh, or tree, and then beat for the Partridge, when as it is impoſſible but ſhe muſt ſee it; if it doth ſpring then, and ſhe fly after and kill it, well. This courſe being well followed will certainly reclaim her from that fault, and teach her to riſe her ſelf; for ſhe will quickly underſtand that elſe ſhe ſhall be caught and toſt up, and alſo that thereby ſhe ſhall enjoy ſome pleaſure and content. This is a common and laſting fault of the <hi>Eyas</hi> Hawk or brancher, ſeldom of the <hi>Haggard,</hi> and therefore you need not fear frighting or angring her by ſo doing.</p>
                     <p>It is in my opinion the moſt commendable and ſafe way after one of theſe Hawks is firſt entred, and only knows a <hi>Partridge,</hi> then immediately to teach her and uſe her to fly from forth the Hood. Often bating at Partridges ſprung to other Hawks diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and diſcourages her: Beſides, ſhe will, if carried bare-fac'd, be very ſtirring and unquiet on the Fiſt, not a Dog can ſtir, or bird riſe, but ſhe will offer to be gone. Let her alſo ſit and weather in the Hood, and never take it off but when ſhe ſhall either fly, feed, bathe, or is to take her reſt at night.</p>

                     <head>§. VII. <hi>How to enter your Goſhawk to the Covert.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>NO man is fit to order and manage a <hi>Goſhawk</hi> to the covert but he that hath a ſtrong and able body, and a good ſpirit and courage to follow her, for in this ſport, and with this Hawk he muſt altogether truſt to his feet.</p>
                     <p>Here becauſe the man cannot follow by view to ſuccour the Hawk, you ought to be chary of what place you enter her in, eſpecially that ſhe may be there well guarded and kept from taking any miſlike or offence at the Dogs, the which if ſhe ſhould do at the beginning ſhe will never indure them again: For it is the ſudden ruſhing of the Spaniels upon her, (their ſight by means of the covert being obſcured) that breeds this offence. The beſt time to enter her is early before the leaf do ſtir; for then the Pheaſant flies not far. Alſo afterwards the nature of them is to leave the young ſhoots and ſmall groves, and draw to the high and thickeſt woods.</p>
                     <p>Having made good choice of your place, and let your Hawk go unto her flight, you muſt be ſure to command your Dogs to you till you have found her; then if ſhe have killed, you have your deſire; if not, and that you chance to find her on the ground, (as it may well be you may, for many of them at their firſt entring will be very hot and eager of that ſport, and oftentimes ſeeking for it on the ground) if there be any tree near hand, that ſhe may well ſee from it, put her up into the ſame, otherwiſe keep her on your Fiſt and beat for it again. Then if ſhe do fly and kill it, you muſt be ſure to make ſtay of the Dogs till you have found her: Which done you ſhall get gently in to her, and if you diſlike the place for the uneaſineſs or thickneſs, draw her gently to another more open, where ſhe may with more eaſe and quiet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy her prey; and there ſuffer her to plume and take her pleaſure on it a while. Then call your Dogs to you, and walk and ſtir gently about her, with ſome moderate ruſling and buſtling in the buſhes, the better to acquaint her with the ſame noiſe. Then when you ſee it convenient ſtoop to it on your knees, and rending the Chaps give her bloud in the throat, where it will iſſue abundantly, to her great content. Then covering the body with your hat, pluck of the head, and give it her in her foot, to eat on the ground: And having your Spaniels cloſe by you, when ſhe hath done, and beginneth to look about her, throw the Pheaſant as it were in their very mouths, that ſhe may, together with ſome words of rebuke from your ſelf, make them give way with fear unto her, yet drawing them into her ſight again, ſo long to remain as ſhe is on the ground, and till you make ready her ſupper. And when you ſee ſhe
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:63869:220"/>
hath taken her ſufficient pleaſure, exchange that artificially with her, and let her eat it on the ground where the quarry lay, only reſerving ſome little thing to take her to your Fiſt withal: And then put on her Hood, not forgetting to beſtow ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on her afterward, which ſhe will be well pleaſed withal.</p>
                     <p>To make your <hi>Goſhawk</hi> with boldneſs take a <hi>Pheaſant</hi> from the Pearch, before you offer to fly her thereto, provide a young Capon or brown Pullet, and take it with you to the Wood, and when you call her to her ſupper, as ſhe is drawing and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending after you, having a Pole fit for the purpoſe provided, call your Spaniels about you, to make them bay, and ſuddenly breaking the neck of the Poultry, lift it up on a bough, ſo high as the Hawk may well have ſight of it, there ſtirring it, and withal crying, <hi>Abay, abay</hi> to her: At which noiſe, and ſeeing it flutter, no doubt ſhe will come in, and pull it down: Which if ſhe ſhall do, be ſure that the Dogs may with ſome rebuke from your ſelf, make way for her deſcending, and then ſuffer her to plume and take her pleaſure thereon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as was before directed: And in uſing this courſe but a while, ſhe will become ſo bold and venturous, as that the <hi>Pheaſant</hi> ſhall no ſooner go to Pearch, but ſhe will have him by the ears, and pull him down.</p>
                     <p>By threatning words and blows, with reaſon, you may bring your Spaniels into ſuch ſubjection, as to truſt them alone with your Hawk in your abſence: taking care there be no ſtrange Dogs among them: For one ſtrange unruly Dog is ſufficient to mar all the reſt, and the <hi>Hawk</hi> too.</p>
                     <p>Be careful to enter your Goſhawk firſt to the <hi>Cock-Pheaſant,</hi> for the verieſt daſtard that is will kill the Hen; which if you enter her firſt to, it may be afterward with all your Art and Skill you ſhall never force her to fly at the Cock. If you find that at firſt ſhe is afraid to buckle with him, then with two or three days reſt prepare her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach ſoundly, and put her to him again.</p>

                     <p>It is the nature of theſe <hi>Hawks</hi> when wild to feed on their prey in covert places, where they may not be deſcried by ſuch other birds as love them not: Wherefore alſo being reclaimed, whenſoever they take it in any Plain or Champain place, they will be apt to carry it to the next harbour or covert: To reclaim her from this ill quality you muſt take this courſe. Though you do call and draw her along after you by your chirping and whiſtle through the thick and covert places, yet do not there take her to your Fiſt to be fully ſatisfied, but let her ſtill wait on you, till you come to ſome plain place, and there entertain her to the Fiſt, and let her feed a little there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then put to her Leaſh, and let her eat the reſt on the ground cloſe by you, and having reſerved ſome ſtump, take her to the Fiſt. Remember that you ſometimes ſtoop gently on your knee, and quietly and ſoftly convey ſome bits unſeen afar off to her, that ſhe ſtrike not at your hand with her Talons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus doing daily with gentle uſage ſo long as you call her, you will embolden her, and make her ſo familiar as never to offer to carry any thing from you.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe kills, be ſure to get in gently to her, having before provided her a meal ready dreſt, and as ſhe ſits on the <hi>Partridge,</hi> beſtow the ſame on her in bits with clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyance, which will prolong her time in pluming, and ſtay the ſharpneſs of her appetite, and deſire to feed, which ſhe muſt not do, for it would cauſe her to love the Bird better than your ſelf, and to be loth afterwards at any time to be bereaved of it, and thereby take occaſion to carry it from you, hoping to enjoy it to her ſelf more quietly and ſecretly: Whereas this courſe will ſo pleaſe her, and draw her love ſo certainly to you, as ſhe will never after offer to carry one feather from you. All this while give her no bloud at all, but with ſome reverſion take her to your Fiſt again. By this means ſhe will never break the Prey ſo long as there is one feather left on it, <note place="margin">I ſpeak this by experience and on my credit.</note> but ſtill attend for your coming, and to have a reward only at your hand. When you have well nuzled up and inured her herein, afterward when you find her with a <hi>Partridge</hi> in her foot; then after a good time ſpent in pluming, take off the head and

                     <p>A <hi>Goſhawk</hi> that was good in her ſoarage, many times proves worſe after mewing: Becauſe in her ſoarage ſhe was not cheriſhed to make her take delight in her flight. For the chief skill of an <hi>Oſtreger</hi> conſiſts in coying and cheriſhing his Hawk, ſo as ſhe may take pride in her flight. Wherefore it were good at her firſt entring to have always a train-Partridge in his Bag, to ſerve her withal if need be, and ſo win her love.</p>
                     <p>Ply your Hawk with Tiring and Plumage morning and evening; for that will open her head; and caſt out the moiſt humours, wherewith Goſhawks are naturally trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. Let her Tiring be a Rump of Beef, or the Pinion of a Wing, or a Chickens Leg, given by the fire, or in the warm Sun, which will not only open her head but keep her in exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>Give her every night caſting either of feathers or Cotton, and in the morning mark whether it be wrought round or not, whether it be ſweet or not, whether it be moiſt or dry, and of what colour the water is that drops out of it: For thereby you may judge in what caſe your Hawk is. You muſt alſo have regard to the mewts, whether they be clean or not.</p>
                     <p>In Winter and cold weather ſet your Hawk warm, in ſome place where fire is made, and roll your Pearch with Cotton, or ſome ſuch like thing. Set your Pearch far from the wall, that your Hawk hurt not her feathers when ſhe bateth. If it be not cold, ſet her every morning in ſome place where the Sun hath power for an hour or two.</p>
                     <p>Let no Hens or Poultry come near the place where your Hawk ſhall pearch.</p>
                     <p>In the Spring offer your Hawk to the water every week, or elſe ſhe will ſoar away when ſhe fleeth, and make you ſeek her. If any time ſhe bathes of her own accord after her flight, if it be Winter, go preſently to the next houſe, and weather her by a fire with her back to it, and not her gorge, for that would make her ſick: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe dry her if you have carried her in the rain.</p>
                     <p>Keep her luſty and high, and yet her ſtomach ſo ſharp, that ſhe may fly eagerly. The plucking down a Hawk mars her, and makes her cowardly; and liable to ſickneſs and infirmity.</p>
                     <p>Keep your Hawk clean, and her feathers whole, and if a feather be broken or bruiſed imp it preſently.</p>
                     <p>The firſt year it is beſt to fly your <hi>Goſhawk</hi> to the field, and not to the covert, for ſo they will learn to hold out and not turn tail in the midſt of their flight: And when they are mewed Hawks you may make them do what you will; it is better to let them be a littleramage than over-manned.</p>
                     <p>Her feeding is beſt on hot meats: And if you would breed her to kill great fowl, make her trains thereof: And if you would have her continue thoſe flights never fly at leſs, for that will take her off from them and ſpoil her.</p>
                     <p>If you would make her to fly with a Dog to aſſiſt her, feed her with great fowl, and your Dogs with fleſh tied under their Wings. If you train your Hawk with them, reward her upon the train, and your Dog with her: This will make them acquainted together. Thus continue doing till your Dog throughly knows his duty: And be ſure to keep your Dog tied up, for if you let him go looſe, it will ſpoil the beſt Dog that is: And never give him a reward but when he makes in at ſuch Fowls to reſcue the Hawk.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Sparhawk</hi> (ſaith <hi>Latham)</hi> though a demy-creature, yet for her ſpirit and mettle is worthy to march in the beſt company: Nay, there is no better Hawk than ſhe, if ſhe be kept, as ſhe ought to be, luſty and ſtrong. Beſides, he that knows how to man, reclaim and fly a <hi>Sparrow-hawk,</hi> may eaſily know how to keep and deal with all other Hawks.</p>
                     <p>And herein lieth an excellency in the <hi>Sparrow-hawk,</hi> ſhe ſerves both for Winter and Summer with great pleaſure, and will fly at all kind of Game more than the <hi>Falcon.</hi> If the Winter <hi>Sparrow-hawk</hi> prove good, ſhe will kill the <hi>Pie,</hi> the <hi>Chough,</hi> the <hi>Jay,</hi> the <hi>Woodcock, Thruſh, Blackbird, Fieldfare: Latham</hi> adds the <hi>Rook, Mew, Lapwing, Ring-dove, Houſe-dove.</hi> To be kept ſtrongly in the Hood and flown from it, ſhe is a moſt excellent Hawk, and will kill more <hi>Partridge</hi> in one day than the beſt long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winged Hawk will do in two.</p>
                     <p>Her diet ſhould be of the daintieſt meat, unleſs in times of reſt, and then alſo well waſht and dried again, eſpecially if ſhe be mewd.</p>
                     <p>Againſt ſhe is to fly ſhe muſt be prepared with a ſhort cut, to put a perfect edge upon her, and then ſhe will fly after the beſt manner. Alſo ſhe ſhould not be flown in the Morning, unleſs ſhe be prepared over night with a ſhort and clean ſupper for the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe you ought to have always about you a little box full of freſh Butter, mixt with a little Saffron and Sugar-candy, to give with her meat now and then; or let her eat it out of the box: Which ſhe will do with great delight, and it will keep her head evermore looſe, and in good temper, and alſo prevent the Cray, and keep her proud and full of ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Eyas</hi> or <hi>Nyas</hi> Sparrow-hawk (which is of greateſt difficulty to bring to perfection) you muſt firſt feed her in ſome cool room, which hath two Windows, the one to the North, and the other to the Eaſt, which muſt be open and barred over with Laths, not ſo wide for a Hawk to get out, or Vermine to come in: Strow the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with freſh leaves, and do in every reſpect to this Room, as was ordered for the mewing of the Falcon.</p>
                     <p>You muſt feed your <hi>Eyas</hi> with Sparrows, young Pigeons, and Sheeps hearts. Whilſt ſhe is very young and little, you ſhould cut her meat, or ſhred it into ſmall pellets, and feed her twice or thrice aday, according as you find her <hi>endew</hi> it or <hi>put it over.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When ſhe is full ſummed and flieth about, then give her whole ſmall Birds, and ſometimes feed her on your Fiſt, ſuffering her to ſtrain and kill the Birds in your hand; and ſometimes put live Birds into the Chamber where ſhe is, that ſhe may learn to foot and to kill them; and let her feed upon them in your preſence: By this courſe you will not only <hi>neal</hi> her, but take her off from that ſcurvy quality of hiding her Prey when ſhe hath ſeiſed it, a natural property belonging to all Eyaſſes. Likewiſe every morning go into the Room, call her to your Fiſt, whiſtle and uſe ſuch terms as you would have her hereafter acquainted with. When ſhe hath put forth all her Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and is full ſummed, then take her out of the Chamber, and furniſh her with Bells, Bewets, Jeſſes, and Lines.</p>
                     <p>It will be altogether requiſite to ſeel her at firſt, that ſhe may the better endure the Hood and handling: And let it be a Rufter-hood, that is large and eaſie, which you muſt pull off and put on frequently, ſtroaking her often on the Head, till ſhe will ſtand gently.</p>
                     <p>In the evening by Candle-light unſeel her, giving her ſomewhat to tire upon, handling, and ſtroaking her feathers gently, hooding and unhooding heras often as you think fit.</p>
                     <p>Before I proceed any farther, I ſhall inform you how to ſeel a Hawk after the beſt manner. Take a Needle threaded with untwiſted Thread, and caſting your Hawk, take her by the Beak, and put the Needle through her Eye-lid, not right againſt the Sight of the Eye, but ſomewhat nearer the Beak, that ſhe may have liberty to ſee backward; and have eſpecial care that you hurt not the Web: Then put your Needle through the other Eye-lid, drawing the ends of the Thread together, tie them over the Beak, not with a ſtreight knot, but cut off the Threads near to the end of the knot, and ſo twiſt them together, that the Eye-lids may be raiſed ſo upwards that the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:63869:222"/>
Hawk may not ſee at all, but as the Thread ſhall ſlacken, ſhe ſhall be able to ſee back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards only, which is the cauſe that the Thread is put nearer the Beak.</p>
                     <p>When your <hi>Eyas</hi> is well won to the Hood and to the Fiſt, let her kill ſmall Birds thereon; then call her two or three days or longer, till ſhe will come far off; then take a live Pigeon tied by the foot with a Creance, and ſtir it till your Hawk will bate at it and ſeiſe it, but not far off, that you may quickly help her at the firſt, leſt the Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtruggling with her ſhe prove too ſtrong, and ſo diſcourage your young Hawk: Then let her plume and foot her, and feed her thereupon, whiſtling the while, that ſhe may know it another time: Then hood her, and let her plume and tire a little.</p>
                     <p>You may uſe her to Trains of Chicken and Quail: And when ſhe will ſeiſe readily by often Training, ride out with her in the morning into the Fields, where calling your Sparrow-hawk to your Fiſt, and giving her a bit or two, go with your Spaniels to ſeek ſome <hi>Beavy</hi> of young Quails, advancing your Fiſt aloft, that your Hawk may ſee them when they ſpring, flying her at advantage: If ſhe kill, reward her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if ſhe miſs, ſerve her with a Train of a Quail.</p>
                     <p>Let your Dogs hunt on your right hand when they range, but eſpecially when they <hi>queſt</hi> and <hi>call,</hi> to the end you may the better caſt off your Hawk. When your Hawk is throughly entred and well <hi>nouzled,</hi> you may then hold your hand low, for ſhe will now bate at the <hi>Whurr:</hi> But whatever you do, have a quick eye and a good regard to the Spaniels, not coveting to be too near them, but a little above them, that you may let your Hawk fly coaſting at the advantage when the Game ſpringeth.</p>

                     <p>HAving ſpoken of the firſt kind of Sparrow-hawks, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Eyas,</hi> the other four in the title of this Chapter muſt conſequently be diſcourſed of.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall give you but few inſtructions, for in effect the ſame precepts that ſerve for the <hi>Eyas</hi> will ſerve alſo for the <hi>Brancher, Soar, Mew'd,</hi> and <hi>Haggard</hi> Hawks; only this, theſe four laſt require not ſo much pains to be taken to make them know their Game as the Eyas, becauſe they have been accuſtomed to prey for themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Above all things the Falconer muſt take them off from their ill cuſtom of <hi>carrying,</hi> and that may be done by ſerving them with great Trains, whereby they will learn to abide on the Quarry.</p>
                     <p>Be very mindful of <hi>coying</hi> them as much as you can, for they will remember a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or injury better than any other Hawk.</p>
                     <p>If the Hawk be newly taken, and will not feed, then rub her Feet with warm fleſh, whiſtling to her, and ſometimes putting the fleſh unto her Beak: If ſhe will not yet feed, rub her Feet with a live Bird; if at the crying of the Bird the Hawk ſeiſe it with her Feet, it is a ſign ſhe will feed; then tear off the Skin and Feathers of the Birds Breaſt, and put the Bird to her Beak, and ſhe will eat.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe will feed upon your whiſtle and chirp, then hood her with a Rufter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and feed her betimes in the morning; and when ſhe hath endewed, give her a Beaching in the day-time, and every time you hood her give her a bit or two; at evening give her the Brains of a Hen for her ſupper: and in every thing elſe order theſe Hawks aforeſaid as you do the Falcon and the reſt.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>SOme uſe to put their Sparrow-Hawk into the Mew as ſoon as they leave flying her, cutting off both her Bewets, Lines, and knots of her Jeſſes, and ſo leave them in the Mew till they are clean mewed.</p>
                     <p>If you will have your Sparrow-Hawk to fly at Quail, Partridge, or Pheaſant Powt, then you muſt draw her in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and bear her on the Fiſt till ſhe be clean and throughly enſeamed.</p>
                     <p>Others keep their Sparrow-Hawks on the Pearch until <hi>March,</hi> and then throw them into the Mew, peppering them for Lice if they have any. Her Mew ſhould be a Chamber aloft from the ground, eight or nine foot long, and about ſix foot broad: Her Windows and Pearches muſt be like the Goſhawks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="431" facs="tcp:63869:222"/>
Her Mew being thus provided, in <hi>May</hi> go in to her in an evening by Candle-light, and taking her up ſoftly, pull out all her Train-Feathers one after another: This ſhall make her mew the faſter, eſpecially if you feed her with hot meat and Birds, obſerving a certain hour to feed her in.</p>
                     <p>Once in fourteen days ſet water before her in the Mew: If you perceive ſhe hath any Feathers or Down which ſtand ſtaring upon her Back, ſitting as if ſhe would rouze, then ſet her water ſooner. If you put water by her continually, it delays her Mewing; and to keep it always from her cauſeth her to mew her Feathers uncleanly: But water once in a fortnight is the beſt medium for her Mewing between thoſe two extremes.</p>

               <head>PART II. <hi>Of Diſeaſes and dangerous Accidents incident to</hi> Hawks, <hi>and their ſeveral Cures.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is neceſſary for a skilful Falconer not only to know how to man, reclaim, keep, fly, imp, and mew his Hawks, with other things pertinent to that purpoſe, but alſo to know their Diſeaſes, with the proper Cures of them, and other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents frequently befalling Hawks, both in their Flights and otherways.</p>
               <p>Before we ſhall characterize their Maladies, and preſcribe rules for their Cures, it will be requiſite to tell you that Hawks, as well as men, (which ſeems ſomewhat ſtrange) have four complexions, the true Indicators of their natures: And as in man his natural Complexion and Conſtitution is known by his Skin, ſo is the Temperament and natural Diſpoſition of a Hawk by her Coat and Plume. This opinion hath not been only averred by the Ancients, but confirmed by the modern experience of the skilful in the noble Art of Hawking. Take it in this manner.</p>
               <p>Falcons that are <hi>black</hi> are <hi>Melancholic,</hi> and are to be phyſicked with hot and moiſt Medicines, becauſe their Complexion is cold and dry; for which purpoſe Aloes, Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Cocks-fleſh, Pigeons, Sparrows, Goats-fleſh, and the like, are very good.</p>
               <p>Falcons <hi>blank</hi> are <hi>Phlegmatick,</hi> and muſt have Phyſic hot and dry, becauſe Phlegm is cold and moiſt; to which purpoſe Cinnamon, Cloves, Cardamum, Goats-fleſh, Choughs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are very good.</p>
               <p>Falcons <hi>ruſſet</hi> are <hi>Sanguine</hi> and <hi>Cholerick</hi> indifferently mixt, and their Phyſic muſt be cold, moderately moiſt and dry, as Myrtles, Caſſia fiſtula, Tamarinds, Vinegar, Lambs-fleſh, and Pullets.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the Complexions: now for the Diſeaſes and their Cures.</p>
               <div n="1" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of Caſtings and Mewtings, either good or bad, according to their ſeveral Complexions and ſmells.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CAſtings</hi> are of two ſorts, <hi>Plumage,</hi> or <hi>Cotton:</hi> The latter is moſt commonly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Pellets, which muſt be about the bigneſs of an Hazel-nut, made of fine ſoft white Cotton: After ſhe hath ſupt you muſt convey this into her Gorge.</p>
                  <p>In the morning diligently obſerve how ſhe hath <hi>rolled</hi> and caſt it, whereby you ſhall know whether ſhe be in a bad or good condition: For example, if ſhe caſt it round, white, not ſtinking, nor very moiſt or wateriſh, you may conclude her ſound; but if ſhe roll it not well, but caſt it long, with properties contrary to the former, then ſhe is unſound and full of Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if her Caſting be either black, green, yellowiſh, ſlimy, or ſtinking, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes your Hawk to be diſeaſed. The former Caſting is remedied by hot meats; the latter by feeding her well, and waſhing her meats in cool water, as of Endive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and give her one or two Caſtings of Cotton, incorporating therewith Incenſe and Mummy. But if ſhe continue notwithſtanding in this condition, give her an upward Scowring made thus: Take Aloes pulverized one ſcruple, powder of Cloves four grains, powder of Cubebs three grains, incorporate theſe, and wrap them in Cotton, and give it your Hawk empty, having no meat in her Pannel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="432" facs="tcp:63869:223"/>
Caſting of <hi>Plumage</hi> is to be obſerved as the former Caſting: That is, if in the morning you find them round, and not ſtinking, it is a good ſign; but if long, ſlimy, with indigeſted fleſh ſticking to the ſame, and having an ill ſent, it is very bad. Here note, that by how much the more ſweet or ſtinking the Caſting is, by ſo much is the Hawk in a better or worſe condition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mewts</hi> muſt be obſerved as well as Caſtings, in this manner: If the Mewt be <hi>white,</hi> not very thick nor clear, having no black ſpot in it, or but very little, it is a ſign of the healthy conſtitution of the Hawk; but if it be white and very thick in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, though it doth not import ſickneſs, yet it ſheweth her to be too groſs and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of greaſe, which you muſt remedy by giving her moiſt meats, as the Heart of a Calf or Lamb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for two mornings after give her ſome Sugar-Candy, or elſe the Gut of a Chicken well waſht, and filled with Oyl-Olive: Either of theſe will ſcour her, and make her to <hi>ſliſe</hi> freely.</p>
                  <p>It is a very bad and mortal ſign to ſee your Hawks Mewt full of variety of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: therefore you muſt ſpeedily prevent enſuing miſchiefs by giving her Mummy purified and beaten to powder, wrapping it in Cotton.</p>
                  <p>If the Mewt be more <hi>yellow</hi> than white, then doth ſhe abound with Choler pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from great Flights in hot weather, alſo from much Bating. This is remedied by waſhing her meat in Bugloſs, Endive, Borage, and ſuch like cold waters, wringing the ſaid meat after you have ſo waſhed it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>black</hi> Mewt is a moſt deadly ſign, and if it continue four days ſhe will peck over the Pearch and die. If ſhe mewt ſo but once, there is no great danger, for it proceeds either from the Bloud or Guts of the Fowl in tiring, or elſe from being gorged with filthy meats: In this caſe give her good warm meat and Cotton-caſting, with the powder of Cloves, Nutmeg, and Ginger, or Mummy alone.</p>
                  <p>If the Mewt be <hi>green,</hi> it is a bad ſign, and denotes her troubled with an infected and corrupt Liver, or with ſome Apoſteme, unleſs ſhe be a Rammage Hawk, and then that ſign holds not good. Her Cure is, by feeding her with meat powdered with Mummy; if ſhe will not take it with her Food, then give it her in a Scouring or Caſting: But if this ill-coloured Mewting continue ſtill, then give her a Scouring of Agarick, and after that another of Incenſe pulverized to comfort her.</p>
                  <p>The dark <hi>ſanguine</hi> Mewt with a black in it is the moſt deadly ſign of all, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers but little, if any thing, from the former <hi>black</hi> Mewt. A Hawk mewting after this manner is irrecoverable, and therefore it is needleſs to preſcribe a Cure.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The <hi>grey</hi> Mewt like ſour milk is a mortal token, yet curable, as ſhall be ſhewn hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee how requiſite it is for a Falconer to obſerve diligently every morning his Hawks Caſtings and Mewtings, that knowing thereby their Maladies, he may time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find out their Remedies. Let us now proceed to their particular Diſeaſes.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the</hi> Cataract.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Cataract</hi> in the Eyes of a Hawk is a Malady not eaſily removed, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times incurable, when it is too thick, and of a long continuance.</p>
                  <p>It proceedeth from groſs Humours in the Head, which frequently do not only dim, but extinguiſh the Sight: and ſometimes the Hood is the cauſe of this miſchief.</p>
                  <p>The Cure muſt be effected by Scouring her two or three days with Aloes or Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick: Then take the powder of waſht Aloes finely beaten one ſcruple, and two ſcruples of Sugar-Candy; mingle theſe together, and with a quill blow it into your Hawks eye afflicted as aforeſaid three or four times a day. This is the gentleſt and moſt ſovereign medicine of any yet I have tried. But if this will not do, you muſt uſe ſtronger medicines, as the juyce of Celandine roots, bathing her Eyes often with warm Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water wherein hath been boyled the ſeeds of Fengreek.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the</hi> Pantas <hi>or</hi> Aſthma.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Pantas</hi> is a dangerous Diſtemper, and few Hawks eſcape which are afflicted therewith. It happens when the Lungs are as it were ſo baked by exceſſive heat, that the Hawk cannot draw her breath, and when drawn, cannot well emit it again. You may judge of the beginning of this Diſtemper by the Hawks la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring much in the Pannel, moving her Train often up and down at each motion of her Pannel: and ſhe cannot many times mewt or ſliſe, or if ſhe do, ſhe drops it faſt by her. It is known likewiſe by your Hawks frequent opening her Clap and Beak.</p>
                  <p>The beſt Remedy is, to ſcour your Hawk with good Oyl-Olive well waſhed in ſeveral waters till it become clear and white; which you muſt do after this manner: Take an earthen pot with a ſmall hole in the bottom thereof, which you muſt ſtop with your finger; then pour therein your Oyl with a quantity of water, and coil theſe together with a ſpoon till the water grow darkiſh, after which remove your finger, and the water will run out, but the Oyl remain behind floating on the top; thus do ſeven or eight times, till you have throughly purified the Oyl: Then take a Sheeps Gut above an inch long for a Falcon and Goſhawk, but of a leſs length for leſſer Hawks, and fill it with this Oyl, and faſten it with thread at both ends. Your Hawk having firſt caſt, convey this Gut into her Throat, holding her on the Fiſt till ſhe make a Mewt; an hour after ſhe hath done mewting feed her with a Calves Heart, or a Pullets Leg, giving her every third or fourth day a Cotton-caſting with Cubebs and Cloves. I ſhall only add one Receipt more for the <hi>Pantas</hi> or <hi>Aſthma,</hi> and that is the Oyl of ſweet Almonds poured into a waſht Chickens Gut, and given the Hawk; which is of great efficacy in the cure of this Diſeaſe.</p>

                  <p>You may know when ſhe is troubled with them by her caſting her Gorge, her ſtinking Breath, her Trembling and writhing her Train, her croaking in the night, her offering with her Beak at her Breaſt or Pannel, and by her Mewt being ſmall and unclean.</p>
                  <p>You may cure her of them with a Scouring of waſht Aloes Hepatic, Muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed and Agarick, of each an equal quantity; or the Powder of Harts-horn dried; or laſtly, a Scouring of white Dittany, Aloes, Hepatic waſht four or five times, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebs, and a little Saffron wrapt in ſome fleſh, to cauſe her to take it the better.</p>

                  <p>THere are ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Filanders,</hi> but I ſhall ſpeak but of one ſticking to the Reins. They are Worms as ſmall as a Thread, and about an inch long, and lie wrapt up in a thin Skin or Net near the Reins of a Hawk, apart from either Gut or Gorge.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall know when your Hawk is troubled with them by her poverty, by ruffling her Train, by ſtraining the Fiſt or Pearch with her Pounces, and laſtly by croaking in the night when the Filanders prick her. You muſt remedy this Malady betimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Worms have inlarged themſelves from their proper ſtation, roving elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to your Hawks ruine and deſtruction.</p>

                     <pb n="434" facs="tcp:63869:224"/>
You muſt not kill them as other Worms, for fear of Impoſtumes from their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption being incapable to paſs away with the Hawks Mewt; but only ſtupefie them, that they may be offenſive but ſeldom: And that is done thus; Take a head of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, taking away the outmoſt rind; then with a Bodkin heated in the fire make holes in ſome Cloves, then ſteep them in Oyl three days, and after this give her one of the Cloves down her Throat, and for forty days after ſhe will not be troubled with the Filanders. Wherefore a Falconer will ſhew himſelf prudent, if, ſeeing his Hawk low and poor, he give her once a month a Clove of this Garlick for prevention of the Filanders.</p>

                  <p>THeſe <hi>Lice</hi> do moſt infeſt the Head, the Ply of a Hawks Wings, and her Train. In the Winter you may kill them thus: Take two drachms of Pepper beaten to powder, and mingle it with warm water, and with this Lotion waſh the places infeſted with theſe Lice or Mites: Then ſet your Hawk on a Pearch with her Back and Train againſt the Sun; then hold in your hand a ſmall ſtick about a handful long, with a piece of ſoft Wax at the end of it, and with that (whilſt the Hawk is weathering her ſelf) take away thoſe Vermin crawling upon the Feathers. You may do well to add to the Pepper and Water ſome Staveſacre.</p>
                  <p>In the Summer-time you may kill the Lice with <hi>Auripigmentum</hi> beaten to powder, and ſtrowed on the places where they lie.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>How to keep and maintain all manner of Hawks in health, good plight, and liking.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN the firſt place, never give them a great Gorge, eſpecially of groſs meats, as Beef, Pork, and ſuch as are hard to be endewed and put over.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, never feed them with the fleſh of any Beaſt that hath lately gone to Rutt, for that will inſenſibly deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if you are conſtrained to give your Hawk groſs food, let it be well ſoaked firſt in clean water, and afterwards ſufficiently wrung; in Summer with cold water, in Winter with luke-warm water.</p>
                  <p>Ever obſerve to reward your Hawks with ſome good live meat, or elſe they will be brought too low: However by ſerving them with waſht meats is the way to keep them in health.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude how to keep Hawks in perfect health with this moſt excellent Receipt. Take Germander, Pelamountain, Baſil, Grummel-ſeed, and Broom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, of each half an ounce; Hyſſop, Saſſifras, Polypodium, and Horſe-mints, of each a quarter of an ounce, and the like of Nutmegs; Cubebs, Borage, Mummy, Mugwort, Sage, and the four kinds of Mirobolans, of each half an ounce; of Aloes Succotrine the fifth part of an ounce, and of Saffron one whole ounce. All theſe you muſt pulverize, and every eighth or twelfth day give your Hawks the quantity of a Bean thereof with their meat. If they will not take it ſo, put it into a Hens Gut tied at both ends, and let them ſtand empty an hour after.</p>

                  <p>You may perceive it by this, the Beak will grow rugged, and it will begin to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Head.</p>

To remedy this Malady, you muſt take the Gall of a Bull, and break it into a diſh, and add thereto the powder of Aloes Succotrine: Mingle theſe well together, and anoint the Clap or Beak of your Hawk therewith, and the very place where the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica</hi> grows, twice aday; but touch not her Eyes or <hi>Nares:</hi> continue thus doing till your Hawk be perfectly cured, and bath her with Orpiment and Pepper to keep her from other Vermin.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Frownce</hi> proceedeth from moiſt and cold humours which deſcend from the Hawks Head to the Palate and root of the Tongue, by means whereof they loſe their appetite, and cannot cloſe their Clap.

                  <p>You may know if your Hawk be troubled with this Diſtemper by opening her Beak, and ſeeing whether her Tongue be ſwoln or no: If it be, ſhe hath it.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral ways to cure this Diſtemper, but the beſt that ever yet I could find for it is, only to take the powder of Allum reduced to a Salve with ſtrong Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinegar, and waſh the Hawks mouth therewith.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Pip</hi> frequently troubleth Hawks, as it doth Chickens, and proceedeth from cold and moiſtneſs of the Head, or from feeding on groſs meat not well waſht in warm water in the Winter, and cold water in the Summer.</p>
                  <p>The Symptoms of this Diſtemper are the Hawks frequent <hi>Sniting,</hi> and making a noiſe twice or thrice in her Sniting.</p>
                  <p>For the Cure hereof, you muſt caſt your Hawk gently, and look upon the tip of her Tongue, and if you find the Pip there, you muſt ſcour her with a Pill made of Agarick and <hi>Hierapicra</hi> given two or three days together with her Caſting at night; this will cleanſe her Head, and the ſooner if ſhe be made to tire againſt the Sun in the morning: Then bind a little Cotton to the end of a Stick, and dipping it in good Roſe-water waſh her Tongue therewith: After this anoint it three or four days with Oyl of ſweet Almonds and Oyl-Olive well waſhed as before ſaid. Having ſo done, you will find the Pip all white and ſoft: Then take an Awl, and with the Point thereof lift up the Pip ſoftly, and remove it, as women pip their Chickens, but remove it not till it be throughly ripe; and wet her Tongue and Palate twice or thrice a day with the aforeſaid Oyl, till ſhe be throughly cured.</p>

                  <p>THis happens either by being foul within, or by a Surfeit; or elſe when ſhe was low and poor her Keeper over-gorged her, by being too haſty to ſet her up, and ſhe being weak was not able to <hi>put over</hi> and <hi>endew,</hi> and furfeited thereupon.</p>

                  <p>If you feed her with the fleſh of any living Fowl, firſt ſteep it well in the bloud of the ſame Fowl, ſo ſhall your Hawk mount her fleſh apace; if you alſo ſcour her

                  <p>A Hawk may loſe her Appetite by taking too great Gorges in the Evening, which ſhe cannot well endew; or by being foul in the Pannel; or ſometimes by Colds.</p>

                  <p>To ſet her up you muſt feed her, a little at once, and often, with good meat and of light digeſtion, as ſmall Birds, Rats, Mice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or thus: Take two ſpoonfuls of Honey, four of freſh Butter, and boil them together in a new earthen pot of water; then take Pork well waſhed, and ſteep it in that water, giving your Hawk a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gorge thereof twice a day, warming the ſaid water when you intend to feed your Hawk: And get ſome Snails that breed in running waters, and give them her in the morning, and they will not only ſcour away the groſs ſlimy humours which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but alſo nouriſh her exceedingly.</p>

                  <p>A Hawk frequently hath no mind to fly, either by reaſon of her ill keeping, that is, when ſhe is kept by thoſe who know not how to give her her Rights, as <hi>bouzing, bathing,</hi> &amp;c. or becauſe the Hawk is too high and full of greaſe, or too poor and low: By the firſt ſhe becomes proud and coy, and by the latter ſo weak that ſhe wants ſtrength and ſpirit to perform it.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>HAwks have <hi>Swelling</hi> in their <hi>Feet</hi> upon ſeveral accounts: Sometimes by chaſing their Feet in flying their Prey, ſtriking it, and taking cold thereupon; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for want of rolling or lining the Pearch with ſome ſoft warm cloth; or elſe through groſs Humours and Foulneſs within, which through exerciſe drop down into their Feet, and ſo cauſe them to ſwell; laſtly, this Swelling happens by pricks when they fly fiercely into Buſhes after Game.</p>
                  <p>For a Remedy, you muſt ſcour your Hawk three mornings together with the Pills of Lard, Marrow, Sugar, and Saffron, and ſet her in the Sun; two days after this feed her with good meat; then take Bole-Armoniack, and half the quantity of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis Draconis,</hi> and having made them into powder, temper them well together with the white of an Egg and Roſe-water, and anoint her Feet twice a day three or four days together, ſetting her on ſome Cloth to keep her Feet warm.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>How to ſcour Hawks before you caſt them into the Mew.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WHen Mewing time is come, you muſt ſcour and cleanſe your Hawks; for in luring and flying-time by foul feeding they engender Filanders and other Diſtempers, whereof they die for want of timely care and cure.</p>
                  <p>The beſt way is, (when you mean to caſt a Hawk into the Mew) firſt to ſcour her well according to former directions, to cope her, and ſet her up well in fleſh, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge her, as near as you can, of all Diſeaſes, alſo to free her from Mites and Lice to ſet her water, ſometimes to feed her with young Rats, Mice, Dogs-fleſh, Pigeons, Rabbets, and now and then with ſome liquid thing and meats laxative.</p>
                  <p>Take notice of this ſpecial Obſervation: A Haggard is not to be caſt in looſe to the Mew, but is to be mewed on the Fiſt, for otherwiſe ſhe will become too coy and ſtrange: And if ſhe fall to bating and beating her ſelf for heat, then muſt you hood her up, or beſpout her with cold water, which is the readieſt way to make her leave Bating.</p>
                  <p>You muſt continue her on the Fiſt till ſhe begin to ſhed her Feathers, then ſet her down and tie her to a Stone or Pearch, as you do the reſt; and after ſhe hath mewed and comes to fly, then let her ſtand on a Block or Billet caſed or rolled. In the ſame manner mew Goſhawks, Tiercels, and Sparrow-hawks; only they will not be born on the Fiſt, but be at liberty in the Mew, and very clealy ſerved.</p>
                  <p>Fifteen or twenty days before you draw your Hawk out of the Mew you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to abate her of her diet, the ſooner and better to enſeam her.</p>
                  <p>Many more Diſeaſes there are incident and Accidents hapning to Hawks, of which with their Cures there are large diſcourſes written in Italian, French, and Engliſh, and therefore I thought fit to inſert in this place no other Maladies than what moſt uſually occur: If you deſire to be farther ſatisfied, I ſhall refer you to thoſe larger Volumes.</p>

            <p>IN the Deſcription of the <hi>Foeroe</hi> Iſlands, written by <hi>Lucas Jacobſon Debes,</hi> I find an account of the manner of breeding and taking of ſome Water-fowl deſcribed by us, Book 3. Part 3. Sect. 1. Chap. 2, 4, 5. and Sect. 3. Chap. 2. which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it confirms and illuſtrates what we have there delivered, I ſhall here ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn. The names by which theſe Birds are known in the <hi>Foeroe</hi> Iſlands are the <hi>Skrabe,</hi> the <hi>Lunde,</hi> the <hi>Lomwifve,</hi> and the <hi>Sea-Daw.</hi> The <hi>Skrabe,</hi> that is our <hi>Mank Puffin,</hi> comes in <hi>February</hi> about St. <hi>Matthias</hi> day, and fareth away about St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> tide <hi>[Aug.</hi> 24.] The <hi>Lomwifve,</hi> that is our <hi>Guillemot;</hi> and <hi>Sea-daw,</hi> that is our <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor-bill,</hi> come about St. <hi>Gregories</hi> tide, <hi>[March</hi> 12.] and fly away at <hi>Mary Magdalens [July</hi> 22.]</p>
            <p>The aforeſaid ſorts of Birds lay every one but one Egg, and get but one Young <note place="margin">The Skrabe or Puffin.</note> every year; and though they be thoſe that are chiefly fought for, and there be taken of them 100000 every year, there is nevertheleſs more of them than of any other ſort; yea, by the admirable providence of God, they are ſo plentiful, that in clear weather they can darken the ſhining of the Sun, as it were with a thick cloud, making ſuch a terrible noiſe with their Wings in flying, that they who hear it, and do not know the cauſe thereof, would not think otherwiſe than that it were Thunder.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Skrabe [Puffin]</hi> builds on the Land under the earth; ſcraping with its Beak and Claws, lying on the back, (whence it is called a <hi>Skrabe)</hi> it diggeth a hole in ſome places a foot deep, in ſome other eight or ten foot in ſeveral turnings, ſeeking eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to dig it ſelf behind a ſtone, where it thinketh to lie ſecureſt. It is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that this Bird is the whole day away from its Young and never comes to it but in the night to feed it; and if it flies not from its Young at the dawning of the day it ſtays with it the whole day over, and then flyeth out to Sea till the other night cometh: And though the Young be fed but once a day, yet it is ſo fat, that no Gooſe, though it hath been three weeks fed, can be fatter. Theſe young ones they call Lyers, and by reaſon of their fatneſs they do not make preſent uſe of them, but ſalt them to eat them in Winter, melting their fat, which they burn in Lamps. They have to take them out ſeveral hooks half an Ell, or an Ell long, wherewith they pierce them through and draw them out. They do not uſually take the Dam her ſelf, except ſhe be ſometimes hurt with the hook that ſhe cannot live. If they cannot get the young one with their hook, or by thruſting their arm into the birds Neſt, by reaſon of the many turnings, they dig a hole down to it, as near as they can gueſs, and then thruſt about with their hooks till they can get it: Which hole they muſt again ſtop ſo cloſe, that not one drop of water can come into it, for elſe ſhe will forſake her hole, and never come thither more; which otherwiſe ſhe doth every year in the wonted place; ſo that the Inhabitants know where under the earth to find that Birds Neſt yearly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lunde,</hi> ſo called alſo by <hi>Hoier</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Cluſius,</hi> and by <hi>Cluſius Anas</hi>

               <hi>Arctica,</hi> by us <hi>Coulterneb</hi> and <hi>Mullet,</hi> hath a ſtrong crooked Beak, ſo that if it biteth a man by the hand it teareth off the fleſh. It wageth war with the <hi>Raven,</hi> that cometh to take it away and its young ones: It being a wonderful ſpectacle to ſee their fight; for as ſoon as the <hi>Raven</hi> cometh near, the <hi>Lunde</hi> catcheth it under the Throat with its Beak, and graſpeth it about the Breaſt with its Claws, ſo that the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> cannot hurt it, but muſt fly away with a great crying. The <hi>Lunde</hi> holds it faſt in the mean time without letting it go, till they come into the Sea, where ſlipping it is drown'd. Yet the <hi>Raven</hi> doth often take the <hi>Lunde</hi> at unawares, ruſheth into its hole, takes and eats it up. <hi>I ſuſpect there is ſomething of fabulous in this Narration.</hi> The ſaid Bird, the <hi>Lunde,</hi> buildeth its Neſt ſometimes on the Continent, far from houſes, digging it ſelf two or three yards, according to the nature of the place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground; ſometimes in <hi>Ures</hi> (that are places under high Cliffs, full of great and ſmall ſtones, that fall from the Cliffs, and by length of time are filled between with earth, and covered with graſs) in which places they dig themſelves into the earth, or build, where there is no earth, their Neſt under and between ſtones, where they can come to breed their Young with moſt ſecurity. The moſt part being taken in ſuch places, ſo that a man may often take above a hundred <hi>Lundes</hi> in one Ure. Some of
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:63869:226"/>
them build on the ſide of Promontories, where they find great tufts of earth in flat places, and when they fly from their Neſts, they firſt make them clean, ſcraping all the dirt and old roots out of the holes, and putting freſh graſs in them again. The <hi>Lundes</hi> that make their Neſts in the fields are taken as is ſaid above of the <hi>Skrabe:</hi> But for ſuch as are under thoſe many ſtones, they let run unto them ſome little Dogs, that are ſo taught, as to bring out both Bird and Egg to their Maſters: But when the Birds are flown, the men take them flying; which is done in this manner. They have a long pole, at the end of which there is a Hoop drawn over with a Net, whereof the Maſhes are almoſt are almoſt as big as the quarries of a glaſs-window, being like the Net wherwith they take <hi>Shrimps</hi> in ſome places, and this they call a Stang or Staff, with this Staff the Fowler ſitteth on the Cliff, or in the Ures among the great ſtones, where he knoweth moſt Fowl to come, which they call flight-places, and when the <hi>Lunde</hi> cometh flying either from or to the Land, he lifts up the Staff and the Net againſt the Fowl, and when he hath got it into the Net, he turneth the Staff about, that it may entangle it ſelf the better therein: A man being ſometimes able to take two hundred <hi>Lundes</hi> in that manner in a very ſhort time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lumwifve,</hi> that is <hi>Hoiers Lomwia,</hi> and our <hi>Guillem</hi> or <hi>Skout,</hi> layeth her Eggs <note place="margin">The Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifve or Guillem.</note> on the bare Points and Cliffs of high Rocks and Promontories, there lying on theſe Cliffs ſome hundred Eggs, according as the place is large, but three fingers breadth from one another, and when the Birds fly away the Eggs rowl often down into the Sea. But laying but one Egg ſhe ſitteth ſtreight thereon, and continueth ſo a months time, never ſtirring from the place till her young one be hatcht; in the mean time the Cock bringeth her to eat. They lay in this manner, ſitting cloſe one to another, Bird by Bird all over the place, ſo that the Cliff ſeemeth quite black, and the young one being hatch'd, ſhe remains yet three weeks with it, and then taketh it on her back and carrieth it to Sea. When the Fowler cometh to that place, if there have not often been men there before, it hapneth ſometimes that the old will not leave their young ones, and therefore are taken with the hand as many as they are and killed; but where they are grown wild by reaſon of mens continual hunting after them, they fly away, the young ones running together in a flock, and when the Hen cometh again, ſhe ſeeks the ſame place where ſhe ſate before, and clacketh ſo long till her young one cometh to her, being very well able to diſcern its own Dam, though they be all ſhaped alike, and when ſhe giveth her Young to eat ſhe putteth her head back under her Wing, giving it ſo to eat backwards.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Daw,</hi> that is <hi>Hoiers Alka</hi> and our <hi>Awk,</hi> (whence I gueſs the Author was <note place="margin">The Daw or Razor-bill.</note> miſtaken in the name) hatcheth its young ones in holes and chinks of high Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. That <hi>Hoier</hi> was not miſtaken in the name of this Bird I conclude, becauſe it is called by the very ſame name, <hi>viz. Auk,</hi> in the North of <hi>England;</hi> ſo that it is manifeſt either our Northern men borrowed it of the <hi>Ferroeſe,</hi> or the <hi>Ferroeſe</hi> of them, it being very unlikely that by chance they ſhould impoſe the ſame name upon it. But that ours borrowed this name of the <hi>Ferroeſe</hi> ſeems to me more probable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in other parts of <hi>England,</hi> farther diſtant from the <hi>Ferroyer</hi> Iſlands this Bird is called by other names. And yet poſſibly it may be alſo called a <hi>Daw</hi> in thoſe Iſlands, as either it or the <hi>Guillem</hi> is in <hi>Cornwall.</hi> Why they ſhould call it a <hi>Daw,</hi> I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine unleſs from its bigneſs, and the colour of its back.</p>
            <p>It cannot be expreſt with what pains and danger they take theſe Birds in thoſe high and ſteep Cliffs, whereof many are above two hundred fathoms high, there being men apt by nature, and fit for that work, called Fowlers, who take them uſually in two manners: For either they climb from below up into theſe high Promontories, that are as ſteep as a wall, or they let themſelves down into them from above, with a thick, ſtrong, hemp-rope, when they climb from below, they have then a pole five or ſix Ells long, with an iron hook at the end, which they that are below in the Boat, or on the Clift, faſten unto the mans Girdle, or another Rope that the Fowler hath about him, helping him thus up to the higheſt place, where he can get footing: afterwards they alſo help up another man, &amp; when they are ſo ſeveral come up, every one with his Fowling Staff in his hand, and the long Rope between them tied to each others waſte, they climb ſo as high as poſſibly they can; and where they find difficulty they help each other up by thruſting one another under the breech with their Poles: And when the firſt hath taken footing, he draweth the other up to him by the Rope faſtned to his waſte, and ſo they proceed on till they come to the place where the Birds build; going then after them about the hill as they pleaſe, and there being many dangerous places to climb about, having bound themſelves at the Ropes end, the one ſeeketh a
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:63869:227"/>
convenient place where he can ſtand ſure, and hold himſelf faſt, whilſt the other goeth about theſe dangerous places; if it then happen that he chanceth to fall, the other that ſtands firm keeps him up, and helps him up again: But if he paſſeth ſafe, he likewiſe faſtneth himſelf till the other hath paſſed that dangerous place; and ſo they go about the Clifts after Birds as they pleaſe; though it often hapneth, the more is the pitty, that when the one doth not ſtand faſt, or is not ſtrong enough to hold up the other in his fall, that they both fall down and kill themſelves; in which manner ſome do periſh every year.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Peter Clauſon</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Norway</hi> writeth, that there was anciently a Law in the Country that whoſoever climbed ſo on the Clifts, that he fell down and died, if the body was found to be buried, his next Kinſman ſhould go the ſame way; but if he durſt or could not do it, the dead was not then to be buried in Sanctified earth, as one that had been too full of temerity, and was his own bane. But there is found nothing of that Law now adays.</p>
            <p>When they then are come, in the manner aforeſaid, to the birds, within the Clifts where they ſeldom come, the Birds are ſo tame that they can take them with their hands, for they will hardly leave their young ones; but where they are wild, they either caſt the Net over them on the Clift; and againſt thoſe that either fly from thence or thereunto, they oppoſe the Fowling Staff with its Net, and intangle them therein. In which manner they take a great multitude of <hi>Lumwiſves, Daws,</hi> and <hi>Lundes.</hi> In the mean time there lieth a Boat beneath on the Sea, wherein they caſt their Birds killed; and in this manner they can in a ſhort time fill a Boat with Fowl. When it is pretty fair weather and there is good Fowling, the Fowlers ſtay in the Clifts ſeven or eight days together, for there are here and there holes in the Rocks, where they can ſafely reſt, and they have meat let down to them with a line from the top of the Mountain. In the mean time ſome go every day to them to fetch home what they have taken.</p>
            <p>Some Rocks are ſo difficult, that they can in no manner get unto them from below, wherefore they ſeek to come down thereunto from above, which they call to Sie, and is the ſecond manner to purſue birds, being performed in this manner: They have a Rope eighty or a hundred Fathoms long, and three Fingers thick, the Fowler maketh the end thereof faſt about his Waſte, and between his Legs, ſo that he can ſit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thus is let down, with the Fowling Staff in his hand; ſix men hold by the Rope and let him eaſily down, laying a piece of wood on the brink of the Rock, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Rope glideth, that it may not be worn to pieces by the hard and rough edge of the ſtone: They have beſides another ſmall line that is faſtned to the Fowlers body, on which he pulleth, to give them notice how they ſhould let down the great Rope, either lower or higher, or to hold ſtill, that he may ſtay in the place whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he is come; here the man is in great danger, becauſe of the Stones that are looſened from the Clift by ſwinging of the Rope, which often fall upon his head, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid it, wherefore he hath uſually on his head a Sea mans Cap, that is thick and very ſhaggy, to defend him in ſome meaſure from the blows of the Stones, if they be not too big, otherwiſe it coſteth him his life. They put nevertheleſs themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in that danger, for our wretched bodies foods ſake, hoping in Gods mercy and protection, unto which the moſt part of them do alſo devoutly recommend themſelves, when they go to that work. Otherwiſe they ſay there is no other great danger in it, but that in it ſelf it is a toilſom and artificial labour; for he that hath not learned to be ſo let down, and is not uſed thereunto, is turned about with the Rope, ſo that he groweth giddy and troubled in his head, and can do nothing, but he that hath learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the art taketh it for a ſport, knowing how to ſwing himſelf on the Rope, to ſet his feet againſt the Rock, caſting himſelf ſome fathoms from thence, whence he ſhooteth himſelf again to what place he will, and knoweth where the Birds are; he knoweth alſo to ſit on the line in the Air, and how to hold the fowling Staff in his hand, taking there with the birds that come, or fly away, and when there are holes in the Rock, and it ſtretcheth it ſelf out, making underneath as a ſieling, under which the birds are, he knoweth skilfully (which is the greateſt art) to ſhoot himſelf a great way from the Clift, and ſwiftly to ſwing himſelf under the roof, and there take footing, making himſelf, when he is in theſe holes, looſe of the great Rope, which he faſtens to a ſtone of the Rock, that it may not ſlip from him to the outſide of the Clift; and then he goeth about in the Rock, taking the Fowl either with his hands, or with the Fowling Staff; according to the manner aforeſaid; and when he hath killed as many Birds as he thinketh fit, he ties them in a bundle, and faſtneth them to the little Rope, giving a
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:63869:227"/>
ſign by pulling, that they ſhould draw them up, working thus the whole day: And when he will get up, he ſitteth again upon the great Rope, giving a new ſign that they ſhould pull him up, or elſe he worketh himſelf up climbing along the Rope with his Girdle full of Birds. It is alſo uſual that where there is not folks enough to hold the great Rope, the Fowler driveth a poſt ſloaping into the earth, and maketh the Rope faſt thereunto, letting ſo himſelf down without any bodies help, to work in the manner aforeſaid; ſome Rocks are ſo formed that one can go in them from the Land, and there he taketh his Comrades with him, proceeding in the manner aforeſaid, each taking as much Fowl, as the Girdle about his Waſte can hold, and as much as he can carry in a bundle on his back, carrying them in that manner home. There are alſo in ſome places high ſteep Clifts, under the Land, that ariſe above an hundred Fathoms from the Sea, that are almoſt as bad to come unto as the Rocks, whereunto they help alſo one another in the aforeſaid manner, taking a ſtrong Rope with them, which they faſten here and there about the Clift, and let it hang there the whole Summer, by which they nimbly climb up to take Fowl when they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe manners are more terrible and dangerous to ſee, then to deſcribe, ſpecially if one conſiders the ſteepneſs and height of the Rocks, it ſeeming not poſſible that a man could come to them, much leſs climb or be let down into them. They go alſo in ſome places where they can only faſten the ends of their Toes and Fingers, not ſhunning ſuch places, though there be a hundred Fathoms height between them and the Sea.</p>
            <p>It is a dear Meat for theſe poor people, for which they muſt venture their Lives ſo extremely, and many after long venturing at laſt do periſh therein.</p>
            <p>When that Fowl is brought home, a part thereof is eaten freſh, another part, when there is much taken, being hung up to dry for Winter proviſion. The Feathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gathered to make Merchandize of for other expences.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants get a great many of thoſe Fowls as God giveth his bleſſing, and fit weather. Yet this is not every where in the Land, but only in the Iſlands that lie towards the Sea, and have great Promontories, as the Northern <hi>Iſlands, Myggyneſs, Waagoe, Skuo,</hi> the <hi>Diemens,</hi> and <hi>Suderoe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when it is dark Weather, they take moſt, for then the Birds ſtay in the Rocks, but in clear Weather and hot Sun-ſhine they ſeek the Sea, and againſt their flying away, they keep themſelves moſt there, ſitting on the Clifts towards the Sea ſide, where people go alſo ſometimes to them with Boats, and take them with Fowling Staves.</p>
