         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is not from any Opinion that the Author has of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or what he can do, that he presumes upon such a Dedication; but only as a true Son of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he finds himself oblig'd to espouse her Cause, and obviate the false Calumnies which those of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do so industriously spread Abroad; not only to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of your Government and Discipline, but even of your Doctrine and Morals: And therefore he begs, that what is well design'd, may not be ill taken, but that you would be pleased to accept of these weak Indeavours, as a Testimony of his Zeal and Affection for his Mother-Church, with that same Benignity that that <hi>Great Prince</hi> accepted of the <hi>poor Man's</hi> handful of Water which was offered him, amongst a Crowd of more valuable Presents. He is sensible, that neither the <hi>Matter</hi> nor the <hi>Manner</hi> deserve the Patronage of such a grave Assembly, but he hopes that you may thence be convinc'd, of the Necessity there is, that you should take such Measures as your Wisdom shall sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, to <hi>provide Antidotes</hi> for those <hi>poysonous Libels</hi>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:44964:3"/>
which fly abroad here against you, in such Numbers, by the United Endeavours of your Enemies. You cannot readily imagine how much you lose by a Neglect herein, and it's not easy to express the Grief of your Well-wishers, to hear the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> made the Song of the Drunkard; and the Ridiculous blasphemous Stories printed here against Her, to be the common Entertainment of Debauchees, who triumph in all publick Places over your silence. May the great Shepherd of his Church, whose Servants you are, inspire you with such Counsels, that as the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> had formerly <hi>Nomen inter caeteras Celebre,</hi> upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her <hi>singular Unity</hi>; She may also be famous in Time to come, <hi>clear as the Sun, fair as the Moon, and terrible like an Army with Banners,</hi> to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of all those who oppose her, upon the Account of the Purity of her Doctrine, and Strictness of her Discipline. And blessed be God, who has not left her without this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that her greatest and most avow'd Enemies are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the <hi>most Vicious</hi> and <hi>debauch'd, and visibly embark'd with an Interest altogether destructive to the Protestant Religion, and the common Liberties of</hi> Europe.</p>

               <hi>The Scots Episcopal Innocence,</hi> &amp;c. PART I.</head>
            <p>IT being undoubtedly his Majesty's Design, as well as Interest, to manifest a fatherly Concern for the Welfare of all his Subjects in General, it's unaccountable that there should not be found a sutable Disposition in them to concur with his Royal Intentions, and be ambitious to out-do one another in their returns of Love and Zeal for his generous and impartial Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by which, like the Sun, he dispenses the Rays of his benign Influence towards all Men, whereof his admirable Temperament to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Dissenting Subjects; are undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Demonstrations; and do so clearly evince that Justice and Equability have the Ascendent in his Soul, that it can be hid from none but those whose Interest and Passion blind their Eyes: But my Thoughts being at present confin'd to his Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I shall endeavour to keep within my Limits, though I must confess it puts a Violence upon my Inclination when I have so large a Field wherein I could expatiate with delight.</p>
            <p>From the sense of the Calamities under which that Kingdom hath for a long time groan'd, upon account of their Differences in Church-matters, it might have been reasonably expected that both Parties should have greedily embraced the opportunity of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension; which his present Majesty hath done more to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish, than he who coveted the Motto of <hi>Beati Pacifici,</hi> or any other of his Successors, had either Interest or Inclination to do: but to the Amazement of all Good Men, those who petition'd for it, now when it is obtain'd, stand aloof from it; and as I hope to make it appear, chiefly, if not meerly, because they are obliged to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure all Interests which are opposite to his Majesty's, who procured it; which (as I am confident there is no need of Rhetorick to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you) is a piece of the blackest Ingratitude. But to set this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44964:4"/>
Matter in its true Light, be pleased to read the following Address of the Scots Episcopal Party, and then the Act of Parliament which his Majesty with no small Application hath obtain'd in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to their Request, and I doubt not but you will discover that there is a Snake in the Grass.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:44964:5"/>By their Petition it's easy to perceive, that Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as now established in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is none of the <hi>Stops</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments</hi> which they desire to be taken off, seeing they promise a Submission to it, and a Concurrence with it: And therefore the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of this Government, in the Comprehension Act, cannot be that which they scruple, especially seeing it doth not enjoin them to own it, submit to it, and concur with it, as the Government of the Church by Divine Institution, but as the only Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if any should object, That this may bear hard upon their Principles, who may reasonably be supposed to think that Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy still remains in Force. I answer,
<list>
                  <item>1. The Petitioners can have no such Objection, for they own <hi>in Terminis,</hi> that Episcopacy is abolished: So that this can be no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge, except they have some such Jesuitical Equivocation, or Mental Reservation, couch'd under that Term, as that late Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of a King <hi>de Iure</hi> and <hi>de Facto.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. If they do not believe the Abolition of Episcopacy <hi>de Iure,</hi> they must be <hi>de Facto</hi> very bad Men to offer Submission and Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with it, seeing whatsoever is not of Faith, is Sin; and he that doubteth, is damned if he eat.</item>
                  <item>3. If they question the Legality of its Abolition, then it's plain they must disown the Authority of their Majesties and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which makes them justly unworthy of their Protection, and liable to the Lash of the Law.</item>
                  <item>But, 4. and lastly, I am very well assured, that the far greater part of the Scots Episcopal Clergy, did always pretend to believe, That no particular Species of Church-Government, was of Divine Institution, but that it was alterable, according to the Pleasure and Conveniency of the State. And this I have heard asserted by some of the most Learned of their Communion.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Then it remains that the subscribing the Confession of Faith as their own, together with the Oaths of Allegiance and Assurance, and their being enjoined to an Uniformity in Worship according to the present Administration, and making Application to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly, thirty Days after their meeting, to be admitted upon the Conditions aforesaid, must be what they scruple, seeing these are all the other Terms required of them by the Act of Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44964:6"/>Then as to the subscribing of the Confession of Faith, they offer it in their Petition: But how? Why truly, as containing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Protestant Religion professed in <hi>Scotland.</hi> —They have indeed laboured to perswade the World, that the Scots Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians were Fools: And truly they would have had very good Reason for their Assertion, if they should have admitted them into the Church upon such a bare-fac'd Equivocation; for so the modest Gentlemen may subscribe to the <hi>Alceran,</hi> as containing the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Doctrine in <hi>Turky</hi>; or the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as containing the Popish Doctrine in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Then certainly their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties and Parliament cannot be blamed, if they have changed the words so far, as to make the Subscriber own it as the Confession of his own Faith; otherwise a Door had been opened to all Errors and Heresies whatsoever. And seeing the Petitioners own that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Protestant Religion, as professed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the said Confession, if they refuse to subscribe it as theirs, it's plain that they entertain some other than that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Doctrine: and if so, it cannot justly be called hard Measure, to exclude them from officiating as Ministers in that, or any other Protestant Church; seeing the Doctrine of that Confession is own'd by all except <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and is every way agreeable to the Doctrine contained in the Articles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then as to the Oath of Allegiance and Assurance, I confess there is reason enough to doubt their Sincerity, if they should comply: for never was there any thing conceived in Terms more express, to abjure the lawfulness of resisting Kings, or those commissionated by them, upon any Pretence whatsoever, than the Scots Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Acknowledgment of the Prerogative.</p>
            <p>And seeing that Doctrine was so much extoll'd and applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that the Party valued themselves so highly upon it, I cannot conceive how they can, without down-right Perjury, own his present Majesty's Title, except they have changed their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. And seeing they have never, by any publick Authentick Act, renounced that Doctrine, nor given us their Reasons why, there is no great Cause to think that they will be any steadier in their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to King <hi>William,</hi> than they were to King <hi>Iames</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Swear, or not Swear, there's no Encouragement to trust them with the Conduct of Peoples Consciences. But however, if they refuse to swear Allegiance, no Body can think the Government ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to grant them Protection, for that were but to nourish Vipers in their Bosom: And if they should swear Allegiance, and decline
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44964:6"/>
the Assurance, it discovers that they act <hi>mala Fide</hi> with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and only watch for an Opportunity to declare against it: For if they think that their present Majesties have not a Title <hi>de Iure,</hi> they will never own their Right <hi>de Facto</hi> any longer than while they are not in a Capacity to rebel. And at the same time, such a Distinction denotes a Man of a very ill inform'd, if not of a debauch'd Conscience: For if their Majesties Title be not lawful, it cannot be lawful for me to own it; and if their Title be lawful, it must needs be lawful for me to oblige my self to defend them in it, against all Pretenders whatsoever; So that a declining of the Latter, is an infallible Demonstration of my doubting the Former. And if those who call their Majesties Right in question, be fit to be intrusted as Leaders of the Subjects, let common Sense and Reason determine.</p>
            <p>Now that the greater part of the Scots Episcopal Clergy disown their Majesties Title, is evident from the Practice of all their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, to whom they have sworn Canonical Obedience; from the practice of the most part of themselves, seeing some hundreds of them were turn'd out by the Convention on that Head; and by their Behaviour now, seeing they universally refuse the Assurance, though many of them formerly had sworn Allegiance, which is in plain English, no other than a granting of the Premisses, and a denying the Conclusion: Or according to the Example of a certain Gentleman in <hi>England,</hi> granting the Abdication, and denying the Vacancy. And in truth their offering to swear Allegiance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the Assurance, is much such another Trick upon the State, as by their <hi>Formula</hi> they have put upon the Church; they would subscribe the Confession of Faith, as that of the Nation, but not their own: And so they would also swear that King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> are King and Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but not theirs.</p>
            <p>Their Prevarication in this Affair, puts it out of all doubt, that their Design to be admitted into a Share of the Government of the Church, was not according to the specious Pretences in their Petition, but meerly to imbroil both Church and State, and by our Confusion to make way for the late Kings in whom that they still design to keep an Interest, is manifest by their sh<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ing with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; as to the swearing Allegiance, which they put off from time to time, with frivolous Pretences, till they see the Success of the late King's Endeavours to reinthrone himself.</p>
            <p>So last Year they pretended that they would take the Oaths, if they were imposed upon the Presbyterians as well as them: And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44964:7"/>
knowing that that could not be done without an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they and their Party stav'd off this Session as long as they could: Which in the mean time shews, that it was Humour and not Conscience which kept them from complying. And now that there is an Act enjoining the Presbyterians to take the Oath and Assurance, and that they conform almost universally, to the Confusion of those who reproached them as Enemies to Kingly Government; yet the Episcopal Clergy keep off still, and not above two of them have subscribed them, because the E. of <hi>L —w,</hi> and Viscount <hi>T—t,</hi> &amp;c. advised the contrary; on this Pretence forsooth, that their Petition was not answered at first, and the Comprehension taken in hand immediately on its being tendered: Which a certain Minister of State did wisely defer till the last, as reasonably imagining that that Affair would create Heats, and disappoint his Majesty's other Affairs which were to be treated of in Parliament. So that before ever the Church-Affairs were meddled with, they sent their Agents to disswade the Northern Clergy from taking the Oaths, because there was no Comprehension; and tho that Objection be now vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet they persist still in their Obstinacy: So that it's evident they have Interest at Bottom; and it's but rational to conclude that the said Managers intend to make their Court with the late King, by keeping the Clergy from abjuring him, or swearing Allegiance to their present Majesties.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Petitioners; They were so disingenuous, and so little sincere in their Application, that when required to attend the Committee of Security, to whom they were referred by the Parliament, they not only declined all Communing with them, but did, in contempt of their Majesties and the Parliament, load the Members of the Committee with Obloquy and Reproach: And, as I am informed from a very good Hand, resolve to continue in their Churches, without qualifying themselves according to the late Act.</p>
            <p>I shall forbear insisting upon their Ingratitude to their Majesties and the Parliament till afterwards, and go on to consider the other Terms required in the Comprehension, which are their observing an Uniformity of Worship, according to the present Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and applying to the General Assembly, or other Church-Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catures, for admission to a Share of the Government, after having qualified themselves according to the Act.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Uniformity of Worship, there is nothing in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them, but the use of the <hi>Doxology,</hi> or <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:44964:7"/>
which the Episcopal Party did declare, that they could omit in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with a Law, though not to satisfy the Humours of the Presbyterians: So that according to their Concession and Promise that ought to be no Scruple, now seeing there is a Law against it. And as for their making Application to the Generall Assembly for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, after having qualified themselves by Law, they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline that from any Scruple of Conscience, seeing in their Petition they promise to submit to, and concur with the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It's true, that the Act doth also require that they shall promise, neither to endeavour, directly nor indirectly, the Prejudice or Subversion of that Government, which by their Promise just now mentioned, it's evident they can have no well-grounded Objection against; for certainly if it be lawful to submit unto, and concur with that Government, it cannot be unlawful to promise, That they will not endeavour its Subversion, especially if their above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Principle of the Indifference of this or that Species of Church-Government, and that there is now a Law enjoining the latter, be considered.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole it is plain, that if the Terms of their own Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and those of the Act of Parliament, be duly weighed, their refusal to comply is an unaccountable piece of Obstinacy and Ingratitude, especially towards his Majesty: Which I think will appear very evident, if we consider,
<list>
                  <item>1. What a great deal of Clemency, beyond any Parallel, he has been graciously pleased to exert in favour of a Party who by their Bishops addressed against him, and wish'd King <hi>Iames</hi> might have his Neck to trample upon when he undertook our Glorious Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; a Party that have hitherto generally disown'd his Title, and continued in Rebellion against him till their Strength fall'd; a Party who, by their Calumnies in Word and Writing, have endeavoured to render the Church of <hi>England</hi> jealous of him; and had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally plotted in conjunction with the Irish and French Papists to overturn his Throne, while at the same time they made Application to him for his Favour.</item>
                  <item>2. If we consider how much he disobliged the Presbyterians, (the only Party on whom he could rely in <hi>Scotland</hi>) to gratify the Prelatists in forbearing to punish those of their Party who had forfeited their Lives, by overturning the Constitution of Government in the late Reigns, and committed barbarous Murders upon their fellow-Subjects, and being actually in Rebellion against himself; nay, and that which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44964:8"/>
was more, advanced some of them to the highest Places of Power and Trust, while he turn'd out Presbyterians, who had ventured all for him, and were stedfast to him.</item>
                  <item>3. If we consider that he disobliged the Presbyterians, at a nick of time when he was threatned with a Foreign Invasion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine Rebellion, by ordering the General Assembly to admit the Episcopal Clergy on such Terms as the Parliament have thought fit to refuse, and then by dissolving them for their declining it. And,</item>
                  <item>4. If we consider the Risk which he ran now, when engaged Abroad with a formidable Enemy, to hazard the Session of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, so much Presbyterian as is that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> chiefly to make way for the admission of the Episcopal Clergy into the Church, when he could not be ignorant how tenacious of their Privileges, both Civil and Religious, the Presbyterians are, and what good Reasons they have for an Aversion to any <hi>Comprehension</hi> of that Party, who when their Turn was uppermost, would never hear of <hi>comprehending</hi> them any otherwise than in <hi>Prison</hi> or a <hi>Rope.</hi> But more especially when this Session might have given an Opportunity to the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of demanding Justice against such English Men, as contrary to our Constitution, meddle in our Affairs, and support the Episcopal Clergy in their disturbing of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> as established by Law; especially having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived such an Affront, as a Commission sent down by their Influence to require such Things of the General Assembly, as the Parliament in their Wisdom thought fit to provide against.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I say, all these things being considered, it cannot but seem very strange, that when his Majesty hath obtain'd them a Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, whereunto, as appears by their own Petition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as aforesaid, they can have no valuable Objection, that they should reject it: So that to all unprejudic'd Persons, this can appear no uncharitable Censure, if we think that they have hitherto been bargaining with his Majesty only to gain Time till they see the Success of their late King, and the French King's Efforts, that they might take their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures accordingly; seeing it must needs be obvious to any who read their Petition, and consider it duly, together with the whole Tenor of their Practice, that the Bond of Assurance, to stand by his Majesty against all Pretenders whatsoever, is that which choaks them most in the Terms of Comprehension.</p>
            <p>Their Obstinacy will still appear more, if it be considered, that the Presbyterians, whom they treated so cruelly in the late Reigns,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44964:8"/>
as to make it Death for any of their Ministers to preach (for not Conforming to that, which, as appears by their Petition, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves reckon indifferent) should have been brought to condescend so far towards an Accommodation with them, as to consent to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted without a formal Renunciation of their Doctrine of Passive Obedience and Episcopacy; considering that the Abjuration of the Covenant was imposed upon the Presbyterians in the late Reigns, and that their Conformity was expresly required as a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their owning Episcopacy, and the King's Supremacy, which was diametrically opposite to their Principles: whereas there is nothing in this Comprehension, but what the Episcopal Party have conceded in their Petition.</p>
            <p>So that there being in effect no more required of the Scots Episcopal Clergy (that of Submission to Presbytery excepted, which they did voluntarily offer) than what is required of all the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> We may easily discern whether or not the Countenance given to the Disobedience of te Scots Clergy by some here in <hi>England,</hi> ought not rather to be ascribed to their Enmity to the Repose of the present Government, than to their Zeal for the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and I am certain that if the unanimous Sentiments of all true <hi>Williamites</hi> may have any Weight, those of them who are the most Zealous Patrons for our Scots Episcopal Clergy, are reckoned Heart-Enemies to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> And I wish that there had been no late publick Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes which may have confirm'd them in their Jealousy; and I am very well assured that the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> had gone near to have branded some of those who are Tools to the said English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with perpetual Infamy, had it not been out of respect to his Majesty, who hath honoured them with an eminent Character; and might have proceeded further to have declared such Proceedings as they advis'd to, in relation to the General Assembly, Arbitrary and Illegal: and a demand of Justice against such as advised to those Measures, would have thereupon followed of Course.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding of all this favourable Procedure towards our Scots Prelatists, yet their Clamour does not cease, and particularly against those Ministers of State to whom his Majesty intrusted the Management of Affairs; though it be Evident, that if any Party be abridged by the Act, it is the Presbyterians, who are now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by Law to receive the Prelatical Clergy on such and such Terms; with certification, if they refuse, that the Episcopal Clergy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44964:9"/>
shall have their Majesties Protection. So that if our murmuring Gentlemen will but evidence so much Loyalty to his Majesty, as to abjure all those who pretend a right to his Crown, and promise neither to molest the Government, Civil nor Ecclesiastical, they have it in their own Power to be secured in the execution of their Office, and enjoyment of their Benefices, whether the Presbyterians will or not, if they cannot in thirty Days time prove them either Heterodox or Scandalous. And seeing, as I said before, the Test to prove their Soundness in the Faith, is no other for the Matter than what the Church of <hi>England</hi> imposes upon her Clergy; we hope that that Venerable Society will find no cause to complain, that the Terms of our Communion are too Narrow, if they do but consider what our Episcopal Party have conceded: whereby indeed they have abandon'd the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Government and Discipline, which I suppose will gall their Patrons more than if they had disown'd her Doctrine; which it's plain they must also do, if they refuse to subscribe the Confession of Faith as injoin'd by the Act.</p>
            <p>This brings me naturally to observe the Unstedfastness and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prevarication of that Party, both with God and Man; which will appear uncontrovertably true, if we consider their subscribing the Solemn League and Covenant, when that was uppermost, and their abjuring it again after <hi>Charles</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi>'s Restoration; their swearing of the Self-contradictory Test in his Reign, as also to Passive Obedience; and yet their offer to swear Allegiance to their present Majesties, which now again they retract. Nor is their Shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling less notorious with their own Church: They were sworn to maintain Episcopacy in the late Reigns, and by their pretended Zeal for it, make their Interest with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this, and yet offer'd to submit to, and concur with Presbytery in their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, which now again they retract: So that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have no more reason then we, to put Confidence in these Men, seeing as has been said, its plain, that they have offered to relinquish her Government and Discipline, and by their refusal to sign the Confession of Faith. It's evident that they have also relinquish'd her Doctrine; and whether King <hi>William</hi> have any reason to trust to their Loyalty, who, contrary to their Oaths and pretended Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, have offered to swear Allegiance to him, when they have, without any Recantation of their former Doctrine, offer'd to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don King <hi>Iames,</hi> let the World Judg. But that they are not to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44964:9"/>
be trusted in relation to King <hi>William,</hi> appears yet more fully by their Shuffling, and refusing to comply with the present Act. And I must ingenuously confess, that of the two, I think the bare-fac'd and stedfast <hi>Iacobite,</hi> the honester Man; though I am apt to be of Mr. <hi>B—y</hi> the blind Parson's Mind, when one told him that Mr. <hi>S</hi>— the <hi>Iacobite</hi> Parson, would bring an <hi>Odium</hi> upon their Party, by his avowed Dissatisfaction to this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He answered, that Mr. <hi>S</hi>— was a Fool, and did act too much above-board; but that Dr. <hi>C—es</hi> would, notwithstanding his Compliance with the Government, be much a greater Man with King <hi>Iames,</hi> than <hi>S</hi>—, or such as he. Which was a plain Declaration, that let them pretend what they will, as the Motive of their Compliance with the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it's by virtue of a Dispensation from the late King that they may undermine it.</p>

            <p>TO let the World see how little Reason our Scots Prelatical Clergy, who are outed of their Benefices, have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Administration of their Majesties Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in relation to themselves, I have been at the Pains and Expence to procure this following Abstract, from the Records of the Committee of States and Council, which doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a List of all those turn'd out during the E. of <hi>Crawford</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing President: And not only vindicates that noble Lord from the malicious Aspersions wherewith his Enemies traduc'd him, and which they continually buzz'd in his Majesty's Ears, till he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to give the said Earl his desired <hi>Quietus</hi>; but justifies the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Presbyterians in general towards their most implacable Enemies: For here the Reader will clearly see, that their Principles as Episcopalians, was never made the Test; and that not one was turn'd out, but such as were proven guilty of refusing to comply with the Order of the State, to pray for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> And herein also the Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceeded, with so strict a regard to Justice, that they acquitted, or, to use their own Term, <hi>assoilzed</hi> such as could not be proven guilty of Disloyalty by suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Evidence: Although at the same time it was proven against them, that they had been Persecutors of the Presbyterians, as ........... number ....,... And to evince this further, we find divers acquitted, though accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of very heinous Crimes, as at N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 8, 58, 59, 84, 93, 94, 102, 103, 124, 125, 126, 133, 138, 164, 165, 170, 177, because the Proof was not clear.</p>
            <p>But so great a Number being turn'd out, as appears by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Catalogue, upon the Account of their Disloyalty, it was no wonder that the Scots Episcopal Party should be concerned to find, not only the Head, but also the Hands and Fingers of their Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44964:10"/>
Dagon cut off, for their espousing the Interest of a Popish Prince, whom the Convention of States had laid aside for his Male-administration, according to former Precedents. And therefore for the Credit of their Cause, and to wipe off that horrible Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, they open their Throats, and raise the Cry, that they were turn'd out, because of their adherence to the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Discipline; by which means they procured abundance of Friends in this Nation, and so great Interest at Court, that they, though disowning their Majesties Authority, are given out to be the best of the Subjects, and his Majesty's real Friends brought under Obloquy and Reproach; whence came those Changes amongst Counsellors and Ministers of State, and those Proceedings against the General Assembly of the Church, which our Prelatical Adversaries endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to destroy in his Majesty's good Opinion. But I hope, that upon perusal of this following List, our Brethren, the moderate Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men, will find how injuriously we have been traduced. And this Catalogue may also serve for a Touch-stone to try those Swarms of begging Scots <hi>Iacobites,</hi> who impose upon the Clergy and Country, and obtain their Charity, as sufferers for the Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Government and Discipline: Whereas there is nothing more false, they being truly seditious <hi>Iacobites,</hi> and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers for the late King's Interest, which they industriously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote as they have Opportunity: and therefore the Charity of those well-disposed Clergy-men, and others, is actually misplaced, and given to a company of Men who are Heart-Enemies to this present Government, and wait for its Destruction. Whereas it would be more acceptable both to God and Man, to give what is lavish'd out upon these idle Bellies, to such who are made Widows or Fatherless, or reduc'd to other Straits, by their own or their Relations Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this present Government; which it's impossible during their present Circumstances for their Majesties to provide for. Not that I would be understood to disswade from Charity, to such who may really be brought to Straits for a Conscientious adhering to King <hi>Iames,</hi> of which the Number will be found very small; but from being cheated by the false Pretences of our Scots Prelatical Clergy, such as <hi>L—son, F—r, G—y,</hi> and others, who make a Trade of Begging, and reviling their Majesties Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and spend what they get profusely in Taverns, Ale-houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>London</hi>; where it's known that they associate only with <hi>Iacobites,</hi> though they impose upon well-meaning People in the Country, as if they were true <hi>Williamites,</hi> and Confessors for the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

            <head>The Scots Episcopal Innocence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> PART III.</head>
            <head>Being some Reflections on Dr. <hi>Monro</hi>'s malicious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, entituled, <hi>The Spirit of Calumny,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>PLVTARCH</hi> in his Book <hi>de Cohibenda Ira,</hi> has a Story of one <hi>Magas</hi> King of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> that sent some <hi>Bones</hi> and a little <hi>Bowl</hi> to a Poet, who had writ Invectives against him, as thinking that he had done it for want of better Imployment. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we have reason to make the same Judgment of our Scots Prelatists, who being spued out of their own Country by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, as <hi>an Insupportable Grievance,</hi> have nothing else to do, but invent and publish Calumnies against the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> whom the King and Parliament have preferred before them; and in Truth their Choler hath got the Ascendant so much, that if any good natur'd Physician will present them with a <hi>Purge,</hi> I'le chearfully contribute for some <hi>Bells</hi> and <hi>VVhistles,</hi> which for any thing I know, may be a Service to the State, and prevent a Voyage to the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> for Hemp.</p>
            <p>But to come to our Authors. Their Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>The Spirit of Calumny and Slander,</hi> is truly the same with which they themselves are possessed, as undeniably appears from the 3<hi>d</hi> Page of their Epistle to the Reader, where they assert, <hi>That they know no Sect, Antient or Modern, that ever broke the Peace of the Christian Church, but may be more plausibly defended than the latest Edition of Presbytery in</hi> Scotland. By the latest Edition, they must mean as it is now established, since the late Revolution in Doctrine and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Now for the Doctrine of the Presbyterians, it is establish'd by Act of Parliament, as contained in the <hi>Westminster</hi> Confession, which is granted by every one to be the same, as to the Matter, with the Doctrinal Articles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Then as for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44964:22"/>
their Discipline, which is establish'd by the same Authority, it is that of their Government by Parochial Consistories, made up of the Minister and Elders; Presbyteries, which consist of a greater number of Ministers and Elders associated; Provincial Synods, which are composed of Delegates from the several Presbyteries; and General Assemblies, which are form'd of Commissioners from all the Presbyteries of the Kingdom. Now any that have perused the Learned Arch-bishop <hi>Vsher</hi>'s Treatise, to reconcile Episcopacy and Presbytery; or that have ever considered the Concessions made as to the Government of the Church by <hi>Charles</hi> I. in his Treaties, may easily be convinc'd, whether our Learned Authors were not possessed with the Spirit of Calumny and Slander even in the sense of the Moderate Episcopalians, when they publish'd the Proposition above-mentioned. But this will appear more evident still, if we do but enumerate some of the Antient and Modern Sects who have broke the Peace of the Church.</p>
            <p>To begin with the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> who were so Antient, that Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond. Diss. Proem de Antichr.</hi> thinks that the Apostles saw the first Authors of their Opinions; and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> alludes to them, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. They are charg'd with denying the Godhead of Jesus Christ, maintaining all manner of Impure Lusts, polluting the places where they met accordingly, and foasting barbarously on the Children begotten in such Impurity, after they had pounded them into Mortar, which they esteem'd a most religious Act, as is related by <hi>Tertullian, Epiphan, Theodoret,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the next place, we shall name the <hi>Arians,</hi> who begun about 290, and infected most of the Christian World: They held Christ to be a Creature, and the Holy Ghost the like, rebaptiz'd the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and baptiz'd all their Disciples only from the Navel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as thinking the inferiour Parts unworthy of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Donatists</hi> flourish'd in the 4<hi>th</hi> Age, and held, that the Son was less than the Father, and the Holy Ghost less than the Son. That it was lawful to kill themselves, rather than fall into the Hands of the Magistrates, and to kill others who were not of the Faith.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Armenians</hi> in the 6<hi>th</hi> Age, who held, that Christ took not a Humane Body from the Virgin; that his Body was immortal from the Minute of his Conception; that there was a quaternity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and that the Divinity suffered.</p>
            <p>In the 11<hi>th</hi> and 12<hi>th,</hi> the <hi>Bong<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>milit</hi> rejected the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> and aledged that God had a Humane Shape.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:44964:22"/>But to make haste, we shall come to the German <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of the 16<hi>th</hi> Century, whose Opinions and Enthusiasms are known to every one: And the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who deny the Divinity of Jesus Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Arminians,</hi> I know it's in vain to name them, most of the Party being infected with their Leaven: But if any Man will be at the pains to compare the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and the <hi>Westminster</hi> Confession, which agree in the Matter, with the Sects here mentioned, he may quickly be satisfi'd whether those Gentlemen may not justly be charged with a Spirit of Malice and Slander, in saying, That they know no Sect, Antient or Modern, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but what are more plausible than Presbytery in the latest Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? They have no other Hole to creep out at, but either that they knew not of those Sects, or else that those Hereticks did not break the Peace of the Church; and then we shall know what Judgment to make of their Learning and Ingenuity. But if they insist upon the Comprehension Act, let them answer what I have already said on that Head.</p>
            <p>However, we may quickly be satisfied, that those Gentlemens Veracity and Learning, are much of a-piece, if we consider the amiable Character which they bestow upon the Presbyterians in the <hi>Scots Presbyterian Eloquence; viz.</hi>
               <q>That they are void of common Sense, never scruple any Perjury before a Judg, that may seem to advance their Cause. That they think Murder a Vertue, when the Work of the Covenant requires it. That they generally discountenance Morality; glory in Lying, Cheating, Murder and Rebellion, to fulfil the Ends of the Solemn League. That they look not upon a Man as endued with the Spirit of God, without a loud Voice, whining Tone, broken and smothered Words, and such canting deformity of Holiness. Their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, they say, are a proud, sowre, unconversible Tribe; looking perfectly like Pharisees, having Faces like their horrid Decrees of Reprobation; are without Humanity, void of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Civility: Never preach Christ nor Eternity; are Firebrands, the Scandal of Christianity, and Disgrace of the Nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now I would fain, in the first place, ask our Gentlemen, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not an Arraignment of the King and Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have lodged the Government of the Church in such Mens Hands, and established Presbytery to please such a sort of People? And if this Character be true, Whether King <hi>William</hi> be not the greatest of Tyrants, to have establish'd such a Church by the touch of his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44964:23"/>
Scepter, in contrariety to such a Learned, Holy, and Innocent Party as the Scots Episcopalians? And if this Character be not true, Whether the Libellers and Bookseller be not obnoxious to the Government, and guilty of seditious Designs, in accusing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of having concurred to the settling of such a Church? Or, whether the Ministers of State in <hi>Scotland</hi> have not cause to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Justice for this Indignity put upon their King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>In the next place, Who deserve most to be charg'd with Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Malice, Slander and Forgery, the Authors of the <hi>Scots Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Eloquence,</hi> who charge the whole Presbyterian Party of <hi>Scotland</hi> with those odious Crimes in general? or the Answerer, who proves the Prelatical Persecution by Acts of their own Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their Murders by uncontroulable Instances? And his Charge in general against their Clergy, by the Vote of this present Parliament, when a Convention, <hi>That they were the great and insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Grievance of the Nation.</hi> To which the Prelatists can op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose nothing, but Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi>'s Vindication of <hi>Charles</hi> II's Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which the Answerer hath made appear to be a malicious Libel, or else the Cause of King <hi>William</hi>'s Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking was unjust, and He and his Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Liars, in declaring those Acts which Sir <hi>George</hi> defends to be <hi>impious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And last of all, I would ask those Gentlemen, Whether they think that any thing which they invent or suggest against the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer, can justly deserve any Credit, when they attaque the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the King, Parliament, and all the Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But lest I should weary my Reader, in being too serious with Libellers, that know not how to be serious in any thing but Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I'le give him <hi>Apollos</hi>'s Portraiture of Calumny; the Goddess to which our Scots Prelatists do now offer Incense, though at the same time they have still a hankering mind after <hi>Bachus</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> This Goddess called by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by <hi>Credulity</hi> with great Leathern Ears like <hi>Midas,</hi> or the silly Tory-fellows about Town, who damn and sink themselves, if all that the Doctor and his Fraternity have writ against the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be not true. <hi>Credulity</hi> stretched out her Hands to <hi>Calumny,</hi> as those dull Fellows do to the Authors of the <hi>Scots Presbyt. Eloquence.</hi> On each Hand of <hi>Credulity,</hi> were <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Iealousy,</hi> i. e. <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thry, Foster,</hi> &amp;c. who trot about the Country, to impose upon the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44964:23"/>
Credulous, with their abominable Forgeries against the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. The first of them was represented by a blind Woman, that saw as little before her Nose, as does <hi>Simon Wild</hi> the pretended Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>the Spirit of Malice and Slander:</hi> And the second by a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of an ill-natur'd Look, just like Dr. <hi>Monroe,</hi> expressing his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness, as the Doctor did at my Answers, but yet seeming to be pleased with some secret thing which he had discovered, as he and his scoundrel Journey-men hug and bless themselves at the huge Discoveries which they pretend to have made against Mr. <hi>R.</hi> in Sir <hi>W. Paterson</hi>'s Letter, accusing him of the terrible Sin of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning. In the middle of the Picture, facing <hi>Credulity,</hi> appeared <hi>Calumny</hi> like a very handsome Woman, well dressed, but having a fierce Look, and her Eyes sparkling with Anger, the lively Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the false Accusations forg'd by the Doctor and his Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, against the Church and State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and varnish'd over with a counterfeit Zeal for the Church of <hi>England.</hi> In her left Hand <hi>Calumny</hi> carried a burning <hi>Torch,</hi> the <hi>flagrant Scandals</hi> with which they charge the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in general and particular. And in her right Hand she dragg'd a <hi>little Infant,</hi> who by its cries im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plor'd the Assistance of Heaven, and so do we to vindicate our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence against the Scourge of their false Tongues. She had <hi>Envy</hi> for her Gentleman-Usher, who look'd like a Meagre and withered Fellow, eat up by his own Choler. Another lively Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dr. <hi>Monroe,</hi> who changes Posts, and is sometimes <hi>Prefacer,</hi> sometimes <hi>Author,</hi> to the scandalous Libels against the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>; and being outed of his Place because unworthy, corrodes his own Bowels with his viperous Resentments, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Unfortunate being always enraged with their Misfortunes. <hi>Calumny</hi> was followed by <hi>Imposture</hi> and <hi>Flattery,</hi> such as <hi>Iohnston</hi>'s forg'd Certificates; and those from the Coopers, Curats, Carters, and old obsolete <hi>Iacobite</hi> Magistrates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> of whom afterwards. However these took care of <hi>Calumny</hi>'s Dress, or what else belong'd to her Service; and so those humble Sneaks are ready to wait on the Doctor, <hi>Iurare in Verba Magistri,</hi> and condemn a Book which I am sure some of them never saw. At a considerable distance from <hi>Calumny,</hi> followed <hi>Truth.</hi> My Answers justified by the Acts of Parliament, and other Records of the Nation. <hi>Truth</hi> seem'd to march towards the Place where <hi>Calumny</hi> stood, to beat up the Doctor's Quarters. And <hi>Truth</hi> was followed by <hi>Repentance</hi> in <hi>Mourning</hi>; and I wish both of them to the Doctor, for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Lies which he hath uttered against the Presbyterians. This
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44964:24"/>
Representation of <hi>Calumny</hi> did <hi>Apelles</hi> present to one of <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Captains, against another Painter, who had falsly accused <hi>Apelles</hi> of a Conspiracy. And in like manner I present my Reader with this Portraiture against Dr. <hi>Monro,</hi> and the rest of the Scots Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Lies-mongers, who have falsly accused the Presbyterians in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and many of them in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 2. Our Authors undertake to make it appear, before any number of grave Witnesses, That there is not one good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence in the Answer to the <hi>Scots Presbyterian Eloquence.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Answerer challenged them then, and does again challenge them now, to prove this an ill Consequence; That if it can be made appear that they enacted severer Laws against us, than we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; or that the Prosecution of those Laws by the then Government, was much more rigid than the Prosecution of our Laws by the present Government: Then it must necessarily be granted, that the Scots Episcopalians are Liars, in saying, That they are more severely persecuted than ever we were. Now if I have not made good the Antecedent in the first part of the Answer to the <hi>Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> I appeal to all Men of Sense: And therefore the Consequence must hold good in spite of the Doctor and his Journey-men: And until they answer what is aduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Position in that Book, they must be contented to be posted for Liars, in saying what they have asserted; or Cowards, that dare not defend it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 2. You bestow the Epithet of the <hi>truly Iust,</hi> upon Sir <hi>Geo. Mackenzie,</hi> and endeavour to stave off the Charge of Subordination, and change it into that which our Law calls Precognition, or a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious examination of the Witnesses. But, Doctor, there is a great difference betwixt Precognition and Prescription: Sir <hi>George</hi> set them their Lesson, and took an Account whether they had conn'd it, that they might swear it briskly in Court: And if it had been otherwise, there was no need of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s begging forgiveness of God upon that Account; which Sir <hi>George Campbel</hi> of <hi>Cesnock</hi> will own to be true, though you have the Impudence to say, that I have no ground for what I asserted in this Matter, but my own Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulance.</p>
            <p>Then as for your Insinuation, that Sir <hi>Geo. Mackenzie</hi> needed not that Gentleman's Recommendation to the present Court, if he had been ambitious to have been a Favourite. It shows your incurable Ignorance of what is the Subject in Controversy betwixt us; for I said, that he had a Mind to ingratiate himself with that Gentleman,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44964:24"/>
without any mention of his Application to the Court; tho in the mean time it's well-enough known, that how ambitious soever you or he either might have been of Favour at Court, that the Court car'd for neither of you; and so you may stand aloof with the Fox, and cry out, sowre Plumbs, when you cannot come at them.</p>
            <p>And as for your slovenly Reflections, <hi>Pag.</hi> 3. upon Sir <hi>Geo. Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> for divulging Sir <hi>Geo. Mackenzie</hi>'s Acknowledgment, it's a Commendation from such an one as you, who can speak well of no honest Man: Nor has he any reason to resent it, seeing you are as unmannerly to the King and Queen, whose Favour you think not to have been worthy of Sir <hi>Geo. Mackenzie</hi>'s Ambition.</p>
            <p>As for what you call my Advice and Threatnings to English Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State, I said nothing but what concerns the Honour of our Nation, and what all true Scots-men do and will maintain, that they ought not to meddle in our Affairs. <hi>Stafford</hi> was as high once, as some others are now: And his Holiness, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> who took the Title of <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials,</hi> p. 83.</note> 
               <hi>Pontifex Maximus, Aeternum Reverendissime Cancellarie,</hi> and <hi>Sanctitas Vestra,</hi> did as much despise the Church and Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as you and your Patrons do at this Day; yet both of them were broken in pieces by falling on that Stone. And as I said then, I say still, that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> is not so very contemptible, but that its Influence may reach those who put an Affront and Injury upon them now, as well as formerly.</p>
            <p>As for your false, malicious and impudent Reflection, <hi>Pag.</hi> 3. That I treat King <hi>William</hi> no better than other Kings. It's like the rest of your Sense and Veracity: I only make a Supposition, that if it should be so and so, what we may justly plead and defend by the practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> toward King <hi>Iames.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I charge your Kings with direct Breach of their Trust, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Original Contract; but your Eyes were blinded with Indecencies of Passion, or sitting up too late at the Tavern, that you could not, or would not see what I wrote; yet, like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Worshipper of Calumny, you are resolved to reproach, tho without either Sense or Reason, as appears by your delicate Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to maintain your Position: because, I say, he is prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to write Letters to the General Assembly, which they are not obliged in Law to comply with; therefore you argue, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Hypothesis, If he venture upon such Essays of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power, he may in a little time forfeit his Title, since he has none but such as is twisted with the Divine Right of Presbytery
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44964:25"/>
Pray, Doctor, look upon this Argument your self once more, and see whether your Conclusion can naturally follow from the Premisses, and compare the Hypothesis which you have laid down as mine, with <hi>P.</hi> 4. of my Book which you refer to, and see if you have not kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishly perverted it My Assertion is,
<q>That their Majesties accepted the Crown upon this Condition, among others, in the Claim of Right, <hi>That they should consent to the Abolition of Prelacy, as contrary to the Inclination of the generality of the People:</hi> And that they have since abolished it accordingly, (which is a fulfilling of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract) and established Presbytery in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as most agreeable to the World of God, as well as the Peoples Inclinations, which are the very Words of the Act of Parliament. Then I suppose, that if their Majesties should be prevailed upon (which, blessed be God, there is no cause to fear) to act contrary to their solemn Oath, and the Claim of Right, they must needs see that the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> would have ground enough to plead a Breach of the Original Contract. Nor could the Church of <hi>England</hi> for shame condemn them, seeing they have made use of the same Plea, in their Convention and Parliament against King <hi>Iames.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Doctor, where can you find in these Words, that I say or insinuate, that he hath no Title but what is twisted with the Divine Right of Presbytery? His Title is indeed twisted with an Obligation to abolish Prelacy, as contrary to the Peoples Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to establish such a Government of the Church, as should be found most agreeable to the same. And accordingly after a Twelve-months suspence, which was time enough to examine it, Presbytery was settled, as most agreeable to the People, and, <hi>ex super abundanti,</hi> as also most agreeable to the Word of God: Which Clause it was in his Majesty's own Power to have consented to, or not; for there was no such thing twisted with his Title, nor did I ever assert it as you do knavishly alledg, though at the same time I made it appear, that according to the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, a King may forfeit his Title by breaking the Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and dispensing with the Laws; for that was the Clamour of your Party against the late King, though your Universities, Judges and Clergy, had formerly preached up his Dispensing Power.</p>
            <p>Then for your Argument, to fix your Malicious Reflection upon me, that if he venture upon such Essays of Arbitrary Power, as writing Letters to the General Assembly, which they are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in Law to comply with, he may in a little time Forfeit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:44964:25"/>
It's so weak, that I am asham'd for Country's-sake, that ever that Man should have been made Vice-Chancellor of an University who argues no better. Will any Man of Sense infer, that because his Majesty, out of his exuberant Clemency to his sworn Enemies, writes to the General Assembly to admit some of them into the Church, which they are impowered to do by the Law if they please, but are not obliged by the Law to do it; I say, will any Man of Sense, think that this is such an Essay of Arbitrary Power, as may hazard the forfeiture of the Crown? Indeed, Doctor, according to the late Actings and Arguments of your Party, such a Principle may be fix'd upon a certain sort of Men in the World, who assoon as the King touched the Hem of their Garment, and gave Liberty to Dissenters, did forthwith bandy against him, and expel him. But you may see that all those Kings which the Presbyterians did oppose, were guilty of overturning the very Foundations; and yet the World must needs own that they were very tender of King <hi>Charles</hi> I's Title and Person, notwithstanding of all his Male-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations. And if your Doctorship please, either to read <hi>Rushworth</hi>'s <hi>Collections, Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Memorials,</hi> or the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs</hi> of the <hi>House of Hamilton,</hi> you will find how Honourably the Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland</hi> acted in relation to King <hi>Charles</hi> I, both in the Treaty, at delivering him up; complaining of the Breach of that Treaty by the Usurping Faction, and protesting against his Imprisonment and Trial; though you be pleas'd, to the dishonour of your Native Country, to assert, with as much Impudence, as Ignorance and Malice, <hi>That we tied him Hand and Foot, till others out off his Head.</hi> Whereas all the World knows that the same Party who cut off his Head, would be satisfied with nothing less than our Hearts Blood for espousing his Cause, and that of his Son and Successor <hi>Charles</hi> II. when those who were afterwards the greatest Sticklers for your Party, did at the same time abjure him; as did also General <hi>Monk</hi> when he was actually bringing him in; which you may see in the same Author's above-mentioned; and the Life of both those Kings printed lately by <hi>Nathaniel Crouch</hi> in the <hi>Poultry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, Doctor, I must find some Weapon-Salve for that dreadful Wound which you have given me, in saying, That her present Majesty is much obliged to me—for alledging that the Scots Prelatists have put the <hi>Stuarts</hi> from the Throne. Really, Doctor, I do think that the Family of <hi>Nassaw</hi> is now upon the Throne, and that with so many Advantages as have hardly been
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44964:26"/>
seen before; for all the different Titles of <hi>Birth, Marriage,</hi> and the <hi>Peoples Choice,</hi> are centred in his present Majesty; whom God hath indowed with such Qualifications, that if <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had had such a Successor, he would never have said, <hi>detur digniori.</hi> But, Doctor, I am so much a Scots-Man, that I am no otherwise for the House of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> than as the Champions whom God hath chosen for the Protestant Interest, and one of the most Illustrious <hi>Cyons</hi> that ever was engrafted in old <hi>Fergus</hi>'s Stock. Nor is it any Diminution to the Honour of our Country, to have a King from that Family which gave Emperors to <hi>Germany.</hi> But, Doctor, <hi>Hinc illae Lachrymae, proh dolor!</hi> Here's the thing that grieves your Party. That that very Family which cut the Turkish <hi>Bowstring</hi> of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> when sent from Spain to choak the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> should, by the Wheel of Fortune, be tumbled from beyond Sea to do the like for <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which have been in horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Convulsions ever since the Apostles of Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials,</hi> p. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Sibthorp</hi> and <hi>Manwaring</hi> preached in 1626, <hi>That the King might make Laws, and do whatever pleaseth him; and that the Subjects under pain of Damnation, ought to pay the Loan-Money, demanded by</hi> Charles I. <hi>and obey the King's Will in all things.</hi> Which by the way, Doctor, gives quite another state of the Doctrine of Passive Obedience, then what your Doctor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is pleas'd to exhibite <hi>P.</hi> . . . . And if it be not <hi>Nefas dictu,</hi> I humbly conceive that the Authors of that Doctrine understood it as well as your Doctorship, or any other of their Scholars: But in truth, Doctor, Ignorance and Malice are so very discernable in your <hi>Spirit of Calumny,</hi> that it's hard to know which of them has the Ascendant; for I perceive your <hi>Elect Lordship</hi> so much upon the Fret, and in such a terrible Rage against the Presbyterians, that you charge them with as little Sense, and as much Malice, as did that Fellow <hi>who came home drunk, and not being able to find the Key-hole of his Door, swore, That the Fanaticks had stole it away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, Doctor, I would fain know whether it be not against the Logical Axiom <hi>ex particulari,</hi> because <hi>Herriot</hi> appointed an Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be kept by those of his Hospital, for whom he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a constant Maintenance, on condition that they observe his Rules; of which this is one, To argue thence that the Observation of Anniversaries may be impos'd upon a whole Nation, by Churches or Civil Magistrates. Really, Doctor, I think this to be just such a way of arguing, as that of a foolish Girl, who being a gathering of Berries with her Mother, said, O Mother, here's abundance of Berries, for I have found one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:44964:26"/>Or tell me, Doctor, whether it be not a <hi>Nonsequitur,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a particular Man may impose an Anniversary upon those of an Hospital whom he maintains, and who by the Observation of his Rules, whereof this is one, are entituled to all the Benefits of his Munificence; to argue thence, That the Church, or Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, may impose Anniversaries upon all the Christians in a Nation, seeing they are neither the Founders of their Religion, nor Donors of the Benefits which they reap thereby.</p>
            <p>Next, I would pray your Doctorship to resolve me, Whether if I affirm such a Man to be a whining Fellow, who drivles at Eyes and Mouth, which in all English Construction must signify Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and another calls that same Man a Ludicrous Fellow in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that very Action; I say, I would pray you to resolve me, Whether we do not contradict one another? But if the Doctor have such a Faculty, that he can drivle at Eyes and Mouth in Jest, I confess that he not only deserves the Name of <hi>Scaramouchi,</hi> but to be a <hi>Merry-Andrew</hi> in the principal Booth in <hi>Bartholomew-Fair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Doctor, to argue this Point a little further, tell me, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be not a direct Contradiction betwixt your Parties say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I cited it, Pag. 37. <hi>That there was nothing like Iustice amongst the Presbyterians; and your owning that the Presbyterian Privy Council, and a Presbyterian Synod treated Dr.</hi> Canaries <hi>with special Honour, acquitted him, and reproved his Accusers?</hi> Really, Doctor, if this be not a Contradiction, I do not understand one; but I wish you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood a little more Honesty, to quote your Adversary fairly, and not leave out my Words, on which the stress of the Argument lay, as you did here. You make a great Noise with me, for leaving out the Word <hi>Sense</hi>; when you oppose the Quality, Sense and Interest of your Party against ours; and yet charge me falsly with saying, that <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate had the advantage of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians, in Quality, Sense and Interest; whereas I only said in Quality and Interest, which you cannot deny. But, Doctor, I'le allow you Sense too, and yet the Argument will hold pretty well; for <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, were Men of much better Education and Sense too, if we mean Philosophy, or Natural Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than any of the Apostles, <hi>Paul</hi> excepted: And yet the Christian Religion is no loser by it, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself declares, <hi>that not many Wise, not many Mighty, nor not many Rich are called</hi>; and here is Quality, <hi>Sense and Interest</hi> allowed to be on the side of our Enemies by the Apostle; so that the Presbyterians might yield all three to the Prelatists, and be no losers in their Cause: but,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44964:27"/>
blessed be God, we need not, for we have the King and Parliament on our Side, and I hope there's <hi>Quality, Sense</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> enough to over ballance you. Then you alledg, that I own your Honour and Integrity; whereas I only tell you, <hi>that it's none of my Business to question it; but the Instances they are charged with, come under none of those Heads:</hi> which to any Man but the Doctor, would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood a denial of it; and therefore your Doctorship must either confute those Instances, or yield your Cause; for I still say it's none of my Business to question their Honour and Integrity <hi>in Terminis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Doctor, to make an end of our Logical Controversy; look to the last Page of your Postscript, and tell me, Whether those words, <hi>he begins his Book with a Lie in the Title Page</hi>; or this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that such a Book was <hi>printed for</hi> Thomas Anderson <hi>at</hi> Charing-Cross, <hi>is a Lie,</hi> be Affirmative or Negative? Doctor, I maintain the former, and for this reason, because there is somewhat affirmed of the Subject: And to make it plain to every Capacity that they are Affirmative, let's try whether they be the same with these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions; He does not begin his Book with a Lie, or that such a Book was printed for <hi>Thomas Anderson</hi> at <hi>Charing-Cross,</hi> is not a Lie; which are undoubtedly Negative.</p>
            <p>Doctor, I presume that you have not forgot the Logical Canon, <hi>Vt propositio sit Negativa, necesse est particulam Negandi, vel toti propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oni praemitti, vel Copulae &amp; verbo adjectivo habenti vim Copulandi imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate addi.</hi> Pray, Sir, either show the Particle of Negation in your Proposition, <hi>He begins his Book with a Lie in the Title Page,</hi> or yield the Cause.</p>
            <p>But seeing you are pleased to say further, That <hi>if you called me a Liar</hi>; though such a Proposition sounded like an <hi>Affirmative,</hi> yet it was no Affirmative Proposition, but finally resolved into a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and can no otherwise be proved than as a Negative may. I demonstrate the contrary thus. You know that <hi>Mentiri,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>Contra mentem ire,</hi> and therefore you will excuse the Latin;
<q>
                  <l>Omnis qui it contra mentem, mentitur;</l>
                  <l>At Doctor <hi>Monro</hi> it contra mentem:</l>
                  <l>Ergo.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Doctor, I prove the Minor thus, You said, That <hi>Halside</hi> denies that ever he was persecuted by Sir <hi>George Mackenzie,</hi> which you must know to be an Untruth; for <hi>Halside</hi> never denied any such thing. And thus, Doctor, I have called you a Liar, and proved it as an Affirmative; and submit it to the Judgment of all Mankind,

whether it be you, or Mr. <hi>R.</hi> that has discovered their Ignorance of the Difference betwixt a Negative and an Affirmative Proposition?</p>
            <p>Doctor, as for the mighty Advantage you imagine to your self, because of the Act of the Assembly enjoining the Covenant to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Students at their first entrance to the College; you will find it not so great as you believe, for you did equivocate at best, in saying, It was required of Children at Schools: By which one might have thought, that it was imposed upon Children before they could read. And according to your wonted Honesty, you charge words upon me, that I never wrote, <hi>viz.</hi> That I believed the Covenant was required of little Children that offered to take Degrees of Master of Arts, about the Age of thirty Years; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I mentioned no such thing as thirty Years in that Case: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, Doctor, I make bold to call you a Liar; which according to your Logick, is no Affirmative, and therefore I hope you won't be angry.</p>
            <p>But further, Doctor, although it be the Custom now for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to go to the Universities at Twelve or Fourteen, which yet is rare, except you mean the Humanity Class; it was not so usual in 1638, or the Time of the Covenant, which I believe your Doctor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship may have heard, if you don't remember it. But after all, Doctor, I own that I did not remember the Act, nor have not the Acts of the Assembly by me, but yet I was as near the Truth in my Supposition, as you were in your Assertion, if Schools be taken in the lowest sense.</p>
            <p>But, Doctor, because I do not love to be in your Debt, I'le an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer your Question in <hi>Pag.</hi> 54. and shew, that you are as ignorant of your own Acts, as I am of our Acts. Your Act of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity obliged all Ecclesiasticks to renounce all Obligation from the Covenant on them, or any other, to endeavour any Alteration of Church-Government. And by the Corporation Act, all Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists were obliged to swear, That they would never endeavour any Alteration of the Church-Government, or else they were not suffered to live within five Miles of a Corporation. And not only so, but all Vestries, Corporations, and Militia, were sworn never to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour any Alteration of Government of the Church. So that now I hope your Doctorship has received more than a sufficient Answer to your Demand, to let you know, if ever Clergy-men were turn'd out of their Livings upon their denying to promise, neither directly nor indirectly to alter an Ecclesiastical Government. For here you see it is imposed upon Laicks, and therefore we hope
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44964:28"/>
that the Church of <hi>England</hi> will find no reason to complain, that this is imposed upon our Ecclesiasticks. And whereas you caution me not to run up and down, and make a Noise as if you opposed an Act of Parliament, for you only dispute against the Opinion of blind Zealots, who have no more regard to the Peace of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than to the Order of Episcopacy: In truth, Doctor, I think it is reckoned Treason in <hi>Scotland</hi> to impugn an Act of Parliament; and King and Parliament both, are those blind Zealots against whom you dispute, for they have in the Act, establishing Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, declared it most agreeable to the Word of God. But your Doctorship is wiser than they all, and says, It cannot be reconcil'd to it, no more than to the former Settlement of Presbytery; and yet the last Act establishing Presbytery, does only ratify the Act of 1592: But such Contradictions are venial in the Doctor.</p>
            <p>As to St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Epistle to St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> your Doctorship is so much Cock-a-hoop, that it's but reasonable to chastise your trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Ignorance, by citing it: And therefore if you please to read his 19<hi>th</hi> to St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> you will find these words, <hi>Quamvis secundum honorum vocabula, quae Ecclesiae usus obtinuit, Episcopatus Presbyterio ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor est, in multis tamen,</hi> &amp;c. Now, Doctor, I think here's the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Presbytery acknowledg'd, and nothing more but a <hi>Ius humanum</hi> of Episcopacy asserted, which was all that I said; though, according to your ordinary way, you falsify my words. And whereas you are pleased to argue for Episcopacy, from the Jewish Church-Government, as having a High-Priest above the other Priests; I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you do not also argue for Circumcision to be join'd to the rest of your Jewish Ceremonies; and perhaps you might, if it were only to be imposed upon Laicks. But I am afraid that your High-Priest <hi>Paterson</hi> would never consent to it, because, for a time at least, it would mar his and some other of your Clergy-mens Gallantries. But, Doctor, is not there a visible disparity in the Case? Can you say that the Office of a Bishop, is as distinctly set down as different from a Presbyter in the New Testament, as that of a Priest and High-Priest in the Old? For though you find the Name of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter given to all above a Deacon in the New Testament, yet you find the Offices of Apostle, Evangelist, and Presbyter, to have their specifical Differences; but so you can never do as to Bishop and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, who are the same in Name and Office; but that you let slip through your Fingers.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now, Doctor, I hope you will allow Father <hi>Simon</hi> to be as well vers'd in Rabbinical Learning as your self: You see that he only insinuates their Imitation of the Jews, but nothing of a Divine Warrant; and plainly owns, that the Superiority of Bishops over Presbyters, is meerly of humane Original. But I must tell you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Doctor, that your Argument from the High-Priest of the Jews, will be more conclusive for a Pope: And if this be not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued like a Gentleman of his Guard, it's however argued like one that wishes him well. For your brag as to St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile it to his Commentary on <hi>Titus,</hi> or your own Opinion with Dr. <hi>Holland</hi>'s K. <hi>Iames</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi>'s Professor at <hi>Oxford,</hi> Arch-bishop <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi>'s, Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi>'s, and others of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The first in an Act at <hi>Oxford,</hi> July 9. 1608. concluded, That it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scriptures, Fathers, Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Schoolmen, to say that <hi>Episcopatus est ordo distinctus à Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteratu, co<expan>

            </p>
            <p>And in the next place, Doctor, as a further Answer, consider, That there was no standing Officer appointed in the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Church above a Deacon, but a Presbyter. And <hi>Clemens,</hi> who lived in the first Century, in his Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> telling them, That God in the Jewish Church, appointed a High Priest, Priests and Levites, names no other Orders of Ministry in the Christian Church, but Bishops and Deacons; His words are <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But, Doctor, my next Attaque shall be upon your Evidence, Sir <hi>William Paterson,</hi> who is pleased to treat Mr. <hi>Ridpath</hi> with the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel Terms of <hi>Villain, Rascal, Varlet,</hi> &amp;c. though at the same time Mr. <hi>Ridpath</hi> is content to refer it to any Herald in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Family whence he is descended, or Sir <hi>William</hi>'s be the best. It can be very well instructed, that the Family of <hi>Ridpath</hi> is of the same Original with the <hi>Gordons,</hi> both by the Heralds Books, their armorial Bearings, and constant Tradition. And I think there's none will deny, that the Family of <hi>Gordon</hi> is one of the eldest and greatest Families in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The History of <hi>Douglas</hi> does also own, that their Princely Family did not think it below them to espouse the Quarrel of that of <hi>Ridpath,</hi> the best Families of the <hi>Mers,</hi> as those of <hi>Swinton, Cockburn,</hi> &amp;c. will not disown their having been allied to them: And there's yet a Monument in <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi>'s Church, at the Head of that which was formerly the Baron of <hi>Ridpath</hi>'s Seat, demonstrating, that one of our Kings did not think it below him to be the Guest of that Family, and to honour them with his Company to Church. This I have much ado to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with Mr. <hi>Ridpath</hi> to let pass, as being of the Opinion, that all such things are but Vanity; and that <hi>sola Virtus nobilitat</hi>; nor would he have indeed suffered it, but that his malicious Enemies think it their Interest to revile and vilify him, because, forsooth, he was a Servant; though at the same time he was never Servant to any Man, but in a Station becoming a Scholar, and thinks it no disgrace to be so still: And as for being Servant to the two Sons of one Mr. <hi>Grey,</hi> it's false; he had no concern but with one of the <hi>Greys,</hi> and that was as an Assistant in his Studies; and that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did then, and does still treat him as his Companion, nor is he asham'd to own that he serves Mr. <hi>Grey</hi> now.</p>
            <p>As for Dr. <hi>Cant</hi>'s having found the <hi>Bond of Combination,</hi> as he calls it, upon Mr. <hi>R.</hi> it's also false; nor was ever the Original Bond found by any of your Party; though Mr. <hi>Massey,</hi> who was his Regent, had a foul Copy of the Bond from Mr. <hi>Grey,</hi> which must be that, if there be any, that is in the Council Office: And if it be there, he dares refer to it to prove Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Falshood, as to that Clause inviting Prentices, and all others, to join in the Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44964:29"/>
for there was never any such in it. But lest Sir <hi>William,</hi> or any of his Gang, have corrupted it, I shall by and by exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit an attested Copy to prove what I say: And it is as false that any Ring-leader of the Presbyterians, or any other, were concern'd in framing the Design besides the Students themselves. Nor was it ever design'd as a Prologue to any Rebellion, as Sir <hi>William</hi> does aver. Neither has Mr. <hi>R.</hi> any reason to believe that he would have been spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, could the Law have reach'd him, or could they have found a Jury to have condemn'd him; for the Proceedings against him on that Head, were universally abhor'd by all Protestants in general, those of Sir <hi>William</hi> and the Doctor's Kidney excepted. As to the Benefit which Mr. <hi>R.</hi> had by the D. of <hi>York</hi>'s Clemency, we shall hear anon: And as to the falseness of his Answer to the D. of <hi>Rothes,</hi> and other great Lords, he defies Sir <hi>William</hi> to instance in one.</p>
            <p>But to set this whole Matter in its true Light, take this short but true Narrative of it. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> having, upon reading the account of the Pope burning at <hi>London,</hi> moved it first himself to some of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Students; the Design was so laid afterwards, that it could not well, nor did not miscarry; though the two Mr. <hi>Greys,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thry,</hi> Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and others were taken up the Night before the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pope, on design to prevent it; and after the Business was done, examined by Sir <hi>George Mackenzie,</hi> the King's Advocate: but Mr. <hi>R.</hi> being sufficiently possessed with the Apprehensions of the then raging Tyranny, he refus'd to answer, though threatned with Torture, till he was perswaded thereunto by his Regent, Mr. <hi>Massey,</hi> who told him in a very Friendly manner by himself, that my Lord Advocate only desir'd to know whether any other than the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents were concerned in the Contrivance; for if it happened to be so, that it was only a Project of their own, the Council would pass it over as a puerile Business; whereupon Mr. <hi>R.</hi> confessed, that he drew the Bond, and after several Questions upon that Head, was discharged, which was a very unpardonable Blunder in that great Lawyer, if the Matter had <hi>imported High Treason,</hi> as Sir <hi>William</hi> alledges. But that this was so in Matter of Fact; Mr. <hi>R.</hi> appeals to Mr. <hi>Massey,</hi> who is still a Regent at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; and though no Knight, yet a Person of better Reputation than ever Sir <hi>William</hi> was. But though Mr. <hi>R.</hi> was set thus at Liberty, a Storm immediately succeeded the Calm; some malicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons having spread it about, that the Students had threatned to burn the Provosts House, which stood about a Mile from the Town, if he would not release their Comrades from Prison; the House was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44964:30"/>
in a few Days after burnt by some Papists, as was suppos'd, to bring an Odium upon the Colledg; but the Students were all of them at Liberty before, so that they had no further Ground of quarrel, and a barrel of Powder with the King's Ammunition-Mark, which the Students could never have come by, was also found near the place. However the Council issued a Proclamation, charging it upon the Students, and summoning the Regents to appear with such and such of their Scholars to answer it: and Mr. <hi>R.</hi> being one of those named, his Friends advised him to withdraw, because they knew his Danger, both as a Presbyterian and framer of the Bond, but especially because there was no due legal Course observed in those Days. Yet he was so concern'd for his Reputation, and that of the University which he had engaged in the Affair of the Pope burning, that he would not abscond, but appear'd on the Day of Summons; and being examin'd on the Head of the Bond, for burning the Pope, refus'd to answer at first, because he was sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned for his alledged Accession to the burning of <hi>Priest-field.</hi> But the Council declining that, and insisting upon the other, and Mr. <hi>R.</hi> knowing that he had confessed to Sir <hi>George Mackenzie,</hi> as above, that he had writ the Bond, did again own it before the Council. And after many other Questions wherein the Bishops were severest upon him, the D. of <hi>Rothes</hi> was very favourable to him, upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Relation to Mr. <hi>Thomas Ridpath</hi> of <hi>Fulfordlees.</hi> But Mr. <hi>R.</hi> being ordered to withdraw to a Corner of the Room, while the Council advis'd what to do, Sir <hi>W. Paterson,</hi> then Clerk to the Council, came to Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and pretending a deal of Friendship, ask'd him, If he went to Church? which Mr. <hi>R.</hi> refusing to answer, this generous Knight went immediately to the Council-board, and mov'd them to ask the Question, which heightned their Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but especially that of the Bishops against him. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> was hereupon ordered to Prison; and as the Macer was carring him out at the Council Chamber-door, Mr. <hi>R.</hi> perceiving that there was abundance of Spectators, and remembring that the whole Colledg was falsly charged with the burning of Sir <hi>Iames Dick</hi>'s House, then Lord Provost, for suffering them to be so much abused, he thought it requisite, seeing he was the only Student committed, to tell the Spectators, in his own Vindication, that it <hi>was only for burning the Pope.</hi> Sir <hi>W. Paterson,</hi> who represents these words falsely, being behind Mr. <hi>R.</hi> when he said so, pull'd him back by the Hair, and revil'd him before the Council, in much the same Language that he uses now in his Letter. And the D. of <hi>Rothes,</hi> the President, sign'd an Order
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44964:30"/>
for Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s close Consinement without Pen, Ink, or Paper, or any Friends having Liberty to come and see him, without his Order. And thus, Doctor, you have an Account how your Evidence, Sir <hi>W. Paterson,</hi> acted both the part of an Informer and Hangman against Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and therefore it's no wonder that he should vilify one whom he had so much abus'd.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>R.</hi> being consin'd, as above, was kept close Prisoner for five Weeks, and removed from Room to Room to prevent his escape or rescue, without any Friends having liberty to speak with him, but in presence of the Keeper, who, from time to time, brought him Word that he was to be tortured, as indeed the Council had threatned him, or some such dismal Message. And at the same time the University was broke up, the Students banish'd the City, and an extraordinary Guard set upon the Prison; but that ever Mr. <hi>R.</hi> was laid in Irons, as Sir <hi>W.</hi> says, is false, though he did very much wonder at the Providence of his escaping the <hi>Boot,</hi> or a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Examination. However two other snares were laid for him at the same time: the first was, by putting in one <hi>Iohn Murray</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same Room with him, who was condemned for an Opinion which some of those poor oppressed People called <hi>Cameronians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan then to broach, that <hi>Charles</hi> II. ought not to be own'd as King, because he had broken the Covenant on which he took the Crown, and that a small number of about 20 or 30 Men had declar'd his Forfeiture at <hi>Sanqhair.</hi> This Man being much superior to Mr. <hi>R.</hi> in Years, and very Zealous for his Opinion, they thought he would infect Mr. <hi>R.</hi> with it, and so they might hang him by clear Law: but a worthy Minister, supposed to be the Reverend and Learned Mr. <hi>Iamison,</hi> having found means to convey Notice of the Design to Mr. <hi>R.</hi> it was not only frustrated, but Mr. <hi>R.</hi> proved an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to save his Fellow-Prisoner, by convincing him of the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of his Principles; and perswading him to petition the Council, which with the Intercession of his Friends procur'd his Pardon, though he was just ready to have been led to Execution.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>R.</hi> having been 5 Weeks in close Prison, was upon his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition allowed the Liberty of the House; and a little after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil passed a Sentence of Banishment upon him, without calling for him to shew a reason why: And at that same time they laid a 2<hi>d</hi> Snare for him by ordering him to sign a Bond, obliging himself to depart the Kingdom in ten Days, and never to return without their Licence, on pain of being holden <hi>pro Confesso,</hi> as guilty of the Burning of <hi>Priestfield</hi> abovementioned, and punish'd accordingly.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44964:31"/>
But Mr. <hi>R.</hi> did utterly reject it, because he perceived the Design, though they thought, that being a young Man, and uneasy under Confinement, it would have gone down glibb, and then they would have had occasion of Calumny at least not only against him, but the whole Colledg, though they never examined him upon that Head when he was before them. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> petitioning the Duke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this unreasonable Bond, and desiring only that the Penalty might be altered, it was granted, and Mr. <hi>R.</hi> was ordered to give Bond, and a Bondsman, for 2000 Mark Forfeiture, if he did not depart the Kingdom in 10 Days, and never return without their Licence; which was accordingly done <hi>March</hi> 10, 1681.</p>
            <p>This is a true Narrative of that Affair; and now, Doctor, Mr. <hi>R.</hi> is not afraid to leave it to any true Protestant to judg, whether his Part in it, or that of your Prelatical Council, and particularly the gallant Knight Sir <hi>W. Paterson,</hi> was most honourable; especially if Mr. <hi>R</hi>'s Years, and other Circumstances, be duly considered. For however your Scurrilous Evidence Sir <hi>William</hi> represents him, he had never then been under the Razor; though the valourous Knight may be very well satisfied, that it was not from any defect of his Constitution, if he remembers the full handful, which Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man like, he took of his Hair to pull him in again before the Council.</p>
            <p>And to let your Doctorship see further what honest Evidence you have to support your Cause, here's an attested Copy of the Bond, which Sir <hi>William</hi> gives a false Account of.</p>

            <p>Now, Doctor, here's your Evidence, Sir <hi>William Paterson,</hi> proven to be a false one, by the Attestation of several Gentlemen of better Quality, and the meanest of them of much better Extract than himself. Whence his Worship may also have a clear <hi>Vidimus,</hi> that better than he chose Mr. <hi>R.</hi> whom he does so much vilify for their Companion. And at the same time you may also perceive the Wisdom of your Prelatical Council, in making so much to do, and bringing in their whole Army to oppose about 200 young Lads, who had a mind to divert themselves by burning the Pope, and to secure themselves from the Insults of any rascally Fellows, Papists, and others, with which the Town did then abound; or from any Collegial Punishment which the Principal and Regents durst never have refus'd, if the Council had desired it, entred into the above-mention'd Bond; which was so far from being maturely considered, that the Tautologies are sufficient to discover its having been drawn in a Hurry; and the foolishness of the Penalty shows, that it was altogether Juvenile. But however, the Council of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44964:32"/>
especially Arch-bishop <hi>Paterson,</hi> and his Brother Sir <hi>William,</hi> were then so eager to promote a Popish Interest, that they affronted Mr. <hi>George Shields</hi>; who is well enough known here in <hi>London</hi> for his owning the late King, because he did about that time, as I think, preach against Transubstantiation; and threatned to kick him down Stairs.</p>
            <p>Well, Doctor, we must now come to the Politicks which you advance, <hi>p.</hi> 51. by way of Apology for your Bishops, seven of whom concurred with the Convention of States in their Vote, when King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Letter was delivered to them, <hi>viz. That they were a free and lawful Meeting notwithstanding of any Order that might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in that Letter to dissolve them.</hi> Whence I concluded, that the said Bishops were inconsistent with their former Principles, and after Practices. The first thing which you advance, is a Concession that it was so, if they intended by that Vote nothing less than what the Presbyterians advanced. Now, Doctor, that the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians advanced any thing higher against King <hi>Iames</hi> than his Forfeiture of the Crown for his Male-administration, you cannot pretend: but I humbly conceive there is something more advanced in the concurrence of your Bishops, <hi>viz.</hi> that King <hi>Iames</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited without Male-administration; for we never heard that they complain'd of his Government, nor was it possible according to their Principles, that he could forfeit on any Account whatsoever. Now, Doctor, all that remains in Controversy betwixt us in this Point, is, Whether by this Vote they intended that King <hi>Iames</hi> had forfeited, or not? And I dare be bold to aver, that whether it were <hi>Intentio operantis,</hi> or no, it was certainly <hi>Intentio operis:</hi> and if your Bishops could not see so far before their Nose as this comes to, who can help it; for that it was the undoubted Right of King <hi>Iames,</hi> while he was King, to call and dissolve Parliaments or Conventions, I know no Body that denies: And therefore by clear Consequence, the depriving him of this Power, does certainly divest him of the Soveraignty; and if your Bishops did this, though they did not intend it, it may perhaps excuse them from being Knaves, but it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares them Fools with a Vengeance. But, Doctor, I am afraid, that if the Business be duly canvass'd, it will prove them both. That this Power of Calling and Dissolving Parliaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was one of the fairest Jewels of the Crown, and the most discernable Badg of Soveraignty in a limited Monarchy, they could not be ignorant of: And therefore to deprive their King of that Prerogative, when by their former Principles they professed him to be accountable to God
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44964:32"/>
only, argues, that they play'd the Knave with God and him too; and if they thought that their future Practices would either have aton'd for them at the Hands of K. <hi>Iames</hi> for unkinging him, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> or recommended them to his present Majesty after such a proof of their Treachery to his Predecessor, it demonstrates them to have been Fools.</p>
            <p>Well, but the Doctor, who it would seem was of the Cabal, tells us, That they took the Word, <hi>A free and lawful Meeting, not to signify any Meeting of the People contrary to the King's Prerogative, Authority and standing Laws, but rather a Meeting to support all the Three.</hi> Good Doctor, this may perhaps please Fools, but do you think that K. <hi>Iames</hi> will take this as a sufficient Excuse for that rascally knavish Act of unkinging him, contrary to your own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or at least Pretences? Was not the declaring that to be a free and lawful Meeting, though K. <hi>Iames</hi> in his Letter had ordered you to dissolve, contrary to his Prerogative, who as I have already said, had the Power of calling and dissolving Parliaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, as an Inherent Right of the Crown, according to your Principles? Or could that be a free Meeting, according to your Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, which was call'd against his Mind by a Power directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to him, and which had an Army to support it? And if that Meeting was not against the standing Laws, what becomes of your Act of Combination, so much insisted on, to prove Mr. <hi>R.</hi> a Traitor, in combining with others to burn the Pope? or of these other Acts, which declare it to be Treason to convocate the Lieges without the King's Authority? as I am sure this Convention was call'd without K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s. But further, Doctor, how could this be a lawful Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in your Sense, to which those who were Out-lawed by your own Laws, and declared Rebels and Traitors, had not only access as Members, but were some of its principal Constituents, and had join'd with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to procure this Meeting by the Sword? So that, good Doctor, if these things be duly considered, you will find it hard to perswade the World, that your Bishops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the Design of this Meeting was to support K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Prerogative, Authority and standing Laws.</p>
            <p>In the next place the Doctor tells us, That they were to sit, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of a Prohibition, until such time as they could duly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the King of their Straits and Difficulties; that's, in plain <hi>English,</hi> they will sit whether the King will or not, till he hear their Case. Really, Doctor, this is strange Doctrine from a Passive-Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience-Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>sed magna est Veritas, &amp; praevalebit:</hi> the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44964:33"/>
were forc'd to confess Christ, though much against their Wills. But, Doctor, how will you reconcile this Doctrine with your Reflection on the Presbyterians, for meeting without the King's Leave, in 1639, when there was an indispensable Necessity for it, to prevent our being swallowed up with Tumults, occasion'd by illegal Impositions on Church and State? But I beg your Pardon, Doctor, the Episcopalians have perhaps a Privilege to rebel, which others have not; and in truth, to give them their due, of all the Rebels which this Age has produc'd, they are the chief.</p>
            <p>The Doctor tells us further, That they hoped that a Vote might be forgiven, which their Practices would have vindicated from any suspicion of lessening the Royal Authority. A fair confession then, that they had some after-Game to play, to atone for their treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Vote. Indeed, if the Viscount of <hi>Dundee,</hi> with their Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, could have succeeded in the Design which was charged upon him to destroy the Convention, it had been a sufficient Vindication of their Loyalty to K. <hi>Iames</hi>; but in the mean time we are obliged to the Doctor for his Ingenuity, this being a plain confession, that his Party can go along with the present Government in things, which all Men of the World would think the most destructive of K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Interest, because their After-practices will sufficiently vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them from any suspicion of lessning his Royal Authority. So that the present Government may hence have a fair prospect of the Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Scots Prelatists, who, by the Doctor's Confession, have such a Dispensation from the late King; For they were to sit, says he, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of a Prohibition: So that it seems K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is only to colour the Matter. So that take him which way you will, the Doctor's an honest Man, he can go along with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and unking his Prince at one Blow, and that pleases this Government; and he can, by after-practices, vindicate his Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to K. <hi>Iames,</hi> and that's a sufficient satisfaction to the late Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Is not this an <hi>Ambidexter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, <hi>Ibid.</hi> the Doctor would insinuate, That they were just in the same Condition with a Merchant in a Storm, who will throw all over-board to save his Life. Good Doctor, the P. of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Army murdered no Man; nor was there any other Life in hazard, than that of your Scots Prelacy: And truly K. <hi>Iames</hi> is mightily obliged to you, that to preserve it, you would throw him over-board, and sink the Crown, to save the Mitre. And when that would not do, then you pretend Loyalty to K. <hi>Iames</hi> again, because you could do other; for K. <hi>William,</hi> and the Nation of <hi>Scotland</hi> would not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44964:33"/>
you. And lest your Doctorship should think this to be more than I can prove, I refer you to your Friend Mr. <hi>Caddel</hi>'s Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the Petition of your Party to this present Government, which demonstrates, beyond all Contradiction, that you would sell K. <hi>Iames</hi> and Prelacy both, if you can but get Money by the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: Though I must needs say, that you have much more Zeal for the Latter than the Former; for you take a great deal of pains to vindicate the dissembling hypocritical Practice of your Bishops, in unkinging him, and then declaring for him again; though at the same time you stab his Prerogative to the Heart; for which, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, he may perhaps remember your <hi>Christmass</hi>-Box, or New-Years-Gift; for I perceive you expect his Return, else it were in vain to excuse your Brethren for their Disloyalty towards him. Your Doctorship is pleas'd to ask your Antagonist, if ever he heard of Merchants throwing their Goods over-board in a Storm? Yes, Doctor, that he has, and moreover remembers, that he has also heard of Buyers and Sellers being whipp'd out of the Temple; and so it's but just that K. <hi>Iames</hi> should do by his Scots Bishops when he returns, for selling his Scepter to redeem their Shepherds Club. But now when I think on't, there's no hazard of that, for the Doctor tells you, <hi>Pag.</hi> 52. That he knows that they intended no more by the words <hi>Free and Lawful Meeting,</hi> than what they are capable of in the lowest Sense that they can be taken in. Very well, Doctor, then I perceive you are a Man of Intrigue, <hi>for you know it,</hi> you say; and pray, Sir, be pleased in your next, to let others know too what is that lowest Sense, for I never understood those words to have any other sense, than what all English Men put upon them; that is, <hi>Free</hi> imports a thing to be free from any Constraint; and <hi>Lawful</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that there is no standing Law against it. But, Doctor, I have already made it evident, that in neither of these senses could that be called a Free and Lawful Meeting, according to your Principles of Passive Obedience.</p>
            <p>Then as for your next Reserve, That some of the Bishops, as Privy-Counsellors, might suspend the Execution of the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in his Letters, until he should be better informed of the State of Affairs, and until he should reiterate his Commands; and in that Case, you think, that all who own his Authority, would leave the Convention. Really, Doctor, you are a Lyncean-sighted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and a wonderful Politician. Will it follow, that because Privy-Counsellors may suspend the Execution of the King's Orders in his Letters for some time, till he be further informed, in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44964:34"/>
State of Affairs, when his Title is not questioned, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may suspend the Execution of his Orders, when their so doing strikes at the Soveraignty it self, and constructively declares their Concurrence with his Rival in Authority? Doctor, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that such a Consequence won't be much neither for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of your Logick nor Loyalty: But you were resolved to say something, though, in truth, you had much better have said nothing, than have defended your Bishops so sillily, at the Expence of your Master's Prerogative.</p>
            <p>As for what you say, <hi>Pag.</hi> 4 &amp; 5, concerning Arch-bishop <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> that he offers 200 <hi>l.</hi> to any Man that will prove, by Witnesses of known Probity, any one of the Particulars vented against him by my self, or any of my Informers: If I were in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it might easily be done; but I don't think it worth my while to go thither on purpose, even though I had an honester Man's Bond than the Bishop's for his 200 <hi>l.</hi> and that's more than his Word. But I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that he is now vomited out of his Country, which was sick of him, and so can neither attend a Trial, nor be responsible for his 200 <hi>l.</hi> But if this be according to the <hi>Plan of his Lordship's Directions,</hi> let him consign his Money in the Hands of some Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and give publick intimation of it, and perhaps some or other may embrace his Challenge. But as for his Promise, I know no Man who will regard it, for it's a long time since Bishops Promises were currant in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But, Doctor, I will be yet more generous, if the Arch-bishop, or any of his Friends, will but procure a Certificate, under the Hand of three or four of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and as many of the Elders, that none of these things wherewith I charge the Arch-bishop, were talk'd of, and believed in that City, I'le fairly insert it. But for the Doctor's Offer, if such things can be proven, it is a meer empty sound; for as to the present Case, it's enough if I can prove, that he lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Scandal, and was commonly talk'd of as such a Person, though I be not oblig'd to produce his Pimps for Evidence, or to make such particular Proofs as are judicially required to warrant the Sentence of a Court in such Cases.</p>
            <p>But, Doctor, having given you such a Latitude as to Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, I find my self obliged to caution you, not to set your Journy-men at work to forge any, as your <hi>Amanuensis</hi> Mr. <hi>Andrew Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> did that in your last Book, to vindicate — <hi>Brown,</hi> Curate of <hi>Drysdale.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:44964:34"/>And that your Doctorship may be fully satisfied of the Truth of what I assert, take this following Letter, under one of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Hands, whose Name is forg'd to your Certificate.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>UNderstanding that Mr. <hi>Andrew Iohnston</hi> hath affixed my Name to a Certificate, in a Pamphlet entituled, <hi>The Spirit of Malice and Slander,</hi> &amp;c. to vindicate Mr. <hi>George Brown,</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of <hi>Drysdale,</hi> from the imputation of scandalous Converse with <hi>Iohnston</hi> of <hi>Lockerby,</hi> and <hi>Sarah Brown,</hi> though living in Adultery, and being his own Parishioners; These are, as I shall answer it at the Great Day, to declare, That I never sign'd any such Certificate, nor gave my Consent to the putting of my Name to it, directly nor indirectly. But the said Mr. <hi>Andrew Iohnston</hi> being one Day in my Company at Mr. <hi>Hopkins</hi> Shop in <hi>Cornhil,</hi> I told him, in jest, That he was of a good Kind, reflecting upon him as the Grandson of the said <hi>Iohnston</hi> of <hi>Lockerby,</hi> the Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, who was excommunicated for the same. Whereupon he answered, That none could prove any such thing of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father. To which I answered, That I could swear it, if need were. And upon his desire, that I would give it him under my Hand, that he might send to enquire of his Friends about it; I gave it him in these words; I testify and declare, that <hi>Andrew Iohnston</hi> of <hi>Lockerby</hi> was excommunicated for Adultery with <hi>Sarah Brown</hi>; and that Mr. <hi>George Brown,</hi> Curate of <hi>Drysdale,</hi> after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, had frequent Converse with both Parties, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it as a Taunt to Mr. <hi>Andrew,</hi> but never as a Certificate to vindicate Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>; and therefore he hath knavishly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the latter part, which fully proves what <hi>Brown</hi> was charg'd with, in the Answer to the <hi>Scots Presbyterian Eloquence.</hi> And as a further Testimony to the Truth of what is there char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon <hi>Brown,</hi> I declare, That I my self have found <hi>Brown</hi> drinking Brandy, by five or six in a Morning, with <hi>Iohnston</hi> of <hi>Lockerby,</hi> lying naked in <hi>Sarah Brown</hi>'s Bed, after the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; which <hi>Brown</hi> was only influenc'd to put in Execution against <hi>Iohnston,</hi> because the Country cried shame upon him for his Converse with such shameless Persons.</p>

            <p>Now, Doctor, pray answer, Is not this a shameful and rascally piece of Forgery? Is not this much for your Credit, to publish such a manifest Counterfeit to the World? And have we not just reason
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44964:35"/>
to reject your other Certificates, in behalf of your Self, <hi>Paterson</hi> and <hi>Cant?</hi> He that is guilty of Forgery in one, may justly be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected in all.

            <p>But, Doctor, I must come to an Engagement with your self in the next place, and leave your Journey-man, who in due time may perhaps be prosecuted according to his Merit. You offer, that if your Antagonist can prove that ever you spoke with Mr. <hi>Shields</hi> in St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Park, you'l acknowledg all the Libels against you to be true.

            <p>Now, Doctor, here's proof of Mr. <hi>Shields</hi> having own'd it: And as for your mutual salute, Mr. <hi>William Robinson,</hi> a substantial House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, and Man of unspotted Reputation, who lives in <hi>York-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> will take his Oath upon it before any Justice of Peace in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further, Doctor, I have been told, by a Person whose Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Quality forbids me to name him without his Consent, that he hath seen you and Mr. <hi>Shields</hi> together in the Park several times. Now let any Man judg, Doctor, whether your denying it in such an impudent manner, be not a Lie in all its forms? And I dare venture Mr. <hi>Shields,</hi> your Brother, will own it to be so; and though your Doctorship, as I understand, slights him as a Fool, and not worthy of your Converse, yet by the Account I have had of him, he seems, though not so cunning a Man, yet to be much the honester Man than your self, and truer to his Principles; which though I do not approve, yet I must needs own to be more commendable than your Doctorship's Practice of <hi>dissembling a Respect to this Government, and at the same time entertaining a Correspondence with Arch-bishop</hi> Paterson, <hi>who was imprisoned for plotting against it</hi>; declaring, That you were
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44964:35"/>
pursuing the Plan of his Lordship's Directions. And though it may be that Mr. <hi>Shields</hi>'s Circumstances for some time past have lessen'd him, yet it seems very haughty in Dr. <hi>Monro,</hi> though a quondam Bishop Elect, so much to despise Mr. <hi>Shields,</hi> who was thought worthy to be a Tutor to the E. of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> as to think him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his Converse.</p>
            <p>And, Doctor, because I would make an end with what concerns your self all together, that Story of your being found with a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man among the Corn, I had from Mr. <hi>Sheals,</hi> formerly Servant to the Countess of <hi>Dundonald,</hi> and now here in Town; which he is ready to own, and will take his Oath that he heard it of you in <hi>Scotland</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though at the same time he is willing to signify so much to you, that he had a more honourable Imployment than to be your Pimp.</p>
            <p>Doctor, as for your saying, <hi>Pag.</hi> 19. that I accuse Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> of having persecuted <hi>Halside,</hi> and that he falsly denies all the Malicious Fictions that I have heaped together on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: Really, Doctor, I perceive you are in a sinking Condition, when you lay hold on every Twig; but if you had acted like an honest Disputant, you ought to have been sure to have repeated my own Words, which <hi>p.</hi> 27. you will find to be, that he suborned Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses against <hi>Halside:</hi> And truly, Doctor, if I may venture to speak so much Logick before such a terrible Critick, I think, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornation and Persecution, are not convertible Terms; for every Subornation is not a Persecution. And as for that matter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Halside,</hi> my Information runs thus; That <hi>Thomas Watt,</hi> Servant to <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Blanterferm,</hi> when examin'd against <hi>Halside</hi> in Court, did actually declare, that he had 20 Dollars offered him by Laird <hi>Sim</hi> in <hi>Sarahs Ieans</hi> Forstairs in <hi>Hamilton,</hi> to depone against <hi>Halside</hi> whom he had never seen; and this Laird <hi>Sim</hi> was Collegue with Sir <hi>Iohn Whitford</hi> of <hi>Milton,</hi> both of them being imployed at that time as Informers, by the Government, against the Presbyterians in the West of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Now, Doctor, to make it plain how I understand Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> to be chargeable with this Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, take it thus: Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> having given order to those Informers to bring him in <hi>viis &amp; modis,</hi> such Evidence as would swear, those Informers did actually offer a Bribe to the Evidence against <hi>Halside,</hi> as the Evidence himself did declare in Court: And this being true, I hope, Doctor, you will allow the Consequence, that Sir <hi>George</hi> was chargeable with the Subornation, and so much the more, seeing he imployed the Suborners not only at that time, but afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:44964:36"/>But further, Doctor, lest you should think to escape by a quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Explanation of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s <hi>Viis &amp; Modis,</hi> I refer to you to the Measures which he took against Sir <hi>George Campbell,</hi> P. 41. of my Last, every bit of which Sir <hi>George</hi> himself will own; and I dare venture to lay his Reputation in the Ballance, against your bully Evidence, Sir <hi>William Paterson,</hi> or the mistaken Narrative of any Stranger, by what Title soever dignified or distinguish'd: and thus, Doctor, you may see that I had better Foundation for what I wrote on that Head, than my own Petulancy, as you are pleased to word it. I leave it to you and your Journy-man <hi>Iohnston</hi> to forge Stories, I'le assure you it's none of my Practice.</p>
            <p>But, Doctor, seeing you are so great a Patron of Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi>'s Memory, pray send to enquire of your Friends, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did not restore fifty Guinies to <hi>Iohn Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Boggs, Halside</hi>'s Brother, which that Gentleman had given him to be saved from the Penalty for refusing the Test, for fear that <hi>Boggs,</hi> who was brought as an Evidence against Mr. <hi>Ezechiel Mongomery,</hi> one of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Informers, should have found himself obliged in Conscience to discover it, if the Question should have been ask'd at him, Whether or not Sir <hi>George</hi> had any of his Money to save him from taking the Test? And at the same time, Doctor, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Whether <hi>Monkland,</hi> another Brother of <hi>Halside</hi>'s, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned upon the Evidence of <hi>Thomas Stevens,</hi> Cottar to <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Woodhall,</hi> though it was proven that the said <hi>Stevens</hi> swore, that he would swear against all the Gentlemen of the Country for 13 <hi>d.</hi> ½ Penny a piece, and all the Yeomen for ½ a Penny a Piece. I am confident, Doctor, that <hi>Halside</hi> will deny none of this, though I doubt not but he is so much a Gentleman, as to acknowledg the Kindness which he receiv'd from Sir <hi>George,</hi> when he was arraign'd for his Life the fifth time, both in saving him from taking the Test, and from Prison, for refusing of it: Though at the same time I have heard so much of <hi>Halside</hi>'s Temper, that I'le presume so far upon him, as to conjecture, that he bought it dear enough. And so much, Doctor, for your <hi>just Lord Advocate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor, I have other Employment, than to answer such rascally and villanous Libels as yours; and therefore have not confin'd my self to your Method, but took your chief Matters to task, at such spare Minutes as my Hurry would allow, and as they offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to my Thoughts, <hi>referring the rest to another Opportunity</hi>; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Doctor, let me advise you, not to be continually <hi>Ignarius Elenchi,</hi> nor to trifle as you have done hitherto, in attaquing the Out-skirts,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44964:36"/>
and passing over the chief of what I wrote, that does not become the Courage of a Cadee of <hi>Dunbarton</hi>'s Regiment, nor the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Elect Bishop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I must beg your Pardon, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you further, that it's every whit as unbecoming a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to treat any Man as you have done Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> for the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Circumstances, seeing the greatest of his Enemies cannot say that ever he was extravagant: And tho he finds not himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to satisfy you, whether he be your Antagonist or not, yet he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows me to give you a publick Defiance, and declares, That he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands not what you would covertly suggest, and gives you free liberty to write his Life, which you say you have by you; only name your Evidence, and don't forge it as you or your Man <hi>Iohnston</hi> did Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi>'s Certificate; and he doubts not but to find those of very good Reputation in <hi>London,</hi> who have known him from his Youth, that will and can obviate your malicious Character; and tho others perhaps would have taken up your Bookseller, yet he despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses all that you have writ or can say against him; so much, that he thinks it his Honour to be reproached by those who belie the Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland</hi> in general, as before-mentioned, the chief of our Ministry as Prophane, Ignorant and Blasphemous; the best of our Nobility and Gentry, as void of Sense and good Morality; the King and Parliament as the greatest of Bigots, and having esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd ungovernable Humour and Rebellion; and God himself as the Author of horrid Decrees.</p>
            <p>Nor is Mr. <hi>Ridpath</hi> asham'd to own, that it's part of his Business to write News, and give as true an Account of Occurences as he can; for which he knows your Party bears him a Grudg, because he hath often obviated the malicious Reflections, and seditious News of your Newsmonger General against the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And seeing the State don't think it below them to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the printing of News twice a Week by their Authority; and that Mr. <hi>Ridpath</hi>'s Intelligence is often confirm'd, <hi>verbatim,</hi> by the <hi>Gazette</hi>; he does not see where the huge strength of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, of his being a News-monger, lies, any further than that it denotes the meanness of his Circumstances; but I think that a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Man would remember the Axiom, <hi>Nemini Miseria sua objicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ridpath,</hi> it's probable, would not have done that, if he had had a better Employment; but thinks it much more creditable to write News, by which he may not only be kept from begging, as some of your Doctorship's Brother-Curats do, because of their Idleness, but is able to imploy and maintain three or four, who
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44964:37"/>
think themselves nothing inferiour to your Doctorship's Journeymen, and would scorn to beg about, or defame their Native Country, and their Majesties Government, with Lies, as you and they do with blasphemous Pamphlets, defamatory Libels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no not for a Share in the Purchase with your new Order of Friars-Mendicants, <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Foster, Guthry,</hi> &amp;c. of which your Doctorship may have the Honour to be General if you please; and then you may be <hi>Mentien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Mendicantes, Manducantes</hi> and <hi>Murmurantes,</hi> altogether; while, bless'd be God for it, Mr. <hi>Ridpath</hi> eats none of the Bread of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; nor does he so much relie on writing News, but that he hath been, and is, engaged in other Business, which would be no disgrace to a Doctoral Scarf.</p>
            <p>If your Doctorship think you are too sharply treated, consider how you dealt with Mr. <hi>Ridpath</hi> in your <hi>Spirit of Calumny and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and you will find that I have been far from revenging his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel in such opprobrious Terms, as you, and <hi>Paterson,</hi> and <hi>Cant</hi> did use towards him in the Libel abovesaid, but leave you in full posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Claim, to be Princes of the <hi>Billinsgate</hi>-Rhetorick, or to use our own Scots Phrase, <hi>Captains of the</hi> Edinburgh <hi>Coal-stealers.</hi>
