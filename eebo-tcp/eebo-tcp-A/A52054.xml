            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theame, when I was called to Preach at your
late solemne Anniversary meeting; the same
desire hath perswaded me to yeeld ready obedience to your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for the publishing of it. I doubt not, but as it was the
prayer of our blessed Saviour, <hi>That all his Saints might
be one;</hi> so it is the desire of all true Christians, that Jesus
Christ would make all his to be of one mind, and of one heart,
and when they cannot be of one minde, yet to be of one heart,
and I am as assured, that in his due time he will effect it;
<pb facs="tcp:95931:3"/>
when that blessed time is approaching, such Doctrines, as this
plaine Sermon holds forth, will be more seriously studied, and
more readily imbraced, then they are at this day.</p>

but provoke divided and ingaged men, to search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whether these things here delivered be true, or not, and
especially, if it occasion some other of his servants, who have
obtained greater ability, and more leasure, to arise, and put
their hand to this worke of reconciliation, and pacification;
I should then hope, that the Day-star of our peace begun to
appear; however, I have peace in the discharge of my duty,

               <q>For as we have many members in one body, and all members
have not the same office; so we, being many, are one body

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat you may the better understand the true
scope of the Holy Ghost in these words,<note place="margin">Introduction shewing the coherence and scope of the Text.</note> it is
necessary that I carry you a little back. The
Apostle having in the eleven first Chapters at
large opened the Doctrine of Faith, begins in
this twelfth Chapter with the second part of
our Christian Religion, which is the Doctrine
of Evangelicall obedience, and there hee first propounds the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
nature of it, <hi>That it is a giving up of our selves to be holy
and living sacrifices unto God,</hi> yeelding unto him <hi>a reasonable
service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He sets it out by the generall rule of it, and that is first
<hi>Negative,</hi> not to bee conformed to the world, the modes, and
customes, and manners of men. And Secondly, <hi>Positive,</hi> viz. to search
and know with a renewed minde, what is <hi>the will of God,</hi> and, as
the will of God is discovered, to imbrace and obey it, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
it to be a <hi>good and an acceptable will</hi> to us; these two are
<hi>generall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then in the next place hee begins more particularly to shew
wherein this will of God doth stand, or what he hath revealed for
the direction of his people. And in the third verse he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
one particular rule, to which (because he would have it take
the better place) he makes this Preface, <hi>I say, through the grace,
that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is given me;</hi> as if hee should have said, I propound that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95931:4"/>
which through mercy, I well understand to be a most excellent and
necessary rule, viz. <hi>That every one would be earefull to imploy that
talent, which the Lord hath trusted him with, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of his owne line and place,</hi> thereby to be usefull and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the whole, that is the scope of those words, <hi>That no
man should thinke more highly of himselfe, then he ought to
thinke, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man the measure of faith,</hi> the same thing which the Apostle,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. means by <hi>the manifestation of the Spirit, which is
given to every man to profit withall,</hi> to be faithfull in the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that talent, which the Lord hath be trusted him with, and to
use it within the bounds of his own line and calling, and not to thrust
himselfe into other mens office or worke, which the Apostle after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
more fully prosecutes verse 6, 7, 8. Now because some man
might a little wonder that the Apostle should begin with this, as
the very first duty, which he imposeth upon Christians, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the necessity and weight of it might the more appear, he useth
a most apt and elegant similitude; look as it is in the natural body of
man, the members are very many, take the joynts and sinews, nerves,
and vaines, &amp;c, there are abundance of them, and every one of them
is indowed with some faculty or other, and all the multitude of
members doe make but one body, wherein every member doing
its owne office, the whole is nourished, and should they neglect
the performance of what God in Nature had intrusted them with,
or should not each of them keepe to their owne worke, this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
or disorder would tend to the destruction of the whole; even
so hath the Lord appointed and ordered it in the Church of Christ,
that all the people of God, scattered throughout the world, though
their multitude bee not to be numbred, yet all these are all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
by the Lords institution into one body, and in this one body,
they are all of them not onely members of Jesus Christ the head,
but every one of them members one of another,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 16.</note> and given gifts and
abilities to be imployed by them for their common good, each nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
another, each bound to helpe one another, and by what every
one is bound in his place to supply, the whole Church, (which is the
body of Christ) growes up to perfection, as is most excellently laid
down, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
            <p>And thus I have brought you to my Text, and opened the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
scope and meaning of it, which words in themselves doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95931:4"/>
the Unity of the Saints in one body with Christ the head, and
each of them one with another, from which without any more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
or interpretation, I propound this one onely Lesson, viz.</p>
            <p>The whole Church,<note place="margin">The generall Doctrine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> or the collection or aggregation of all the
Saints, are one body in Christ, of which body Christ is the head,
and all the Saints are members.</p>
            <p>Which I will indeavour briefly to explain, and then come to that
branch which I have chosen to insist upon this day.</p>
            <p>Know then that our Lord Jesus Christ in the Scripture is said to
have a twofold body,<note place="margin">The Church is Christs body.</note> the one a natural body, that body which was
conceived in the wombe of the Virgin, which was borne into the
world, wherein Christ lived, which dyed, rose againe, and is now
ascended up into heaven, this natural body of Christ is not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
meant in my Text.</p>
            <p>But secondly,<note place="margin">And explained</note> Christ hath another body very often mentioned in
the Scripture, which is called his mysticall body, or a body in a
mystery: but because that may be looked upon, but as a blinde,
which every man may interpret according to his own fancy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Spirit of God hath taught us, that the collection or aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
or the thus gathering together of all the Saints in one, which
the Scripture cals the body of Christ, though it be not his naturall
body, yet it is to him <hi>as</hi> his naturall body, and this I pray you to
<hi>marke,</hi> and give me leave to prove, because it is the onely founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the Discourse, that I am this day to make to you; I say,
The Church, when the Scripture cals it the body of Christ, is to
him, <hi>as his naturall body,</hi> that is, they stand to Christ in the same
relation that the naturall body doth stand to the naturall head, and
Christ stands to them in the same relation, that a natural head doth
to the naturall body, and all the members, that is, all beleevers,
or Saints', stand in the same relation one to another, as the
members of a naturall body doe stand one to another: this I say,
is the foundation of all, and out of the many Texts which
might bee alledged,<note place="margin">And proved out of Scripture</note> to prove it, I shall onely (to this which I
have in hand, which saith expresly that wee are all one body
in Christ, and every one members one of another) mention two
more, which are so plaine, that he that runs may read this truth in
them; one is in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Indeed almost the whole Chapter
is a proofe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</note> and an improvement of this one truth: the Apostle tels
them in the beginning of the Chapter, that there are given to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95931:5"/>
Church, diversities of gifts, diversities of administrations, diversities
of operations,<note place="margin">Vers. 7.</note> and all these come from the same Spirit, and this Spirit
that gives these gifts, and administrations, and operations, hee gives
them all to this end, that there may be a profiting of the whole: and
presently (that you may understand his meaning) tels us, that look
as it is in the naturall body,<note place="margin">Vers. 12.</note> there is abundance of members joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and every one have their severall office for the good of all, so
<hi>is Christ,</hi> saith he by Christ, there, he doth not mean Jesus Christ
in his humane nature onely, but Christ mysticall, Christ and all
his members gathered into one; and then goes on in the thirteenth
verse,<note place="margin">Vers. 13.</note> and tels us, That by one Spirit we are all baptized into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
whether Jewes or Gentiles, bond, or free, and are all made to
drink into one Spirit, and so, throughout to the end of the Chapter,
prosecutes the same comparison of Christs being <hi>as</hi> a naturall head
to his Church, and all the Saints, as naturall members to Christ, and
one to another, and the duties which follow thereupon.</p>
            <p>The other place is <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4 from 12. to 17. in the beginning of the
Chapter,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. from 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. to 16. opened and explained.</note> he exhorted them earnestly to live in love, and keepe the
unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; to provoke them the better
to it, he shews them verse 4. 5, and 6. in how many things they are
<hi>one</hi> (of which you shal hear more afterward.) Then vers. 7. he addes,
that each of them had received gifts, which were the fruits of Christs
ascention, all which were given for the converting, edifying, and
perfecting of the <hi>body</hi> of Christ, untill it attaine unto the measure
of the stature of the fulnesse of Christ, that they all might grow up in
all things unto him that is the <hi>head,</hi> even Christ. Now that it might
appear what kinde of head and body is meant, he presently fals upon
this similitude of a naturall body, verse 16. <hi>From whom the whole
body fitly joyned and compacted together, by that which every
joynt supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure
of every part, maketh increase of the whole body to the edifying of
it selfe in love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And almost parallel to this is,</hi> Col. 2. 19. <hi>where the Apostle tels
us, that</hi> from Christ the head, all the body by joynts and bands
is knit together, receives nourishment administred, and so increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
with the increase of God.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be plainer, that, look as it is in the naturall body,
the Lord hath so cast it, and what the Head doth for its part, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
for its part, the Heart for its part, the Brain for its part, and every
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95931:5"/>
Joynt and Sinew for its part, the whole body growes up to a full
stature, and all grows up together; so hath the Lord ordained, and
cast it to be in the Church of Christ.</p>
            <p>Now this foundation being laid,<note place="margin">Wherein the comparison stands between the Church and a natural body</note> that though the Church be not
Christs naturall body, it is yet <hi>as</hi> his naturall body. The great
Question is, Wherein doth this comparison or resemblance
stand?</p>
            <p>To that I answer first: it is easie for a man to name many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
wherein the comparison will not hold betwixt the Church
and a naturall body: and it is as easie for a man to name many things
wherein they are very like one to another; but we must not be wise
beyond the Scripture, nor stretch it any further then the Lord intends
it; I humbly conceive that the comparison lies properly in these
two things.</p>
            <p>First, That as in the naturall body the members, and every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
hath a reall union with the head, for its owne part, having the
same spirit animating it that is in the head, and thereby hath a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with, and dependance upon the head in all the offices that
the head can do for it; so every particular Christian, or member of
the Church, hath a reall, indissoluble, spiritual union, and conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Lord Jesus Christ, having his Spirit communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, which is the foundation of all their communion, the very
root and principle of their spirituall life, and which inables them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one for their part to live unto Christ, <hi>that is one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Which is the thing I intend, that as in the natural body
all the members doe not onely meet in the head, as all the lines do
meet in a Center, and are <hi>one</hi> there, though they do not touch one
another any where else, but they are all by the wonderfull power
and wisdome of God so contrived, and compacted, and joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that they have a reall union one with another; So in this
mystical and spiritual body, all the Saints have not only each for his
owne part a union and conjunction with Jesus Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also a
reall union and conjunction one with another, which is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many duties, which every one of them are thereby bound to
perform one to another, and of many priviledges, which thereby
they injoy with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by one another, as shall, God willing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
opened unto you.</p>
            <p>Now this my Text speakes as plainly as any man could wish,
when it saith, that <hi>we being many,</hi> that is, all we Christians, all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95931:6"/>
that truly beleeve in, and professe the name of Christ, being very
many, <hi>are all one body in Christ;</hi> that is, we all meet, and are one
in him, and that is not all, but <hi>we are also all of us members one
of another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the first of these, the reall, indissoluble, and spirituall union,
that all the people of Christ have with Christ their head, is a most
divine, excellent and necessary truth, and indeed, is the foundation,
and principle of all our Christian life, and therefore most worthy to
be understood by all Gods people: But that not being the maine
drift of the holy Ghost in this place,<note place="margin">The union of the Saints one with another.</note> I forbear to speak of at this time,
and shal treat only of the second, and that is the union and conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is, and ought to be between all the people of Jesus Christ
one with another, they being members one of another; and therein
shall indeavour first to prove and clear it, and then hasten to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it. For the proof of it, I shall not need any other Texts,
then those that I have mentioned already, that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. how fully
and clearly doth the Apostle teach, that the eye, the hand, the foot,
and every member are for the good, and use of the whole, and none
of them can say I have no need of thee, or I have no need of thee;
God having so ordered it, that every one of them needs one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 15. 22, 23, 24.</note>
and every one of them are, and ought to be usefull one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
yea, that even the most mean and feeble of all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
are not onely of the body as well as the rest, but are necessary
to the good of the whole, and those members which we are prone
to think lesse honourable, and more uncomely, God hath appointed
in this mysticall body, as well as in our naturall bodies to have the
more honour put upon them.</p>
            <p>And so in that other fore-mentioned place, the fourth of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians,</hi>
where he saith, That the whole body being joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by that that every joynt supplieth, &amp;c. there is not the least
joynt, but it makes for the supply, for the edification of the whole.</p>
            <p>To these might be added all those places, which speake of the
Church, as one corporation or body under other resemblances, one
<hi>vine,</hi> one <hi>house,</hi> one <hi>City,</hi> &amp;c. whereof very many do occur in the
holy Scriptures; but all these things will be clearer in my subsequent
Discourse, wherein for the fuller clearing the doctrinal part, I shall
a little insist upon two maine questions, and then endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
a doubt or two, which may seem to lye as objections against
all the Saints making but one body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95931:6"/>
First, If the Saints bee one body, &amp;c. it may bee demanded,
wherein this unity of the Saints stands, or what are the things
wherein all the members of Christ have union one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
            <p>Secondly, If they be thus all one, what are the bands and liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whereby this vast multitude are all of them tyed thus firmly
together?</p>
            <p>For the first, If all the Church and people of Jesus Christ be all
really one, one with another, and have thereby a communion one
with another;<note place="margin">Quest. 1.</note> the Question is, what are those things wherein they
are thus one?</p>
            <p>To which I answer, the particulars are both many and excellent;
but because I would not burden your memories, I desire you to
turne to, and consider with me but one onely Text, which indeed
doth comprehend the sum of all that can be said about it, and that
is <hi>Eph. 4. ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6.<note place="margin">Ephes. 4 4, 5, 6. opened.</note> the Apostle exhorting all the Saints <hi>to keep the
unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> the better to encourage
them to it, useth this motive, <hi>For there is one body, and one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
one God, and Father of all, who is above you all, and through
you all, and in you all.</hi> Now in these seven Unities are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the things, wherein all the Saints of Christ are one; therefore I
shall endeavour briefly to open them.</p>
            <p>First, They are all of them one <hi>body,</hi> that is, all Gods people
throughout all the world, are but one incorporation, and there is no
one of them but hee hath as really a membership in the body of
Christ, as any other of them; as in an Army, though every one
be not an Officer, nor every Souldier equally valiant, or skilfull,
yet every one is equally a member of the Army; and as in a City,
or Corporation, every Free-man, though no Mayor, Alderman, or
Master of a company, &amp;c. yet is as really a member of the City as
any other; or look as in a building, it may be some rooms may be
larger, beautifuller and usefuller, yet there is not the least stud, the
least naile, the least pin, but it is as really a part of the building, as
the maine post that upholds it; So take the Church of Christ,
which is made up of the collection, and aggregation of all Gods
people, there is not one of them, but hee may truly say, I am a
part of that house, body, or building of Jesus Christ, as reall as
any other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95931:7"/>
Secondly, and they are all one in this, that there is but <hi>one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
which I thinke signifies these two things (for other Scriptures
teach me so to interpret it;) First, they are all of them animated
and led by the selfe-same Spirit, that as the members of the body,
though they be (it may be) many hundreds, yet there is one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
soule that animates them all; so in the Church of Christ, all the
Saints, every one of them have the selfe-same Spirit of Jesus Christ,
which is the principle of their life, and animates every one of them;
but that is not all: but by the same Spirit, he secondly means the
Spirit, as it is the Administrator, or distributor of all the gifts of
Christ, that whatsoever gifts, graces, operations, administrations
are to be found in the whole Church, the self-same Spirit distributes
his gifts variously, as he pleaseth, to some more, and to some lesse,
yet gives them all to, and for the good of the whole Church in
generall, and for every member in its particular; so the Spirit of
God himselfe interprets this, in the first of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and
the twelfth, from ver. 4. to 14. <hi>There are diversities of gifts, but
the same Spirit, the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every
one to profit withall, to one is given a word of wisdome, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
the word of knowledge, to another faith, to another the
gift of healing, &amp;c. but all these worketh that one and the self-same
Spirit; dividing to every man severally, as he will, that is
the second,</hi> they are all one body, and they have one Spirit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and they are all one in this, That they all have the <hi>same
hope of their calling;</hi> by hope, there, is not meant the <hi>grace</hi> of
hope, whereby we <hi>expect</hi> and waite for the good that Christ hath
purchased for us, but there it signifies the object of hope, and
therefore is called the <hi>hope of our calling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 18.</note> which in other places is
called <hi>the hope set before us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iude 3.</note> and plainly signifies that, which the
Holy Ghost cals the <hi>common salvation</hi> of all Gods people, the
meanest as well as the greatest have a share in the great things laid
up in store for them all, which they all aspire to, and seek after,
and in the end doe all injoy, which is, <hi>the end of their faith and
hope, the salvation of their soules;</hi> there is one Body, one Spirit,
one hope of their calling.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They have all <hi>one Lord;</hi> one Lord, what is that? to
interpret this aright, bee pleased to remember this one rule, that
where-ever in the New Testament you find God, and Lord, both
mentioned together, to signifie distinct Persons, Lord always signifies
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95931:7"/>
Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 5.</note> as Mediator, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and other places, there
<hi>are gods many, and lords many,</hi> but we have but one <hi>God</hi> that is
over all, and one <hi>Lord,</hi> by whom are all things, and we by him; so
that by one Lord he there means, that all the Saints throughout the
world have their addresse to God, only in the name and mediation
of the same Lord Jesus Christ, they have but one <hi>Advocate,</hi> one
<hi>Intercessour;</hi> one <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and them, and by
whom alone are communicated to them all the good things, which
come from God.</p>
            <p>Then fifthly, they have all one <hi>faith,</hi> there is one Lord, and one
Faith; I conceive that there by faith is not meant the grace of faith,
(although if that be meant, as I shal shew you by and by, yet they
have all that one faith) but there, he meanes by faith, the rule, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and object of faith, the Doctrine which is beleeved, and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
that all the Saints throughout the world doe by faith receive,
and beleeve the selfe-same truths, which give them an interest in
God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, &amp; which carry them to eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Now because this seemes a little difficult, I must endeavour
a little more fully to cleare it, then I have done any of the former: I
say, all the members of Christ throughout the world have <hi>one faith;</hi>
the meaning is, in every Age, and every corner of the world, where
Christ hath any of his people, there are some common Doctrines,
wherein Salvation is to be found, in which all Gods people doe
agree, each of them beleeving, and receiving them for his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
for although great Clerkes doe know and understand many
truthes, which others are ignorant of; yea, and among the people
of Christ there are great differences, and divisions in their opinions
in many particular things of weight and concernment, yet if you
sever the things, wherein they differ one from another, and set them
aside, and gather into one symboll or summe those great truthes,
wherein they all agree, there wil be found so much truth imbraced
by all the people of God, which wil bring them all to Salvation,
being really beleeved, and answered with a holy conversation. For
instance, looke this day into all the corners of the earth, East, West,
North, and South, where the name of Christ is knowne and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
the great fundamental Doctrines, which bring Salvation, are
received by all the members of Christ. Truth is, there are in many
places damnable Heresies superinduced, which, if received, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
is destroyed; but Christs Spirit in all the Saints either make
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95931:8"/>
them see the danger of them, and abhor them, or else in mercy
keep them ignorant of them, and so I doubt not but it is, even in the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> this day (among whom Christ wil have a people
to be called out from among them, when that <hi>Babilon</hi> is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed)
though their Doctrine in the grosse summe, as set forth in
the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> wil not stand with Salvation, yet some latent
members of Christs Church among them, doe through mercy see,
and shun those things which are damnable, or are ignorant of that
mystery of iniquity, and place all their hope of Salvation in Christ
alone, and lead their lives in holinesse, according to their measure
of Light received. The summe of all comes to this: That among
all Christs people in the world, there is imbraced so much truth, as
being accompanied with an answerable conversation, wil save them,
and notwithstanding the remainders of their mistakes, errours, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of judgement about lesser truthes, and corruptions in their
conversations, we may comfortably say of them all, as the Apostle
doth in the sixth of the <hi>Galathians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 16.</note> 
               <hi>As many as walk according
to this rule, peace be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</hi> This
is the fifth thing, that all the Saints in every corner of the world
have <hi>one faith:</hi> and if also you would take <hi>faith</hi> for <hi>the grace of
faith,</hi> whereby each for their part are <hi>united</hi> to Jesus Christ, which
faith also is the principle of that Life of Grace, which the Saints
lead in this world, (for <hi>we live by faith)</hi> in this also all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the world have the <hi>same faith,</hi> which is therefore called the
faith of <hi>Gods elect,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Titus 1. 1.</note> and the <hi>like precious faith;</hi> so they are <hi>one
body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 2.</note> have <hi>one Spirit, one hope of their calling, one Lord, one
faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then 6ly, and they have all <hi>one Baptism,</hi> which is not to be taken
literally, barely for the Sacrament of washing with water, but either
it is taken, as some interpret it, for the Spiritual part of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
which is their new Birth, the washing away of their sins, and
the washing of them with Gods Spirit; or rather, as it was the
custom in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, to have all their Ordinances signified
by circumcision (whence therefore, all who imbraced the <hi>Jewes</hi>
manner of worship, are called the Circumcision) because it was the
first Ordinance, and that which sealed them to all the rest; so I
conceive he meanes by Baptisme, that as it is the first Ordinance,
so it is here used to expresse all Gospel institutions, so that by <hi>one
Baptisme</hi> he meanes, that Gods people all have the same Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95931:8"/>
or meanes for their edification, and building up in Christ.</p>
            <p>And then lastly, they have <hi>all one God, and father of all, who
is above them all, and through them all, and in them all,</hi> which
signifies that they all have one God, which is their Soveraigne Lord,
the Father, of whom originally are all things, and to whom alone, as
supreame, all their addresses are made in the mediation of Christ,
and in whom alone they all acquiesce, and rest, as their supream good,
and last end, and is therefore here said <hi>to be above them all, and
through them all, and in them all; above</hi> all in regard of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,
and divine Eminency; <hi>through</hi> them in regard both of his
providentiall, and gracious administrations, and <hi>in them all</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his neare relation, and conjuction with them in Christ his
Sonne; In all these seven things all the people of God throughout
the world are <hi>one,</hi> they all of them have a state, standing and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership
in the same body, they all are anoynted by the same Spirit,
and all the gifts of the Spirit are intended for the good of them all,
they all have the same common salvation, they all have their accesse
to God in the name and mediation of the same Christ, and all doe
imbrace the same common truths, they all live upon the same Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-ordinances,
and administrations, and they all serve, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and seeke to injoy and rest in one supream God, who is <hi>our</hi>
God, and the God of <hi>our Lord</hi> and Saviour Jesus Christ, in all
these things they have copartnership, fellowship, and are herein as
I may say, heires in <hi>Gavel-kinde.</hi> And let this be for the first que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
viz. <hi>What are the things wherein all the Saints and people
of Christ are one?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is, What are the bands that doe tye all the
Saints,<note place="margin">Quest. 3.</note> and people of Christ thus together? Surely, it must needs be
some strange Genius of Government,<note place="margin">What are the bands of this Union?</note> that must be able to keep in
<hi>one</hi> such infinite multitudes, so differing in their languages, in their
birth, in their spirits, in their educations, in almost all things,
wherein temperature or corruption can make men opposite, and
contrary one to another; what strange band must it be, which can
keep all these so united, that you may predicate all these seven
things of every one of them.</p>
            <p>I answer; the bands of them are not any politick tricks of mens
devising; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> saith, it is impossible the Church
of Christ should be kept thus in unity, unlesse you allow some visible
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95931:9"/>
head, that may have a visible government over all, and upon whose
judgement and decision, all must depend; but we need not look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any such devices, the bands are of Jesus Christs own appointing
and giving, which are these two.</p>
            <p>The first is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ</hi> First, The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ teaching and ruling them all.</note> his holy Spirit given to every one of them, which doth
not only serve, as a band to tye them all to Christ their head, but this
self-same Spirit is intended by Christ the head to be the band, that
should tye them all one to another, and therefore it is said, 1 <hi>Cor.
12, 13. That we are all made to drinke into one Spirit,</hi> that as we
are all united into one head, so we are all made to drink into one
spirit: conceive it thus; The Lord Jesus being the quickning head of
all his people, gives the self same spirit (which resides in him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all measure) and pouring it out in what measure he pleaseth upon
all his people; This Spirit makes them all so to understand his Laws,
rules, and directions, that without any other Teachers (not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the use of his owne Ordinances, but any device or policy of
men) he makes them all to understand what is the minde of their
Lord, which are the duties imposed upon them by their
Lord, and so inlightning their minds, and ruling their hearts, makes
them conformable to all his good pleasure, and thereby keeps them
all in this peace, and unity one with another. A most excellent instance
you have of this in <hi>Esa.</hi> 11. where the Lord Christ is spoken of,
<hi>first,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esai 11. 6, 7, 8.</note> as he is the <hi>head;</hi> and of him it is said there, that <hi>he hath the
spirit of wisdome, and the spirit of knowledge, and the spirit of
the feare of the Lord,</hi> signifying thereby how fitted and inabled he
is to the worke, of being head of the Church, to ver. 5. then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
ver. 6 &amp;c. he tels you, how all his people shal be associated,
and joyned together, that the Wolfe shal agree with the Lamb, the
Leopard with the Kid, the Calf, and the young Lion, and a little child
shal lead them, the Cow and the Bear, the sucking child and the Asp,
the weaned childe, and the Cockatrice, none shal hurt other, that is,
people, who before they came under Christs government, were as
Lions, Beares, and Serpents one towards another, shal now all be
united, and live in peace. What strange Discipline must it be, that can
make Lions and Lambs, Tigers, and Cockatrices, and little Kids and
Children, agree thus together? the reason of it is given in the ninth
verse, <hi>All the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the
Lord;</hi> that is, that spirit of knowledge, which Jesus Christ is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with, shal be poured out upon all the Lords people, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95931:9"/>
them let them be of what nature or disposition they wil, as this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
prevailes, where he doth but informe them, that this or that is
the minde of Christ, this Spirits teaching wil make them all of one
minde, and all live in peace thus one with another: and this is the
same,<note place="margin">Ezek, 11. 19</note> which the Lord elsewhere promiseth both in 11. of <hi>Ezek.</hi> and
the 36. of <hi>Ezek.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 27</note> 
               <hi>I will put my spirit in them, end cause them to
walke in my Statutes, and keep my Ordinances, and my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and doe them.</hi> Now this band of the Spirit of Christ, is such
a band of union, which none of all the heathen Philosophers, or Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers,
ever so much as dreamed of: <hi>Plato, Lycurgus,</hi> or any of
them, who have framed plat-formes of Common-wealths, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
meanes, how all the subjects should be kept in concord and
peace, could never once thinke of such a thing as this is; but our
Head the Lord Jesus hath both promised and done it.</p>
            <p>Then secondly,<note place="margin">2 Band, the grace of love.</note> there is another band, which is a secondary and
subordinate band, and that is the grace of <hi>Love,</hi> the grace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
love, and charity, which in this place you are not to look upon
only, as a particular grace, a branch of the Image of Christ, as all
other saving graces are, but as a grace exalted by Christ to this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
office, that it should be the band to tye all the Lords people
in one, and so the Scripture saith expresly of it.</p>
            <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> having opened the conjunction of all the
Saints in one body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. doth in the latter end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
exhort them all to labour after the best gifts, which might edifie
the Church; <hi>But behold</hi> (saith he) <hi>I wil shew you a more excellent
way:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cap. 13</note> a more excellent way then what? why a more excellent way for
edification of the Church, then Apostles, Prophets, Pastors, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
Governments, helps, take them all; he would shew them an
excellent way beyond all these: what is that? <hi>the grace of love;</hi>
which he discourses of throughout the whole thirteenth Chapter,
and tels you all miracles, all abilities to preach, all that it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for man to be endowed with, are not able to doe that good to
the Church which the grace of love doth. And the same Apostle
<hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3. 14</note> Col. 3. when he had exhorted Gods people to seeke after,
and put on all those graces, wherein the new creature stands, <hi>Bowels
of mercy, kindnesse, humblenesse of minde, &amp;c.</hi> adds ver. 14. <hi>But
above all put on love;</hi> why? <hi>it is the band of perfection,</hi> it is the
perfect band,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13, 34, 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> or the band that perfectly tyes all Gods people toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And therefore our Saviour Christ in <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13. 34, 35. makes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95931:10"/>
it the Livery of the Church, whereby in all places of the world they
may be knowne to be his Disciples, even by their loving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 16</note>
and therefore also the Apostle in the fourth of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
vers. 16. when he had shewed that every joynt contributes, and
supplyes its part towards the building up of the whole body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
it thus; <hi>by that which every joynt supplyeth according to
the effectuall working in the measure of every part, maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the body unto the building up of it selfe in love;</hi> as if
the grace of Love were the thing that ran through them all, and gave
vigour and strength to them all, in their working one with another,
and one for another. Thus you have heard what the things are,
wherein all the Saints are one, and what the bands are, whereby
they are thus united. Now before I proceed to the application, of
necessity I must remove one great doubt out of the way: It may be
said,<note place="margin">3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Q. How is it then that the Scripture speaks of many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, if all are but one Church</note> If the Church of Christ be but <hi>one Church,</hi> whence comes it,
that wee read mention of so many Churches, of a <hi>Triumphant
Church,</hi> and a <hi>Militant</hi> Church, of a <hi>visible,</hi> and an <hi>invisible
Church,</hi> of the Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi>
the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Galatia,</hi> the <hi>seven Churches,</hi> all <hi>the Churches</hi>
where the Scripture doth mention so many Churches, how are
these expressions reconciled with this, that all Gods people are but
one Church?</p>
            <p>I answer;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> First, it is most cleare, that Jesus Christ hath but one
mystical Church, which is his body; the Church of Christ is as we
say in Logick, <hi>Species specialissima,</hi> it cannot be sub-divided into
other Churches, if we wil speake properly; but though it be but
<hi>one</hi> Body, one reall individuall Church, yet this one Church is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of severall distributions, from some properties, or qualities,
or adjuncts which are found in it, and those distributions, or consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
of it, doe, and may in some sence obtaine the name of the
Church. To give you a little taste, the Church of Christ, though
it be but one, yet it is sometimes considered, distributed, or distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
according to the <hi>manner,</hi> and the <hi>measure</hi> of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which the parts and members inioy with their Head, thus; one
part of this Church injoyes communion with the Head by <hi>sight,</hi> and
not by faith, and the communion which they have with Christ is
<hi>perfect,</hi> freed from all imperfections, or infirmities, or crosses, in
this respect these members are called the <hi>triumphant</hi> Church. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
part of the same Church hath communion with Christ by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95931:10"/>
               <hi>faith,</hi> and not by sight, and the communion which it injoyes with
him is imperfect in all the Graces, and mingled with corruptions,
temptations, and afflictions, in respect whereof this part of the
Church is called the Militant Church, but all these are not two
Churches, but one Church, only one part of it hath shot the Gulfe,
and is at rest, and the other is in another condition here upon
earth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that part of it which is upon earth, in regard that the
very life and being of it, and of all the members of it, lye in <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Graces,</hi> which <hi>cannot be seen,</hi> in that respect the Church of
Christ is called <hi>an invisible Church;</hi> but now as the same Church
and Members doe make an outward profession of their faith, and
obedience, sensibly to the eyes and eares of others, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
it is called <hi>a visible Church;</hi> but the visible is not one
Church, and the invisible another Church, but meerly the same
Church under severall denominations, the one from their constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Graces, the other from the external profession of them: How
men, who have no Grace, come to be accounted <hi>a part</hi> of the
Church, I shal endeavour to expound afterwards.</p>
            <p>Or, Thirdly, take it thus; the selfe-same Church of Christ at
one time hath been trained up under one kind of outward admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
and forme of worship and Government, one before
Christs Incarnation, and that is called the Church of the <hi>Jewes;</hi>
since Christs time there is another Administration, and thence it
comes to be called the Church of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> but <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
before and since Christs incarnation, are but one Church; so
likewise you may read that Jesus Christ, though he have but one
Church, yet he hath appointed that the multitude of those, who
professe his Name, for their better <hi>discipline, instruction,</hi> and <hi>edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
should be ranged, and ranked, and ordered into <hi>particular
assemblies;</hi> now in regard of this Marshalling, and Disciplining of
them, these severall Associations, or Congregations make so many
Churches, but these Churches are not severall bodies of Christ, but
only parts of his one body; as in a great Army, the number of all, who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
have listed their name in the Muster-role, are all under one <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi>
and all under some <hi>generall Officers,</hi> but yet for their better
ordering, there is this Brigade, this Regiment, or that Troop, or
that Company, and every one of these under some meaner Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
yet all of these taken together are all but one Army, so is it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95931:11"/>
in the Church. I might adde, that sometimes these several associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are distinguished and known by the outward confessions which
they make of their faith, and in that respect you have in our dayes
the Churches of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and the <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Protestants</hi> and these againe according to some of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
are purer, and holier then others. And just as it is in a great
building, some rooms (it may be) are more light and glorious, and
some of them more dark, and it may be some of them have more
weak timber, and other materials, then the rest, and yet all of them
are but parts of the self-same house.</p>
            <p>So I say, all these, <hi>triumphant, militant, Jewes, Gentiles, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
invisible,</hi> the <hi>severall Churches</hi> in the several quarters of
the world, in the East, West, North, and South, all these, or rather
the members of Christ in all these taken together, doe make up
that one Church of Christ, which is his <hi>Body,</hi> his <hi>Spouse,</hi> his
<hi>Kingdome,</hi> his <hi>City,</hi> his <hi>Vine,</hi> his <hi>Love,</hi> his <hi>Dove,</hi> his <hi>Turtle,
his only one of her mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, whether this Church of Christ, that is thus one, be autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised
to meet in her representatives to make Lawes, and to exercise
Discipline? whether it be the first subject of the Keys, whether the
government of particular Congregations slow from this Church to
the rest? or whether any wayes at all it may doe any judicial, or
judiciary act, is a most noble question, and much disputed amongst
learned Divines, especially in our latter age; my haste doth not
allow me to meddle with that controversie, only thus much I may
safely assert:</p>
            <p>1 That all the Officers, Offices, and gifts, that Christ gave,
when he ascended up into heaven, he gave them all to this Church,
and they all serve for the gathering, edifying, and perfecting of this
Church.</p>
            <p>2 And as any ever were, or are converted to Christ from the
world, they are all primarily added to this Church.</p>
            <p>3 Yea, and all, whether particular Christians, or numbers of
Christians associated, all are to act, as parts of this Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
in reference to the good of this whole Church, all having
such relation to, and dependance upon this Church, as parts have to
the whole: and a standing in a particular Church-relation doth no
more take off from duties to this great body, which is the great
Common-wealth, then the <hi>Jewes</hi> being ranked under their several
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95931:11"/>
Tribes, or in their particular Cities, were taken off from the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which they owed to the whole Common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> &amp;c.
that therefore he who is justly <hi>(clave non errante)</hi> excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or cast out of any particular Church, is cast out from all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as he who is shut out of any one Gate of a City, is shut out of
every ward of that City, yea, out of the whole City it selfe. Having
thus farre cleared the Doctrinall part,<note place="margin">Application.</note> I now proceed to the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, and there are many excellent uses, which this Lesson doth
afford, I shal handle only two at this time, 1. for instruction,
2. For duty.</p>
            <p>First for instruction,<note place="margin">1 Instruction Therefore this communion of Saints is that brotherly good fellowship, Prov. 1. 14.</note> from all this it appeares, that to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church of Christ, or the Association of all Gods people
into this one body, is the only desirable good Fellowship, and Society
in this world. You shal read of a great many other Fellowships,
and Co-partnerships: you may read in the first of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of
a fellowship of Theeves, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. of a company of Drunkards, in
<hi>Psal.</hi> 2. of a Society of Malignants,<note place="margin">Esa. 56, 12.</note> and abundance of several compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and societies of men there are,<note place="margin">Psal. 2. 2.</note> some joyned for pleasure, some for
profit, and many glory, and take great content in the society, and
fellowship, and fruit they enjoy, in those whom they are linked with:
but ah! beloved, when things are rightly viewed, it will appeare,
that the Congregation, or the Society of the Church of the first
borne, whose names are written in Heaven, wherein all the Saints
of God from the beginning of the world to the end of it, are all joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in one body, all of them united to Christ, and one to another,
having the same Spirit, the same Lord, the same hope, all of them
<hi>one</hi> in all these seven things, which I have opened to you; it will, I
say, one day appeare, this is the only desirable society under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Let them therefore, who are men of other societies, glory as
much as they please in their supposed good Fellowship, when in
the meane time they are strangers from the Common-wealth of
<hi>Israel;</hi> But let us count our selves happy, that we have a
part and lot in this communion,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 3.</note> wherein we have <hi>Fellowship
not only one with another, but with the Father, and his Sonne
Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Instruction. Therefore none are true members of this Church but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men.</note> it hence also followes for our instruction, That none
in all the world are, or ought to be judged Members of the Church
of Christ, but only those that have the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Jesus Christ in
them, really <hi>regenerate,</hi> really <hi>holy,</hi> really <hi>united</hi> to Christ the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95931:12"/>
Head, these and no other are Members of the Church, which is
Christs Body, which is a Lesson of very great use. You all know
there is at this day much disputing, about what things are requisite
to make men Church-members; some very learned men maintain,
That to make a man admittable into Christs Church, or to make
him a Church-member, no more is in the Scripture required, but
only, that he <hi>give up his name,</hi> and professe, that he is willing to
learne the wayes of Christ, and to walke in them; the Church of
Christ being, say they, appointed as a Schoole, to traine Schollars
up, into which are admitted not only those that are Learned, but
those who are willing to learne.</p>
            <p>Others say, That is too laxe, if you wil own a man, as a Church-member,
he must be able <hi>to give you an account of his faith,</hi> and a
<hi>promise of a voluntary subjection</hi> to the Gospel of Christ for time
to come, and if they come to that, then you may take them in; and
owne them, as Church-members.</p>
            <p>Others say, You must yet goe further, unlesse you can in the
<hi>judgement of your owne charity conceive, that the worke of
Grace is really wrought in their hearts,</hi> you are not to owne
them, or joyne with them, if you can probably hope that, then you
may take them in.</p>
            <p>Others will goe yet further, and say, These things are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
for unlesse there be a right admission by <hi>Baptisme,</hi> when you
make your first confession, all the rest is in vaine, and upon these
points we dispute, till we have disputed our selves into a thousand
peeces.</p>
            <p>Now Brethren, be pleased to know, that though there be good
use of these debates, to direct us to know the persons, with whom
we may exercise the acts of communion in the wayes and worship
of Christ, yet none of all these rise up, to prove a man to be a
Member of the Church of Jesus Christ; there are indeed signes,
and rules, that may teach us, with whom we may joyne in visible
and external Fellowship, and whom we may reject, or cast out, if
they be taken in; but these are not rules to make us know, who are
reall Members of the Church of Christ; indeed as the Church is
denominated from some external things, these rules direct us to
judge with whom, and to whom we may communicate in those
external things, but these are clearly two Distinct questions, <hi>with
whom we may joyne in visible and externall communion,</hi> and <hi>who
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95931:12"/>
are truly Members of this Church of Christ,</hi> Of the latter there
is but one note, and that is, if they be united to Christ the Head,
have the quickning Spirit of Christ in them, and the grace of Love
wrought in them, which note is <hi>invisible,</hi> and not external, and can
be knowne only in our owne Consciences; if this be wanting, let
men carry themselves never so wel, so that all the people of Christ
under heaven should owne them, yet Jesus Christ ownes them not,
and you may truly say, that all they, who have not communion
with <hi>God the Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 3.</note> and <hi>the Lord Jesus, and his holy Spirit,</hi>
have no <hi>reall</hi> communion <hi>with the Saints;</hi> therefore let no man
rest, or pride himselfe in being joyned in this, or that Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
a carnal, or unconverted man, whatsoever his outward shape
or mould be in his profession, that man for his Spiritual standing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to another Corporation.</p>
            <p>There are two great Spiritual corporations, the one is, that whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eof
Christ is the Head; the other is, the corporation of Hel, whereof
the Devil is the Prince; now all men, let them be of what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
they wil, if they be not under Christ the Head, they belong
to another corporation, and their external visible profession alters not
their Spiritual relation. A lump of <hi>Lead,</hi> whilst it is in the lump,
it is a lump of <hi>base Metall,</hi> called <hi>Lead,</hi> melt this, and mould it
into the forme of a Beast, what is it then? it is but a <hi>leaden</hi> Beast;
melt it, and mould it againe into the forme of a man, it is but a
<hi>Leaden</hi> man; melt it, and mould it againe, into the forme of an
Angel, it is but a <hi>Leaden Angel:</hi> So I say, take a carnal Man, an
unregenerate Man, he is a carnal man, whilst he professeth no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
suppose him then, to professe himselfe a <hi>Protestant</hi> at large,
he is but a <hi>carnall</hi> Protestant; suppose him next, to joyne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
into some Church Order, let him joyne with those that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of the <hi>Presbyterian way,</hi> he is a <hi>carnall</hi> Presbyterian. Take
him off from that, put him into the <hi>Congregationall</hi> way, what is
he then? a <hi>carnal</hi> congregational man; joyne him next if you wil,
to those, who deny our Baptisme, he is then but a <hi>carnal</hi> Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,
he is stil a carnal, an ungodly man, belonging to the corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Satan, whatsoever his out-side be; and know ye all for certain,
that no Bastard, no Gibeonite, no Hypocrite, no man unconverted,
what gifts soever he may have, what reputation soever he may have
amongst men, he is <hi>no member of the Church of Christ,</hi> unlesse
the Spirit of Christ be in him. I say therefore againe, beare not your
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95931:13"/>
selves too much upon your visible Church-standing, as too many
doe; beleeve it, its an easie thing for the children of the world to put
on an outward forme of Church-communion: but O! how hard is it
to become a new creature, to resigne up it selfe wholly to Jesus
Christ, and the guidance of his holy Spirit? and I presse this the
more upon this account also, viz. were this well understood; it would
satisfie, and cure the mistake of many, who thinke, that there are the
same rules to direct us, with whom we must exercise our external
communion, as there is to judge with whom Jesus Christ exercises his
communion; no, no; we may exercise outward acts of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by the appointment of God, with those unto whom Jesus Christ
never communicates himselfe, nor his Spirit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, one instruction more, which I doe but name from all
this,<note place="margin">3 Instruction. Therefore the most usefull Christians are the most noble members.</note> That the Church of Christ is but one Body: it followes plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that therefore among all the great multitudes of the Members of
the Church, they are the honourablest, and noblest Members, who
are most useful for the common good of the Church, as it is in a
Natural body, the Liver that makes bloud for all the body; the
Heart, that makes spirits for all the body; the Stomach, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
meat for all the body; and the Eye, which sees for the whole
body, &amp;c. these are counted the noblest, and excellentest: So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all Christians, the man, or men, who are most useful, best
fitted for use, and laid out for use, these wil one day be found, and
acknowledged the honourablest Members of the Church of Christ,
what esteeme soever the world hath of them.</p>
            <p>But the maine use,<note place="margin">2 Use for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</note> which I purpose, and which indeed we most
need, is to shew what duties doe arise from this unity of the Saints
in one body,<note place="margin">1 Therefore there must be no Schisme in the Church, 1 Cor. 12. 25.</note> and they are two, which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> layes
downe, in the first of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the twelfth chap. vers. 25.
when he had shewed, how the Lord had framed all his people into
one body, he then tels us, to what end and purpose all this was
done, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That there should be no schisme in the body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That therefore all the members ought to have the
like care one of another.</p>
            <p>The first of these I purpose with the Lords assistance to speake
somewhat to at this time, <hi>because all the Church, the Saints, the
people of God in all the world are but one body, therefore rents,
and divisions are most unnaturall, and destructive to it.</hi> I hope
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95931:13"/>
you wil all judge it a necessary and seasonable Theam, it being almost
our epidemical disease, we being rent and torne into multitudes of
sects and divisions, which this doctrine of the unity of the Church
of Christ doth utterly condemn, and therefore though I know it is
an unpleasing subject, and possibly many may give me small thanks
for it, yet truly I durst not (being called to this place) but cast in
my mite towards the healing of this wofull distemper; and three
things I shall endeavour to cleare about it:</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">What Schisme is.</note> What Schisme is, and what is the nature of it:</p>
            <p>Secondly, the greatnesse of it, what a horrible sin it is:</p>
            <p>And thirdly, and principally, I will labour to shew you, who they
are, that are guilty of it.</p>
            <p>For the first, what it is, Its usually defined to be a rash or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
separation in matters of Religion, but I would rather describe
it to be a <hi>renting, violating, dissolving,</hi> or <hi>breaking of that unity,
which ought to be amongst Christians,</hi> or amongst all the Saints
of Christ.</p>
            <p>And this rending or breaking of this union properly lyes in two
things; one is <hi>inward,</hi> and that is dissolving or breaking the band,
or bands, which the Lord hath given to tye them all together, which
band on our part (as you have heard before) is <hi>the grace of love,</hi>
and therefore the breaking off of love among Christians, whether
it be from all the Church, or from a particular Church, yea, or from
a particular man; I say, the dissolving or breaking of this spirituall
band, hath in it the very intrinsecall nature of the sinne of Schisme,
the Lord having appointed <hi>that grace</hi> to be the band to tye his
people together; but because the inward band is invisible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not easie to judge of, therefore there is a second thing in Schism,
and that is, a denying, or with-drawing from the exercise of those
things, which Christ hath given, as the <hi>symboles</hi> or <hi>pledges</hi> of love
amongst his people, as conversing together, praying together,
hearing together, conferring together, receiving Sacraments, and the
like together; the with-drawing from these, or the denying of these,
otherwise then Jesus Christ directs in his Word. These things are
visible, and therefore Divines use to appropriate the name of Schism
to such with-drawings, or denyings, which indeed are but the fruites
of the other: for the dissolving of the band of love, is the root
of the disease, and the denying of the expressions, and exercise of love
are the bitter fruits growing from that evill root; So then, he, or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95931:14"/>
they, who ever they are, that do deny to exercise, or with-draw from
the exercise of those things, which Jesus Christ hath made to bee
both duties, and pledges of love among his people, are truly and
properly guilty of the sin of Schism; the nature of this sin of Schism
lying properly in this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is against <hi>Christian love;</hi> and hereby
also you may learne the difference between Heresie and Schisme;
Heresie is a false opinion, which destroyes <hi>faith,</hi> but <hi>Schisme</hi> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an opinion, or practice against charity. The first of them, which
is against faith, tends to rend off from Christ the head. The second,
which is against love, tends to the rending off from the body; This
for the nature of it.</p>
            <p>In the next place,<note place="margin">2 The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the sin of Schisme.</note> let us consider the greatnesse of this sin, and the
rather, because in truth, the name and charge is grown so common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, (as formerly the name of Puritan was) that many make
no account of it, whether they be charged justly, or unjustly with it;
but who ever considers of it, according to the sense of the Scripture,
wil find that the sin of Schisme is a most hainous sin; The greatness
of it not easily set forth in words, whether you consider it in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it, <hi>or the effects of it.</hi> In</p>
            <p>1 The nature of it;<note place="margin">In the nature of it.</note> its contrary to one of the highest ends of
Christs great undertaking, which is, that all his people should bee

with one another,<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 21.</note> he begged it of his Father, that they should be
one; now this sinne tends to frustrate this great designe of Jesus
Christ.</p>
            <p>And secondly, It is contrary to all the Commandements of Christ,
for all the Commands, which he hath given to his people for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of their conversation, himselfe tels us, That <hi>the end of the
Commandement is love;</hi>

                  </gap> Tim. 1. 5</note> 2 If we consider the effects of it, they
are most dreadful and mischievous:</p>
            <p>For first,<note place="margin">2 In the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it.</note> it is wonderfully dishonourable to Jesus Christ; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he holds out to all the world, that his people are <hi>one house, one
body, one city,</hi> which is at unity, compacted together, &amp;c. this is a
publick confutation of it, makes <hi>Jerusalem</hi> appeare as a <hi>Babel,</hi> a
City of confusion, a Kingdome divided, wherein is nothing but <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,</hi>
and <hi>tumults,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>And as it is dishonourable to Christ, so it wonderfully hinders
and destroyes the <hi>edification</hi> of the Church, both the edification
of them, who make the Schisme, and the edification of them, from
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95931:14"/>
whom the rent is made, depriving them of that spiritual good they
might, and should receive and supply from, and to one another; for
though Iesus Christ the head, be the only fountaine of our spiritual
life, yet it is as true that Christs usuall way of exercising, strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
increasing, and perfecting it, is in the fellowship of the body,
<hi>that by what every joynt supplyes, the whole may be increased;</hi> so
that if we weigh it seriously,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 16.</note> we must conclude, That as nothing
within the bounds of the Church more argues a conformity to the
spirit of the Gospel, then the study of unitie, peace, and concord, so
few things more argue an opposition to Christs worke, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
good, then this spirit of division.</p>
            <p>But the third is the greatest question,<note place="margin">3 Who are guilty of it,</note> who are guilty of it? and
before I enter upon this discovery, give me leave to premise this, that
in our dayes it is in this point of Schisme, as it was of old in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church in the first point of Heresie: what opinions the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
would make odious, they would brand with the name of
<hi>Heresie,</hi> and thereby sometimes very truths of Christ were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
as Heresies; so it is at this day in the point of Schisme, the
Papists cry downe all, who professe Christianity through the whole
world as Schismaticks,<note place="margin">Who are guilty of the sin of Schisme.</note> who joyn not with, and subject not unto the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Prelatical</hi> party usually account all Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
who are not under the Church-government of Bishops; come
among them who are for the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> many of them call all
Schismaticks, who joyn in any other way: the <hi>Congregational men,</hi>
(as they are called) have the same esteeme of them who depart
from them, and goe into another way: I premise this, only for this
end, that you may hence conclude, that doubtlesse sometimes
the name is given, where it should not be given.</p>
            <p>Now let us returne to our Question, <hi>Who they are that are
guilty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Truly with sorrow I must reply,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In generall most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans this day are guilty of it.</note> It is a hard thing to
say in our sad dayes who is not guilty, as in Common-wealths,
where the bands and sinews of Civil government are cut asunder, &amp;
no conjunction, or associating of a people into or under government;
Politicians say, that in such times, <hi>Every man is at war with every
man, every man is an enemy to every man;</hi> so the Lord for our
sinnes hath poured this evil upon us, that we lye in confusion, almost
every man is divided from every man, and so deep hath the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady
taken root, that many are in love with it, and like their very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95931:15"/>
and as it is in popular tumults <hi>no man will heare any man,</hi>
but still the confused noyse goes on; so in truth is it with us, we are
not willing to heare of agreement, he is almost an enemy, who
would labour a pacification, or reconciliation. The Lord have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
upon us, our divisions are very great and sad; but as a generall
declaiming against sin, never converted a man from sin, untill he bee
convinced that himself be guilty of this or that sin; so my declaiming
against Schisme in generall wil not heal it, until I discover more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
who they are that are guilty of it. And to this I answer first
negatively,<note place="margin">This opened more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</note> all departure, separation, and denying to joyn in Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from some such, as call themselves Christians, is not Schisme;
the <hi>Israelites</hi> separation from <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calves was no Schisme, if
the faith of a people be <hi>heretical,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Negatively.</note> or their <hi>worship be idolatrous:</hi>
the Lord bids his servants <hi>come out from such a people.</hi>
               <note place="margin">All separation is not Schisme, such as are Schismaticks, who separate from Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I adde further, that although the faith of a Church be sound, and
the worship pure for the substance, yet if that Church, or Company,
wil presse some such things, which others cannot practise without sin,
and which unlesse they will practice (though against their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
they must be under intollerable persecution, as losse of state,
life, &amp;c. or spirituall anathematisme, unjust excommunications, or
the like,<note place="margin">Or from perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</note> to with-draw from such a people (provided that still they
will retaine those truths which are held by that persecuting Church,
and be ready to perform what Christian duty of love lyes in their
power towards them) this with-drawing is no Schism, it is no more
then Christ and his Disciples did to the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and
no more then the Lord hath bid his people do, when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
in one place, to with-draw and flye to another.</p>
            <p>2 I answer positively,<note place="margin">Some are schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks from principles of an erroneous judgement, some from principles of a corrupt heart.</note> they who are guilty of the sin of Schisme
may be reduced under two heads:</p>
            <p>Some are guilty of Schisme from their principles of judgement;
their principles of judgement carry them to the practice of that
which is a rending of the Church.</p>
            <p>Others, though their principles of judgement be right, yet are
Schismaticall,<note place="margin">Schismaticks from corrupt judgement are</note> through principles of a corrupt <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>spirit;</hi> I
shall speake to both these, but principally to the first sort.</p>
            <p>First, all those whose erroneous judgements make them Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
(as I conceive) may all be brought to these foure.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Independents properly so called.</note> Independency properly so called, is one of the highest prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Schisme, all such Christians, whether they be <hi>single persons</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95931:15"/>
or <hi>associated bodies,</hi> yea, though all the Christians in a Nation, asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
into a body, doe looke upon themselves as absolute, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
from the rest of the Church of Christ, with whom the
rest of the Church of Christ hath nothing to doe; this I say, is one
of the highest principles of Schisme in the world: but doe not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
me, I know there are some called, and branded with the
name of Independency, who professe they abhor both the name and
thing, I meane such, as conceive that a particular Church hath all
power in it selfe, and that no other assembly can authoritatively call
them to an account, so as to dissolve their sentences, or excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
them, because they conceive, that the government of the
Church is not placed in Synods, or in any other Assembly, then that
of a particular Congregation; yet readily acknowledge that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are but part of the Church, and ought to be countable to the
Church of Christ for their wayes, and that, if upon brotherly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
given by other Churches, they reforme not, they may and ought
to with-draw from all Christian communion with them: whether
their way of being countable be right or no I dispute not, only I say,
this is not the Independency here intended; but I meane any man,
or company of men, who looke upon themselves, as an intire Civil
State, or Common-wealth lookes upon it selfe, how small soever it
be (as in <hi>Italy,</hi> there are some such, which containe not above one
City or two) yet they count all the world hath nothing to do with
them, nor are they to be countable to any other State, no not to the
whole world, any further then their owne interest carries them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for their owne safety, or as they make use of them; this is true
State independency; so is it here when any persons, or company of
Christians looke upon themselves, as <hi>totum quid seorsum,</hi> as
men by themselves, and in their intentions, carry not themselves
as parts of the great Common-wealth, accounting it a thing little
or nothing materiall, so they professe the Name, and faith of
Christ, and serve him, whether they doe it in the communion of
the Catholick Church, or out of it, as if they were not persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
within the whole, or part of the same Common-wealth, this,
I say, is high and deep Schism; the very nature of Christs Church,
being one Body, requires, that whatsoever any, whether persons or
Churches do in matters of Religion, <hi>teaching,</hi> or <hi>being taught, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
fasting, Almes-giving,</hi> in <hi>word,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> yea, in <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95931:16"/>
loving, hoping, &amp;c.</hi> should all be done intentionally with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to, and communion with the whole Church of Christ; this first
principle lies deep rooted, many live by it, though few wil own it.</p>
            <p>2 Others are deeply schismatical from principles of judgement,<note place="margin">2 All who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches because not of their own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
who are so farre in love with their own constitution, or way of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation
into Church-Order, that they condemne all the other
Assemblies throughout the world, as no Churches of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they be not modelled and moulded according to the Plat-form
of their own particular Church-order, and association. I doe not
deny, but it is possible that some of Gods people may have some
such great mistakes lye upon them, that they cannot possibly joyne
in all Christian ordinances with any congregation in the world: as the
converted Christian <hi>Jewes,</hi> while they were under that apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that no man ought to be owned, but he that was circumcised; I
say, as long as that errour possest them, they could never joyn in all
Ordinances with the rest of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and how farre the rest
of the people of God should beare with such, and still own them as
Christs servants, is a thing worth the studying, but certainly the
principle it selfe is most destructive to the unity of the Church. To
refraine fellowship and communion with such Churches, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
who professe Christ their Lord, whose faith is sound, whose
worship is Gospel-worship, whose lives are holy, unlesse they will
come into that very particular way of Church order, which they
have pitched upon, is a dreadfull renting of the Church of Christ to
peeces; for if all Christs people in the world are one body, and all
thereby bound to have communion one with another, then certainly
that principle, which necessitates men to cast off (it may be) nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ninety nine parts of a thousand, must needs be dangerous, and
Schismatical;<note place="margin">Of which the Papists are most guilty.</note> of this none are so guilty, as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
who circumscribe the Church of Christ within the precinct of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Jurisdiction, and cast off all Christians, and all Churches in
the East, West, North, and South, yea, cast them off from all hope
of Salvation, who subject not themselves to their way. 2. Nor can
our rigid Separatists bee any way excused, who censure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
all other Churches, whatever their faith, worship, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
be, meerly because they are not gathered into Church-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
according to their own patternes. This so strict bounding of
our christian communion by outward formes, I humbly conceive
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95931:16"/>
hath been a great, and almost generall fault among the Churches of
<hi>Europe</hi> ever since the Reformation: in some Churches, the <hi>large
forme</hi> of the confession of their faith is made the <hi>Shibboleth;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
owning, and subscribing to this, without abating of a tittle, no
communion to be injoyed; in other Churches, without conforming
to their <hi>formes of Prayers, Rites,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sacraments, no communion to be injoyed, in others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
submitting to their <hi>forme of Church-government,</hi> no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
and with these, of whom I now speake, without submitting
to their manner and <hi>forme of gathering</hi> into Church-fellowship,
none to be owned, or acknowledged to be Churches of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
alas! how little is to be found in Scripture to bound our fellowship
and communion of Saints by any of these things? In the Scripture,
Churches are cryed up or downe, commended and blamed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as their <hi>fundamentall faith</hi> was sound, and their lives holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and I doubt not but one day, we shall all judge those Churches the
best, whose substantial faith is soundest, and lives most holy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their first manner of gathering were every way regular or not.
Suppose that in an Army, the Lawes of that Army were, That
none should be <hi>prest</hi> to serve, but all to come in as <hi>Volunteers,</hi> that
their Officers should bee so and so chosen, and qualified; now
suppose in this Army should be found some Souldiers, who at first
were <hi>forced</hi> in, or Officers, who came <hi>corruptly</hi> by their places;
suppose whole Troops or Companies of these, who yet being in,
prove as <hi>good Souldiers,</hi> as <hi>faithful, skilfull valiant</hi> for the Cause,
as any other, it may be, beyond any others, think you these would
not be owned by the Army, when they should be found such? Or,
suppose in <hi>Marriage,</hi> at the first the Parties <hi>marry,</hi> while not of
years of <hi>discretion,</hi> or to <hi>please Parents,</hi> or the like, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
come to love, and live in their <hi>Marriage-relation</hi> according
to the Word, thinke wee these shall not be owned as Husband and
Wife? so is the case here: Let mee for present suppose these
men, or Churches, to whom I speak, to be at their fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st gath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring
according to the purest patterne; and let mee also suppose another
Company irregularly joyned, it may be forced in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that also whilst
they are <hi>ignorant, prophane,</hi> &amp;c. and that their Minister also was
put upon them; now if the Lord please to worke upon those effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
so that Minister and people grow sound in the faith, holy in
their lives, pure in their worship, zealous for the truth; when pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95931:17"/>
they who boast of their first joyning, are grown like <hi>Sardis,</hi>
to have a name to be alive, and yet are dead, &amp;c. shal we thinke
the Lord Jesus wil not owne the other before themselves? yes
doubtlesse, and so should all his people; give me leave to adde
one thing more; That the notion of making the first gathering of
people into Church-fellowship, to be the rule to direct us with
whom we may joyne, or not joyne; this I say, may make us refuse
some Churches, upon whom are apparently seen the <hi>Scripture-</hi>
Characters of a Golden Candlestick, and imbrace communion
with others, only upon a <hi>humane</hi> testimony or report; for in that
Church above mentioned, I may see a visible profession of sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in faith, and holinesse there; in the other, <hi>men</hi> only tell me, the
<hi>first</hi> were not orderly gathered, and the others were; to conclude
this branch, this principle of renouncing all Churches for want of a
supposed orderly gathering, or for want of some such desirable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
which themselves injoy, is so dangerous and schismatical,
that I feare not to say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is more lawful to have a Church-standing
in the corruptest Church in the world, where salvation and
life may be obtained, by the doctrine held out, and the way profest
in that Church, though there should be very many frailties, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
amongst them, then with that company, how holy soever
it seemes to be, that wil necessitate such as joyne with them, to
renounce communion with all the rest of the Body of Jesus Christ
upon earth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. All who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons erring in points not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall.</note> another principle of Schism, and which I conceive to be
of larger, and of farre greater extent, and may make a fairer plea for
it selfe, then yet any named, is, that which shuts up many servants
of Christ, that they cannot joyne, nor afford Christian communion
unto others for some particular errours found in their profession of
faith, or some frailties found in their conversation. I say, that
principle which makes the <hi>servants</hi> of Christ deny communion
to them, to whom <hi>Christ</hi> wil not deny communion, to <hi>interdict</hi>
communion with them, with whom Christ doth not <hi>interdict</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
is a renting principle. Conceive my meaning in a plaine
comparison. Suppose in a Corporation, there were some rules gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by their Charter and Founder, concerning their infranchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that whosoever is so, and so qualified, shal be a Free-man;
if that Corporation, or any number shal deny freedome to any so
qualified, or shal disfranchise any for any offence, for wch the Charter
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95931:17"/>
whereby they all stand, doth not warrant them, they are guilty of
rending their Charter, and they usurpe a power not given them by
their founder; so is it in the Church, let me give a few instances;
Take the Churches in the Apostles time, some of them did think it
utterly unlawful to eat any meat that had been offered to an Idol,
some did think all days were alike, some thought that it was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unlawful to eat any thing, but herbes, &amp;c. Suppose now that the
number of those, who held these opinions, should have gone to the
rest of the Church, and said, <hi>You are too lax in your principles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
you will renounce that carnall, ungodly liberty, which you
take, to eate in Idols temples, or to eate meat that hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to an Idol, &amp;c. we professe we must renounce communion
with you,</hi> they had been Schismaticks in doing so. If on the other
side the Church had called them, and said, <hi>You by your strict opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
cut short the liberty Christ hath purchased for us by his
bloud, unlesse you lay aside these conceits of yours, we cast you
out,</hi> then the Schisme had laine on their part; because the Charter
of Christianity hath provided,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 3, 4, 10, &amp;c.</note> that for these things the people of
God should not rent one from another, but bear one with another,
that thereby they might heale one another.</p>
            <p>Come a little nearer our own times, Take the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as now they stand, all the Churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi>
though they be sound in their faith, yet generally they are against
<hi>the divine institution</hi> of the Lords day.</p>
            <p>Goe to <hi>Helvetia</hi> amongst the <hi>Switzers,</hi> generally the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
there are against all Divine-right of any Church-government,
and require nothing but the help of the Magistrate to keep their
people in order.</p>
            <p>Go from them, if you wil among the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> among them
are many (as we judge) dangerous opinions, the Arminian points,
and besides them, Consubstantiation, and the ubiquity of Christs
body, and the like. The like might be said in many particulars of
the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Danes;</hi> all these Churches being sound in the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,
and owned by Christ, ought also to own one another; there
are indeed some doctrines, wherein if men or Churches be not sound,
the Lord Christ wil have nothing to do with them, or if a Churches
worship be Idolatrous, the Lord Christ wil not hold communion
with them, but there are some errours in doctrines, and corruptions
in conversation, for which (though Christ like them not) he doth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95931:18"/>
not reject them; apply this to our purpose. At this day the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
deny the Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Deity of the
Holy Ghost, the Trinity of Persons, they deny that Jesus Christ
hath merited, or satisfied for his people, these doctrines overthrow
our Christianity, and we count the holders of these to have nothing
with Christians in common, but only the name, therefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them.</p>
            <p>The Papists also, besides some fundamentall errours, as justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the merit of our owne workes, &amp;c. are most abominably
Idolatrous in their worship, and the Lord therefore bids us <hi>come out
from them;</hi> but take all the rest of the Churches of Christ in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
and I humbly conceive that we ought, and must owne them
to be Churches of Christ; and therefore when the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and
the <hi>Lutherans</hi> had had many disputes, to see if they could fetch off
one another from their principles, and could not do it, the <hi>Calvinists</hi>
even the holiest, and learnedst of them, such as <hi>Calvin, Beza, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
Zanchy, Vrsin, Pareus,</hi> have offered to owne them as brethren,
as Churches of Christ, and would have been willing to heare them, to
receive Sacraments with them: the rigid <hi>Lutherans</hi> refused it, and
cry out, <hi>From communion with the</hi> Calvinists, <hi>Good Lord deliver
us:</hi> Now say I, the Schisme was on the <hi>Lutherans</hi> part: if the
<hi>Lutherans</hi> had offered it, and the <hi>Calvinists</hi> had rejected, the
Schisme had laine on the <hi>Calvinists</hi> part.</p>
            <p>Bring it yet nearer, many of these opinions are got in among us,
especially about free-will, Infant-baptisme, formes of Church-government,
&amp;c. and we should not refuse communion with any of
them (supposing their lives unblameable.) If they will hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with us; I say, <hi>if they will,</hi> for ordinarily erroneous persons
are proud, and must have all mens sheaves bow down to theirs, and
will close only with teachers and companies according to their owne
lusts, but if we in a spirit of Christian love would have peace,
and they refuse it, then both the errour and schisme lyeth at their
doore.</p>
            <p>But against all this, it may be,<note place="margin">First objection against this third branch.</note> and is objected: What a speckled bird
would you make a particular church? Suppose the church you should
be an Officer unto, should be such a medly, of some holding the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the Lords day, some denying it, some for Infant-baptisme,
some condemning it, some like the Presbyterian-government,
others are for the Episcopal, others like a Congregational better then
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95931:18"/>
either of them; some would have their children baptised, others
are utterly against it, some of them <hi>Calvinists,</hi> some <hi>Lutherans,</hi> to
have a Church made up of all these, would not this be a reproach to
you to be a Pastor to such a flock?</p>
            <p>To which I answer;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> what reproach would it be to me to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
of such a Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Jesus Christ is a head of? If the Church
of Christ, wherein his Spirit rules, to whom he is a head, and which
shal be saved, be made up of all these, what reproach (if prejudice
did not blinde mens eyes) could it be to any of us, to have such
members to be members of our Congregations?</p>
            <p>But doe you then intend a toleration of all these opinions?<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> would
you have <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Anti-sabbatarians, Anabaptists,</hi> and
others tolerated among us?</p>
            <p>I answer first,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> what the Magistrates office is about toleration, or
non-toleration, I have nothing to doe to meddle with at this time;
my doctrine confines me to speake only of Church forbearance, and
upon that account.</p>
            <p>I answer, if by toleration, you meane an approbation of these,
God forbid, we must approve of no errour, we should all seeke to
make one another imbrace every truth of Christ; But if by tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you meane a not cutting them off, unlesse they lay downe their
errours and renounce them, that indeed I plead for, we should hold
Christian communion with them for Christ thus beares with them,
and will have us beare one with another; and as it is in our naturall
body, if a man have an ulcer in his hand or his leg if ordinary medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
wil not cure it, he wil wait till the strength of nature work out
the humour, or till by the providence of God, he can light of some
more happy medicines, then yet have been propounded, but he will
not cut his hand or his leg off, so long as it may be any wayes use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to him; so is the case here.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note> Some will yet object, indeed if you meane to bear with
them for a while, till the truth hath been set before them, that they
have all meanes of conviction, it wil be granted; but suppose all
paines have been taken, the truth hath been propounded, they have
been reasoned with, and they still hold the same, then they may be
judged obstinate and self-condemned.</p>
            <p>I answer plainly,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
               <hi>faith,</hi> as it is the imbracing of any particular truth
is as well the gift of Gods Spirit, as that faith whereby we receive
Christ for our Saviour, no wisdome, or rhethoricke of man can ever
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95931:19"/>
make a man receive the faith of any one doctrine of Christianity,
till Gods Spirit inable him, and it is a far easier matter to <hi>non-plus</hi> a
man in disputing, then it is to clear his understanding, and inable him
to receive a truth; and when such persons do appeal to the searcher
of hearts, that it is meer want of light which hinders them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one minde, our Christian love (which ever judgeth the best)
should rest satisfied, especially when their lives are unblameable, we
must not take upon us to be Lords of their faith; and therefore after
many disputes and conferences between the dissenting Churches in
<hi>Germany,</hi> when they were not able to dispute one another
out of their principles (as I before noted) the <hi>Calvinists</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to hold an amicable Christian communion one with another; and
if in a fair debating way they could afterward satisfie one another,
well and good, in the meane time they would wait, till Christ
would give more light: and upon this account, the <hi>Calvinists</hi> and
<hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Polonia</hi> doe at this day live in concord, both of them
retaining their opinions.</p>
            <p>And in truth, we all professe to doe the same toward them; for I
hardly know any amongst us, but confesse the <hi>Helvetians, Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi>
&amp;c. are true Churches, notwithstanding their errours: Now
(say I) shal a company associated in such, and such opinions, bee
counted a true Church? and shal not a particular man, who holds
the same points, be counted a true visible member? or shal we hold
communion with them in <hi>Germany,</hi> and shal we deny it to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in <hi>England?</hi> God forbid, that the exercise of our Christian
charity, and communion should vary, according as Regions vary.
If <hi>whole Churches</hi> be owned, because of their faith and holinesse of
life (notwithstanding their errours) to be true visible Churches,
then <hi>one man</hi> that hath those errours, may goe for a true visible
Christian, because of his faith and holinesse. And in truth they who
are the brethren of our elder brother, are our brethren, wil we, nil
we, and we shal repent, if we use them not as brethren.</p>
            <p>Yet againe,<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> it wil be said, but <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>wish they</hi> were all cut
off that troubled the <hi>Galatians.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I answer;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> But mark who they were, they were such who brought
such a doctrin that he profest,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 2.</note> if they imbraced it, <hi>Christ would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
them nothing;</hi> they, who would set up a new Christ, a new way
of salvation, to seek justification by their own works, he prayed they
might be cut off, but he never wished it for errours of a lower nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:95931:19"/>
But lastly, some may yet demand, and say, What if they who
hold such Opinions, joyn in communion with you, and in your
communion make it their worke and practise; (for errour is very
Pragmatical) to draw all the rest of your company into their errors,
and labour to infect all; yea, to put all into flames of division and
confusion, unlesse they can prevaile. Shall we indure to see our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and our people before our eyes drawne into errors, although
those errors, it may be, are not fundamentall?</p>
            <p>I answer;<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 22.</note> First, I know no great hurt for men to be permitted
modestly, and humbly to debate among their Brethren the things
wherein they differ; But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, I answer; If men, who hold differing opinions in these
lesser points, can neither be content to follow <hi>Pauls</hi> counsel, <hi>to have
their faith, in these, to themselves before God,</hi> nor modestly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
their arguments, and grounds, and so be quiet, but must make
it their work to draw (it may be) weak ones, into doubtful disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and thereby take them off from the study and prosecution
of more weighty things; I can bee no Advocate for such people, if
they judge the spreading of their opinions to be such a duty, that
they take themselves bound in conscience, to do all that is possible, to
draw all others in to them; I know no remedy, but such people must
be contented to with-draw, and joyne with such Churches, where
their opinions are received; for it cannot be conjectured that in any
Society, of any nature, men will be quietly tolerated, who shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
be boutefues, and kindle-fires, to disturbe their peace, and
alwayes putting them into flames.</p>
            <p>Suppose a man were of <hi>Erastus</hi> his opinion, that there is no
Church-Government by Christs appointment, and yet withall
should joyne in a Congregationall, or Presbyterian way, and they
also willing to joyne in Church-Fellowship with him, as knowing
his errour not to be fundamentall, if this man will now make it his
worke to draw them off, from what they beleeve to be Christs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
and their duty, that they must either all yeeld to him or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
no quiet, this I say will prove intolerable; thus also it is in Civil
associations.</p>
            <p>Suppose in any Corporation, where a Court of Aldermen, or
Common-Counsell should bee Judges, if the major part judge any
Cause before them, and the residue, who judge otherwise, wil not be
content to sit downe, but be alwayes quarrelling, and calumniating
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95931:20"/>
the rest, charging them to be erroneous, or unrighteous Judges, such
unquiet and turbulent carriage over-throws all, and is not compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with humane Society.</p>
            <p>Beloved, I beseech you pardon me, that I have been so long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this third Branch, for I confesse it is deeply settled upon my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that were this rule received, it would have a great influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the healing of our divisions; I know indeed, that many learned
and holy men think otherwise, and doe conceive, that their zeale for
Christs truth must not suffer them thus far to tolerate them, who hold
errors derogatory to the truth of Christ; but I humbly conceive that
zeale for Christs truth should never use other meanes to preserve
Christs truth, then Christ himselfe hath appointed; zeale to preserve
Justice, and Righteousnesse, and to punish disorders in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
is very commendable, but yet that zeale would not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
in a Magistrate, who should hang a man for such a fault,
for which the Law hath only appointed the house of Correction, or
Whipping-post. Let us confine our selves to Christs rules, and then
let our zeale burn, as hot as may be.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4 They are Schismaticall who separate from true Churches for light cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> There is yet one sort more, and they are such, whose
principles carry them to separate from particular Churches for light
causes; suppose some defects, or some miscarriages in their Church-government,
it may be, some too great connivence at unworthy or
scandalous persons, or it may be some defects or miscarriages in their
publick administrations. I say, the renting off, and departing from
particular Churches for such causes, as these, wil be found to be but
Schism, to separate from Churches, from which Christ doth not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate,
is schismatical; now it is cleare in the Scripture, Christ Jesus
owneth Churches, who are defective in many things, and if, as I said
before, Churches should bear with particular persons in their errors,
certainly particular persons should bear with Churches; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when a Churches faith is sound for the substance, and their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
Gospel-worship, though their Government be not perfect, and
other defects found among them, we must not separate; and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from them is the more unjust, if that Church bee seeking for
light, and willing to be informed; I grant, there may bee slitting
from one Church to another, for greater edification, which is without
condemning that Church, they slit from: but separation from a true
Church for want of some desirable perfection, is a fruit of this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
root of Schisme, because it rents where Christ rents not; for if
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95931:20"/>
we looke into the Scripture, we shal find there were Churches, who
had many errours in <hi>Faith,</hi> others disorderly in their <hi>Worship,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had many among them loose in their conversations, but not one
word of the Holy Ghosts counselling the Lords people to with-draw
from them, or to go and gather into a body by themselves; they
are often called upon to do what they can, to heale them, but not
one word of separating from them,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 25.</note> or with-drawing from them;
indeed we sometimes read of some,<note place="margin">Jude 19.</note> who separated themselves, but
we may also read in the same places, what sad brands the Spirit of
God gives them; and should it bee lawful for every errour, and
every miscarriage, or for the want of some desirable perfection thus
to rend off, we must rend, and rend, and rend, for ought I know, to
the end of the world, and the union and communion of Christs
people would come almost to nothing; whereas he would have all
his throughout the world, as they injoy communion with himselfe,
so to injoy (as their occasion and need requires) communion with
all his Saints; now such limitations and restrictions, as these are,
make such a communion impossible; I am veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y perswaded, that
were the union and communion of the people of Christ rightly
knowne, there is no Saint in any part of the world, but where ever
he comes, might demand upon the profession of his faith, and his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
subjection to the Gospel, his right in the Ordinances, hear
the Word with them, pray with them, receive the Sacrament with
them; I say onely upon that ticket, that hee professeth that faith,
which is the common faith of Gods people, and while hee is with
them, walkes according to the Gospel rule; now where mens prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
doe shut them up, after the manner I have been treating of,
these things are not practicable. I shut up all this discourse,
concerning all these, who are schismatical through erroneous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with this briefe corollary; The communion of Saints one
with another is not only a priviledge, but a duty injoyned by Christ,
he hath not left us at liberty to chuse with whom we wil hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and to refuse whom we lift, no; as ever wee wil appear
before him with comfort, wee must hold communion with those,
who professe his name,<note place="margin">2 Some are Schismaticall from principles of a corrupt heart.</note> and labour to <hi>keep</hi> with them all, <hi>the unity
of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</hi> Now, as these are schismatical
from erroneous judgements, so there are others from principles of a
corrupt heart, I shall only name them, and indeed naming them is
sufficient to convince them, for no man dares take upon him to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95931:21"/>
justifie them, yet named they must be, for they are as mischevious
as the others.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">1 As self-lovers and self-see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</note> therefore all selfe-lovers, and selfe-seekers, with whom all
others in their affections and spirits are regarded, onely as they can
make use of them; we know that if the members of the body were
thus affected, the whole body would soon perish. Private-wealths-men,
are never good Commonwealths-men; <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted the
Saints <hi>not to looke upon our owne things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>but every man on
the things of others,</hi> else it is impossible, but we must divide from
them,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> as our private interest leads us: This self-seeking ruined and
overthrew <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the other, of seeking the publick-weale,
built up <hi>Rome,</hi> and so is it in our great, and spiritual Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Proud and high-minded spirits.</note> All proud, insolent, arrogant, high-minded men, who
must have rule, and beare sway where ever they come, or who use
to despise and contemn others, <hi>I have no need of thee,</hi> full of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and sleighting of others: This spirit of pride is a cursed root
bringing forth heresie, schisme, contention, and every evil work. The
first rent which ever was in Gods family, was the <hi>pride</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and ever since it hath born the like fruit; examples are innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<hi>Cain, Esau, Corah, Dathan</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 Quarrelsome and railing spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note> All quarrelsome, railing, froward spirits, who upon every
dissent from them in any opinion, or in matters of conversation, fall
into railing language, branding others with odious terms, seeking to
make them infamous and hateful: railing never cures errour, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
but keeps division open, and makes the breach wider; truth
and love joyned together may work great things, but truth and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
can do little.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4 Busie-bodies.</note> And so are all busie-bodies, who must have an oare in
every mans boat, who cannot be content to keep within their owne
calling,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 3.</note> but as the Apostle expresseth their nature in this Text, are
<hi>wise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 15.</note> or thinke more highly of themselves then they ought to think;
all these polypragmatical spirits, which delight to be Bishops in all
mens Diocesses, are dangerous persons, nothing more divides or
rends the body, then when the members keepe not to their owne
worke.</p>
            <p>And fiftly, All factious people, who, where ever they come wil be
making parties,<note place="margin">5 All factious spirits.</note> (though it may be) they draw them not into a new
Church, yet divide into several parties, some for <hi>Pauls,</hi> and some
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95931:21"/>
for <hi>Apollos,</hi> and some for another, and all that is but to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
seem some body, and serve their own bellies.</p>
            <p>Paul <hi>often complains of such kind of men, these carnal men made
the schisme in</hi> Corinth, <hi>of these he admonishes the Romans,</hi> Mark
them, who cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine,
which you have learned,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> and avoid them; for they that are such,
serve not our Lord Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 17.</note> but their owne bellies. <hi>A very
sad sentence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">6 All who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</note> and lastly, All they, whose spirits carry them to foment and
cherrish such, as make rents and divisions, who not onely bear with
such, as we would bear with a disease, so bear with, as yet to lance it,
and seek to cure it, but delight in them as to make them the men of
their counsel and confederacy, and thereby doe harden them in their
way, expose themselves unto snares, and occasion others who are
weak, to incline to these dividers, all these, some from one principle,
others from another, help to rend and divide that body, which Christ
would have preserved in unity.</p>
            <p>I have thus far, according to my weaknesse, discovered to you the
true causes, and in part the instruments of our woful divisions, which
have made the Church of Christ present it selfe such a rueful specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
as it is at this day: what remaines, but only these two things?</p>
            <p>First, That we all lament this, and mourn for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That we all labour to help to cure it.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Exhort. 1. To lament our divisions.</note> That we all lament it; I confesse our divisions in opinions
are very sad, but our divided affections are sadder: were our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
united, the spirit of love would have such a power upon our
hearts, that when we had once learned to follow the truth in love,
truth and love would carry all before them: Ah, that God would
teach us to lay it to heart, and to mourne, that wee should be as so
many <hi>Ishmaels,</hi> our sword against every man, and every mans against
us. Beloved, we little consider how precious the peace of the Church
of Christ ought to be, even more precious then our lives; we little
consider how dishonourable our divisions are to Jesus Christ, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his <hi>Jerusalem</hi> appeare as <hi>Babel,</hi> a disordered and confused
heap, when he dyed to make us one, and prayed to his Father that
we might be one, we thus to expose his body to be a scorne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
is very sad. We little consider how pleasing our divisions are
to Satan,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 10.</note> who prevailes upon our hearts,<note place="margin">Iohn 17. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> while we thus furiously busie
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95931:22"/>
our heads; nor how pleasing are they to our common enemies, who, no
doubt do secretly foment them, that thereby they may destroy us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
get the rule over us; our divisions and sub-divisions are strong wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
in their hands against us. Little doe wee lay to heart these
things; if wee did, our hearts would bleed in secret for them;
and I humbly beseech you, let these things be to us for a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And secondly,<note place="margin">Exhort. 2.</note> Labour to heale them; Beloved, it must be done,
Christ wil have it done,<note place="margin">To endeavour to cure them.</note> he wil compel us to it, he wil beat us into
one, or he wil beat us til we are none; he wil not bear long, if we
remaine as we are, and therefore let all Gods people first pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
for it,<note place="margin">1 Pray for it.</note> 
               <hi>Oh pray for the peace of Jerusalem,</hi> intreate the
Prince of peace, and the Spirit of peace to grant us peace, to heale
our divisions, to raise up healing instruments, make it our supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
every day, that our Lord, the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> would poure in
oyle and wine, and bind up these our woful rents, he, and he alone
can doe it. I read, that when the divisions in <hi>Germany</hi> about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, were extream hot and fierce, the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi>
the fifth made a decree, called the <hi>Interim,</hi> that there should bee
common and publick peace in <hi>Germany,</hi> and none to make war up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other for the cause of Religion, but that Christian amity should
be practised by all until a free and general Councel should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
Oh pray to Christ for such an <hi>Interim,</hi> that we might not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
but live in love, <hi>untill</hi> himselfe reveale such light, as wil make
his people all of one minde; <hi>Charles</hi> made the Decree, but could
not give the heart: our Lord can give the <hi>Decree</hi> and the heart also.
Follow him with this Suite.</p>
            <p>And secondly; Let us not onely pray, but let us labour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
it, and let us to this end, examine our owne principles, and let
us count no principle, no affection, no disposition of spirit worth
the keeping, which wil not let us bee one with them, with whom
Christ is one, and let us beleeve, that while we are in this world, we
shal all of us know in part, and but in part; beleeve in part, and but
in part; let us never expect to finde in this life, all who agree in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
truths, to agree in all other truths; and let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that though every truth of Christ be precious, and worthy to
be contended for, yet every truth is not necessary to salvation, nor
necessary to be found in all, with whom we ought to hold and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95931:22"/>
Christian communion; many meats, which are whole some, yet
cannot be relished by all, with whom we may sit at the same table;
while we are here, we shal often see cause, to differ in our <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
about many precious truths, but wee shall never see cause to
differ in <hi>affection</hi> from those whom Jesus Christ loveth. Certainly,
I may love, where Christ loves; and I may imbrace, where
Christ imbraceth; and I may not interdict, where Christ doth not
interdict, and wee may, and ought to bee of one heart with them,
with whom wee cannot be of one minde in all things; the time is
coming when we shal be of one <hi>minde. Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> are of
one mind in heaven, while their Disciples wrangle on earth: at which
day he will appeare with more comfort, who <hi>beares and forbeares</hi>
with his weak and erring brethren, then he is like to do, that <hi>loves
not his brother;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> sure I am this is <hi>Pauls</hi> counsel, who said, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
we have attained, let us mind the same things, and if any be
otherwise minded, the Lord will reveale it to him</hi> in his due time.
And therefore I conclude this Use with that speech of the Apostle,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 14. 15.</note>
               <hi>Above all, put on love, that is the band of perfection, and
let the peace of God rule in your hearts;</hi> I meane that peace the
Lord Jesus Christ is the Authour of, let that rule in your hearts;
The Greeke word signifies, let it bee as the Officer the Greekes
had in their solemne Games, who determined and quieted all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
in all strifes and contentions, to whom he gave the Palm,
that quieted all the rest; So let the peace of God be such a <hi>bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beutes,</hi>
let it rule in our hearts. And the Spirit of God presseth it
there upon this very ground, <hi>because we are called thereunto in
one body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are brethren, let us not strive, or if we do contend, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
who shal be most holy, who shal love most, who shal beare
most one with another, till that blessed day come, when Christs light
shal shine so perfectly upon us, that wee shal be all of one minde,
and one heart in all things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus much for the first great duty,</hi> That Saints are all one
body, therefore there should be no schisme, no divisions among
