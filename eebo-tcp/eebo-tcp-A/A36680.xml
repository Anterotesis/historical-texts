            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>SInce Men like Beasts, each others Prey were made,</l>
               <l>Since Trade began, and Priesthood grew a Trade,</l>
               <l>Since Realms were form'd, none sure so curst as those</l>
               <l>That madly their own Happiness oppose;</l>
               <l>There Heaven it self, and Godlike Kings, in vain</l>
               <l>Showr down the <hi>Manna</hi> of a gentle Reign;</l>
               <l>While pamper'd Crowds to mad Sedition run,</l>
               <l>And Monarchs by Indulgence are undone.</l>
               <l>Thus <hi>David</hi>'s Goodness was e'en fatal grown,</l>
               <l>While wealthy Faction aw'd the wanting Throne.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48933:3"/>For now their Sov'reigns Orders to contemn</l>
               <l>Was held the Charter of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>His Rights t'invade, his Tributes to refuse,</l>
               <l>A Privilege peculiar to the <hi>Iews</hi>
               </l>
               <l>As if from Heav'nly Call this Licence fell,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Seed were chosen to rebell!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Achitophel</hi> with triumph sees his Crimes</l>
               <l>Thus suited to the madness of the Times;</l>
               <l>And <hi>Absalom,</hi> to make his hopes succeed,</l>
               <l>Of Flatterie's Charms no longer stands in need;</l>
               <l>While fond of Change, though ne'er so dearly bought,</l>
               <l>Our Tribes out-strip the Youth's Ambitious Thought;</l>
               <l>His swiftest Hopes with swifter Homage meet,</l>
               <l>And crowd their servile Necks beneath his Feet.</l>
               <l>Thus to his aid while pressing Tides repair,</l>
               <l>He mounts and spreads his Streamers in the Air.</l>
               <l>The Charms of Empire might his Youth mis-lead,</l>
               <l>But what can our besotted <hi>Israel</hi> plead?</l>
               <l>Sway'd by a Monarch whose serene Command,</l>
               <l>Seems half the Blessing of our promis'd Land.</l>
               <l>Whose onely Grievance is excess of Ease,</l>
               <l>Freedome our Pain, and Plenty our Disease!</l>
               <l>Yet since all Folly wou'd lay claim to Sense,</l>
               <l>And Wickedness ne'er wanted a Pretence,</l>
               <l>With Arguments they'd make their Treason good,</l>
               <l>And righteous <hi>David's</hi> self with Slanders load:</l>
               <l>That Arts of foreign Sway he did affect,</l>
               <l>And guilty <hi>Iebusites</hi> from Law protect,</l>
               <l>Whose very Chiefs, convict, were never freed,</l>
               <l>Nay, we have seen their Sacrificers bleed!</l>
               <l>Accusers Infamy is urg'd in vain,</l>
               <l>While in the bounds of Sense they did contain,</l>
               <l>But soon they launcht into th' unfathom'd Tide,</l>
               <l>And in the Depths they knew disdain'd to Ride,</l>

               <l>Mere Truth was dull, nor suited with the port</l>
               <l>Of pamper'd <hi>Corah,</hi> when advanc't to Court.</l>
               <l>No less than Wonders now they will impose,</l>
               <l>And Projects void of Grace or Sense disclose.</l>
               <l>Such was the Charge on pious <hi>Michal</hi> brought,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Michal</hi> that ne'er was cruel e'en in thought,</l>
               <l>The best of Queens, and most obedient Wife,</l>
               <l>Impeach'd of curst Designs on <hi>David</hi>'s Life!</l>
               <l>His Life, the Theam of her eternal Pray'r,</l>
               <l>'Tis scarce so much his Guardian Angels Care.</l>
               <l>Not Summer Morns such Mildness can disclose,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Hermon</hi> Lilly, nor the <hi>Sharon</hi> Rose.</l>
               <l>Neglecting each vain Pomp of Majesty,</l>
               <l>Transported <hi>Michal</hi> feeds her thoughts on high.</l>
               <l>She lives with Angels, and as Angels do,</l>
               <l>Quits Heav'n sometimes to bless the World below.</l>
               <l>Where cherisht by her Bounties plenteous Spring,</l>
               <l>Reviving Widows smile, and Orphans sing.</l>
               <l>Oh! when rebellious <hi>Israel</hi>'s Crimes at height,</l>
               <l>Are threatned with her Lord's approaching Fate,</l>
               <l>The Piety of <hi>Michal</hi> then remain</l>
               <l>In Heav'ns Remembrance, and prolong his Reign.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Less Desolation did the Pest persue,</l>
               <l>That from <hi>Dan</hi>'s limits to <hi>Beersheba</hi> slew,</l>

               <l>Well might he deem each Peer and Prince his Slave:</l>
               <l>And Lord it o'er the Tribes which he could save:</l>
               <l>E'en Vice in him was Vertue — what sad Fate</l>
               <l>But for his Honesty had seiz'd our State?</l>
               <l>And with what Tyranny had we been curst,</l>

               <l>T' have told his knowledge of th' Intrigue in gross</l>
               <l>Had been alas to our Deponent's loss:</l>
               <l>The travell'd Levite had th' Experience got,</l>
               <l>To husband well, and make the best of 's Plot;</l>

               <l>For now his Writ such Reverence had got,</l>
               <l>'Twas worse than Plotting to suspect his Plot.</l>
               <l>Some were so well convinc't, they made no doubt,</l>
               <l>Themselves to help the founder'd Swearers out.</l>
               <l>Some had their Sense impos'd on by their Fear,</l>
               <l>But more for Int'rest sake believe and swear:</l>
               <l>E'en to that height with some the Frenzy grew,</l>
               <l>They rag'd to find their danger not prove true.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet, than all these a viler Crew remain,</l>

               <l>Not urg'd by Fear, nor through misguided Sense,</l>
               <l>(Blind Zeal, and starving Need had some pretence)</l>
               <l>But for the <hi>Good Old Cause</hi> that did excite</l>
               <l>Th' Original Rebells Wiles, Revenge and Spight.</l>
               <l>These raise the Plot to have the Scandal thrown</l>
