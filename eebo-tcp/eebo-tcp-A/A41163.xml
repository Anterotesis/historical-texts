            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A brief Account of some of the late <hi>Incroachments</hi> and <hi>Depredations</hi> of the <hi>Dutch</hi> upon the <hi>English</hi>; and of a few of those many Advantages which by <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Violence</hi> they have made of the <hi>Brittish Nations</hi> since the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,</hi> and of the <hi>Means</hi> enabling them thereunto.</head>
            <p>IT may justly astonish, as well as Surprize those who give them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selves liberty to think, that a Nation pretending to so much Wit, and good Sense (and that very rightfully) as the <hi>English</hi> do, should suffer themselves both in the view, and to the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, to be Tricked, Cheated, and Bubbled to the degree they are by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were never much esteemed for the Greatness and Transendency of their Understandings, tho' they have been so well known for Treachery and Fraud, as the peculiar qualities they excell in, and which they have never failed to excercise, and display themselves by, when and where they have had opportunity. For tho' now and then a few <hi>Individuals</hi> may have been found, and still are among them, who for Probity and Intellectuals, have been, and are secured against this Imputation and Charge, yet these are the characters, which they have commonly lain under as a <hi>State</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to which the generality of that People, have been as Meritoriously as Commonly entitled. And which tho' most Nations have in some measure Experienced, who have either had the misfortune to need, or the folly to Confide in them; yet none have so often and so sensibly felt the Effects both of their Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Deceit, as we of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> have done: Whereof it were eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Republick.</hi> But that I intend for reasons which any man may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into, to confine the account I am now to give of their fraudulent and rapacious behaviour towards, and the Gains they have made of us by tricks and violence, only to that circle and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of time which hath elapsed since the Commencement and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of the late <hi>Revolution.</hi> And besides all the other Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, this is as well proper as designed to have upon us, if we have not both renounced common Reason, and our Native Country, It may serve not only to awaken us, to a perusal of those many former Relations of their Treacherous Supplanting, and their hostile Us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urpations, but to give a fresh and raised credit to all those ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent detections of their Villanies, which either thro a strange Oscitancy we were willing to forget, or thro the Inhumanity of them, too much disinclined to believe.</p>
            <p>I suppose it is needless now to tell any man that is not qualified for <hi>Bedlam,</hi> tho he be one that hath renounced all Revealed Religion and moral Honesty, and ridiculeth every thing that is superstructed on, or which fasteneth obligation and duty upon us in the vertue of the acknowledgment of those Fundamentals: That it was not out of any love to these <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> or for any real concern for what we value and challenge a property in, either as Protestants or <hi>Englishmen,</hi> that the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> lent their Men and Ships to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> and encouraged his coming with an Army into <hi>England.</hi> Alas! both his Conduct and theirs since, do so interfere with those pretences, that it were as easie to reconcile Contradictions, as to resolve that Undertaking into those Motives. And tho I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it to be very natural to all true <hi>Hollanders</hi> to be furnished with a great deal of assurance, and to claim it as a Prerogative entailed upon their Country not to blush, as those other Climes retain the modesty to do, when they obtrude the most notorious falshhoods upon the faith of Mankind; yet the present tottering and precarious state of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the little room it hath in their thoughts, unless it be how to subvert it, as well as the many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions made upon our <hi>Laws, Rights,</hi> and <hi>Civil Liberties,</hi> besides the Rapines committed upon our <hi>Trade,</hi> and the many guileful Arts that have been practised to enslave and impoverish us since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of 1689. have not only refuted, but exposed these <hi>State</hi> pretences of rescuing us from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Thraldom,</hi> which had been made use of to wheedle us into those Crimes, whereof we became
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106931:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
guilty thro their Delusions, and to prepare us to entertain, and tamely to undergo and suffer the Miseries which they had projected to bring upon us.

Which tho it be but the beginning of a Just Recompence of Reward upon your <hi>Episcopal men</hi> for their Apostacy, from the Doctrine of their Church in Reference to civil Government, and legal Governours, yet it both sufficiently proclaims some Peoples Ingratiude, and intimates what those deluded, credulous, missed; and revolting <hi>Clergy-men</hi> are to expect, in relation to all those Dignities and Emoluments they have been advanced unto, and hitherto kept in possession of, by standing Laws in preference unto, and contradistinction of all other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants. And should not that story be so Authentick, as it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally vouched to be; yet his behaviour upon all occasions towards those of the Established Church, is so scornful as well as unkind, as abundantly testifies, not only his Distrust and Hatred of them upon the motives of <hi>Dutch</hi> Counsels; but a design to mortifie their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and to alter and subvert the Establishment, which our Laws do at present give them: Nor are the late Caballings, Animosities and Prosecutions against a certain Person Orn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Adding that he had expected an answer to his former Letters, and to those Memorials given into them by his Ministers, in which he had advized them of the dangers that threatned him, and desired their Assistance, that so at least, he might have had the Comfort to see the Concern they had for his Misfortune, which he had the more reason to expect, for that it must be fresh in their Memories, how in their greatest necessity he hazarded All for them, and preferred their Friendship before all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous conditions that were offered him. And therefore that he writes to their High and Mightynesses this Letter, That they may not think that he tamely Digested their Unjust Proceedings, or quitted the Obligation which his Alliance with them laid upon them; but, that as on his part he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies performed his Promises and Engagements, so he requires the like from them, or in default thereof, Satisfaction for the same, and reserveth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his Posterity, all the Right thereunto belonging.</hi> And indeed such has been their Perfidiousness, as to the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For, until then, it will be but a necessary Prudence in all those, with whom they seek and endeavour to be in a Foederal Amity, To ask them as <hi>Livy</hi> tells us the <hi>Roman Senator</hi> did the <hi>Carthaginian Ambassadors</hi> at the end of the second <hi>Punick War,</hi> when they came to Supplicate for a Peace, <hi>Per quos Deos Foe dus icturi essent; cum eos per quos ante ictum esset fefellissent?

Nor will I so far Reflect upon the Memory of that Prince, as to assign the Reasons why they came to Treat him with so much Superciliousness and Neglect, in that and other Concerns as they did; Seeing, besides the too great Encouragement they had to it from somthing in his own Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Temper, they were Embold'ned thereunto by the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Humour, that was then Predominant in many of his Subjects; and by the great and unaccountable Divisions which were arisen between those who were Stiled the Court and Country Factions. But, finding that his Royal Brother King <hi>James,</hi> who, on his Decease Rightfully Ascended the Throne was not a Prince that bore that careless respect to his own Honour, to the Reputation of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and to the Prosperity of his Subjects; as to digest the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned Affront, Injustice and Injury, with the Tameness that King <hi>Charles</hi> had done; and that he Carried not that Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency to his Peoples Welfare, and to the Traffick of the Nation; as for a private Gratuity, either to Connive at, or to Forgive a Wrong done to the Meanest of those under his Protection and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; And much less an O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And they took Hold of, and Encouraged the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange's,</hi> Ambition, whom Pride had disposed and prepared to despise and transgress all the Laws of God, and to Trample upon all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of Nations for the Gaining of a Crown; whose aspiring Haughtiness they resolved, in that Matter to Gratifie, in order to the Supporting themselves in the quiet Enjoyment, of what they had Treacherously, Unjustly and Rapaciously Seised. And, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they Lent unto, and Furnished him with a great part of their Army and Navy to Enable him, in Conjunction with the Traitors that were here at Home, to drive the King both from his Throne and Dominions. And, had not the People of England been at that Time strangely Infatuated by <hi>Bigottry,</hi> and made Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable by their Disloyalty, of all just and rational Thinking and Arguing; they might from the forementioned Depradation of the <hi>Dutch</hi> upon Us in the Business of <hi>Bantam,</hi> have very easily Foreseen and have naturally Concluded, how far they would Usurp upon Cheat and Rob us afterwards, when they should come to obtain one of their own Complexion and Mould, as well as of <hi>Belgick Birth,</hi> Education, Authority and Inheritance, to be chosen and Advanced to Reign over us. Nor is it unworthy of Remark, how far in this very matter his being a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> hath made him for these Seven Years last past, live in a continual forgetfulness of the Justice he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Nation, upon the Foot and Foundation of being Stiled our King. For whereas both the <hi>Belgick East-Endia Companies,</hi> and the <hi>States General</hi> had before the <hi>Revolution</hi> made and sent Overtures of giving Satisfaction, and had offered a Vast Summ of Money, in Expiation of that Crime, and for repairation of the Injury they had done us in the Case so often mentioned, we have not dared since to Pretend unto, or Claim the least Compensation for that Wrong, and much less to be so Presumptuous, as to Require to be Re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there again; Tho according to the Modern Methods of Merit, and the ways and means which recommended People most Distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively to the New Monarch; This <hi>Kingdom</hi> hath deserved as much of his Highness for Perjuring themselves, in order to Serve and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige him, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> have done by the Violation of their <hi>Treaties.</hi> Nay! whereas they broke their <hi>Alliances,</hi> upon the Motives of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106931:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we had both so good a Right unto, and were in so near and assured Prospect of recovering. So that all which, by Co-operating unto, and Concurring in the <hi>Revolution</hi> falls to <hi>Our</hi> Share, is the acquiring the Preheminence of a Double Character, Namely that of <hi>Fools,</hi> as much as that of <hi>Knaves,</hi> whilst our <hi>Belgick</hi> Neighbours are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to acquiesce in the single one of being <hi>Villains,</hi> and that chosen and submitted unto for their Gain, and not for their Loss. But the <hi>English</hi> being esteemed naturally a generous sort of People, may possibly think it but Congruous to that Opinion which Men have commonly had of them, that when they have so wilfully done all they can by their late Practices to forfeit Heaven, to Part with, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and Contemn the World also, and not to be like the Avaritious, Covetous <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are indeed willing enough to Renounce and Disclaim their Portion in the former, but then it is with a Proviso of Bartering it away for the later, which they take to be a Cunning and Wise Exchange.</p>
            <p>And, all Men must Grant that more is to be said in their Favour and for the Extenuation of their Folly, who would not choose Damnation, but for the Obtaining of Wealth, than can be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly said of those, that not only give themselves over to Eternal Wrath, <hi>gratis</hi>; but, who choose to Pay Dear for, it and to be Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of their Liberties and Estates, that they may Superarrogate for Hell; and be the better Entitled and have the more deserving Right to future Vengeance. Yet, I ought not to omit mentioning one thing which falls to our Lot even in this World; as the Reward of having Purchased the Name, Guilt and Infamy of Rebells, at the Expence of our Wealth and Traffick, and of all we were happy for at Home, and Reputable for Abroad; namely, That the <hi>Cap</hi> and <hi>Coat,</hi> which were heretofore only the Enclosure and Peculiar of a few; ought now and henceforward, to be the common <hi>Badges,</hi> Habit and Dress of most of the Kingdom, and especially of our <hi>Westminster Senators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To what I have already said, I will add in the next Place, that our Electing the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> King, hath not only Emboldned the <hi>Dutch</hi> both to Detain from us what they formerly Usurped, and to make fresh Encroachments upon us in all parts of the World, as well as in all things; but they plead<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For not to look nearer home. <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> can witness how they Triumph over and Insult us, in those Remote parts of the Universe; Representing us a Poor, Feeble and Dastardly People, over whom they have Constituted their <hi>Servant</hi> a <hi>Monarch,</hi> and thereby reduced us unto the Condition of a Province, Tributary unto and Depending on the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Now the Material part of this <hi>Harangue</hi> being too true, tho not in all the formal Circumstances in which they relate it, they thereupon not only themselves <hi>Hector</hi> us, and Withdraw and Alienate the Natives of those Countries from Valuing us as they were formerly wont to do; but having Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished our Esteem and Reputation among them; they do conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, Baffle and Worm us out of our <hi>Trade</hi> in all those Parts. And, as the taking one from among them to be our <hi>King,</hi> who had no rightful Title to be so; and his having been their, and still being no more than an honourable a Servant and dignifi'd Minister of that <hi>Republick</hi>; gives a Speciousness to what they say and alle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For tho under the Influence and Conduct of Madness, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and Folly, We have Invited and Advanced a <hi>Dutch</hi> Prince to be our King. Antecedently to our waiting the Time he might possibly in Right have come to have been so: Yet, it deserves our warmest and most angry Resentments, to hear that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> boast and glory in their having Imposed such a one upon us. Nor can we Vindicate our Selves from the Disgrace and Reproach, until We have both Renounced Him, and severely Chastised Them, for the Insolency of pretending to have done it. But alas! Should we Overlook this Allegation, which proceedeth merely from <hi>Boorish</hi> Pride: And their being bred in Mosses and Quagmires, there are many other Advantages accruing unto them, by the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment

For, as all the Priveledg appertaining to our Privy Council is only to Advise him; but not to Club with him in an Authoritative Power; so it Appears by too many modern <hi>Presidents,</hi> that few of those that are Members there, have the Integrity and Fortitude to Contradict him in what he has a Mind to Publish; and that his Pleasure is sufficient Reason with most of them to Concur, and with others not to be so rude and unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly as to Oppose him, but silently to Acquiesce. And should some be so Bold, as at any time to Express their Dissent; the most Part have that Dependance upon him, in respect of Pensions, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and other gainful Places, that he is alwaies sure to have the Majority of the Board to joyn with him in what he would have done.

that had <hi>Leases</hi> of and <hi>Tenant Right</hi> in them, from and under the late <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> to whose <hi>Father</hi> they were Judged a very Royal and Valuable Recompence, for the Noble Service He did, in Retrieving and Re-establishing the Government upon its Ancient Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Bottom; the Restoring the late <hi>King Charles</hi> to his Rightful and Hereditary Soveraignity, and for Re-estating these Kingdoms in the peaceable Possession of their Laws and Liberties: I say. that not being Satisfied with this ample Donative and Gift, He hath lately Begged of <hi>King William</hi> the other Lands I have Mentioned, and hath had them Granted unto Him without the least Regard to the Right of the <hi>Crown,</hi> the <hi>Property</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Laws of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or to the Interest which some <hi>Hundreds</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi> have more or less in them, Of which Acquisition on <hi>Benting's</hi> part and <hi>Alienation</hi> on <hi>William's,</hi> it will not be amiss to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large a little, that we may the better Discern, and come the more Sensibly under the Impression, both of the Despotical and Unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Absoluteness which the <hi>Usurper</hi> and his <hi>Minions</hi> Challenge over us; and of the Slavish State and Tenure we are Reduced unto, of having our <hi>Estates</hi> wrested from us and given away, to what Degree, Measure and Proportion one <hi>Dutch</hi> Man shall have the Impudence to Demand, and the other the Insolency and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny to Grant. For, if we look into the Extent and Largeness of this <hi>Grant</hi>; it is the Giving away no less than the Dominion and Property of <hi>Five Parts</hi> of <hi>Six</hi> of one <hi>Entire County</hi>; which as it is too great a Power and Inheritance for any <hi>Foreign Subject</hi> to Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess and Inherit: So it may hereafter prove Unsafe for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to have so Numerous a People made Subject unto, and Dependant on <hi>Him</hi>: Seeing it is of that vast Dimension, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Jurisdiction, that near <hi>Fifty</hi> Mean <hi>Lordships</hi> Hold of those <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi> and above <hi>Fifteen Hundred Freeholders</hi> are Tenants there to the <hi>King,</hi> and thereby Obliged unto <hi>Him</hi> under a particular <hi>Allegiance,</hi> besides that which they ow him in the Quality, and on the Foot of their being his Subjects. And it is so particular a Revenue Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Vested in the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> that it cannot Legally, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Customs, Constitution and Laws of <hi>England</hi> be Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from him. And therefore, upon the Creation of a <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> there are upon the Right of <hi>Tenure</hi> under him, and of <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy</hi> unto him, <hi>Mises</hi> of <hi>Eight Hundred Pounds</hi> payable to the said <hi>Prince.</hi> Nor is it unworthy of Remark, that in the Preamble of the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 21. <hi>Jac.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106931:13"/>
questioned, whether <hi>Charles the First</hi> that was then <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> whom the <hi>Statute</hi> Declares to have an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in both, tho under special Limitation, could <hi>Let</hi> or <hi>Rent Leases</hi> for <hi>Three Lives</hi> or any longer than his Own: And it is there Declared that he could not unless such <hi>Leases</hi> were Confirmed in <hi>Parliament.</hi> And the Reason is, Because upon want of a <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> that <hi>Inheritance</hi> becomes immediatly Vested in the <hi>Crown.</hi> So that if the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> himself, who has an <hi>Inheritance</hi> in that <hi>Revenue,</hi> cannot Grant <hi>Estates</hi> out of it for any longer than his own Life, without the Consent and Authority of <hi>Parliament</hi>; it demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively Follows, that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> who by the very <hi>Title</hi> that he possesseth the <hi>Crown,</hi> hath at most, only an Estate in it for his own Life; cannot Grant away and Alienate it, without the Consent of <hi>both Houses of Parliament</hi> Declared in and by a formal and express <hi>Statute.</hi> To which I will presume to add, that in Case of a Failure of a <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> it doth not settle in the <hi>Crown</hi> as a <hi>Propriety</hi>

And therefore in and by the very <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> II. which gave Power as well as Liberty for the Sale and Disposal of the <hi>Fee Farm Rents,</hi> there is a particular and express <hi>Exception</hi> of the

forementioned <hi>Welch Rents,</hi> tho there was then no <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> nor any Prospect that there would be one of that King's Body: which plainly Imported, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> took the <hi>Welch Revenue</hi> nor to be Alienable. Much less then can the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> that hath no <hi>hereditary Right</hi> to the <hi>Crown,</hi> but hath only Obtained it by the illegal and merely pretended Choice of the People, which is in other Terms, to have Usurped it; and who by the very <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Settlement,</hi> has but an Estate for <hi>Life</hi> in the Possession of it, Grant away the Inheritance and absolute <hi>Fee</hi> of the <hi>Principality</hi> of <hi>Wales.</hi> For, it is no less an Absurdity in <hi>Law</hi> to say that <hi>a Tenant for Life can Grant a Fee,</hi> than to say, <hi>that a Tenant in Fee can Grant no more than for a Life.</hi> But it appears that that tho the Power of a <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King,</hi> and of a <hi>legitimate Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> be Limited and Restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within the Precincts of <hi>Law</hi>; yet that the Power of an Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is boundless and unconfined. However, it is no way incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, that he who has violently Snatched his <hi>Father</hi> in <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Uncle's Crown from</hi> his Head, and Drove him from his Dominions, should also take upon himself to Grant away and Alienate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of his <hi>Cousin,</hi> and to Disinherit him of it. But why doth he not as well make <hi>Benting Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> as to give him the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of that <hi>Principality</hi>? Seeing he may as lawfully, and by the same Measures of Justice do the <hi>First,</hi> as he has done the <hi>Last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And no doubt but that as he hath Inclination to it, we may also live to see it done, if he can but once Emerge out of the present War, and thereupon bring over from the <hi>Continent,</hi> a numerous and triumphant <hi>Outlandish</hi> Army to support and protect him in his <hi>Usurpation</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and make us with Tameness and Decency wear our Chains. In the mean time, considering the Depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Poverty which thro a long and costly War, the Nation is already reduced unto, we may make this Reflection upon, and this Inference from the Prodigality of our <hi>Belgick King</hi> to his <hi>Dutch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> and to his <hi>Outlandish Janizaries,</hi> viz. that it can be done upon upon no other Design than to gratifie the <hi>Commo-nwealth</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> and to raise them to an Ascendency of Wealth and Power over us.

those <hi>Lands</hi> that are pretended to be <hi>forfeited,</hi> but those Ancient <hi>Inheritances</hi> that the Sovereign and Royal Family should Subsist upon, squander'd away upon little <hi>Foreigners,</hi> which were bred and heretofore accustomed to live upon the Fragments of their Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Table. Surely we may expect from the Justice and Wisdom of this Parliament; That before they Empty the Purses of those they Represent, they will enquire how the <hi>Revenues</hi> vested in the <hi>Crown</hi> are bestowed and applyed. For whatsoever <hi>Usurpers</hi> may dare to do, in wasting the <hi>Treasure</hi> and <hi>Inheritance</hi> of the <hi>Throne</hi> by Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng <hi>Palaces,</hi> and furnishing them splendidly at <hi>Loo,</hi> and for making Indorsements on the <hi>posteriour Parchments</hi> of those I have mentioned. Our Natural and Lawful Kings never used to demand Succours of their Subjects, till they had Exhausted themselves, and Disbursed their whole Revenue in the Service, and for the Protection of their People. Nor is there any thing more frequently met with, and better known in our <hi>Law,</hi> than that there have been <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi> of former Grants and Donations from the <hi>Crown,</hi> whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Nation has been Engaged in an expensive War, and the People have Groaned under large Taxes. And as this is the first <hi>Original</hi> of the Kind, that ever we had Experience of in this Kingdom, and for which we are indebted to <hi>Holland</hi>; so I hope, that after our Deliverance from a <hi>Belgick Prince.</hi> we shall have no <hi>Copy</hi> of it; or that any King hereafter will make Alienations of <hi>Lands</hi> from the <hi>Crown,</hi> when he is under Necessities of demanding Aids of his People, for his Support and Assistance in Wars wherein he may come to be engaged, To which I will only add, that under all those lavish and squandring Wasts and Consumptions of our <hi>Prince</hi> upon <hi>Dutch,</hi> for Closet and Chamber Services; he hath not only been Narrow and Parcimonious enough, but Niggardly and highly Ungrateful to the <hi>English</hi>; because it could not benefit <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Whereof among others, <hi>Talmash</hi> that is Dead, and old <hi>Danby</hi> who is Alive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are known Instances; tho they Served him both in Policy and War, and Contributed farther to his Exaltation to the Throne, and to the keeping him in it, than Thousands of his Country-men were capable of doing; and especially beyond what the <hi>Chocolate</hi> and <hi>Carpet</hi> Gentleman I have been speaking of had either Courage or Brain to Attempt. In recompence whereof, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of any Lands, and much less those of the <hi>Crown</hi>; the <hi>one</hi> was sent and abandoned to be Killed by the <hi>French,</hi> but <hi>Murthered</hi> by the <hi>English abroad</hi>; and the other is Forsaken, Given up and Sacrificed at <hi>

And where our Men behaving themselves with that wonderful Bravour that is natural to them, it is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly believed, even by our Enemies as well as by others, that a Defeat might have been given the <hi>French,</hi> if those <hi>Brittish Troops,</hi> which were so shamefully Deserted and treacherously Sacrificed, had been reinforced and succoured as they should have been. But as to the <hi>List</hi> which the House of <hi>Peers</hi> have demanded; it is too probable that <hi>King William</hi> will with the same Regardlesness
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106931:16"/>
both to Truth and to his Honour, endeavour to <hi>Sham</hi> them off with a false and imperfect Account of those <hi>Officers,</hi> as he hath ventured to do the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> in the <hi>State of the War</hi> he hath caused lay before them of the <hi>Quota's</hi> of the several <hi>Confederates</hi> for the Year 1696. if their <hi>Lordships</hi> will have the Tameness to sit down with, and acquiesce in it, without farther Examination and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. But to proceed; It may not be amiss to observe, how that in order that none of those whom he hath already <hi>Mustered,</hi> in order to this future Design; or of whose Service he thinks himself sure, when the time arrives of Accomplishing it, may in the Interim lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and decay in their Zeal towards the Enterprize, he loseth no opportuni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y of placing Marks of his Favour and Kindness upon them; tho it be sometimes to the Forfeiture of his Discretion, and prove the giving too early an <hi>Alarm</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> of the lurking and malicious Intentions which he entertains for us. So that when he Addressed his <hi>Parliament</hi> on <hi>Nov.</hi> 23. last, he could not omit Recommending his Muster'd and Regimented <hi>Hugonots</hi> to their Care and Supply; tho he did not think those many Thousands of Starving <hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Orphans,</hi> whose <hi>Husbands</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> perished in his Service, worth the being mentioned to them for Relief. And much less had he the Justice and Goodness to desire their Aids and Supplies, in behalf of those many once Wealthy and Trading Families, that are since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution reduced to extream Poverty, by his pursuing his concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Measures with <hi>Holland,</hi> for the ruining of our Trade; and thro the Treachery as well as Neglect of the <hi>Commissioners</hi> of the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty,</hi> who Act by his Order and Instructions; and rather choose to Sacrifice the Kingdom, than in any thing to Controul his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Of whom, if the <hi>Parliament</hi> requireth not an exact and severe Account of all our Losses by Sea, and make both their Lives and Estates responsible for their Sloth and Infidelity in protecting our Commerce and Traffick, we shall have reason to think both the <hi>Houses,</hi> as well as the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of that <hi>Commission</hi>; engaged equally to hasten and see the Ruin of the Kingdom. Nor can any other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be given, save that which I have assigned, why <hi>King William</hi> should Address his <hi>Parliament,</hi> with that Concernedness he did, for a Benevolence to be granted to the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> at a time when the other Supplies he demanded will arise to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106931:16"/>
than ever it was in their own Country, but exceedeth as well as equalleth the State of our own People of Rank and Quality with them. For instead of <hi>Canvas</hi> and <hi>Sabotts,</hi> which used to be the Habit and Dress of many of them in <hi>France,</hi> they are now both <hi>Shod</hi> and <hi>Clad</hi> as decently and richly as the best of the <hi>English</hi> are; upon, as well as among whom they do Subsist. And in the place of feeding commonly upon <hi>Herbs,</hi> and only now and then upon <hi>Flesh,</hi> and that the <hi>Refuse</hi> of Markets, which was their Custom; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will now content them but the choisest Provisions that Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Poulterers can Furnish them with, and that in large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions also: Which also shews that while our Purses are almost emptied, theirs are become well filled since their Arrival hither, that they can be able to bear the Charges of living so splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly, as they are now known to do.</p>
            <p>But it shews the Mean and Contemptible Opinion this <hi>Dutch Prince</hi> has of the Understanding and Wisdom of an <hi>English Parliament,</hi> otherwise he would not in the forementioned Particular have Treat-them as so many <hi>Fops,</hi> that are to be Bubbled and Cullyed out of their Own, and the Nations Mony: And indeed he hath had Just cause given him to account the Generality of the People of <hi>England,</hi> to be no less <hi>Fools</hi> than in Subserviency to his Ambition they have discovered themselves to be <hi>Knaves.</hi> And it is but Just, that upon his finding them to be People of so little Conscience towards <hi>King James,</hi> he should in Reference to his own Concernments, Esteem and Treat them as People both of as little Wit and Honesty. And this I dare Avouch, as having had it from those that are Conversant with his <hi>Privadoes,</hi> and with such as are upon his Secrets, Namely, that he looks upon most of the <hi>English</hi> as no better than <hi>Rogues</hi> and <hi>Traytors</hi>; and as he knows no difference in this Point betwixt <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory,</hi> so he Resolveth to Treat them all equally and alike, if he can but once put an end to this Present War. And what we may then Expect from him answerable to those fine Characters he is pleased to give Us, may be easily guessed by the Murder of <hi>Glenco,</hi> and so many other <hi>Innocents</hi> as were there <hi>Massacred</hi> by his <hi>Express Order</hi> and <hi>Command,</hi> after having had all Assurances given them by those in Commission under him of their Protection. Nor can we after that Treacherous and Bloody President question the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we are to meet with from this <hi>Dutch Prince's</hi> Cruelty and Malice, as soon as he hath his <hi>Hugonots</hi> here, and his <hi>Outlandish Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> from Abroad in a readiness, and all Mustered together upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106931:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Spot to Execute his Commands. And as his <hi>Outlandish Troops</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad have such Officers Commanding them, who will as readily put in Execution all his Barbarous and Inhumane Orders, as well as those Degenenerate Natives, <hi>Hill, Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Glenlion,</hi> &amp;c. Did that which was sent down to Require and Authorise the Massacre in <hi>Scotland, Anno</hi> 1691. So We have little reason to believe otherwise, than that the <hi>French</hi> and pretended <hi>Hugonot Schombergh,</hi> whom in derision of the Nation and in Contempt of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Peers,</hi> he hath Advanced to be <hi>General</hi> over all the <hi>Forces</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> will be forward enough both to employ such of them as he can Debauch to Perpetrate a Cruelty, and to Instigate and to make use of his <hi>Refugee</hi> Country-men, to Concur and Assist in Inslaving Us, and to Cut our Throats, if we will not Tamely Submit whensoever the time comes, that such a Work is Seasonable to be put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.

Nor is it unworthy of Remark; that whereas whilst they were drawing our <hi>Bullion</hi> and <hi>Coyn</hi> from us, and in order to get most of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Silver of <hi>England</hi> into their possession, and have it lodged in their Country, they willingly paid and allowed <hi>Three</hi> and <hi>Forty</hi> of their <hi>Skillings</hi> as the Equivalent of <hi>one Pound Sterling</hi> of ours, and gave our Soldiers so much readily in Exchange for it; that now having gained and engrossed the greatest part of our <hi>Mony,</hi> and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that what we continue to remit in <hi>Specie</hi> at present, is not out of Choice but upon Necessity, they have sunk the value of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to <hi>Eight</hi> and <hi>Twenty</hi> of their base <hi>Skillings,</hi> which is the most they have given of late, and will give no more at present for <hi>One Round Sterling</hi> of ours. Which being less by near a <hi>third part</hi> than what they gave in exchange for it before, is an incredible Damage to us, and a vast Gain to them at our Loss and Expence. And which villainous Depradation of theirs upon us, cannot without our utter Impoverishment and Ruin be much longer suffered or connived at. To which may be added, that since the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing and Clipping of our <hi>Silver Coyn</hi> which we are indebted to the <hi>Revolution</hi> for, and which had never befaln us in the degree it hath, but thro the ill Administration of our <hi>Dutch</hi> Prince, who is glad of and encourageth all the Methods, that may render us poor and make us despicable: The <hi>Hollanders</hi> will either receive none of our clipt Mony, tho it is in a manner all that is left current in the Kingdom; or if they do receive any of it, it is only in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to the intrinsick Value, and not according to the Rate that it doth pass for here, and hath done for a great while; So that if any of that Mony be sent over, either in payment to our Soldiers, or come to be carried abroad upon other occasions, the <hi>Dutch</hi> will take it but for a <hi>Moyety</hi> of what it commonly and universally goes for here. And yet in this very Interim, while they either wholy refuse the taking our clipt Mony, or depress the Value of it to half what it now passeth for in <hi>England</hi>; our poor Soldiers beyond Sea, are forced to take their base <hi>Skillings,</hi> and other of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based Mony, at what Rates they are pleased to make them current, tho not worth half of it with respect to their intrinsick Value.

and the <hi>Magazines,</hi> upon which the Confederate Army should Subsist, turneth all to the profit and account of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and is improved by them to their Gain and Advantage.

For as <hi>Namur</hi> is the only Conquest since the Commencement of this War in <hi>Flanders,</hi> that has been obtained over the <hi>French,</hi> so it is but a recovery of what the <hi>Confederates</hi> had lost during the present War, and not a new Acquisition. And as it has cost infinitely more in Men and Treasure, than it and all the dependencies upon it are worth; so these three Kingdoms who contributed most to the taking of it, and had more of the Blood of their Men spilt and more of their Treasure and Ammunition expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and wasted in the Winning of that City, than any one of all the <hi>Confederates,</hi> have Reapt nothing by it but the enlarging the <hi>Barrier</hi> of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the putting a strong and well fortified City into their power and possession, to make them more Insolent unto and Encroaching upon their <hi>Allies.</hi> And when I Consider the Customs of the <hi>Spartans</hi> who had an Order that when any of their <hi>Generals</hi> compassed his Designs by <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Treaty,</hi> he should Sacrifice an <hi>Ox</hi>; but when by <hi>Force and Bloodshed,</hi> only a <hi>Cock.</hi> I think that our many late <hi>Bonfires</hi> and <hi>Illuminations,</hi> and especially our prodigal and foolish Expences in <hi>St. James's Square,</hi> were ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous as well as wastful Consumptions. For as the distinct Values of those Oblations of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> do shew us (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Judgment of <hi>Plutarch</hi>) how much they preferred the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of calm and sober Councils, before those of Force and Strength, so there was more cause for Lamentations for the many and brave Men that had been lost before the Town and Castle of <hi>Namur,</hi> e'er they fell into our hands, (and which in all probability, will with less Cost be speedily Snatch'd from us again) than of vain, childish and expensive Triumphs for the gaining them. But to omit this, that which I am to represent and display is, that the <hi>City
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106931:23"/>
Castle</hi> which were gained at the Price and Cost of so much <hi>English</hi> Blood and Treasure, are now Consigned over to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and stand Mortgaged to them for the Repayment of what they have laid out and disbursed in this War; which seeing there is no likelihood that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ver the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will be in a condition to Reimburse them; that Town is consequently become a part as well as an enlargement of their Territories and is the Addition of an <hi>Eighth Province</hi> to the former <hi>Seven.</hi> Yea out of Kindness to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and Disaffection to us; our <hi>Belgick</hi> Prince is so frugal of their Treasure, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of that of this Kingdom, that much of the <hi>Charges</hi> necessary for Repairing the <hi>Fortifications</hi> of <hi>Namur</hi> is born by us, and our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remitted and transported to Defray them. Which is such a bubbling of this Kingdom; that those most engaged in King <hi>William's</hi> Interest, cannot avoid Resenting it with Indignation. And as this new Acquisition which our <hi>Dutch</hi> King hath gained them, at the price of our blood and bones, as well as of our Mony, gives them a stronger <hi>Barrier</hi> than they had, and a new and large Jurisdiction, so it not only opens a Traffick to them with <hi>France,</hi> in time of War as well as of Peace; but delivers the <hi>Hollanders</hi> from a Necessity of depending upon <hi>Brussels,</hi> or upon any <hi>Spanish</hi> Towns, for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their Trade: Seeing by being possessed of <hi>Namur,</hi> they can supply both <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and carry home what they want from thence, without being under the necessity of allowing the Intervention of others in the management of their Trade, or of suffering others either to intercept them in it, or to make profit by it thro Exchange: So that while the <hi>English</hi> and others Fight, they do only Win; and the Lives of our Men are no farther valuable with our <hi>Belgick</hi> King, than as they serve to purchase Power and Opulency to the <hi>Dutch.</hi> For tho we be made use of as the <hi>Jackall</hi> to hunt the Prey; yet we are not permitted to have the least Share in it. And therefore whosoever have cause to be weary of the War, and to groan under the Consumptions and Desolations that attend it, they have not; and thence it is that in kindness to them, but in hatred to us, our <hi>Belgick</hi> King labours all he can, both by persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and by Authority to foment and keep it up, and resolves to do so untill he hath render'd them so opulent and powerful, and us so necessitous, despicable and weak, that we must be contented (because we will not remain in a Condition to hinder it) to be Slaves to him, and Tributaries to the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>

And the Ways, Means, and Methods in and by which it might have been done, are both so various and plain, That had there not been a Conjunction of Malice in King <hi>William,</hi> and of Treachery in our Senators towards <hi>England,</hi> it would not have escaped the being undertaken, persued and effected long ago. For why might not we with as much Ease, and with more Justice, have carried all the Provisions from hence for the subsisting the Confederate Army, or at least our own Troops, and those of other Nations under our pay, as that the <hi>Dutch</hi> should have the Privilege of furnishing it, and to be encouraged as well as suffered to go away with the Gain? Nor can any other Reason be assigned of the Conduct we have been under in this matter, but that <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> intends to bring us first to Beggary, and then into Thraldom; and that too many among our selves are through Folly and Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very willing both to assist and justify him in the effecting of it. Had we not Ships enough (as I am sure we had before we lost so many Thousands of them, as we have done since the Revolution, and the Commencement of this War which was the unhappy Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of it) to have carried over to <hi>Flanders</hi> our <hi>Grain, Butter</hi> and <hi>Cheese, Iron, Bread,</hi> and all things else that are necessary unto, or consumable by an Army, but that the buying of all those here, and the transporting them thither, should in a manner be given up and entirely consigned into the hands of the <hi>Dutch?</hi> Whence we are justly become the Derision and Contempt of the World, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stored and furnished (without purchasing of other Nations) with all the Productions either of Art or Nature that an Army

can need or use, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> having scarce any thing of their own Growth, and little of their own Manufactures, to answer the Occasions and Exigences of so vast a military Body; yet that they should engross to themselves the supplying them with all they want, and we not only tamely connive at it, but like People who have lost their Senses, and forfeited their Understandings, as well as abandoned the Care of their Country do approve it. With what facility might it have been stipulated and provided for at our first entrance into the <hi>Confederacy,</hi> or retrieved and recovered to us since, upon renewing of <hi>Alliances</hi> with those whom we are become enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to assist in this War, that all those Supplies necessary for Troops which <hi>England</hi> could afford should be applied to that end; and that as they should be transported by none but our selves, so they should be expended and laid out not only upon our own Troops, towards the saving the Remission of Money, but taken off from us, and accepted by our <hi>Allies</hi> in lieu of those vast Sums we have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursed upon them. Nor will ever <hi>England</hi> vindicate it self from the Dishonour and Ignominy brought upon it, in that during all this time wherein we have been wasting our Men and Treasure to defend the <hi>Dutch</hi> Barrier, and protect the Provinces of others, and to make Conquests for them, we should never have contracted for a <hi>Port,</hi> where we might <hi>unload</hi> what we pleased towards the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Uses and Ends, without being liable to the Payment of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, or any other Duties of that kind which use to be exacted.

For as that great Heroine, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did, upon her assisting the <hi>Dutch</hi> with a very few Troops in comparison of what we now do, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with and obtain of them the <hi>Brill, Flushing</hi> and <hi>Ramekins,</hi> to be put into her hands as <hi>Cautionary Towns,</hi> not only that she might thereby oblige them to a more firm dependency upon her, and tie them to the better observation of their <hi>Alliances,</hi> and secure unto herself the Reimbursment of some part of the Treasure which she expended in protecting them; but that she might always be in a Condition, and have it in her own Power, to reinforce, relieve, succour and supply, those Troops that she sent them for their aid and defence, according as their should be occasion, and as she should judg to be at any time needful for the Honour of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and for the Safety, Commerce and Reputation of her Subjects. So <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> upon the Assistance of <hi>Six thousand</hi> Men which he gave the present King of <hi>France, An.</hi> 1657. did not only by a ratified <hi>Treaty</hi> take care and provide that what <hi>Ports</hi> and

               <hi>maritime Towns</hi> should be won from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by the joynt and confederate Forces of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> should be resigned unto him, and given up to the Possession of the <hi>English</hi>; but in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of that Stipulation he had <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> upon its being taken from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> put into his hands. Yea, the late King <hi>Charles,</hi> who in the <hi>Alliances</hi> he made, was not thought by many to be so regardful of the <hi>Interest</hi> of his Kingdoms as he might have been, did in the <hi>Treaty</hi> he entred into with <hi>France</hi> against the <hi>Dutch, An.</hi> 1671.

Whereas this <hi>Dutch</hi> Prince, whom we have been so unkind to our selves, as well as disloyal to the King, as to set over us, hath not in all the many <hi>Alliances</hi> which he hath entered into with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Monarchs and States, notwithstanding the numerous Troops and vast Treasure supplied by us to their Aid and Defence, made the least Provision for any one Advantage to accrue to these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, should the War wherein we are united and embarked prove successful.

Underminers and Supplanters. Nay, he disdains to acquaint the two <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> with those <hi>Treaties,</hi> when they humbly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress him concerning the doing it: And instead of laying those <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances</hi> before them in the plain and ratified Draughts, he either Shams them off with general, imperfect and blind Accounts; and that done with the unsincerity and regardlesness of Truth, natural to a <hi>Dutch man,</hi> of which the whole course of his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions with, and towards this People, since he became unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously possessed of his <hi>Father in Law</hi> and <hi>Uncles Crown,</hi> is one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted and continued Evidence; or else he ridicules and bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them with false and counterfeit <hi>Copies</hi>; in which as some things are disguised so others are not expressed, though he hath concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them formally with his <hi>Confederates,</hi> and especially with the <hi>Dutch.</hi> And I dare affirm, That of all the <hi>Branches of the State of War</hi> in reference to the Year 1696. which he hath caused to be delivered into them, there is none of them true, genuine and just.

and Forty <hi>Czars</hi> in his Belly. And could he but once prescribe terms to the <hi>Monarch</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> he would soon trample upon all the Laws of these Kingdoms, and tread upon our Necks: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the Shapes and Figure of sometimes an <hi>Almansor,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>Gusman,</hi> that he now puts on and seeks to appear in, he would then manifest himself a <hi>Caligula,</hi> a <hi>Nero,</hi> or according to the Title lately bestowed upon him a <hi>Galienus Redivivus,</hi> having already furnished himself with more than one <hi>Verianus.</hi> But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving said enough upon the Head of which I have been discoursing, it is now time to advance to another.</p>
            <p>In the next Place then I shall proceed to a more particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view and representation of their <hi>Invasions, Rapines</hi> and <hi>Depradations</hi> committed upon our <hi>Trade,</hi> than those I have hitherto unfolded and laid open. Nor will it require any great Enlargement, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Men do experience and feel it, though some may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the several and particular Ways and Methods in which it hath been done. Nor shall I here repeat what I have already both insinuated and detected concerning the Decay that is brought upon our <hi>Trade,</hi> and the final Destruction that threatens it, as well through the <hi>Clipping</hi> and <hi>Embasement</hi> as through the <hi>Transportation</hi> of our <hi>Coin</hi> to other <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Uses</hi> then those of <hi>Commerce,</hi> and in much greater Quantities than Traffick could have ever required its being carried abroad for. Though all the Misery and Mischief that do by these means befal and overtake us, are all chargeable upon, and to be laid at the Door of our <hi>Dutch</hi> King: Seeing that of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting it has been the natural and unavoidable effect of his ascent to the Throne, and of the War that thereupon he engaged us in, and especially of those ways which he has designedly chosen and persued in support of it. And then as to the <hi>Clipping</hi> and <hi>Embasing</hi> our Mony, none can be reasonably accused either of causing or conniving at it but the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who has occasioned and encouraged it by his weak and improvident Administration. For both these Practices, which do eventually and in the Effects of them prove so ruinous to the Kingdom, having obtained in no other <hi>Reigns</hi> in any proportion and degree to what they have done in <hi>his,</hi> as it is commonly stiled, they must consequently be resolved into some Neglect, Weakness or Treachery in his Admin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stration, whereof no other Reigns were guilty or accusable. Nor will it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him to have it alledged, That more have been executed for those Crimes, since his usurping of the Throne, than were in an
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106931:26"/>
Age before: Seeing though some of the little and indigent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whom necessity tempted to it, and which necessity he brought upon them, have been condemned and executed; yet your <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths</hi> and <hi>Refiners,</hi> who both bought the <hi>Clippings,</hi> and who at mighty Gain furnished them with broad Mony for continuing the Crime, have not only escaped Prosecutions, which by Law they deserved; but divers of them have been the special Favourites and Confidents of the Government. And to mention but one of many, I will be bold to say the hanging of <hi>Evans</hi> the Goldsmith, who infinitely more deserves it, for melting down and carrying abroad our <hi>Coin</hi> to satisfy his Covetousness, and make Profit by what was our <hi>milled</hi> Mony, than any of the <hi>Clippers</hi> and <hi>false Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> have done, would have given greater check unto, and have been a more effectual Remedy, even of the Crimes of these <hi>later,</hi> than all the Convictions and Executions for Offences of that kind since the <hi>Revolution,</hi> which we have seen but have found no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by. But instead of that, he hath been honoured and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by our <hi>Dutch</hi> Bestower of Titles, and Disposer of Places, to be both a <hi>Knight</hi> and a <hi>Commissioner</hi> of the <hi>Excise</hi>; though a Fellow void of all Merit, and destitute of good Sense, and whom only Knavery, Impudence, and the Emptying the Kingdom of our <hi>Silver,</hi> by carrying it to <hi>Holland</hi> to enrich the <hi>Dutch,</hi> have entitled to his Master's Favour. And I crave Liberty to say <hi>en passant,</hi> though it may seem alien to the subject, That I have often wondered why our Kings and Parliaments should fall upon so ineffectual a Remedy of those Crimes, as the making them <hi>Capital</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to prove in a Nation, where Men are sunk into so much Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion and Atheism; and which the many Villanes attending and wrapt up in the <hi>Revolution</hi> have encreased and strengthned as to dread Death less than Poverty, and to chuse Damnation as well as Hanging and Quartering rather than want Supplies for the Feeding and for the Maintenance of their Lasciviousness and Luxury. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when our Mony was both Pure and <hi>Sterling,</hi> and of full <hi>Weight,</hi> as it was generally at the <hi>Revolution,</hi> the bare imposing and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>Mulct</hi> of <hi>Five</hi> or <hi>Ten Pounds</hi> upon every one that should have been found offering either <hi>Clipt</hi> or <hi>False</hi> Mony to another, would have deterred all Men from venturing upon it, and obvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both the forementioned Crimes, and likewise the woful Effects of them. And possibly it would be no ill Policy to do in this Case as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did in that of <hi>Theft,</hi> which when they thought
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106931:27"/>
not fit to prevent and hinder by punishing the <hi>Thieves,</hi> they effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually suppressed it, by rendering those liable to a considerable Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty that should have any Thing <hi>stolen</hi> from them. So may be the inflicting of a <hi>Mulct</hi> upon every one that should take either <hi>light</hi> or <hi>base</hi> Mony, would soon cause that there would be no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers of it, by reason there would be none found so unkind and unjust to themselves as to receive it. But to return from this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression; I do say that the <hi>Dutch,</hi> besides all the Injuries they have done us, and the Spoils they have committed upon us, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to our <hi>Trade</hi> in the forementioned Methods which I have been displaying, they have also in divers other Ways, and in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Instances, either craftily supplanted, or directly invaded, and forceably assaulted us in our <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Traffick</hi> since the late <hi>Revolution</hi>; which I shall presume now to lay open, as far as the brevity of this Discourse will allow, and shall discover how and wherein they have done so. And I shall begin with the Advantage they have had of protecting their own Trade, and of exposing and leaving ours open to be ruined, by reason of that small and unequal <hi>Quota</hi> and Proportion of <hi>Ships</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> that in respect of our much greater Number of Ships of that kind they supply and furnish to the forming and constituting the <hi>Confederate</hi> and <hi>United Fleet</hi> of both Nations; which is the more remarkable in that their Number of <hi>Land Forces</hi> is not much encreased towards the support of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent War, above what it use to be in time of Peace. Yea, it is hardly so great now as then, if we consider that all the <hi>Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> raised in the Province of <hi>Namur,</hi> and on the <hi>French Conquests,</hi> go for the Ease of their Establishment; and that the vast <hi>Sums</hi> spent in <hi>Flanders</hi> by the whole <hi>Confederate Army</hi> become<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in <hi>Holland.</hi> However it bears no proportion with ours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>War</hi> for the <hi>Year</hi> 1696. which as the Earl of <hi>Renelagh</hi> by King <hi>William</hi>'s Order gave it into the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Decemb.</hi> 3. amounts to 87440 Men; whereas if it were not to defend the Provinces of these, stiled our <hi>Allies,</hi> a very few For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would be sufficient for our Occasions at home, if it should not be found needless to have any at all: Whereas they in the times of the profoundest Peace are seldom without <hi>Fifty thousand Men,</hi> to which their supernumerary Addition now is but inconsiderable, if what I have said be well considered; and provided that we also observe, that divers of those Troops reckoned into their <hi>Quota</hi> are upon <hi>English</hi> Establishment, and paid with our Mony. Indeed if
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106931:27"/>
we had charged our selves with furnishing the whole <hi>marine</hi> Power, both for us and them, and stood thereby excused for affording any <hi>Land Forces</hi> to be employed in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or elsewhere, upon any part of the Continent, I should not have blamed the Conduct of requiring a few <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>War</hi> from them, yea should not have much complained if they had been acquitted from the yielding any: Seeing such a <hi>Stipulation</hi> and Agreement between us and them could not have been much to the Prejudice either of the Kingdom or of Trade, farther than as it involved us in an unnecessary and unjust War, meerly to gratify the Ambition of our <hi>Dutch</hi> King, and to hinder the Return of our Legal and <hi>Rightful Sovereign.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause otherwise, as it would have been agreeable to our Interest, both as we are an <hi>Island</hi> and a <hi>Trading</hi> Nation; so it would not only have proved a means of keeping all our Mony at home, and of the having had it to <hi>circulate</hi> among our selves, but we should thereby had Treasure enough to have rigged out a Royal Navy superior to the marine Power of <hi>France,</hi> and to have equipped and maintained more than a sufficient Number of Men of War as <hi>Crui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers</hi> and <hi>Convoys</hi> to have protected our Trade. But to be first at the vast Expence we have been in raising and maintaining so great an <hi>Army</hi> on the <hi>Continent,</hi> meerly for the Benefit of others and not our own, and then to <hi>equip</hi> and set out double the <hi>Quota</hi> that the <hi>Dutch</hi> have towards the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nstituting the <hi>Confederate Fleet</hi> of both Nations, was plainly to disable our selves from having that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Cruisers</hi> and <hi>Convoys</hi> as is necessary to be kept at Sea during the present War, against so potent an Enemy as the King of <hi>France</hi> and his <hi>Subjects</hi> are upon that Element. Nor was this concerted between our <hi>Belgick</hi> Prince, and his beloved <hi>Dutch,</hi> upon any other Motives, or to other Ends, but that we might be put out of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of safe-guarding our Coasts, and protecting our trading Vessels; whilst the <hi>Dutch,</hi> through furnishing a small <hi>Quota</hi> to the the <hi>General Fleet,</hi> are left in a Condition to employ the rest of their <hi>marine</hi> and naval Strength in securing and protecting their Traffick. And the Event hath fully answered the Design, in that while we, by furnishing so many Ships of <hi>War</hi> to the <hi>Royal Navy,</hi> did leave our selves destitute of such a Number of Ships of War, as might in the Quality of <hi>Cruisers</hi> and <hi>Convoys</hi> in all Seas as well as in the Chanel have covered and defended our <hi>trafficking Vessels</hi>; and as we have in consequence thereof lost above 4000 <hi>trading Ships</hi> to the empoverishing of the Kingdom, as well as of many Families that

were before the <hi>Revolution</hi> opulent and rich, while the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the mean time, through their furnishing so small a Proportion of <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>War</hi> to the <hi>General Fleet,</hi> and being thereby provided of the larger number of Men of War, as well to defend their <hi>Merchant Ships</hi> as to guard their Coasts, have not s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that if the Parliament (as I have formerly hinted) do not make those Persons accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the <hi>Losses</hi> at Sea, which Merchants and in and through them the Kingdom hath sustained, all thinking Men will have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe, That those they have chosen to be their <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> do take pleasure in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And indeed, by the whole Management of publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs for near these <hi>Seven Years,</hi> both in Parliament and out of it, those called to sit in the <hi>Senate,</hi> as well as those employed in civil <hi>Offices,</hi> have been doing to the Nation, as the Daughters of <hi>Peleus</hi> did by the Advice of <hi>Medea</hi> to their aged Father, whom they hackt in pieces, in hopes that by her <hi>Magick</hi> they should have restored him both to Life and Youth again. For through the Influence of <hi>Dutch</hi> Councils, and the Administration of a <hi>Belgick</hi> King, and by this wheedle, and under pretence of rescuing us from Popery and Slavery, of banishing Tyranny, securing Liberty, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us an opulent and glorious Nation, they have empoverished us beyond Remedy and Retrieve; and have brought us so near to the brink of Vassalage and Thraldom, that it will require more Vertue and Courage to prevent it, than we have much ground of hoping to find the generality of this debauched, rebellious and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal Generation endowed with.

But if it be in order to King <hi>William</hi>'s erecting a <hi>Citadel</hi> for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaving <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> it is to be hoped that the terrour of <hi>Bombs</hi> and <hi>Carcasses</hi> will not frighten <hi>English-men</hi> quietly to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render their Liberties and Properties, and tamely to put on and wear Chains. To all which might be further added the very small <hi>Quota</hi> which they furnish the <hi>Confederate Fleet</hi> are not only many times subsisted upon our Provisions and Stores instead of their own, and supplied with our naval Preparations, but in the Place of attending constantly upon the <hi>Flag,</hi> as they ought, many of those <hi>Ships</hi> of War are detached from the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and employed as <hi>Convoys</hi> to their trading Vessels: Which as it may at some time or other prove of fatal consequence to the Royal <hi>Fleet</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the whole Kingdom, so in the mean time they make their Profit by it, through the enlarging and securing their Traffick, while ours is narrowed and crippled for want of <hi>Cruisers</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys,</hi> and while such Merchant Ships as will venture upon Voyages are left exposed to be seised by <hi>French Privateers.</hi> But this being so warmly and judiciously represented by the ingenious Author of <hi>a Letter to a Gentleman elected a Knight of the Shire to serve in the present Parliament,</hi> I shall not farther enlarge upon it; especially, seeing Admiral <hi>Russel,</hi> who is now a Member of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> is able to give an ample and particular Account of it, and who for resenting it as became him, when lately <hi>Admiral</hi> in the

For as few can be ignorant, especially of Gentlemen and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, both of the Occasion and Design of these several <hi>Laws</hi>; so the whole Nation hath abundantly experienced all along since the making of them, what Profit and Advantage have thereby accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, first to Trade, and then to the Kingdom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut now, by the Insolency of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the Treachery of King <hi>William</hi> to this Nation, all those <hi>Laws</hi> have been slighted and violated by them, and the Care of having them observed and put in execution to us been <hi>neglected</hi> by <hi>him</hi>; which both on his part, and theirs, is in direct subserviency to make them powerful in Shipping and opulent in Wealth, and to render us Poor, Feeble and Weak. And as there is not one <hi>Branch</hi> of all these <hi>Laws,</hi> the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of which has not been practised by them, and connived at by their <hi>Country man</hi> on the <hi>English</hi> Throne; so they are, through his Encouragement and Protection, grown at last to that Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and arose to that Defiance of <hi>English</hi> Laws and common Justice, That <hi>Coffee house</hi> Tables have been furnished with printed and publick <hi>Advertisements</hi> of such and such <hi>Dutch</hi> Productions and Manufactures that were to be vended at Places there named in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> notwithstanding of their being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly prohibited by those Laws to be either imported into or sold in this Kingdom.

And therefore the next Attempt I charge them with is still more hainous, and done infinitely more to our disgrace, being not only an Invasion upon our <hi>Trade,</hi> but upon the <hi>Liberty</hi> of our Persons.

This they have practised for these <hi>Two</hi> Years past, only they are grown more rampant, tyrannous and oppressive this last than they were the former. For whereas in the Year 1694. they were contented with <hi>One</hi> Man out of <hi>Ten,</hi> or 15 <hi>Guilders</hi> in lieu thereof, and for his Ransom, they have in the Year 1695. required and taken a <hi>Man</hi> out of every Ship of ours that went into their <hi>Ports,</hi> though the Sailors were never so few, or else they have exacted 25 <hi>Guilders</hi> for the excusing and redeeming him from their Service. So that if it be but a <hi>Hoy,</hi> which is sailed with a Master, one Man, and two Boys, yet they demand <hi>One</hi>; and upon its being replied that the Vessel cannot be sailed if <hi>One</hi> be taken out, they pretend it a Condescention and Favour to compound at 25 <hi>Guilders</hi> for his being excused, which is <hi>Fifty Shillings</hi> of <hi>English</hi> Mony. Nor do any Ships escape without doing the one or the other, and for which they alledg their having King <hi>William</hi>'s Authority. And these Things they are so far from concealing, or seeking to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the Injustice and Criminalness of, by the necessity of their Condition, That they glory in it both in their <hi>Trackschuytes,</hi> and in all Places of Society and Concourse, as the Badg of their Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Triumph over us, and of our Subjection to them. The Method in which this Force and Hostility over us is practised is this, namely, before any <hi>Ship</hi> can be <hi>cleared</hi> at their <hi>Custom-house</hi> the Master must go to the Lords of the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> and bring from thence a Certificate to the <hi>Custom-house</hi> of having given a <hi>Man</hi> out of the <hi>Vessels Crew</hi> to their Service, or of having compounded at the Value I have mentioned for his Redemption. Surely it will not be unseasonable now to ask, whether we be in terms of <hi>Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or of <hi>Alliance?</hi> Seeing we are not treated by them in this as <hi>Friends,</hi> but as <hi>Enemies:</hi> Nay, it will be needful t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as much as they deal not with us as with a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>independent Nation,</hi> but as with a <hi>Province</hi> which they have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and brought into <hi>Vassalage.</hi> And if we be not <hi>Slaves,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main yet a free <hi>People,</hi> this Hostility in them ought to be hostily repelled by us: And in the Place of accounting them any longer our <hi>Confederates,</hi> we ought to esteem and take them for our <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and every where to assault them accordingly. And for our <hi>Belgick</hi> King to authorise the <hi>Dutch</hi> to do what I have mentioned, is to assume a Power over the Liberties and Persons of the People of <hi>England,</hi> which no <hi>Rightful King</hi> did ever pretend unto. For our Persons and Liberties being under the Custody of the Laws, no King can claim a larger Jurisdiction over them than what the Laws give him; unless he will renounce to govern by Law, and take upon him to rule Despotically. And the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> may with as good Right transplant all the People of <hi>England</hi> to the Deserts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or send them to work in the <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> as to authorise the <hi>Dutch</hi> to seise upon <hi>one</hi> Man that is either a native Subject here, or under the Protection of <hi>English Laws,</hi> to navigate either their Ships of War, or their Vessels of Commerce and Traffick. Nor has he any more Right to deprive me of my Liberty, save when, where, and in what Cases the Laws have declared me to have forfeited it, than I have to break into the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Closet at <hi>Kensington,</hi> and to snatch from thence the <hi>Testimonials</hi> of his <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But by these little sportful <hi>Preludiums</hi> of the young <hi>Cub,</hi> we may guess what we are to expect from the <hi>Animal</hi> when grown up to the full strength and vigour of a <hi>Tyger,</hi> or a <hi>Lion.</hi>

            <p>But the next Depradation and Invasion committed upon our <hi>Trade</hi> is more vilanous, and ought to be more provoking, as well as surprising, than any of the former; seeing it was neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed nor executed by meer Cunning and Fraud, nor upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of avowed Authority derived and received from King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> but which they perpetrated by open Force and direct Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Whereof though there may possibly be found divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, yet I shall only assign <hi>one,</hi> but which shall be of that hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Nature, that we need require no more, and ought hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth to think how to do our selves Right, and take our Revenge upon them. The Hostility and Violence which I mean is that committed by the <hi>Dutch</hi> upon the <hi>African Company</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in

By which fraudulent Means, and Language as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful of us, as it was false in it self, the <hi>Natives</hi> who are all a kind of unthinking <hi>Mob,</hi> and easily misled, as well through the Habitude and Dulness of their Understandings, as through the little Acquaintance and Knowledge which they have of the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Parts of the World, made an Insurrection against the <hi>English,</hi> and in Multitudes assaulted and attacked their <hi>Factory.</hi> But the <hi>Africans</hi> being no better than an undisciplined <hi>Rout,</hi> and not well furnished with the Materials and Utensils of War, and especially being unprovided with great Artillery, were easily repelled and beaten off by those of the <hi>English Factory</hi>; which the <hi>Dutch</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and being sensible that time would both asswage the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Passions of the <hi>Natives,</hi> and discover the Fraud by which they had hur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as these are some

of the blessed Fruits and Effects of the <hi>Revolution,</hi> so having by our departure from our Loyalty, lost together with our Vertue, our Honour, and our Concerns for the safety and welfare of our Country, these Encroachments, Rapines, and Robberies of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> are not only overlookt by most, tamely digested by all, but have a Merit and Sanctity ascribed to them by some of our Sycophant and Mercenary <hi>Clergy,</hi> under the Notion of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of our Gratitude paid to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> as our Deliverers from Popery and Slavery. And it is but Reason, That owing our Lives, Liberties and Estates to the Friendship and Bounty of their Assistance, when the Gospel and every Thing that is valuable in it self and dear to us was at Stake, they should at pleasure claim and exercise a Jurisdiction over them, and we be contented with a precarious Right in all that we are and have. For through the Bigottry of most, and the Treachery of a great many, it is now arrived at this, That even for a <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Peers</hi> to take upon them the representing the Decays and Sufferings of the <hi>Nation</hi> in point of Trade, is by your <hi>Salisbury Burnet</hi> thought worthy of being branded with the alarming and ignominious Name of <hi>Remonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> against the <hi>Government.</hi> But I will venture to say, That if speedy Remedies be not fallen upon and used by the <hi>Senate</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> for the relieving us from our Distresses and Miseries of that kind, that the forenamed mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>All I have further to add in reference to the damage done to the <hi>Trade</hi> of this Nation by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and of the Design which King <hi>William</hi> out of kindness to them has been promoting for the

Ruin and Subversion of our <hi>Traffick,</hi> shall be briefly to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and to reflect a little upon his erection of a <hi>Scotch African and East India Company,</hi> with such Immunities and Privileges as will prove destructive of the Trade of <hi>England</hi> to those Parts. Which <hi>Scotch Company,</hi> as it is established by a late <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> of that Kingdom, to which King <hi>William</hi> gave the enacting <hi>Fiat</hi> and Royal <hi>Sanction</hi>; so he did it without giving his <hi>English Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> or any other of this Nation, the least antecedent Notice of it, and much more without asking or taking their Advice about it, though a matter both of great Importance in it self, and of vast Consequence to the <hi>Trade</hi> of this Kingdom. Nor can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that the said <hi>Act</hi> for erecting of a <hi>Scotch Company</hi> was surrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiously obtained, or precipitately passed, without his Knowledg and Information of the Tenor of it: Seeing the <hi>Instructions</hi> were formed and digested here, and signed by <hi>him</hi>; which upon being sent down thither, gave occasion and encouragement there to make and enact such a <hi>Statute</hi> at this Juncture. And it is highly worthy of remark, That this <hi>Scotch Law,</hi> containing so many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual Privileges, and beneficial Concessions, as were never gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heretofore by any King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> should be made at a Season when the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is so loaded and depressed by late grievous <hi>Impositions</hi> and <hi>Taxes</hi> laid upon It, by several Laws since the <hi>Revolution,</hi> in order to the carrying on of the present War, and for the defraying the Charges of it. Nor is it concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, how after so many Discouragements given to the <hi>English East India Company,</hi> not only in refusing them an <hi>Establishment</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> but in Delaying for several Years to grant them a <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of their <hi>Charter</hi>; and thereby putting them both to vast <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses,</hi> through their being so long in soliciting of it, and the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them all that while naked and exposed to be undermined and supplanted by <hi>Interlopers,</hi> that this unwonted and exuberant <hi>Grace</hi> should be exercised to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were it not done upon the Influence of <hi>Dutch</hi> Councils, and in pursuance of Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures from <hi>Holland</hi> for the ruining the Trade of <hi>England.</hi> And whosoever considers the little respect, and the less affection which King <hi>William</hi> hath for the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation, and with what disdain and contempt he speaks o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106931:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was done upon the Motives, and in pursuance of foreign Councils. Not that I do envy the <hi>Scots</hi> any Favour that is shewed them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatsoever Inducements it be done; or that I blame the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> for what they have done in this particular, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the raising of the <hi>Genius,</hi> and encouraging the Industry of their People, to the pursuit of Trade; but what I would say is, That as King <hi>William</hi>'s Kindness to the <hi>Scots</hi> in this matter is to the apparent and visible Damage of the <hi>English,</hi> so it is morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that both the first overture of such an Establishment sprung from <hi>Belgick</hi> Councils, and that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s <hi>Instructions,</hi> which led that Parliament to such a <hi>Bill,</hi> and the Royal Assent gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thereunto by his <hi>Commissioner,</hi> upon which it is become a <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Statute,</hi> is all in order to encrease the Trade, and raise the Grandeur of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to depress and lessen the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> and thereby to weaken and impoverish the Kingdom. For as the <hi>Author</hi> of a Paper called, <hi>Some Considerations upon the late Act of the Parliament of</hi> Scotland <hi>for constituting an Indian Company,</hi> has with Candor and Ingenuity told us, Pag. 4. <hi>That the Original of that Design of settling a Company of Commerce for Strangers as well as for Scotch-men was not from</hi> Scotland, <hi>nor from hence, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from foreign Parts</hi>; which, as he there tells us, <hi>he had from good hands.</hi> So we have reason upon his Testimony to receive what he says, being so avowed a Patron of the Wisdom, Justice and Equity of the said <hi>Act.</hi> However it will not be amiss to unfold a little more distinctly, what he hath only obscurely and briefly insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In the doing whereof I must crave pardon for revealing a Secret committed to me in a private Conversation, and the rather because I have always valued my self upon an inviolable Fidelity toward all that have trusted me, and upon a tenacious Retentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and steddy Secrecy in reference to such Things as have been privately, and under the Notion of friendship conveyed to me. But where my Discretion has only been confided in, but neither my Honour nor my Conscience have been engaged, I do judg that I not only may, but that in Duty I ought to disclose what hath been, and is contrived and machinated, in order to divide and <hi>separate</hi> these <hi>two Kingdoms,</hi> and thereby to weaken if not ruin both of them: namely, That the <hi>Dutch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106931:32"/>
injured by the <hi>Hollanders</hi>; and thereupon may be provoked to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Reparation, and grow enraged to persue Revenge, they have therefore studied and concerted how to separate the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> the one from the other: And have proceeded so far therein, as in either of the foregoing Cases to have allowance for it from <hi>Willam</hi>'s <hi>Dutch Minions</hi> and <hi>Confidents,</hi> which is equivalent to the having it from himself. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they have treated with some of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation about it, whom they have not only gratified with Mony to make them pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but have given them assurance, That there shall be <hi>Three or Four hundred thousand Pound</hi> ready, to bribe and gain the chief and most leading Men of that Kingdom to comply with this Design, at what time it may be needful for the <hi>Dutch</hi> to have it put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. In pursuance whereof they have started the Project of a <hi>Scotch East India Company,</hi> which that Nation had all the reason in the World to take hold of, and they will be thought not only kind but just to themselves in gaining this Grant and Concession from the Crown, for their coming into the Interest of this <hi>Man</hi> at a Season when their adhering to their Rightful King, as was their Duty to have done, would have made this Man's Title very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and precarious, and would have rendered his Abode in, and Reign over these Kingdoms of a very short Duration and Continuance. Nor will it escape the recommending the Wisdom of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation to Posterity, That whilst the <hi>English,</hi> who have lavished away and wasted near 40 Millions <hi>sterl.</hi> upon their <hi>Dutch</hi> King, have not obtained one Beneficial National <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> in recompence of all that they have so foolishly and prodigally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed for the support of his Government; the <hi>Scots,</hi> by taking the Benefit of his foreign Inclinations and Affections, have gained something that may be useful to them and their Off-spring. It were high Presumption in me to undertake to declare how far the <hi>Scots</hi> Act is directly calculated and adapted to the Prejudice of <hi>England,</hi> seeing that were to invade the Province, and to break into the Rights of both Houses of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who being extreamly sensible of, and having maturely weighed it, have not only the Integrity and Fortitude to represent it by a solemn Address to King <hi>William,</hi> but who in their profound Wisdom are considering both how to obviate the Evils which that Law threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the Traffick of the Kingdom, and how to settle the Trade of the Nation upon such a Foot and Bottom as may give Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106931:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to it, and make it revive and flourish. I do know that all which the two Houses are to expect from their <hi>Belgick</hi> King in answer to their Address is, That he was surprised into the passing of the <hi>Scotch Act,</hi> which I hope all Men will believe he as truly was, as he pretends to have been into the <hi>Massacre</hi> of <hi>Glenco,</hi> for the perpetration whereof he gave several positive and reiterated Orders: For <hi>Fides Belgica,</hi> and <hi>Fides Punica,</hi> are equivalent; and the Word of a <hi>Carthagenian Senator</hi> or <hi>General,</hi> and that of a <hi>Dutch Prince,</hi> are of the same alloy and stamp. But as the <hi>Scots</hi> are a wiser Nation, having obtained the passing of such a Law, than upon any Consideration whatsoever to be prevailed upon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal or to part with it, either to gratify King <hi>William,</hi> or to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and accommodate this Kingdom; so no Man in the present Circumstances in which <hi>England</hi> is, will judge it the Interest of this Nation to quarrel with <hi>Scotland,</hi> or too much to rally and vex the <hi>Scots</hi> upon this Account. Not but that there are many ways and means within the Circle and under the Power of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> by which they may not only vent their Anger against those <hi>English</hi> that have subscribed to the <hi>Scots East India</hi> Stock, but make <hi>Scotland</hi> it self first uneasy and then enraged. But as this were to spend their Resentment and Anger where they ought not, seeing all their Indignation ought in Justice and Equity to fall no where but upon <hi>Kensington</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi>; so it were to make themselves Tools in promoting the Design of separating these two Kingdoms, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> contrived this Act for the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of the forementioned Company as a Foundation of, and a Path unto. For should they at <hi>Westminster,</hi> as they easily may, make all those <hi>English</hi> that have put in their <hi>Shares</hi> into the <hi>Scots Stock</hi> pay <hi>quadruple Taxes</hi> to the War, which they are upon Ways and Means to support; this would but make many wealthy and industrious Merchants to forsake <hi>England,</hi> and retreat to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where they will be heartily welcomed, and effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected against all the Operation of such a stingy Law. Or should the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> enjoyn these <hi>English</hi> that have subscribed to the <hi>Scots Stock</hi> to abandon and renounce their <hi>Membership</hi> in that <hi>Company,</hi> this would not only entitle the <hi>Scots</hi> to so much Mony as was the <hi>Quota</hi> of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106931:33"/>
the Benefit of such a Proportion of their own Estates, and likewise to forfeit so much of their very Principal. Nor would the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England</hi> act with less imprudence, and in greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency with their own Interest, should they suffer themselves to be provoked to turn the Payment of all the <hi>Scots Regiments</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> off from the <hi>English Establishment,</hi> and cast it upon the <hi>Scots</hi> as the equivalent of the <hi>Customs</hi> which they are excused from by the forementioned <hi>Statute</hi>; but which they would be obliged to pay to the Government, were they to trade to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>East Indies</hi> upon the like bottom and terms which the <hi>English</hi> do. But as this were to enfeeble the Confederate Army, by robbing it of Seventeen thousand as good Men as any it is constituted of, or else to necessitate <hi>England</hi> to hire and pay so many Foreigners in their room, which they cannot in that Method of acting avoid doing towards the compleating of the <hi>Eighty seven thousand four hundred and forty Men,</hi> which the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> by their <hi>Vote</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the 14th have declared <hi>necessary for the Year</hi> 1696. So such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> towards <hi>Scotland</hi> would enforce the <hi>Scots</hi> both to call home their Troops, and to employ them where <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will not find any Advantage in giving them Provocation as well as Occasion to do it. So that in a Word, all the Anger that boileth in <hi>English</hi> Breasts upon the Account of this <hi>Scots Act</hi> ought to vent it self upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> who gave the Advice, and upon our <hi>Belgick</hi> King who gave it the legislative Stamp, and ratified it into an Act, by what he calls his Royal Authority. And to shew that all his little Excuses, and particularly what he gave in answer to the <hi>Address</hi> of the <hi>Two Houses</hi> when presented to him <hi>Octob.</hi> 17. <hi>viz. That he had been ill served in</hi> Scotland, is all Cheat, pure <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mace,</hi> in that he has not in Evidence of his being imposed upon and misled, turned out or laid aside one of those <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>State</hi> whom he would have this credulous Nation believe to have delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to it. Which were it true, as it no wise is, it ought not to vindicate him from being accountable for the wrong he hath therein done to the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi>; seeing he who drove away King <hi>James</hi> by a President of his own making, meerly for the Offences of that King's Ministers, and which Ministers he has not only taken into his Friendship and Confidence, but made some of them the chief Superintendants of all his Affairs, must not think to Sham the World off with Pretences that the Ministers are only guilty, whilst he is to be looked upon as one as innocent as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106931:34"/>

But if nothing else will serve and content the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> save the making Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisals, and taking Revenge upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> for their establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>East India Company</hi> with so many ample Privileges and Immunities, the way of doing it is open and easy, without their committing any thing that the <hi>Scots</hi> can call unjust, or which they themselves may either repent or be ashamed of: namely, To grant unto their own <hi>trading Company,</hi> especially to those of <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>East Indies,</hi> such an Establishment by Law, with ease from Custom and Impositions, at least with such an Abatement and Moderation of them as <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> may be an Equivalent to all the Privileges and Immunities in the <hi>Scots Act,</hi> and thereby discourage and cripple, if not stifle and smother their Undertaking. And it is a surprise to all thinking disinterested Men, that Trade being the Source and Fountain of the Wealth, Strength and Populace of a Nation; and that this Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more adapted for it by its Situation, Harbours, and the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of its People, than any other Country whatsoever, that yet it should be so far from being encouraged in the way, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and degrees it ought, that the Trade of <hi>England</hi> is more Clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, Loaded, and has greater Burthens laid upon it, than that of any other Nation. But if this Method of counteracting the <hi>Scots</hi> should not be thought convenient, when the Kingdom is to be charged with so many and large Grants of Mony to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the upholding and carrying on the present War, there is still another way of obviating all the Evils we are apprehensive of from the <hi>Scots Act,</hi> and from the old <hi>East India Company</hi>; yea and not only of defeating the Design of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were the first and under-hand Advisers to it, but of improving it into an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of strengthening our selves to chastise the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and to exact Reparations from them for all the Injuries of one kind and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

these two Kingdoms into an <hi>Union</hi> of Councils, Laws and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of all Sorts, as they are already united under <hi>one Monarch,</hi> encompassed by the same Seas, Inhabitants upon one Island, and not differing in Language farther than in <hi>tone</hi> and dialect. Which as it would be to the mutual Safety and Prosperity of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so it is not to be questioned but that the <hi>Scots,</hi> in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and acknowledgment of the Benefit that would accrue to them by an <hi>Incorporation</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> would chearfully surrender their late <hi>Act,</hi> and be as forward as we can wish to repeal it. Nor would it be sound so difficult as some do imagine it, to effect, compass and perfect such an <hi>Union</hi> upon Terms that both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms may think equal, could we on each side renounce national Piques, and give up little private Interests, in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a general common Good.</p>
            <p>I am told that some are so ignorant, and others so impudent, as say, That King <hi>William</hi> in virtue of that Sovereign Power which that Kingdom hath granted him, may, by his own personal and immediate Authority, without the concurrence of a Parliament, or the Prescription of a Law, impose upon Trade what Duty, Customs or Taxes he pleaseth; and this they alledg to stand vested in him as a part of his Prerogative, by the Gift and Concession of an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> made in one of those <hi>Sessions</hi> when <hi>Launder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> was King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's <hi>High Commissioner.</hi> To which I reply three Things: 1. That such a Supposition were to put all <hi>Traders</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> into the state and condition of <hi>Slaves,</hi> by making their whole Property acquirable by the way of Traffick to be under the protection of no Law, but to be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>isable and disposable at the arbitrary Will and despotical Pleasure of the King; which I think that Nation which justly boasts it self a free Kingdom, as much as any other whatsoever, will not easily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in, and submit unto from any King: But especially not from one of their own making, who being as the Clay in their hands, of which they have made a <hi>Vessel</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> they may either <hi>break</hi> it or mould it again when the Humour takes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Vessel</hi> of <hi>Dishonour.</hi> 2. Whatsoever <hi>Prerogative</hi> this Man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of being their King, may have as to the laying Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions upon Goods and Merchandise, where no Law doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and bar him from doing it, and where the Concession, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Right for them to trade to such and such Places, and in such and such Commodities, proceed and are derived mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106931:35"/>
from his personal Grant and <hi>Charter,</hi> which gives them all their Title so to do; yet it is most absurd to imagine that he can have any such <hi>Prerogative</hi> or Power where a publick <hi>Law</hi> hath given them both a Right and Authority to trade, and an Immunity from all Impositions whatsoever in reference to such Places, and the Productions and Superfluities thereof; and it is also Tyranny in him to challenge it. For by this means no Laws can be a Fence about Mens Estates and Properties, nor give them the Security which they both promise, and were made and enacted for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring to them. And for King <hi>William</hi> to claim and exercise such a Jurisdiction and Authority were to usurp a <hi>dispensing</hi> Power that is both infinitely worse in it self, and more fatal in its consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than that for which we so much blamed, and have hostily treated King <hi>James:</hi> Seeing all the <hi>dispensing</hi> Power King <hi>James</hi> challenged was only in reference to <hi>penal</hi> Laws, and those also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative meerly to <hi>Religious Matters</hi>; as to both which the King has a greater extent and latitude of Jurisdiction inherent in him by reason of his Sovereign Power, than he hath in reference to other Laws. But should King <hi>William</hi> take upon him to <hi>dispense</hi> with the Act we are speaking of, it were to usurp a <hi>dispensing</hi> Power both in reference to <hi>beneficial</hi> Laws, and those made for the protection of our Civil Rights, Properties and Estates, which all Men who have common Sense know to be more out of the verge and reach of Kings to supercede and controle, than those are which refer to <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Officers, and which are likewise of a <hi>penal</hi> Nature. 3. Should it be admitted that by that <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Lauderdale</hi>'s <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> an absolute, unlimitted and despotical Authority became vested in King <hi>Charles,</hi> and stood conveyed to King <hi>James,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to this laying Taxes and Impositions on Trade; yet no Power of this kind accrues by this <hi>Act</hi> to King <hi>William,</hi> in that it was complained of as one of the <hi>Grievances</hi> which were presented to him antecedently to his having Crown conferred upon him, and whereof <hi>Redress</hi> only was demanded: But it was stipulated, and made a part of the <hi>Original Contract,</hi> betwixt the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> and Him, That no such Power as <hi>Lauderdale</hi>'s Act impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted should ever be claimed, or exercised over them. And for King <hi>William</hi> now to pretend to it, were not only to violate his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Oath, and proclaim himself perjured to all the World; but it were to discharge that Nation from all Obligation of Fealty to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106931:35"/>
him, and to give them a legal Right as well as Cause to proceed to the deposing and abdicating him.</p>
            <p>Before I shut up this Discourse, which the variety and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the matter has already made longer than I at first desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, though I hope it will not be found tedious, I shall for the sake of many Thousands; as well as my own, humbly applying my self to the <hi>Senate</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> and to the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Gowns,</hi> for their resolving me <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> Questions; which it is of great Concernment with respect to our Constitution, our Laws, our Relig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The first is, That they would tell us what the meaning of a King <hi>de facto</hi> is, and how such a One differs from a King <hi>de jure</hi>? For I find that many both of the <hi>Lawyers, Gentry,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who do wholy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe, and in their Minds disclaim the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Right to the Sovereignty, do yet allow themselves to swear Allegiance to him, and do pay him the Duty of Subjects, meerly because he is got into Possession of the Throne and Royal Title, and <hi>de facto</hi> hath assumed the exercise of the Kingly Power. Nor am I igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that the <hi>pedant</hi> Writers of <hi>Politicks</hi> do speak of a King <hi>de facto,</hi> as well as of a King <hi>de jure</hi>; but so far as I am capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Reason or good Sense, no Man can be called a King <hi>de facto,</hi> who is not either antecedently or concomitantly a King also <hi>de jure</hi>: Seei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A Thief may as well be called a legal Proprietor of what he hath stolen from his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and he that <hi>Pads</hi> upon the Road may have as just a Claim to the Purse he hath forcibly taken from a Traveller, though the Law makes both the one and the other obnoxious to be hanged, and that very justly too, as he can have either Right or Pretence to the Regal Title and Power, who attains not to them by the Methods, Rules and Measures, and in the Virtue, Force and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of the Constitution. And as the Names of Intruder, Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Robber, and not those of Prince, Sovereign and King, are which such a one ought only to be called by; so instead of <hi>Allegiance</hi> due unto him, or of our being under the Obligation ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

accountable for the Crimes which have entitled him to the Names of <hi>Robber</hi> of his Neighbours Crown, and <hi>Intruder</hi> into and <hi>Usurper</hi> of another Man's <hi>Throne.</hi> Things are stubborn and inflexible, and will not change their Natures, because of the complemental soft Words that are fastned upon them. Theft, Robbery and Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, will not cease to be the same evil and abominable Crimes which God hath denounced Curses against, and which Men in all Ages have annexed Punishments unto, notwithstanding the smooth <hi>Whitehall</hi> and <hi>Kensington</hi> Language with which we varnish them over. And whereas the Word and Name <hi>King</hi> hath been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to taken for a fair, honest, and honourable <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Name,</hi> and held no ways reproachful for a vertuous Man to have it ascribed unto him, and to be denominated by it; I will venture to say that it is one of the worst and most scandalous <hi>Words</hi> in the World, and the most disgraceful and injurious Title that a Person is capable of having given him; if it be allowed to express an Usurper by, and used of one that has no Right to a Crown, but meerly the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it. But whereas there are some who through want of Sense, and others who through Ignorance of the Law, may take the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to be a King <hi>de jure,</hi> and may thereby hope both to save their Consciences and their Credits, and think to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify themselves from Treason and Disloyalty in their swearing <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi> to him, and yielding him the Fealty due from Subjects; I desire therefore in the second Place to ask our <hi>Senators</hi> of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and our <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Gowns,</hi> how this <hi>Right</hi> to be King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and from what Sources of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> the <hi>Royal Stile</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> come to be derived unto and vested in <hi>him,</hi> and by what Tenure he bears the Royal Name, and exerciseth the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi>? For as there are but <hi>Three</hi> ways in any Nation of arriving lawfully at the Supream Authority, and of coming legitimately and honestly to be a <hi>King,</hi> namely, either by the Right of <hi>hereditary Succession,</hi> or by the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>just</hi> and <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conquest,</hi> or by the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Election,</hi> where through the known Laws, and the fundamental Provisions of the <hi>Constitution,</hi> there is upon every Vacancy of the Throne a Privilege vested in the People, or in their Representatives, or in some select Number of the most honourable and qualified Persons, to chuse one to fill it. And as none can have the Impudence to say, either that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is King of <hi>England</hi> by the Right of <hi>hereditary Succession,</hi> seeing there are divers Persons who have an <hi>hereditary</hi> Right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106931:36"/>
the Crown antecedently to him. Or that he attained to be King by a lawful <hi>Conquest</hi> in a just War; seeing that is not only disclaimed by himself, and repr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bated by the Parliament, but because the offering to establish his Title upon that Foundation, and to justify it by that <hi>Plea,</hi> were to put us into the State of <hi>Slaves</hi> instead of Subjects, and to make us enjoy all we are and have by his Pleasure and Will, and not to have any Property in them by our antient Laws. So in the third Place none who have the least Acquaintance with the Nature of our <hi>Constitution,</hi> the Frame of our Government, or the many Laws of the Land re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the Right and Manner of Succession in the Sovereignty, will dare to pretend that upon a <hi>Demise</hi> of the Crown the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or any certain Number of Persons whatsoever, stand legally vested with a Power of chusing who shall succeed: And the reason is obvious, because our <hi>Monarch</hi> is and has been always an <hi>hereditary Monarch,</hi> and not an <hi>elective.</hi> Wherefore though there have been sometimes Interruptions in the Rightful Succession, and Translations of the Crown from one Family to another, yet save in the Cases of direct Usurpation, such as <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi>'s, it was never attempted on the Foot and Principle of the Peoples ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Power resident in them by Law to elect their King; but it was always on the Motive and Foundation of doubtful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Titles. Which Claim, though in some it was very weak, yet it was always insisted upon; and what their Title wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in legal Goodness, they endeavoured to make out by military Power. I might add, That there was no <hi>Demise</hi> here, neither by Death nor by Resignation, and much less were there any vested with a Regal Power of abdicating, deposing, and driving away King <hi>James.</hi> So that upon the whole, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> can upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o Foundation whatsoever, nor in any Sense received, among Men of coming Lawfully to a Crown, be King of <hi>England de jure,</hi> and by consequence he must be contented to be held for no other than an <hi>Usurper,</hi> and as such ought all Men to account him, who according to the Laws of Revelation, and of the Kingdom, would either approve themselves to God, or have peace in their own Minds. But then thirdly, admitting the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to be <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> (whether <hi>de Jure</hi> or <hi>de Facto</hi> I further enquire not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) I desire to ask the <hi>Two Houses</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> as well as our <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Divines,</hi> of what <hi>Signification and Importance in their Judgments and Opinions the Word King is,</hi> that the People may the better
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106931:37"/>
know the Nature, Extent and Bounds of their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> that being on their part <hi>Reciprocal</hi> and <hi>Corrolate</hi> to <hi>Kingship</hi> on the Sovereigns? And this <hi>Question</hi> is the more necessary to be resolved, in that the <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>King</hi> is much different in the present Estimate of the Generality of Men, as well <hi>within</hi> the Houses of Parliament as <hi>without</hi> them, from what it is represented and found to be in our Laws, and from what it has been always heretofore taken and acknowledged to be. That therefore which with reference to my self, as well as to many Thousands besides, I would earnestly beg to know, is, Whether by <hi>King</hi> they mean a Sovereign Prince, whose Person (by virtue of the Authority lodged in him, and by reason that the Peace and Welfare of the whole Society depends upon his Safety) is <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Inviolable</hi>; who cannot legally be resisted, opposed or withstood, and much less be judged, deposed and abdicated by any Power on Earth, on any Pretence whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and one without whose Call and Authority all Meetings, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies and Consultations about Matters of Government and State are Treason and Rebellion? Or whether by <hi>King</hi> they do intend only a Person that is meerly in the Quality of a <hi>Trustee,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted by and accountable to the <hi>People</hi> as his <hi>Principals,</hi> and who being only vested with a <hi>delegated</hi> Power, may therefore be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, arraigned, judged, abdicated, and drove away, if he offend those over whom he is advanced to rule, and act dissonantly from and contrary to the Laws, of all which his Subjects are to be Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? For if <hi>King</hi> be taken in the <hi>first Sense,</hi> to signify one that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accusable, irresistable and unabdicable; than we of this Nation neither have, nor lawfully can have, any other King than King <hi>James</hi> while he liveth, and hath not renounced and disclaimed his Right: And by consequence the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is no other than an <hi>Usurper.</hi> And we out of our own Mouths, and by our own Sentence, no better than Rebels in abdicating the <hi>former,</hi> and in submitting unto and owning the <hi>later.</hi> And indeed the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon which the <hi>Salisbury</hi> Dictator of <hi>Measures of Obedience,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> (who out of disloyal Malice to us endeavoured to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert our antient Government, and to battle all our Laws, by his modern and treasonable Politicks) striveth to justify the <hi>Abdication</hi> in a Book he hath lately published, called, <hi>Reflections on a Pamphlet entitled Some Discourses upon Dr.</hi> Burnet <hi>and Dr.</hi> Tillotson, <hi>occasioned by the Funeral Sermon of the former upon the later,</hi> plainly shew both how self condemned the Author is, and what Rebellion he and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106931:37"/>
the Nation are, according to the Laws of God and Men, become guilty by that Transaction. For whereas he owns, That <hi>illegal Acts, and Acts of Tyranny, and the remote Consequences of them, do not justify the resisting of Princes; and that they can be then only lawfully withstood, when their going about to subvert totally the Constitution shall be plainly apparent,</hi> P. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. there is no more needful to be said for the loading of him, and for the branding the Nation with the just Imputation of the highest and most detestable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son committed in the <hi>Abdication</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> and in the Choise and Exaltation of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to his Throne. Seeing whatsoever illegal Acts (which were not many, nor of any mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Importance to the Kingdom) the King might be misled and hurried into by treacherous Councillors; yet it is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plainly <hi>apparent</hi> that he <hi>designed to subvert the Constitution,</hi> that the contrary is demonstratively evident; and that no Prince ever bore greater regard to the Laws, Liberties and Prosperity of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> than he did. And as his Majesties <hi>sending an Ambassador to</hi> Rome, <hi>his appointing Popish Bishops, and his claiming a dispensing Power in reference to penal Laws about Religion,</hi> are all the Instances which that traiterous Doctor gives of the King's being embarqued in such an Attempt; so they are such weak and impertinent Proofs of such a Design, that it is to <hi>banter</hi> Mankind, to raise a Suspition of it upon them, and much more to stile them plain and apparent Evidences of it. Nor needs there any more to shew that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> was in no danger of being <hi>totally subverted</hi> by those Means and Overt Acts of Government, than that neither the noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that went to <hi>Rome,</hi> nor those that were constituted Popish Bishops, nor any of them that gave Advice for the dispensing Power, have been so much as arraigned, and much less capitally punished, as they would and deserved to have been, if those Things had been of a direct and immediate Tendency to destroy totally the Constitution. Nor would any Man have betrayed at once the Weakness and the Impudence as to have assigned those Acts of Administration, and no other, as convictive Proofs of an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Design in King <hi>James to subvert totally the Constitution</hi>; but this noisy, treacherous and disloyal Doctor, who like to him that fired <hi>Diana</hi>'s Temple to protect himself from Oblivion, has been stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying to raise himself a <hi>Monument</hi> upon the Banishment of his Sovereign, the Ruin of our Antient Government, and the Invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of these Kingdoms in a bloody and destructive War. But
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106931:38"/>
then on the other had, if <hi>King</hi> be taken in the <hi>second Sense,</hi> for one that may be <hi>resisted, arraigned, deposed</hi> and <hi>drove away</hi> from his <hi>Throne</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi>; then as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hath but a flippery Seat of it, and a thorny Crown, so no Man can be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully required to take an <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> to him, and much less justly punished by double Taxes, or otherwise for refusing it: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if that be the Signification and Importance of <hi>King,</hi> it may be every Man's Duty to assist in deposing and dethroning him. And upon what I have said of his Miscarriages in Government, and the Designs he is carrying on to the Ruin as well as Impoverishment of the Kingdom, there is nothing remains to be added or adviced, But <hi>to your Tents O Israel,</hi> for this Man ought no longer to be suffer'd to pretend to reign over us. For as he hath in <hi>many Instances apparently attempted the total Subversion of the Constitution,</hi> (which even by our <hi>Salisbury Doctor</hi>'s Principles of Politicks, justifieth the deposing him) and particularly both in the commanding a <hi>whole Tribe</hi> of Men that were under the Protection of the Laws to be <hi>massacred,</hi> without any previous Tryal or Conviction; and in his taking the Earl of <hi>Bredalbin</hi> by meer arbitrary Power, not only out of the hands of Justice, when he stood impeached by Parliament (which whether he was justly or unjustly makes no Change in the Nature of what the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hath therein done) but in putting him into the Administration of the Government as a <hi>Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor:</hi> So he hath likewise in effect destroyed the very Kingdom, and hath brought us into those Circumstances of Confusion, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and Want, out of which it is impossible to recover and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us, while he is permitted to sit at the Helm. And which, if we be so sortish, and so much Enemies to our selves and to our Posterity as to connive at any longer, it will be out of the reach and power both of our <hi>Rightful King,</hi> and of a well <hi>constituted Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> ever to redeem us; or either to retrieve the Nation from final Ruin, or to save us from being Conquered by any potent Neighbour that may have a mind to invade us.</p>
            <p>Nor will I enlarge this Discourse any further, save to tell those who out of rebellious Enmity to a Rightful King, and Idolatry of an Usurper, may complain of the Acrfmony of some Expressions which will be found to occur in the foregoing Leaves, That all the Language I have used is either consecrated by the Tongues or Pens of your <hi>Williamite Divines,</hi> in their Pulpit Invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst King <hi>James,</hi> and the King of <hi>France</hi>; or else it is all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised
