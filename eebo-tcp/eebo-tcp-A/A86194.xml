         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>That the hearts of all the Members of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
and of all the well-affected within this
Kingdom are exceedingly grieved, and made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
That in ſo long a time, againſt the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
both of King and Parliament, and contrary to
the joynt deſires and prayers of the godly in
both Kingdoms, to whom it is more dear and
precious then what is deareſt to them in the
world, The Reformation of Religion hath
moved ſo ſlowly, and ſuffered ſo great inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112564:3"/>
They conſider, That not onely Prelates,
formall profeſſors, prophane and worldly men,
and all that are Popiſhly affected, are bad Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
and Workers, and do abuſe their power,
and bend all their ſtrength and policies againſt
the Work of God, but the god of this world al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
with Principallities and Powers, the Rulers
of the darkneſſe of this world, and Spirituall
wickedneſſe in high places, are working with all
their force and fraud in the ſame oppoſition, not
without hope of ſucceſſe; they having prevailed
ſo far from the beginning, That in the times of
the beſt Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> of old, and the moſt part
of the Reformed Kirks of late, a thorow and
perfect Reformation of Religion hath been a
Work full of difficulties: Yet do they conceive,
That as it ought firſt of all to be intended, ſo
ſhould it be above all other things, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in God, who is greater then the world, and
he who is in the world moſt ſeriouſly endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And that when the Supreme Providence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
opportunity of the accepted time and day
of Salvation, no other work can proſper in the
hands of his ſervants, if it be not apprehended,
and with all reverence and faithfulneſſe impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
This Kirk and Nation when the Lord gave
them the calling, conſidered not their own dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
nor ſtaggered at the promiſe through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
but gave glory to God. And who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(we ſpeak it in humility and love, and from

come, it ſhall be to <hi>England,</hi> after ſo long deferred
hopes, a Tree of Life, which ſhall not onely

               <p>The Commiſſioners of this Kingdom in the
late Treaty of Peace, conſidering that Religion
is not onely the Mean of the Service of God,
and ſaving of ſouls, but is alſo the Baſe and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Kingdoms and Eſtates, and the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Band to tye ſubjects to their Prince in true
Loyalty, and to knit the hearts of one to another
in true Unity and Love, They did, with Preface
of all due Reſpect and Reverence, far from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance
or Preſumption, repreſent, in name of
this Kingdom, their ſerious Thoughts, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Deſires for Unity of Religion; That in all
His Majeſties Dominions there might be one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Faith, one Directory of Worſhip,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:112564:4"/>
one publike Catechiſm, and one Form of Kirk-Government:
This they conceived to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God Almighty, who delighteth to ſee
his people walking in Truth and Unity; To be a
ſpeciall Means for conſerving of Peace betwixr
the Kingdoms, of eaſing the Kings Majeſty and
the publike Government of much trouble which
ariſeth from differences of Religion, very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to Kings and Eſtates; of great content to
the King Himſelf, to His Nobles, His Court,
and all His People, when—occaſioned to be
abroad, without ſcruple to themſelves, or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall
to others, all may reſort to the ſame publike
Worſhip, as they were at their own dwellings:
Of ſuppreſſing the names of Hereſies and Sects,
Puritans, Conformiſts, Separatiſts, Anabaptiſts,
&amp;c. which do rent aſunder the Bowells both of
Kirk and Kingdom; Of deſpair of ſucceſſe to
Papiſts and Recuſants to have their Profeſſion,
which is inconſiſtent with the true Proteſtant
Religion, and Authority of Princes, ſet up again,
and of drawing the hearts and hands of Miniſters
from unpleaſant and unprofitable Controverſies,
to the preſſing of Mortification, and to Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes
of true Piety, and Practicall Divinity. The
Aſſembly doth now enter upon the labour of
the Commiſſioners, unto which they are encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
not onely by their faithfulneſſe in the
late Treaty, but alſo by the Zeal and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Generall Aſſemblies of this Kirk in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:112564:5"/>
former times, as may appear by the Aſſembly at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,
Decemb. 25. in the yeer 1566. which ordained
a Letter to be ſent to England againſt the Surplice,
Tippet, Cornercoap, &amp; ſuch other Ceremonies as then
troubled that Kirk, that they might be removed. By
the Aſſembly at Edinburgh, April 24. 1583. humbly
deſiring the Kings Majeſtie to command His Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour
then going to England to deal with the Queen,
That there might be an union and band betwixt them
and other Chriſtian Princes and Realms profeſſing
the true Religion, for defence and protection of the
Word of God, and profeſſors thereof, againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of Papiſts and confederates, joyned and knit
together by the bloody league of Trent: As alſo, That
Her Majeſty would disburthen their Brethren of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
of the yoke of Ceremonies impoſed upon them
againſt the liberty of the Word. And by the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at Edinburgh, March 3. 1589. ordaining the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytry
of Edinburgh to uſe all good and poſſible means
for the relief and comfort of the Kirk of England, then
heavily troubled for maintaining the true Diſcipline
and Government of the Kirk; And that the Brethren
in their private and publike Prayers recommend the
eſtate of the afflicted Kirk of England to God. While
now by the mercie of God, The conjunction of the two
Kingdoms is many wayes increaſed, The zeal of the
Generall Aſſembly towards their happineſſe ought to
be no leſſe. But beſides theſe, the Aſſembly is much
encouraged unto this duty, both from the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
and His Parliament joyntly, in their Anſwer to the
Propoſition made by the late Commiſſioners of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112564:5"/>
Treaty, in theſe words, <hi>To their deſire concerning</hi> Unity
<hi>of Religion, and</hi> Uniformity <hi>of Kirk-government, as a
ſpeciall means for conſerving of peace betwixt the two
Kingdoms, upon the grounds and reaſons contained in the
paper of the 10 of March; and given in to the Treaty and
Parliament of England. It is anſwered upon the 15 of
June, That His Majestie, with advice of both Houſes of
Parliament, doth approve of the affection of His Subjects
of Scotland, in their deſire of having Conformity of Kirk-government
between the two Nations; And as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath already taken into conſideration the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Kirk-government, ſo they will proceed therein in
due time, as ſhall beſt conduce to the glory of God, the peace
of the Kirk, and of both Kingdoms.</hi> And alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally;
for His Majeſty knoweth that the cuſtody and
Vindication, the conſervation and purgation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
are a great part of the duty of Civil authority
and power. His Majeſties late practiſe, while He was
here in perſon, in reſorting frequently to the exerciſes
of publike Worſhip, His Royall actions in eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Worſhip and Government of this Kirk in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
And in giving order for a competent main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to the Miniſtery and Seminaries of the Kirk;
And His Majeſties gracious Letter to the Aſſembly
(ſeconded by the Speech of His Majeſties Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner)
which containeth this Religious expreſſion,
<hi>Where any thing is amiſſe, We will endeavour in a fair
and orderly way a Reformation, and where Reformation is
ſetled, We reſolve with that authority wherewith God hath
veſted us, To maintain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and defend it in peace and liberty,
againſt all trouble that can come from without, and againſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:112564:6"/>
all hereſies, ſects, and ſchiſmes which may ariſe from within.</hi>
All theſe do make us hopefull that His Majeſtie will
not oppoſe, but advance the worke of Reformation. In
like manner the Honourable Houſes of Parliament, as
They have many times before witneſſed their zeal, So
now alſo in their Declaration ſent to the Aſſemblie,
which not only ſheweth the conſtancie of their zeal,

by a Malignant party of Papiſts and evill-affected
perſons, eſpecially of the corrupt and diſſolute Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
by the incitement and inſtigation of Biſhops and
others. Their hopes according to their earneſt deſire
when they ſhall return to a peaceable and Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
proceeding by the bleſſing of God, To ſettle ſuch
a Reformation in the Church as ſhall be agreeable to
Gods word; And that the reſult ſhall be a moſt firm
and ſtable Union between the two Kingdoms of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
and Scotland, &amp;c. The Aſſemblie alſo is not
a little encouraged by a Letter ſent from many Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Brethren of the Kirk of England, expreſſing their
prayers and endeavours againſt every thing which ſhall
be found prejudiciall to the eſtabliſhment of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Chriſt and the peace of their Soveraigne.
Upon theſe encouragements, and having ſo potent a
doore of hope, The Aſſemblie doth confidently expect,
That England will now beſtir themſelves in the beſt
way for a Reformation of Religion; And do moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
offer their prayers and uttermoſt endeavours for
furthering ſo great a work, wherein Chriſt is ſo much
concern'd in his glory, the King in His honour, the
Kirk and Kingdom of England in their happineſſe, and
