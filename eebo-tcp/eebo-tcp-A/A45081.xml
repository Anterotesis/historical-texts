            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But indeed I was of late doubly undeceived, for I both found (to my amazement) that you were alive, as alſo that your late Book was but eight ſheets, which indeed for that very cauſe I ſhould have baſtardiz'd and diſclaimd for being yours; But that I therein found that a many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and impertinent daſhes did abſolutely Characterize it yours, and beſides I ſaw abundance of Quotations, which I ſuppoſe no other Man would upon that occaſion have plac't there.</p>

            <p>For the fame of your Learning I found that it had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther invaded the minds of the multitude, and poſſeſſed the weak inconſiderate ſwallowers of all Books, and intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted

And therefore I call'd to mind that I had heard many of them ſay, that (though your induſtry were not at all diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, yet it did not infer any ſuch vaffneſſe or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of nature in you, as the Titles or Margents of your Books ſeeme to promiſe, for (ſay they) Nature makes ever the dulleſt Beaſts moſt laborious, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt feeders.

            </p>
            <p>Ergo, <hi>It ought not to be demanded nor levied, and you might in conſcience and prudence withſtand it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Propoſition which you take as indubitable would in the firſt place be ſtated and Rectified, becauſe ſo many of your Reaſons, and indeed your moſt preſſing, nay the very ſtrength of the Aſſumption leane upon it, But you muſt conſider that though I agree with you, that no Tax ought to be layd but in Parliament, yet I utterly diſſent from you in the Acception of the word <hi>Parliament,</hi> and though I grant you <hi>the whole Realme</hi> yet I doe not extend it to your Latitude; which I thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and confirme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I take the <hi>Realme of</hi> England to be no other, But that People which God and nature hath planted in this Iſland, free from all humane power and poſitive Law, ſave what they electe and conſtitute over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or their Repreſentive (by their authority) enact for their good and welfare; and therefore whatſoever power is not deriv'd from them, ought not to be obey'd by them, Nor the Laws Impos'd by and under that power to be held any other then Tirannicall and not binding.</p>
            <p>That they are not under the Right of any forreigne domination, I ſuppoſe you leave me as granted, and therefore to conſider them in themſelves, we muſt look whither they be a people naturally endewed with a free diſpoſition of themſelves, (as was juſt now layd down) or elſe by the Laws of God, or their own ſtipulation they ought to obey ſome ſuperiour power (whither in one hand or many) which ſhould Inviolably or unalterably rule over them.</p>
            <p>If you can affirme this of Monarchie, you muſt ravell this conſideration to its firſt principles (as there is no better way to underſtand the making of a watch then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32963:9"/>
to take her in pieces) and conſider what Right Kings have to Rule over us; if they ſay from God, this is but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They muſt prove how they come to be Kings; if they ſay that in the Scripture God do's favour and delight in Monarchy, let them tell us what kind of Monarchy it is, and what limits God hath appoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If they ſay by compact and choice of the people, let them produce it and its condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and then ſtand a tryall, whither the people could paſſe away the liberty of their ſucceſſors, or themſelves upon breach of Truſt or other conſiderations, <hi>Recall &amp; annull:</hi> if none of theſe will hold, they muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be intruders and depoſable upon the firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>All this I conceive remain'd to be prov'd before our Kings can affect their <hi>Jus Regnands</hi> in ſo clear and ſafe a manner as the late <hi>CHARLES</hi> pretended to it. But if they were only elected (as the ſupreme expoſitor the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament have declared) then it evidently declares that in the height of their intruſion they either could not ſtifle a remembrance of the peoples Right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elſe by an odde <hi>Arcanum Imperii</hi> practized by the Primitive Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperors) they were willing by a ſpecious ſhew of liberty, to baniſh all offence and Recollection of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion. And of election<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> queſtionleſſe thoſe that have power to chooſe have power alſo not to chooſe.</p>
            <p>Then ſecondly if Kings be not Integrall parts of our Parliaments, Repreſentatives or Nationall meetings ('tis things I mind not words for the people cannot all at once meet in Councell) it will Poriſmatically follow
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32963:10"/>
that the Lords being his vaſſalls, conſtitutes or at leaſt but Councellours, are not, as being not entruſted nor called thither by the people, who have the only power to make their Deputies, and gives voyces in their Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall meetings.</p>
            <p>Thus much being gaind there will flow a <hi>Third,</hi> That will immediatly inveſt a ſupream authority in thoſe meetings, and this authority muſt needs make them Judges of caſes of neceſſity, and neceſſity oftentimes warranting, nay bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding violent courſes, ſome actions and carriages may be juſtifiable, nay laudable and glorious in them that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nor have you Reaſon to ſtorme with this Parliament, for voting the excluſion of part of their Members (whereof your ſelfe were one) that had concurred in dangerous and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive pernicious Votes.</p>
            <p>And now you may ſee how unſound your Propoſition was, and how utterly the State of the whole Syllogi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſaid to the Aſſumption for the preſent, I ſhall ſay thus much; That ſince King and Lords are no eſſentiall parts of it, and that they make up the cuſtomary number, we have no Reaſon to diſavow them on that Tophick, ſome other Reaſon then muſt we ſearch, and ſee whither they were either lawfully called, or elſe ſince their calling ſome act either done by themſelves or others have in Law diſſolved them. But for the Legallity of their Aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling your ſelf are ſo far from denying, that you found ſome Arguments upon it; &amp; I further juſtifie that they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly were entruſted by the people, and that the Kings did put them into a courſe, not give them Authority, (for if it had, then muſt all power Immedidately flow from the King which we have deny'd) and therefore though the Right of the people were at that time c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>og'd with that load, there is no Reaſon but they might when they could ſhake it off, and reſtore themſelves to thoſe Priviledges nature endowed them with. And therefore they muſt neceſſarily remain anauthoritative Body after the decol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>King</hi> as not ſitting by him: But it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion according to the word of the Law, whither they ever can be diſſolved or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the King not being alive to diſſolve them. Howſoever you can diſtinguiſh a King in the abſtract, and concret and know that it is not his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall preſence adds any thing to them: for otherwiſe your own books muſt riſe up againſt you, and all their actions ſince the Kings de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To this you ſay, 1. <hi>That by Statutes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>No Freemen ought to be compelld to goe in perſon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Or to pay Taxes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>without their conſents in a free Parliament,</hi> ſuch an one you deny this preſent to be, and I contrariwiſe affirme it, and have demonſtrated it, and ſo farwell this Argument. 2. <hi>Moſt of thoſe Ancient forces are revolted and declared Rebells,</hi> and therefore this Parliament ſhall not avail themſelves of others in their Roomes. 3. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now pretending for</hi> Ireland <hi>hath been obſtructers of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</hi> This is a ſtrong Argument againſt the Legalitie of the Tax. 4. <hi>The reliefe of</hi> Ireland <hi>is not now upon the firſt juſt and pious grounds.</hi> ('Tis falſe they are now juſt the ſame.) <hi>But to joyne with</hi> Owen Roe; the Parliament have diſclaim'd the actions of two brave men in that affaire. Notwithſtanding the prudence advantage and neceſſitie of it; which certainly cannot but declare that they are not over affected with him and his Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Fourth</hi> Reaſon is the <hi>coercive power and manner of Levying this Tax,</hi> as though upon caſes of neceſſitie and Imminent danger a State muſt want neceſſary reliefe, becauſe ſuch and ſuch a skittiſh perſon is not ſatisfied, and if we ſee that many actions of private men (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe illegall) are juſtified by their ſubordination to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32963:16"/>
publike. How much more muſt we thinke of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths themſelves in whom the chiefe care and truſt of preſervation is repoſed; which how they could be endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, know not I, unleſſe they had alſo a power to enforce thoſe reliefs, which neceſſity and reaſon of Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſo uſually require, and therefore your <hi>Firſt</hi> reaſon that they ought not to diſtraine is nothing, ſince it determines not in what caſes it is unlawfull to diſtraine, and you withall take it as granted that this is an unlawfull Tax. 2. For <hi>Impriſonment;</hi> It hangs upon the ſame falſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition as the former, and all you can inſtance who hath been impriſon'd upon this Act invalid; ſince a many Laws come accompanyed with a terror, which they alſo intend ſhall ſeldome or never be put in execution. 3. Levying of <hi>Taxes by Souldiers was judged high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Treaſon in</hi> Strafords <hi>caſe,</hi> as though there were not difference between a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame authority and a Subject, a time of peace and War. 4. <hi>If any perſon bring his Action at Law we ſhall be ſtopt by the Committee of Indemnity,</hi> as though the Parliament (who are ſo much above all ordinary proceedings of Law) ought not in Juſtice to protect thoſe who execute their juſt Commands.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Fifth</hi> Reaſon is; <hi>The tune ſticks much with you, for if we have ſuch a Tax in the firſt yeare of</hi> Englands <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared freedome, what ſhall we have in the ſecond,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer <hi>Evax! vah!</hi> there wants a Comma, to expreſſe Irriſion and Indignation.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Sixth, Is the order or newneſſe of Tax is is the firſt you find Jmpos'd by the Commons Houſe after the Parliament diſſolved.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Lingua! thou ſtrikſt too much upon one ſtring</l>
               <l>Thy tedious plain-ſong grates my tender ears.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I thought this Argument had been thred bare enough to be uſed againe, But no matter 'tis your cuſtome, but certainly, A man of your Imployment and ſpeed is to be forgiven if he forget what he wrote three pages before; and yet this you confirme with a not able reaſon (as you
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32963:16"/>
think) out of <hi>Ovids Remedio Amoris: Principiis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta, &amp;c.</hi> a bu kin that may fit any fool, and clog any obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction whatever.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Seventh is the exceſſiveneſſe of the Tax.</hi> A main objection indeed, when you were to treat about its Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but I muſt tell you occaſions are alſo exceſſive, as I told you when I anſwered your third Reaſon in which this your ſeventh Reaſon (according to the uſuall Caball of your writing) was alſo involved, I ſhall onely adde now that I wonder by what Arithmetick you Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late 90000 pounds <hi>per mens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to be half the Revenue of the Nation, and by what Analogy of Reaſon; you inſtance the Impoſition of the Popes Legate on the Engliſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, to affront an Act of Parliament concerning the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Eighth</hi> (for I would gladly once be rid of you) is, <hi>the Principall Judgement of this Tax is to free us from Free quarter,</hi> and you ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. <hi>Free-quarter is illegall</hi> (and you make an ample citation for it) <hi>and ſo ought to be taken off without any compenſation.</hi> 'Tis true! but when there is a Neceſſity of keeping up a Souldiery whether of the two evills is to be choſen: and ſecondly, you ſay, <hi>That they have often promis'd to take off Free quarter, but ſtill as ſoon as Contributions were paid, there was as much free quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as formerly,</hi> and therefore becauſe ſome under-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are negligent, and ſome Common-ſouldiers rude; An Act of Parliament muſt become invalid, although it may be affirmed that the diſcipline of this Army is as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and ſtrict as can be poſſible, and therefore it is not ſtrange, if they be not ſubject to ſuch diſorders as might commonly make ſuch Companies of men both deteſtable or hated, and yet certainly there are ſome among them very rare <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> if that ſtrange Tragae-Comedy of <hi>May</hi> 22. (a day it ſeems fatall to your ſtrong-beer and proviſions) be true, for certainly (according to your Lamentations) it is as dreadfull and hideous as the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of an Inchanted Caſtle, or ſome new Commotion

            <p>To your <hi>Ninth</hi> (which in my underſtanding is the ſame with your third) <hi>the end of this taxe is not for defence of the Kingdome, but aboliſhing of Monarchy &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We affirme this for the defence of the Nation, and all the reſt we confeſſe.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Laſt,</hi> which you ſuppoſe chain-ſhot, but indeed is a ſquirt, whereas you ſay, <hi>that in your poor judgement it will be offenſive to God and good men.</hi> Certainly God hath ſtampt too many viſible Characters of his favour upon theſe proceedings, to withdraw his aſſiſtance from this Parliament, for proſecuting that work which he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with: and for good men; there are thouſands think it both neceſſary and fit to pay it. <hi>Scandalous to the Proteſtant Relegion.</hi> As how? <hi>diſhonourable to the Engliſh Nation,</hi> for bravely aſſerting their liberties, and giving ſo faire an example of Magnanimity and bravery to <hi>Europe</hi> and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, <hi>hindring the ſpeedy ſettlement of our peace.</hi> Me thinks we are at peace already, if you mean a peace with <hi>C.

            <p>And beſides, conſider what Reputation it is to you, that ſeem to carry the face of a grave civill writer, to ſtuffe your materiall books (and this indeed I think you conceive one of your Maſter-pieces) with ſuch large
