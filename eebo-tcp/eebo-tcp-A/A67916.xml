            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Courteous Reader,</head>
            <p>I Have on purpose o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Progression,
as also many other
Rules following,
partly because that these being
well learned, not only by rote,
but also by reason, the young
learner (for whose sake I wrote
this) will be inabled hereby in a
good measure to understand
what hee findes in other books
concerning such; And if this
prove but as useful, as I wish it
may, and hope it will (by the
Teachers care, and Scholars
diligence) I may be incouraged
<pb facs="tcp:121279:3"/>
to add somewhat to it hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that may bee of further
use, or else these weak indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
may provoke some others
of better parts to bring them
to the publick Treasurie of Art.
In the mean time accept of this
mite from him that is one
that would count it an honour
to bee but one of the meanest
of those that might present any
thing on the behalf of this
most Noble, and most Necessary
Art of Arithmetick; that
might further the growth of
such as are entring upon the
practice of the same, which I
presume, if this small Tract
may bee as a small Table
wherein to see the first Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:121279:3"/>
in, briefly and plainly,
which being by the Masters
discretion appointed the young
Scholar to get by heart, may
prove an ease to both; to the
Master, in that (if hee please
to spend some set time in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
his Scholars, as they
use to catechize little ones) hee
by that means may teach the
Rules to twenty in teaching
one, and not only print the
Rules in the memory of such
as are past such Rules, who
perhaps may bee apt to forget,
but also teach the Rudiments to
other, even before they come to
the practice of them, whereby
hee may save the pains of often
telling them, and may only fit
<pb facs="tcp:121279:4"/>
them with examples suitable
to the Rule, sometimes descan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a little upon the Rules as
they lye in order, as he findes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
and by this course, being
observed, he will with the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of God finde by the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
growth in knowledge, that
the pains bestowed will not be in
vain; but not to be tedious, I
leave each to use his own discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
how to use this or any other
help, only I have thoughts, that
a thing of this nature will bee
profitable, and have its use; So
wishing this most Noble Art,
and all those that love it, to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in our Land, I bid thee
farewel.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why say you its own simple
value?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because a figure by being
put in the second, third, or

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because every place ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the place next before it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:121279:7"/>
ten times in value, so that the
figure that signifies but four in
the first place, signifies ten times
4 in the second, and an hundred
times four in the third place, and
a thousand times four in the
fourth place, &amp;c. and in that
proportion increaseth infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
according as its place is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
removed from the unite
place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is the proportion of diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
decimal fractions, like this of

Then I begin with those figures
next the right hand, and say, 5

now in regard it is just 2 times

say, 2 that I bear in my mind,
and 8 is 10, and 7 is 17, and 6
makes 23, then I set down the
odd 3 in the second place below
the line, and for the 2 Tens, I
carry 2 in minde to the next
place, then I say, 2 that I carry
and 3 is 5, and 6 is 11, and 5 is
16, the odd 6 I set below the

line, and carry one in lieu of
the ten to the next place, and
say, 1 I carry, and 6 is 7, and
5, is 12, and 4 is 16, so I set the
6 below the line, and in regard
there is not another place to

work, till I have multiplied the
first figure of the multiplier by
all the figures of the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cand
in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what do you next?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Then I multiply the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
figure of the multiplier by
all the figures of the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cand,
in like sort as I did the first,
only I must observe to set my
first place in this second work,
one place nearer the left hand,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:121279:19"/>
that it may fall right under the
figure I multiply by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the reason of that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because every unite in the
second place signifies 10, in the
third place, 100, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is this order then to be kept in
a sum of many figures or places?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, the same order is to
bee observed in any sum, be the
places never so many, I must
still set my first figure right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the figure I multiply by,
and then the rest in order to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the left hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Having so set down all
your figures, what remains fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to bee done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Only to add the several
numbers together in order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
still at the first place
next the right hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Give one Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:121279:19"/>

               <p>Where first I say, 4 times 5
is 20, where I set a cipher below
the line, and carry 2, then I say,
4 times 4 is 16, and 2 that I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
is 18, the 8 I set down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and carry 1, then 4 times
3 is 12, and 1 that I carried is
13, then I set down 3, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one, 4 times 2 (or 2 times
4, for it is all one) makes 8,
and one that I carried is 9, which
I set down in its place, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
the first figure of my multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier,
with a dash through it, to
signifie that it hath done its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:121279:20"/>
then I begin with the next
figure, saying, 3 times 5 is 15,
the five I set down right under
the 3 I multiply by, and carry
one in minde, then I say, 3
times 4 is 12, and one that I
carried is 13, the 3 I set down in
the second place, and carry one,
and say, 3 times 3 is 9, and one I
carried is 10, where I set down
a (0) and carry one, then I say,
3 times 2 is 6, and one I carry
is 7, which I set down, and
cancel my second figure of the
multiplier, and begin with the
third, saying, 2 times 5 is 10,
then I set down a cipher in that
place right under my multiplier
2, and carry one in mind to the
next place, then I say, 2 times 4
is 8, and one I carried is 9, which
I set down in the next place, in
order, then I say, 2 times 3 is 6,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:121279:20"/>
which I set in its due place, and
lastly, I say, 2 times 2 is 4, which
I write down also, so have I
multiplied all my figures of the
multiplier, by all the figures of
the multiplicand, there remains
to add up all into one sum,
which to do I begin at the right
hand, and work as in Addition,
and so the product is 548730,
as in the example.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The truest proof is by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
but it is ordinarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thus, they make a cross
X</p>
               <p>And then cast away so many
nines as can bee found in the
multiplicand, and set the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
on the upper side of the
cross, and do the like with the
multiplier, &amp; set the remainder
under the cross, then multiply
the 2 remaidners 1 by another,
and cast out the nines out of the
product of them, setting the rest
at one side of the cross; and last
of all cast out the nines out of
the product of the Multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and mark the rest, if it be
like that which is placed on the
side of the cross, it appears
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:121279:21"/>
to bee right, or else it is not well
done.

how many times one number is

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How many numbers are to
bee noted in any Division?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Three, namely, the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend,
or number to bee divided,
secondly, the divisor, or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
dividing, thirdly, the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
which sheweth how often
the divisor is contained in the
dividend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> In what manner is Division
performed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First I set down my divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend,
and under it I place my
divisor, in such sort, that the
figures next the left hand stand
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:121279:22"/>
right under one another, and so
each following place in order,
except the divisor bee a greater
number than so many figures of
the dividend as stand over it,
for then the divisor must bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
a place nearer the right
hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And what do you then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Then I draw a crooked
line to the right hand of my fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
to place my quotient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond,
and I consider how often
I can take the divisor, out of the
number over it, and set the
number of times in the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and multiplying the said
quotient figure by the divisor,
I substract the product from the
figures above the divisor, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the remainder over head,
cancelling the other figures that
were over the divisor, and also
the divisor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:121279:23"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> And how proceed your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Then I remove my divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
one place nearer the right
hand, and consider as before
how often I may take it out of
the figures over head, and work
in all points as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If there bee many remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
of the divisor, is that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
still to bee observed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, where the divisor
can bee substracted once or
oftner out of the dividend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But what if you cannot take
the divisor out of the figures over
it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I must then place a cipher
in the quotient, and cancel the
divisor, and remove it a place
nearer the right hand, without
cancelling the figures over
head, and continue the work as
before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:121279:23"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What else is to bee observed
in Division?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If the divisor have any
ciphers in the first places, they
may bee placed under the first
places of the dividend, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
only by the other figures,
till I come to those ciphers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What must be done with the
number that remains after the
division is ended?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If any remainder be, I set
it after the quotient, and the
divisor under it, with a line
drawn betwixt them, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it in a fraction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Give an Example or two in
Division.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Take this for one, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
30038 by 23, I set it down
thus,

Then having drawn a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

consider how often I can have
my divisor, 23 in the number

have but once, therefore <hi>I</hi> say,

               <p>Then <hi>I</hi> remove the divisor

<hi>I</hi> put 3 down in the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,

rests one, and that <hi>I</hi> set over

               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:121279:25"/>
Then I remove the divisor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
And it stands thus,

               <p>Then I consider that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take my divisor 23 out of
the number over it being but

and cancel the divisor,
and remove it one place more,
and let the figures over it stand

stands thus,

               <p>Now I consider again how

of the number over it, which

there rests one, which I set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

of the one sort makes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

As for example, when 3 marks
makes 2 pounds, then to turn
marks into pounds, I must mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Four Ells is equal to five
Yards, therefore any number
of Yards given, to know how
many Ells it contains, I multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
by 4, and divide by 5, but
if the number given bee Ells,

any number of pounds starling
being multiplied by 5, and the

pounds Flemmish, being multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by 3, and the product di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by 5, declares the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of pounds starling in the
quotient, the like proportion is
in Flemmish Ells, and English
Ells, because 5 Ells Flemmish is

Work in the Rule of Three?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, there is another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of work called the Backer
Rule of Three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why is it called the Backer
Rule of Three?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:121279:35"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because in the former wee
multiply the second by the
third, and divide by the first,
but in this wee multiply the
first by the second, and divide
by the third number.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the use of this Rule?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It serveth to finde out a
number that holds proportion
to the first, as the third doth to
the second.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Of what use is such propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
numbers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The use is manifold, as by

               <p>Shew 2 or 3 Examples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First, if 5 men do a peece
of work in 15 daies, how many
men will do the like in 3 daies?
here I multiply the first by the
second, comes 75, which divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the third, yeelds 25 in
the quotient, being the number
of men demanded.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> This, if a quantity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
serve 40 men 30 daies,
how many men will it serve 80
daies? here I multiply and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
according to rule, and
finde 15 men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Give one example more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Then thus, If 9 yards of
cloath, of yard broad, make a
man a suit &amp; cloak, how much
broad cloath of yard and half
broad will make another so
large; here I multiply 4 <choice>

and it yeelds 6 yards for the
length of the second cloth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there any other use here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, many, which the

but these shall serve at present
for an entrance.</p>

after the Division is ended?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It must bee annexed to

writ with a cipher, and a 5 thus
05, where 100 is understood for
denominator.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 34 ten thousand
parts is exprest thus 0034,

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yea, that not an unite
only may bee divided infinitely
into fractions or parts, but also

               <head>Reduction.</head>
               <p>Q. Now tell me what is Reduction?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Reduction is a changing
of numbers or fractions out of

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Either for more ease in
working, or for the more easie
estimation of the value of two
or more fractions, either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
one with another, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them together, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting
one from another.</p>
               <p>Q. How are fractions of several
denominations reduced to one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination?</p>
               <p>A. First multiply the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minators
together, and set the
product for a common denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:121279:40"/>
then multiply the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
of the first, by the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minator
of the second, and set
the product for a new numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
for the first fraction; and
multiply the numerator of the
second, by the denominator of
the first, and set the product for
the new numerator of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
fraction, and so are both
those fractions brought into one
denomination.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an Example hereof?</p>
               <p>A. Two thirds and three
quarters, being so reduced,
make 8/12 for 2/3, and 9/12 for 3/4, which
yet still retain their first value,
but are now both of one deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
               <p>Q. You have shewed how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
two Fractions into one deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
but what if there bee

               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:121279:41"/>A. Then I must multiply all
the denominators together, and
set the product down so many
times as there bee fractions, for
a common denominator to
them; and then multiply the
numerator of the first, by the
denominator of the second, and
the product by the denominator
of the third, and that by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominator
of the fourth, if I
have so many, and so forward,
and the product is a new nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merator
for the first fraction;
then multiply the numerator of
the second, by the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator
of the first, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
by the denominators of
the third and fourth, and so
forward, if you have so many,
and set the product for a new
numerator for the second fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and multiply your third
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:121279:41"/>
numerator by the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
denominators, and the
product by the denominator of
the fourth, if you have to many,
and that product is your third
numerator; then if you have so
many, multiply the numerator
of the fourth by the other three
denominators, the product is a
new numerator for the fourth
fraction, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Must this order then bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
still, when you have many
fractions?</p>
               <p>A. Yea, alwaies multiply all
the denominators together for
a new denominator, and one
numerator by all the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominators,
except its own, the
product is a new numerator
for that fraction whose nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
was taken to multiply
by.</p>

               <p>

have found a new denominator
as above, then divide the same

of the same, and the product
shall bee a new numerator for
that fraction, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If the lesser denominator
will by any multiplication
make the greater, then note the
multiplier, and by it multiply
the numerator over the lesser
denominator, and in place of
the lesser put the greater deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minator,

               <p>Q. What if I have a mixt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

into fraction form?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q And how reduce you such
an improper fraction into its unites

               <p>A. I must divide the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator

the quotient shews how many

Q. What bee the terms of a
Fraction?</p>
               <p>A. The terms bee the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
and denominator whereby
it is exprest.</p>
               <p>Q. What mean you by greatness
and smalness of terms?</p>
               <p>A. By great, I mean, when a
fraction is exprest in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
as 480/960 which in its smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
terms is (1/2) one half.</p>
               <p>Q. How are such reduced into
their smallest terms?</p>
               <p>A. If they be both even num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
by halfing them both so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as you can, but if they come
to bee odd, or either of them
odd, then by dividing them by
3, 5, 7, 9, &amp;c. which will divide
them both, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,
and take the last
numbers for the terms of the
fraction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:121279:44"/>
Q. But is there no way to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
what number would reduce a
fraction into its smallest terms,
but by halfing or parting in that
sort?</p>
               <p>A. Yes, thus, divide the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominator
by the numerator,
and if any thing remain, divide
the numerator by it, and if yet
any thing remain, divide the
last divisor by it, and so do till
nothing remain, and with your
last divisor, which leaves no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,
divide the numerator
of the fraction, and the quotient
is a new numerator, and divide
the denominator in like sort by
it, and the quotient is a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominator.</p>
               <p>Q. What if no number will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
them evenly, till it come to
one?</p>
               <p>A. Then the fraction is in its
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:121279:44"/>
smallest terms already.</p>
               <p>Q. How reduce you fractions
of one denomination, into another
denomination?</p>
               <p>A. I multiply the numerator
by the denominator, into which
I would reduce it, and divide
the product by the first denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator,
and the quotient is the
new numerator.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an Example of this.</p>
               <p>A. If 3/4 bee to bee turned into
twelfth parts, I multiply 12 by
3 comes 36, which I divide by
4, the quotient is 9, so it is 9/12, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to 3/4.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you multiply in

               <p>A. I multiply the numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

               <p>A. That two Fractions multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

               <p>Q. How comes that to bee,

signifies to augment or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
a thing manifold, or many
times?</p>
               <p>A. That is true, in whole
numbers. where a number is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by so many times as the
multiplier contains unites, but
in fractions wee must note, that
the multiplier being less than
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:121279:45"/>
one, it makes the product lesser
than the multiplicand; for so
often as the multiplier contains
unites, just so often doth the
product contain the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cand,
therefore (in fractions)
feeing the multiplier doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

bee imployed 6 daies, then to
earn 5<hi>l.</hi> by 3 men, what time is
required? where I multiply the
first number and the fifth num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
together (being the least
sum of mony, and the least

divisor, then I multiply the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
three numbers together,
comes 150 for my dividend,
which being divided, gives 16
in the quotient, and 6 remains,
which abreviated or reduced to
the least terms, is 2/3 so the whole
is 16 2/3 daies, as before.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is this done at two

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First I say, if 40 yards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
6 daies, how long time will
80 yards require? (by the Rule
of Three Direct) comes 12
daies; then I say, if 30 men bee
12 daies about it, how long
will 15 men bee about it by the
Backer Rule? and it comes to
24 daies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is this performed at
one working?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I say thus, if 40 yards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
30 men for 6 daies, then
to do 80 yards by 15 men, how
long time will it require? where
I multiply the first number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
40 yards, by the fifth num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
being 15 men, that is the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:121279:53"/>
least number of yards, and the
least number of men together,
that is, 40 by 15 comes 600 for
my divisor, then I multiply
the other three numbers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) 30 by 6 comes 180,
and that by 80 comes 14400 for
my dividend, which I divide by
my divisor, the quotient is 24
as before, being so many daies,
according to the denomination
of the middle number.</p>
               <p>Thus having briefly and
plainly explained the Rules, I
shall set down some questions,
with their resolutions, omitting
the work, that the young learner
may practise himself in them, or
such like, to make himself the
more ready in this Art.</p>
