         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HOW great a Loſs I had in the death of my moſt dear and honoured Friend, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Father, no man is
<pb facs="tcp:31856:4"/>
able to conjecture, but he that hath ſuffered in the like. So affable was his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Diſcourſe ſo ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, his Judgment ſo exact in moſt parts of Learning, and his Affections to the Church ſo Exemplary in him, that I never enjoyed a greater Felicity in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of any Man living, than I did in his: In which reſpects I may affirm both with Safety and Modeſty, that we did not only take <hi>ſweet Counſel together, but walked in the Houſe of God as Friends:</hi> I muſt needs ſay,
<pb facs="tcp:31856:4"/>
I was prepared for that great Blow, by the loſs of my Preferment in the Church of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which gave me the opportunity of ſo dear and beloved a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; ſo that I loſt him partly before he died, which made the Miſery the more ſupportable, when I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of him for altogether. But I was never more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the infelicity, than I am at this preſent, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that ſatisfaction, which I am ſure he could have given the Gentleman whom I am to deal with:
<pb facs="tcp:31856:5"/>
His eminent Abilities in theſe Political Diſputes, exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his Judicious Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques; as alſo in ſome paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges on <hi>Grotius, Hunton, Hobbs,</hi> and other of our late Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſers about Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, declare abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how fit a Man he might have been to have dealt in this cauſe, which I would not willingly ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by unskilful handling: And had he pleaſed to have ſuffered his Excellent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe called <hi>Patriarcha</hi> to appear in Publick, it would
<pb facs="tcp:31856:5"/>
have given ſuch ſatisfaction to all our great Maſters in the Schools of <hi>Politie,</hi> that all other Tractates in that kind, had been found unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>

               <hi>and Paternal Power, and their Agreement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SInce the time that School-Divinity began to flouriſh, there hath been a common Opinion maintained, as well by Divines, as by divers other Learned Men, which affirms,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mankind is naturally endowed and born with Freedom from all Subjection, and at liberty to chooſe what Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it pleaſe: And that the Power which any one Man hath over others, was at firſt beſtowed according to the diſcretion of the Multitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Tenent was firſt hatched in the Schools, and hath been foſtered by all ſucceeding Papiſts for good Divinity. The Divines alſo of the Reformed Churches have entertained it, and the Common People every where tenderly embrace it, as being moſt plauſible to Fleſh and Blood, for that it prodigally deſtributes a Portion of Liberty to the meaneſt of the Multitude, who magnifie Liberty, as if the height of Humane Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity were only to be found in it, never
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31856:10"/>
remembring That the deſire of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was the firſt Cauſe of the Fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But howſoever this Vulgar Opinion hath of late obtained a great Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it is not to be found in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers and Doctors of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church: It contradicts the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Hiſtory of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the conſtant Practice of all Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Monarchies, and the very Principles of the Law of Nature. It is hard to ſay whether it be more erroneous in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or dangerous in Policy.</p>
            <p>Yet upon the ground of this Doctrine both <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and ſome other zealous favourers of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Diſcipline, have built a perillous Concluſion, which is, <hi>That the People or Multitude have Power to puniſh, or deprive the Prince, if he tranſgreſs the Laws of the Kingdom;</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Buchanan:</hi> the firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Dolman,</hi> in the Third Chapter of his Firſt Book labours to prove, that Kings have been lawfully chaſtiſed by their Commonwealths: The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>atter in his Book <hi>De jure Regni apud</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:31856:11"/>
               <hi>Scotos,</hi> maintains A Liberty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to depoſe their Prince. Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Calume,</hi> both look aſquint this way.</p>
            <p>This deſperate Aſſertion whereby Kings are made ſubject to the <hi>Cenſures</hi> and <hi>Deprivations of their Subjects,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows (as the Authors of it conceive) as a neceſſary Conſequence of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Poſition of the ſuppoſed <hi>Natural Equality and Freedom of Mankind, and Liberty to chooſe what form of Government it pleaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though Sir <hi>John Heyward, Adam Blackwood, John Barclay,</hi> and ſome others have Learnedly Confuted both <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> and <hi>Parſons,</hi> and bravely vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Right of Kings in moſt Points, yet all of them, when they come to the Argument drawn from the <hi>Natural Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Equality of Mankind,</hi> do with one conſent admit it for a Truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, not ſo much as once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying or oppoſing it; whereas if they did but confute this firſt erroneous Principle, the whole Fabrick of this vaſt Engine of <hi>Popular Sedition</hi> would drop down of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:31856:11"/>
The Rebellious Conſequence which follows this prime Article of the <hi>Natural Freedom of Mankind</hi> may be my Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Warrant for a modeſt Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the original Truth of it; much hath been ſaid, and by many, for the <hi>Affirmative;</hi> Equity requires that an Ear be reſerved a little for the <hi>Negative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this DISCOURSE I ſhall give my ſelf theſe Cautions:</p>
            <p>Firſt, I have nothing to do to medle with Myſteries of State, ſuch <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> or Cabinet-Councels, the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar may not pry into. An implicite Faith is given to the meaneſt Artificer in his own Craft, how much more is it then due to a Prince in the profound Secrets of Government? The Cauſes and Ends of the greateſt politique Actions and Motions of State dazle the Eyes, and exceed the Capacities of all men, ſave only thoſe that are hourly verſed in the managing Publique Affairs: yet ſince the Rule for each men to know in what to obey his Prince, cannot be learnt without a relative Knowledge of thoſe Points wherein a Sovereign may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31856:12"/>
Command, it is neceſſary when the Commands and Pleaſures of Superiours come abroad and call for an Obedience, that every man himſelf know how to regulate his Actions or his Sufferings; for according to the Quality of the Thing commanded, an Active or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience is to be yielded; and this is not to limit the Princes Power, but the extent of the Subjects Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by giving to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſar's,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I am not to queſtion, or quarrel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the Rights or Liberties of this or any other Nation; my task is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enquire from whom theſe firſt came, not to diſpute what, or how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny theſe are; but whether they were derived from the Laws of <hi>Natural Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or from the <hi>Grace and Bounty of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> My deſire and Hope is, that the people of <hi>England</hi> may and do enjoy as ample Privileges as any Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven; the greateſt Liberty in the World (if it be duely conſidered) is for a people to live under a <hi>Monarch.</hi> It is the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of this Kingdom, all other ſhews or pretexts of Liberty, are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31856:12"/>
but ſeveral degrees of <hi>Slavery,</hi> and a <hi>Liberty</hi> only to deſtroy <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſuch as Maintain the Natural Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Mankind, take Offence at the Liberty I take to Examine it, they muſt take heed that they do not deny by Retail, that Liberty which they affirm by Whole-ſale: For, if the <hi>Theſis</hi> be true, the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> will follow, that all men may Examine their own Charters, Deeds, or Evidences by which they claim and hold the Inheritance or Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of their <hi>Liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, I muſt not detract from the Worth of all thoſe Learned Men, who are of a contrary Opinion in the Point of <hi>Natural Liberty:</hi> the profoundeſt Scholar that ever was known hath not been able to ſearch out every Truth that is diſcoverable; neither <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in Philoſophy, nor <hi>Hooker</hi> in Divinity. They are but Men, yet I reverence their Judgements in moſt Points, and confeſs my ſelf beholding to their Errors too in this; ſomething that I found amiſs in their Opinions, guided me in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that Truth which (I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31856:13"/>
my ſelf) they miſſed. A Dwarf ſometimes may ſee that which a Giant looks over; for whileſt one Truth is curiouſly ſearched after, another muſt neceſſarily be neglected. Late Writers have taken up too much upon Truſt from the ſubtile School-men, who to be ſure to thruſt down the King below the Pope, thought it the ſafeſt courſe to advance the People above the King, that ſo the Papal Power might take place of the Regal. Thus many an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Subject hath been fooled into this Faith, that a man may become a <hi>Martyr</hi> for his <hi>Countrey,</hi> by being a <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> to his <hi>Prince;</hi> whereas the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyned diſtinction of Subjects into Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alliſts and Patriots, is moſt unnatural, ſince the relation between King and People is ſo great, that their well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſo Reciprocal.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) To make evident the Grounds of this Queſtion, about the <hi>Natural Liberty of Mankind,</hi> I will lay down ſome paſſages of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that may beſt unfold the State of this Controverſie. <hi>Secular or Civil Power</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is inſtituted by Men; It is in</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:31856:13"/>
               <hi>the People, unleſs they beſtow it on a Prince. This Power is immediately in the whole Multitude, as in the Subject of it; for this Power is in the Divine Law, but the Divine Law hath given this Power to no particular Man—If the Poſitive Law be taken away, there is left no Reaſon, why amongſt a Multitude (who are Equal) one rather than another ſhould bear Rule over the reſt.—Power is given by the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to one man, or to more, by the ſame Law of Nature; for the Commonwealth cannot exerciſe this Power, therefore it is bound to beſtow it upon ſome One Man, or ſome Few.—It depends upon the Conſent of the Multitude to ordain over themſelves a King, or Conſul, or other Magiſtrates; and if there be a lawful Cauſe, the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude may change the Kingdom into an</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy <hi>or</hi> Democracy. Thus far <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine;</hi> in which paſſages are compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſtrength of all that ever I have read, or heard produced for the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Liberty of the Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I examine or refute theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, I muſt a little make ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon his Words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:31856:14"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſaith, that by the Law of God, <hi>Power</hi> is immediately in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; hereby he makes God to be the immediate Author of a <hi>Democratical Eſtate;</hi> for a <hi>Democracy</hi> is nothing elſe but the Power of the Multitude. If this be true, not only <hi>Ariſtocracies,</hi> but all <hi>Monarchies</hi> are altogether unlawful, as being ordained (as he thinks) by Men, whenas God himſelf hath choſen a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He holds, that although a <hi>Democracy</hi> be the Ordinance of God, yet the people have no power to uſe the Power which God hath given them, but only power to give away their Power; whereby it followeth, that there can be no <hi>Democratical Government,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith, the people muſt give their Power to One Man, or to ſome Few; which maketh either a <hi>Regal</hi> or <hi>Ariſtocratical Eſtate;</hi> which the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is tyed to do, even by the ſame Law of <hi>Nature</hi> which Originally gave them the <hi>Power:</hi> And why then doth he ſay, the <hi>Multitude</hi> may change the <hi>Kingdom</hi> into a <hi>Democracy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:31856:14"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He concludes, that if there be lawful Cauſe, the <hi>Multitude</hi> may change the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Here I would fain know who ſhall judge of this lawful Cauſe? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f the <hi>Multitude</hi> (for I ſee no Body elſe can) then this is a peſtilent and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Concluſion.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) I come now to examine that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which is uſed by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the One and only <hi>Argument</hi> I can find produced by my Author for the proof of the <hi>Natural Liberty of the People.</hi> It is thus framed: <hi>That God hath given or ordained Power, is evident by Scripture; But God hath given it to no particular Perſon, becauſe by Nature all Men are Equal; therefore he hath given Power to the People, or Multitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Anſwer this Reaſon, drawn from the Equality of Mankind by Nature, I will firſt uſe the help of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whoſe very words are theſe: <hi>If many men had been together created out of the Earth, they all ought to have been Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces over their Poſterity.</hi> In theſe words we have an Evident Confeſſion, that Creation made man Prince of his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31856:15"/>
And indeed not only <hi>Adam,</hi> but the ſucceeding <hi>Patriarchs</hi> had, by Right of Father-hood, Royal Authority over their Children. Nor dares <hi>Bellarmie</hi> deny this alſo. That the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> (ſaith he) were endowed with Kingly Power their Deeds do teſtifie; for as <hi>Adam</hi> was Lord of his Children, ſo his Children under him, had a Command and Power over their own Children; but ſtill with ſubordination to the Firſt Parent, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is Lord-Paramout over his Children Children to all Generations, as being the <hi>Grand-Father</hi> of his People.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) I ſee not then how the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> or of any man elſe can be free from ſubjection to their <hi>Parents:</hi> And this ſubjection of Children being the Fountain of all <hi>Regal Authority,</hi> by the Ordination of God himſelf; It follows that Civil Power not only in general i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by Divine Inſtitution, but even the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment of it ſpecifically to the Eldeſt Parents, which quite takes away tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Laſtly, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (if it had pleaſed him) might have remembred, That Nature doth not always make one Thing but for one Uſe: he knows, the Tongue ſerves both to Speak, and to Taſte.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) But to leave <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Suarez;</hi> he ſaith that <hi>Adam</hi> had Fatherly Power over his Sons, whilſt they were not made Free.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> know no means by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is the Favour I think of the Parents only, who when their Children are of Age and Diſcretion to eaſe their Parents of part of their Fatherly Care,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31856:29"/>
are then content to remit ſome part of their Fatherly authority; therefore the Cuſtom of ſome Countreys doth in ſome Caſes Enfranchiſe the Children of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Parents, but many Nations have no ſuch Cuſtome, but on the contrary have ſtrict Laws for the Obedience of Children: the Judicial Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> giveth full power to the Father to ſtone his diſobedient Son, ſo it be done in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Magiſtrate: And yet it did not belong to the Magiſtrate to enquire and examine the juſtneſs of the Cauſe: But it was ſo decreed, leſt the Father ſhould in his Anger, ſuddenly, or ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kill his Son.</p>
            <p>Alſo by the Laws of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and of the People of the Upper <hi>Aſia,</hi> and of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and by the Laws of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> the Parents have power of Life and Death over their Children.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> even in their moſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Eſtate, had this Law in force, and this Power of Parents was ratified and amplified by the Laws of the Twelve Tables, to the enabling of Parents to ſell their Children two or three times

over. By the help of the Fatherly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Rome</hi> long flouriſhed, and oftentimes was freed from great Dangers. The Fathers have drawn out of the very <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies</hi> their own Sons; when being <hi>Tribunes,</hi> they have publiſhed Laws ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Sedition.</p>
            <p>Memorable is the Example of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> who threw his Son headlong out of the Conſiſtory, publiſhing the Law <hi>Agraria,</hi> for the Diviſion of Lands, in the behoof of the people; and afterwards, by his own private Judgment put him to Death, by throwing him down from the <hi>Tarpei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Rock; the Magiſtrates and People ſtanding thereat amazed, and not daring to reſiſt his Fatherly Authority, although they would with all their Hearts, have had that Law for the Diviſion of Land: by which it appears, it was lawful for the Father to diſpoſe of the Life of his Child, contrary to the Will of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates or People. The <hi>Romans</hi> alſo had a Law, that what the Children got, was not their own, but their Fathers; although <hi>Solon</hi> made a Law, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted the Son from Nouriſhing of his Father, if his Father had taught him

no Trade, whereby to get his Living.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suarez</hi> proceeds, and tells us, That in Proceſs of Time, <hi>Adam</hi> had compleat <hi>Oeconomical</hi> Power. I know not what this compleat <hi>Oeconomical</hi> Power is, nor how, or what it doth really and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially differ from Political: If <hi>Adam</hi> did, or might exerciſe the ſame Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which a King doth now in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, then the Kinds of Power are not diſtinct; and though they may receive an Accidental Difference by the Amplitude, or Extent of the Bounds of the One beyond the Other; yet ſince the like Difference is alſo found in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical</hi> Eſtates, It follows that <hi>Oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> Power, differ no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than a Little Commonweal differs from a Great One. Next, ſaith <hi>Suarez, Commnnity did not begin at the Creation of</hi> Adam. It is true, becauſe he had no body to Communicate with; yet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity did preſently follow his Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that by his Will alone: for it was in his power only, (who was Lord of All) to appoint what his Sons ſhould have in <hi>Proper,</hi> and what in <hi>Common;</hi> ſo that <hi>Propriety</hi> and <hi>Community</hi> of Goods did follow Originally from Him;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31856:30"/>
and it is the Duty of a Father, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide as well for the Common Good of his Children, as the Particular.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Suarez</hi> Concludes, That by the Law of Nature alone, it is not due unto any Progenitor, to be alſo <hi>King</hi> of his <hi>Poſterity.</hi> This Aſſertion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed point-blank by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who expreſly affirmeth, That the Firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents ought to have been Princes of their poſterity. And untill <hi>Suarez</hi> bring ſome Reaſon for what he ſaith: I ſhall truſt more to <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Proofs, than to his Denials.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) But let us Condeſcend a while to the Opinion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> and all thoſe, who place Supreme pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Whole People; and ask them of their meaning be, That there is but one and the ſame power in All the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the World; ſo that no power can be granted, except All the Men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth meet and agree, to chooſe a Governour.</p>

But let this alſo be yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, That in each particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, there is a Diſtinct Power in the Multitude.

What can a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſay more?</p>
            <p>Indeed, the World for a long time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>new no other ſort of Government, out only Monarchy. The Beſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Greateſt Strength, the Moſt Stability and Eaſieſt Government, are to be found all in Monarchy, and in to other Form of Government. The New Platforms of Commonweals, were firſt hatched in a Corner of the World, amongſt a few Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> which have been imitated by very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ew other laces. Thoſe very Cities
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:31856:37"/>
were firſt, for many years, governed by Kings, untill <hi>Wantonneſs, Ambition</hi> or <hi>Faction</hi> of the People, made them attempt New kinds of Regiment; all which Mutations proved moſt Bloody and Miſerable to the Authors of them; happy in nothing, but that they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued but a ſmall time.</p>
            <p n="11">(11.) A little to manifeſt the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of Popular Government, let us but examine the moſt Flouriſhing Democratie that the World hath ever known; I mean that of <hi>Rome.</hi> Firſt, for the <hi>Durability;</hi> at the moſt, it laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but 480 Years (for ſo long it was from the Expulſion of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar.)</hi> Whereas both the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Monarchy laſted, without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, at the leaſt twelve hundred years, and the Empire of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued 1495 Years.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the Order of it, during theſe 480 years, there was not any One ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Form of Government in <hi>Rome:</hi> for after they had once loſt the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Power of Kings, they could not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31856:37"/>
find upon what Form of Government to reſt: their Fickleneſs is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they found things amiſs in every Change. At the Firſt they choſe two <hi>Annual Conſuls</hi> inſtead of Kings. Secondly, thoſe did not pleaſe them long, but they muſt have <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi> of the People to defend their Liberty. Thirdly, they leave <hi>Tribunes</hi> and <hi>Conſuls,</hi> and chooſe them <hi>Ten Men</hi> to make them Laws. Fourthly, they call for <hi>Conſuls</hi> and <hi>Tribunes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: ſometimes they chooſe <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> which were Temporary Kings, and ſometimes <hi>Military Tribunes,</hi> who had <hi>Conſular</hi> Power. All theſe ſhiftings cauſed ſuch notable Alteration in the Government, as it paſſeth Hiſtorians to find out any Perfect Form of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſo much Confuſion: One while the Senate made Laws, another while the People. The Diſſentions which were daily between the Nobles and the Commons, bred thoſe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Seditions about <hi>Uſury,</hi> about <hi>Marriages,</hi> and about <hi>Magiſtracy.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the <hi>Graecian,</hi> the <hi>Apulian,</hi> and the <hi>Druſian</hi> Seditions, filled the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31856:38"/>
the Temples, and the Capitol it ſelf, with Blood of the Citizens; the <hi>Social</hi> War was plainly Civil; the Wars of the Slaves, and the other of the Fencers; the Civil Wars of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> of <hi>Cataline,</hi> of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus, Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Antonius:</hi> All theſe ſhed an Ocean of Blood within <hi>Italy</hi> and the Streets of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, for their Government, let it be allowed, that for ſome part of this time it was <hi>Popular,</hi> yet it was Popular as to the City of <hi>Rome</hi> only, and not as to the Dominions, or whole Empire of <hi>Rome;</hi> for no <hi>Democratie</hi> can extend further than to One City.

            <p n="2">(2) The Unlimitted Juriſdiction of Kings is ſo amply deſcribed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> that it hath given Occaſion to ſome to Imagine, that it was, but either a Plot or Trick of <hi>Samuel</hi> to keep the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himſelf and Family, by frighting the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with the miſchiefs in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, or elſe a prophetical Deſcription only of the future III Government of <hi>Saul:</hi> But the Vanity of theſe Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures are judiciouſly diſcovered in that Majeſtical Diſcourſe of the true Law of free Monarchy; Wherein it is evidently ſhewed, that the ſcope of <hi>Samuel</hi> was to teach the People a dutiful Obedience to their King, even in thoſe things which themſelves did eſteem Miſchievous and Inconvenient; For by telling them what a King would do, he indeed inſtructs them what a Subject muſt Suffer; yet not ſo that it is Right for Kings to do Injury, but it is Right for them to go Unpuniſhed by the People if they do it: So that in this point it is all one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Samuel</hi> deſcribe a King, or a Tyrant,

            <p>As for the taking of the Tenth of their Seed, of their Vines, and of their Sheep, it might be a neceſſary Proviſion for their Kings Houſehold, and ſo belong to the Right of Tribute: For whereas is mentioned the taking of the Tenth it cannot agree well to a Tyrant, who obſerves no Proportion, in fleecing his People.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The taking of their Fields Vineyards, and Olive-trees, if it be by Force or Fraud, or without juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, to the Dammage of Private Perſons only, it is not to be defended but if it be upon the publick Charge and General Conſent, it might be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, as neceſſary at the firſt Erects on of a Kingdome; For thoſe who wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31856:55"/>
the Wiſdom of God ſaith, <hi>By me Kings Reign:</hi> But his meaning muſt be, that the Laws of Kings are Human Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Next, the <hi>Governours that are ſent by him;</hi> that is by the King, not by God, as ſome corruptly would wreſt the Text, to juſtifie Popular Governours as authorized by God, whereas in Gramatical Conſtruction [Him] the Relative muſt be referred to the next Antecedent, which is King; Beſides, the Antitheſis between Supreme and Sent, proves plainly that the Governours were ſent by Kings; for if the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours were ſent by God, and the King be an Humane Ordinance, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the Governours were Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, and not the King; Or if it be ſaid, that both King and Governours are ſent by God, then they are both equal, and ſo neither of them Supreme. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s meaning is in ſhort, obey the Laws of the King, or of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. By which it is evident, that neither St. <hi>Peter,</hi> nor S. <hi>Paul,</hi> intended other-Form of Government than only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical, much leſs any Subjecton of Princes to Humane Laws.</p>

That familiar diſtinction of the Schoolmen, whereby they Subject Kings to the Directive, but not to the Coactive Power of Laws, is a Confeſſion that Kings are not bound by the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws of any Nation: Since the Compulſory Power of Laws is that which properly makes Laws to be Laws; by binding men by Rewards or Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment to Obedience; whereas the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Law, is but like the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and direction which the Kings Council gives the King, which no man ſays is a Law to the King.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) There want not thoſe who Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the firſt invention of Laws was to Bridle and moderate the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great Power of Kings; but the truth is, the Original of Laws was for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Multitude in Order: Popular Eſtates could not Subſiſt at all without Laws; whereas Kingdoms were Govern'd many Ages without them. The People of <hi>Athens,</hi> as ſoon as they gave over Kings, were forced to give Power to <hi>Draco</hi> firſt, then to <hi>Solon,</hi> to make them
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:31856:56"/>
Laws, not to bridle Kings, but themſelves; and though many of their Laws were very Severe and Bloody, yet for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence they bare to their Law-makers they willingly ſubmitted to them. Nor did the People give any Limited Power to <hi>Solon,</hi> but an Abſolute Juriſdiction, at his pleaſure to Abrogate and Confirm what he thought fit; the People never challenging any ſuch Power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: So the People of <hi>Rome</hi> gave to the <hi>Ten Men,</hi> who were to chuſe and correct their Laws for the <hi>Twelve Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> an Abſolute Power, without any Appeal to the people.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) The reaſon why Laws have been alſo made by Kings, was this, when Kings were either buſyed with Wars, or diſtracted with Publick Cares, ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very private man could not have acceſſe to their perſons, to learn their Wills and Pleaſure; then of neceſſity were Laws invented, that ſo every particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject might find his <hi>Prince's Pleaſure</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyphered unto him in the Tables of his Laws, that ſo there might be no need to reſort to the King; but either for the Interpretation or Mitigation of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:31856:56"/>
or Rigorous Laws, or elſe in new Caſes, for a Supplement where the Law was Defective. By this means both King and People were in many things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaſed: Firſt, The King by giving Laws doth free himſelf of great and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Troubles, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did himſelf by chuſing <hi>Elders.</hi> Secondly, The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have the Law as a Familiar Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher and Interpreter of the King's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which being publiſhed throughout the Kingdom, doth repreſent the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Majeſty of the King: Alſo the Judges and Magiſtrates, (whoſe help in giving Judgment in many Cauſes Kings have need to uſe) are reſtrained by the Common Rules of the Law from uſing their own Liberty to the injury of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſince they are to judge according to the Laws, and not follow their own Opinions.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Now albeit Kings, who make the Laws, be (as King <hi>James</hi> teacheth us) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Laws; yet will they Rule their Subjects by the Law; and a King, governing in a ſetled Kingdom, leaves to be a King, and degenerates into a Tyrant, ſo ſoon as he ſeems to Rule according to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31856:57"/>
his Laws; yet where he ſees the Laws Rigorous or Doubtful, he may miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and interpret. General Laws made in Parliament, may, upon known Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to the King, by his Authority be Mitigated or Suſpended, upon Cauſes only known to him. And although a King do frame all his Actions to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws, yet he is not bound thereto, but at his good Will, and for good Example: Or ſo far forth as the General Law of the Safety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Weale doth naturally bind him; for in ſuch ſort only Poſitive Laws may be ſaid to bind the King, not by being Poſitive, but as they are naturally the Beſt or Only Means for the Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Common-Wealth. By this means are all Kings, even Tyrants and Conquerours, bound to preſerve the Lands, Goods, Liberties, and Lives of all their Subjects, not by any Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pial Law of the Land, ſo much as the Natural Law of a Father, which binds them to ratifie the Acts of their Fore-Fathers and Predeceſſors, in things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Publick Good of their Subjects.</p>

               <hi>them to rectifie whatſoever upon Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al they find to be better than the Written Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, all Laws are of themſelves Dumb, and ſome or other muſt be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Application of them to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, by examining all Circumſtances, to pronounce when they are broken, or by whom. This work of right Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Laws is not a thing eaſie or obvious for ordinary capacities; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires profound Abilities of Nature, for the beating out of the truth, witneſs the Diverſity, and ſometimes the contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Opinions of the learned Judges, in ſome difficult Points.</p>
            <p n="10">(10) Since this is the common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Laws, it is alſo moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Law-maker ſhould be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Application or Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Laws; and for this Cauſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the Kings of this Land have ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten perſonally in Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are ſtill Repreſentatively preſent in all Courts; the Judges are but ſubſtituted, and called the Kings Juſtices, and their Power ceaſeth when the King is in place. To this purpoſe, <hi>Bracton,</hi> that learned Chief Juſtice in the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:31856:63"/>
Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, ſaith in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms; In doubtful and obſcure points the Interpretation and Will of our Lord the King is to be expected; ſince it is his part to interpret, who made the Law; for as he ſaith in another place, <hi>Rex, &amp; non Alius debet Judicare, ſi So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus ad id ſufficere poſſit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The King, and no body elſe, ought to give Judgment, if He were able, ſince by vertue of his Oath he is Bound to it; therefore the King ought to exerciſe Power as the Vicar or Miniſter of God, but if our Lord the King be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to determine every cauſe, to eaſe part of his Pains by diſtributing the Burthen to more Perſons, he ought to chuſe Wiſe men fearing God,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>and make Juſtices of them:</hi> Much to the ſame purpoſe are the words of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Book of <hi>Laws,</hi> written by his appointment by <hi>John Briton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hereford, We will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that our own Juriſdiction be above all the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our Realm, ſo as in all manner of Felonies, Treſpaſſes, Contracts,</hi> and <hi>in all other Actions, Perſonal, or Real, We have power to yield ſuch Judgments as do appertain without other Proceſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we know the right truth as Judges.</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:31856:63"/>
Neither may this be taken to be meant of an imaginary Preſence of the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in His Courts, becauſe he doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after in the ſame place ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſet forth by themſelves the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of his Ordinary Courts; but muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction remaining in the King's Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Perſon. And that this then was no New-made Law, or firſt brought in by the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſts, appears by a <hi>Saxon</hi> Law made by King <hi>Edgar,</hi> in theſe words, as I find them in Mr. <hi>Lambert, Nemo in lite Regem appellato, niſi quidem domi Juſtitiam conſequi, aut impetrare non poterit, ſin ſummo jure domi urgeatur, ad Regem, ut is Onus aliqua ex parte Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, provocato. Let no man in Suit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the King, unleſs he may not get Right at home; but if the Right be too heavy for him, then let him go to the King to have it eaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Judicial Power of Kings was exerciſed before the Conqueſt, ſo in thoſe ſetled times after the Conqueſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Parliaments were much in uſe, there was a High-Court following the King, which was the place of Soveraign Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:31856:64"/>
both for matter of Law and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as may appear by a Parliament in <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt's time, taking Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>That the Chancellour and the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Bench ſhould follow the King, to the end that He might have always at hand able men for His Direction in Suits that came before Him:</hi> And this was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the time that the Court of Common-Pleas was made Stationary, which is an Evidence that the King reſerved a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power, by which he did ſupply the Want, or correct the Rigour of the Common Law; becauſe the <hi>Poſitive Law,</hi> being grounded upon that which happens for the moſt part, cannot fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee every particular which Time and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience brings forth.</p>
            <p n="12">(12.) Therefore though the Common Law be generally Good and Juſt, yet in ſome ſpecial Caſe it may need Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by reaſon of ſome conſiderable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance falling out, which at the time of the Law-making was not thought of. Alſo ſundry things do fall out, both in War and Peace, that require extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary help, and cannot wait for the Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Care of Common Law, the which is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:31856:64"/>
not performed, but altogether after one ſort, and that not without delay of help and expence of time; ſo that although all Cauſes are, and ought to be referred to the Ordinary Proceſſe of common Law, yet rare matters from time to time do grow up meet, for juſt Reaſons, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the aid of the abſolute Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Prince; and the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> hath been underſtood of the Inſtitution then made of the ordinary Juriſdiction in <hi>Common Cauſes,</hi> and not for reſtraint of the Abſolute Authority, ſerving only in a few rare and ſingular Caſes, for though the Subjects were put to great dammage by <hi>Falſe Accuſations</hi> and <hi>Malitious Suggeſtions</hi> made to the King and His Council, eſpecially during the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, whilſt he was abſent in the Wars in <hi>France,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as in His Reign divers Statutes were made, That provided none ſhould be put to anſwer before the King and His Council without due Proceſſe; yet it is apparent the neceſſity of ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings was ſo great, that both before <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's days, and in his time, and after his Death, ſeveral Statutes were made, to help and order the Proceedings
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:31856:65"/>
of the King and his Council. As the Parliament in 28. <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, <hi>That the Chancellour and Juſtices of the King's Bench ſhould follow the King; that ſo he might have near unto him ſome that be learned in the Laws, which be able to order all ſuch matters as ſhall come unto the Court, at all times when need ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</hi> By the Statute of 37. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Taliation</hi> was ordained, in caſe the <hi>Suggeſtion to the King proved untrue.</hi> Then 38. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. takes away <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,</hi> and appoints Impriſonment till the King and Party grieved be ſatisfied.

            <p>At a Parliament at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> 2. <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. when the Commons made Petition, <hi>That none might be forced by Writ out of</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, <hi>or by Privy Seal, to appear before the King and His Council, to anſwer touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Free-hold.</hi> The King's Anſwer was <hi>He thought it not reaſonable that He ſhould</hi>

            <p>Alſo in the <hi>13th</hi> year of his Reign, when the Commons did pray, that upon pain of Forfeiture, the <hi>Chancellour</hi> or <hi>Council</hi> of the King, ſhould not after the end of the <hi>Parliament</hi> make any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance againſt the Common Law; the King anſwered, <hi>Let it le uſed as it hath been uſed before this time, ſo as the Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Again, in the <hi>4th</hi> year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, when the <hi>Commons</hi> complained againſt <hi>Subpoena's,</hi> and other Writs, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>Likewiſe when for the ſame Cauſe Complaint was made by the Commons, <hi>Anno</hi> 3. <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. the King's Anſwer was, <hi>Le Roy s'adviſera, The King will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed;</hi> which amounts to a Denyal for the preſent, by a Phraſe peculiar for the Kings denying to paſs any Bill that hath paſſed the Lords and Commons.</p>

certain Circumſtances touching the Forms of Parliaments, which are fit to be conſidered.</p>

               <hi>Mercian</hi> Law: The <hi>Weſt Saxons</hi> were confined to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws; <hi>Eſſex, Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> and ſome other Places, were vexed with <hi>Daniſh</hi> Laws; The <hi>Northumbrians</hi> alſo had their Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. And until <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſors</hi> Reign, who was next but one before the Conquerour, the Laws of the Kingdom were ſo ſeveral and Uncertain, that he was forced to Cull a few of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and beſt of them, which were from him called St. <hi>Edwards</hi> Laws: Yet ſome ſay that <hi>Eadgar</hi> made thoſe Laws, and that the <hi>Confeſſor</hi> did but reſtore and mend them. <hi>Alfred</hi> alſo gathered out of <hi>Mulmutius</hi> laws, ſuch as he tranſlated into the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue. Thus during the time of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the Laws were ſo variable, that there is little or no likelihood to find any conſtant Form of Parliaments of the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="13">(13) A ſecond Point conſiderable is, whether in ſuch Parliaments, as was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the <hi>Saxon</hi>'s times, the Nobility <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd Clergy only were of thoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lies, or whether the Commons were alſo called; ſome are of Opinion, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hough none of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws do
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:31856:70"/>
mention the Commons, yet it may be gathered by the word <hi>Wiſemen,</hi> the Commons are intended to be of thoſe Aſſemblies, and they bring (as they conceive) probable arguments to prove it, from the Antiquity of ſome Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs that do yet ſend Burgeſſes, and from the Proſcription of thoſe in <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Demeſne,</hi> not to ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament. If it be true, that the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> had a Cuſtom to aſſemble Burgeſſes out of ſome of their Towns, yet it may be doubted, whether other Kingdoms had the ſame uſage; but ſure it is, that during the Heptarchy, the People could not Elect any Knights of the Shire, becauſe <hi>England</hi> was not then divided into Shires.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, there be of our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians who do affirm, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt cauſed the Commons firſt to be Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by Knights and Burgeſſes of their own Appointment, for before his Time only certain of the Nobility and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the Realm were called to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation about the moſt Important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State. If this Aſſertion be true it ſeems a meer matter of Grace of this
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:31856:70"/>
King, and proves not any Natural Right of the People, Originally to be admitted to chuſe their Knights and Burgeſſes of Parliament, though it had been more for the Honour of Parliaments, if a King, whoſe Title to the Crown had been better, had been Author of the Form of it; becauſe he made uſe of it for his unjuſt Ends. For thereby he ſecured himſelf againſt his Competitor and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother, by taking the Oaths of the Nobility in Parliament; and getting the Crown to be ſetled upon his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And as the King made uſe of the People, ſo they, by Colour of Parliament, ſerved their own turns; for after the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of Parliaments by ſtrong hand, and by the Sword, they drew from him the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> which he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rather to flatter the Nobility and People, as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> in his <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> of <hi>Parliaments</hi> doth affirm, in theſe words. <hi>The great Charter was not Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally granted Legally and Freely; for</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>the Firſt did but Uſurp the Kingdom, and therefore, the better to aſſure himſelf againſt</hi> Robert <hi>his Elder Brother, he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Nobility and People with their Charters; yea, King</hi> John, <hi>that Confirmed</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:31856:71"/>
               <hi>them, had the like reſpect, for</hi> Arthur <hi>Duke of</hi> Brittain <hi>was the undoubted Heir of the Crown, upon whom King</hi> John <hi>Uſurped,</hi> and <hi>ſo to conclude, theſe</hi> Charters <hi>had their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal from Kings</hi> de facto, <hi>but not</hi> de jure<hi>—the Great Charter had firſt an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Birth by Uſurpation,</hi> and <hi>was Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoſtered and ſhewed to the World by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">(15.) A third conſideration muſt be, that in the former Parliaments, inſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and continued ſince King <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt's time, is not to be found the Uſage of any Natural Liberty of the People; for all thoſe Liberties that are claimed in Parliament are the liberties of Grace from the King, and not the Liberties of Nature to the People; for if the liberty were Natural, it would give Power to the Multitude to aſſemble themſelves <hi>When</hi> and <hi>Where</hi> they pleaſe, to beſtow Soveraignty, and by Pactions to limit and direct the Exerciſe of it. Whereas, the Liberties of Favour and Grace, which are Claimed in Parliaments, are reſtrained both for Time, Place, Perſons, and other Circumſtances, to the Sole Pleaſure of the King. The People can
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:31856:71"/>
not Aſſemble themſelves, but the King, by his Writs, calls them to what place he pleaſes; and then again Scatters them with his Breath at an inſtant, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Cauſe ſhewed than his Will. Neither is the whole Summoned, but only ſo many as the Kings Writs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. The prudent King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, ſummoned always thoſe Barons of ancient Families, that were moſt wiſe, to his Parliament, but omited their Sons after their Death, if they were not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their Parents in Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nor have the whole people Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Election of Knights of the Shire or Burgeſſes, but only Free-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Counties, and Freemen in the Cities and Burroughs; yet in the City of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> all the Houſe-holders, though they be neither Free-men nor Free-holders, have Voices in their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Burgeſſes. Alſo during the time of Parliament, thoſe priviledges of the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> of freedom of Speech, Power to puniſh their own Members, to examine the Proceedings and Demeanour of Courts of Juſtice and Officers, to have acceſs to the King's Perſon, and the like, are not due by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:31856:72"/>
Natural Right, but are derived from the Bounty or Indulgence of the King, as appears by a ſolemn Recognition of the Houſe; for at the opening of the Parliament, when the Speaker is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King, he, in the behalf and name of the whole Houſe of Commons, humbly craves of His Majeſty, That He would be pleaſed to grant them their <hi>Accuſtomed Liberties</hi> of freedom of Speech, of acceſs to his Perſon, and the reſt. Theſe Priviledges are granted with a Condition implyed, That they keep themſelves within the Bounds and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of Loyalty and Obedience; for elſe why do the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict puniſhment themſelves upon their own Members for tranſgreſſing in ſome of theſe points; and the King, as Head, hath many times puniſhed the Members for the like Offences. The Power which the King giveth, in all his Courts, to his Judges or others to puniſh, doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Him from doing the like, by way of <hi>Prevention, Concurrence,</hi> or <hi>Evocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> even in the ſame point which he hath given in charge by a delegated Power; for they who give Authority by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, do always retain more than
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:31856:72"/>
they grant: Neither of the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes claim an <hi>Infallibility</hi> of not <hi>Erring,</hi> no more than a General Council can. It is not impoſſible but that the greateſt may be in Fault, or at leaſt Intereſted or Engaged in the <hi>Delinquency</hi> of one <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Member.</hi> In ſuch Caſes it is moſt proper for the Head to correct, and not to expect the <hi>Conſent</hi> of the <hi>Members,</hi> or for the Parties peccant to be their own Judges. Nor is it needful to confine the King, in ſuch Caſes, within the Circle of any one Court of Juſtice, who is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge in all Courts. And in rare and new Caſes rare and new Remedies muſt be ſought out; for it is a <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Common Law, In novo Caſu, novum Remedium eſt apponendum:</hi> and the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. giveth <hi>Power,</hi> even to the <hi>Clarks</hi> of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> to make <hi>New Forms</hi> of <hi>Writs</hi> in <hi>New Caſes,</hi> leſt any man that came to the <hi>King's Court</hi> of <hi>Chancery</hi> for help, ſhould be ſent away without <hi>Remedy:</hi> A <hi>Preſident</hi> cannot be found in <hi>every Caſe;</hi> and of things that happen ſeldom, and are not common, there cannot be a <hi>Common Cuſtom.</hi> Though <hi>Crimes Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> do poſe the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:31856:73"/>
a <hi>Preſident</hi> for a <hi>Condigne Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet they muſt not therefore paſs unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>I have not heard that the people, by whoſe Voices the Knights and Burgeſſes are choſen, did ever call to an account thoſe whom they had Elected; they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give them Inſtructions or Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons what to ſay, or what to do in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore they cannot puniſh them when they come home for doing amiſs: If the people had any ſuch power over their Burgeſſes, then we might call it, The Natural Liberty of the people, with a miſchief. But they are ſo far from puniſhing, that they may be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves for intermedling with Parliamentary Buſineſs; they muſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chuſe, and truſt thoſe whom they chuſe to do what they liſt; and that is as much liberty as many of us deſerve, for our irregular Elections of Burgeſſes.</p>

affirms in His true Law of free Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; and as <hi>Hooker</hi> teacheth us, <hi>That Laws do not take their conſtraining force from the Quality of ſuch as deviſe them, but from the Power that doth give them the Strength of Laws: Le Roy le Veult,</hi> the King will have it ſo, is the Interpretive Phraſe pronounced at the King's paſſing of every Act of Parliament: And it was the ancient Cuſtom for a long time, till the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, that the Kings, when any Bill was brought unto them, that had paſſed both Houſes, to take and pick out what they liked not, and ſo much as they choſe was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted for a Law: but the Cuſtom of the later Kings hath been ſo gracious, as to allow always of the entire Bill as it hath paſſed both Houſes.</p>

            <p>The Reverend Judges have had regard in their <hi>Proceedings,</hi> that before they would reſolve or give <hi>Judgment</hi> in new Caſes, they conſulted with the <hi>King's Privy Council.</hi> In the Caſe of <hi>Adam Brab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> who was aſſaulted by <hi>R.

(18.) In the laſt place, we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how much hath been attributed to the Opinions of the <hi>Kings Judges</hi> by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and ſo find, that the <hi>Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> hath guided and ruled the <hi>Judges,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> guided the Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Parliament</hi> of 28. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. The Commons made Suit, <hi>That</hi> William de la Poole, <hi>D. of</hi> Suffolke, <hi>ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priſon, for many Treaſons and other Crimes. The Lords of the Higher Houſe were doubtful what Anſwer to give, the Opinion of the Judges was demanded. Their Opinion was, that he ought not to be committed, for that the Commons did not charge him with any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Offence, but with General Reports and Slanders.</hi> This Opinion was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>In another Parliament, 31. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. (which was prorogued) in the Vacation <hi>the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons</hi> was condemned in a thouſand pound damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in an Action of Treſpaſs, and was committed to Priſon in Execution for the ſame. When the Parliament was re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, the <hi>Commons</hi> made ſuit to the King and Lords to have their Speaker delivered; the Lords demanded the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:31856:80"/>
Opinion of the Judges, whether he might be delivered out of Priſon by priviledge of Parliament; upon the Judges an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it was concluded, <hi>That the Speaker ſhould ſtill remain in Priſon, according to the Law, notwithſtanding the priviledge of Parliament, and that he was the Speaker:</hi> Which Reſolution was declared to the <hi>Commons</hi> by <hi>Moyle,</hi> the King's Serjeant at Law; and the <hi>Commons</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Kings Name, by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> (in the abſence of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> then Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour) to chuſe another Speaker.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In ſeptimo</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. a queſtion was moved in <hi>Parliament, Whether Spiritual Perſons might be convented before Temporal Judges for Criminal Cauſes.</hi> There Sir <hi>John Fineux,</hi> and the other Judges, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Opinion, <hi>That they might and ought to be: and their Opinion was allowed and maintained by the King and Lords, and Dr.</hi> Standiſh, <hi>who before had holden it; the ſame Opinion was delivered from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</hi>

            <p>If a Writ of Errour be ſued in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon a Judgment given in the <hi>Kings</hi>

               <hi>Bench,</hi> the Lords of the higher Houſe alone, (without the <hi>Commons)</hi> are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Errours; the Lords are to proceed according to Law, and for their Judgment therein they are to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the advice and counſel of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, who are to inform them what the <hi>Law</hi> is, and ſo to direct them in their Judgment; for the Lords are not to follow their own Opinions or Diſcretions otherwiſe.
