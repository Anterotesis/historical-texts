            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sir Fleetwood Sheppard, &amp;c.</head>

               <l>WHile the vain Fop his vainer Mistress sues,</l>
               <l>Growing more slavish as he longer Woo's,</l>
               <l>(For she but flies because the Sot pursues)</l>
               <l>You, Sir, a safer, nobler way have ran,</l>
               <l>For an ill Age a general Good began,</l>
               <l>And shewn the ways of Liberty to Man.</l>
               <l>Vnpitied let the Husband mourn his strife,</l>
               <l>That Woo's, and Lies, and labours for a Wife.</l>
               <l>Mean while to you our Praise we justly pay,</l>
               <l>Whom Woman's utmost Art cou'd ne'er betray,</l>
               <l>Or all her charms seduce to quit your Native Sway.</l>
               <l>Learning and Prudence rais'd you safe, above</l>
               <l>The snares of Wedlock, and the smiles of Love;</l>
               <l>In their embrace a nobler Prize you sought,</l>
               <l>And to their Empire lasting Conquests brought.</l>
               <l>'Twas strange to be the Foe of Love so Young.</l>
               <l>But stranger to retain the Bent so long.</l>
               <l>Nor heat of Youth, nor yet your Elder Years</l>
               <l>(For many a Man is fonder as he wears)</l>

               <l>'Twas not because you never saw the Flame;</l>
               <l>In Crouds of Beauties you were still the same,</l>
               <l>And, looking back, despis'd the following Game:</l>

               <l>And <hi>Parthian</hi> like, secur'd the Conquest by Retreat:</l>
               <l>Disarm'd of all their Darts, the Fantoms fled,</l>
               <l>By your persisting Sense their Pow'r struck dead,</l>

Proud to his senseless Songs to Print his Name,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>This bad, and yet that other Songster's worse,</l>
               <l>Whose <hi>Madrigals</hi> flow only from his Purse,</l>
               <l>So much for <hi>Making</hi> he at first bestows,</l>

               <l>The singing Master sharps another Spill;</l>
               <l>Ah! Sir, he gargling cries,—<hi>That Note must kill!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>At Midnight he for Serenade prepares,</l>
               <l>As if (alike disturbing sickly Ears)</l>
               <l>He must ring his Chimes when the Bells go theirs.</l>
               <l>In vain this Cost and Toil; for still 'tis found</l>

               <l>Some Brawny Groom, as thus the Fop hums on,</l>
               <l>Cries Ough, and Mounts, and the Love-suit is done.</l>
               <l>Thus to the Fool the Filly's ready broke,</l>

               <l>Sot! only fit to make his Court to Trees,</l>
               <l>That hopes a Cure, yet tells not his Disease.</l>
               <l>If she appears he shakes, a Deathlike Pale</l>
               <l>Sits on his Visage—but the mournful Tale</l>
               <l>Some Friend, at last, to the lov'd Lady bears,</l>
               <l>And with the tender Accents wounds her Ears:</l>
               <l>She Melts, and now the Joy he wish't is come;</l>
               <l>VVon without VVords, she's born in Triumph home—</l>
               <l>Happy! if he wou'd still continue Dumb,</l>
               <l>And pray the Pow'rs to take his Hearing too,</l>
               <l>And save him from the Clamour to ensue.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If by his Cowardice this gets Success,</l>
               <l>The Bully, you may Judge, expects no less:</l>
               <l>Mad to enjoy, he ventures Life and Limb,</l>
               <l>As if the Nymph were only made for him;</l>
               <l>And Marriage were not binding, just, or good,</l>
               <l>Unless he cut his way to it thro' Blood.</l>
               <l>Thus the first hour we loving Fops commence,</l>
               <l>Away goes Christianity and Sense.</l>
               <l>A Father's Precepts lose their pious force,</l>
               <l>For Counsel makes a hardn'd Blockhead worse.</l>
               <l>Still he fights on, and the most Common Drab</l>
               <l>He meets with, Courts with Duel and with Stab:</l>

So that at last (from Justice fled for fear)</l>

               <l>By dext'rous Management, you still must shew</l>
               <l>Her good results from her Delight in you.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:44898:13"/>
Give her full freedom; too severe restraint</l>
               <l>Estranges Love, and makes Affection faint.</l>
               <l>Let her wear whet she will; your Happiness</l>
               <l>Lies in your being easy, not her Dress.</l>
               <l>No sullenness must in your looks be worn,</l>
               <l>And all her Pets must patiently be born,</l>
               <l>For y'are her Cuckold if y'are once her scorn.</l>
               <l>If all this keeps her not to Virtue fast,</l>
               <l>Conclude no Woman ever yet was Chast:</l>
               <l>But if this Usage does her Soul encline</l>
               <l>To Truth, she's happy, and her Joy is thine,</l>
               <l>And only so the Marriage Knot's Divine:</l>
               <l>For as it stands among the Vulgar Fry,</l>
               <l>Or Gentry either, where there's Jealousy,</l>
               <l>Jack Ketch,s Noose is far the Holier Tye.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>All this is hard, <hi>you'l cry,</hi> extreamly hard!</l>
               <l>And if such Doctrine met the World's regard,</l>
               <l>The Trade of Lisences wou'd soon be marr'd.</l>
               <l>Tis what one of Ten Thousand ne'er cou'd do.</l>
               <l>—Faith, Sir, I am of your Opinion too.</l>
               <l>'Tis therefore I'm so earnest with the Men,</l>
               <l>Before they Noose to think—and think agen.</l>
               <l>If with a Wife he Happiness wou'd see,</l>
               <l>Just such a Creature must a Husband be:</l>
               <l>Nay often too with all this Kindness shewn,</l>
               <l>His Heir shall be her Bantling, not his own.</l>

            <lg>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:44898:13"/>
               <l>Thus, Sir, I've freely answer'd your request,</l>
               <l>Marry, or Marry not, as like's you best.</l>
               <l>But now tis time some Counsel to bestow</l>
               <l>Upon <hi>Sir Passionate,</hi> the Am'rous <hi>Beau,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That he at need may scape a scowring too.</l>
               <l>If in his Breast he finds the Poison strong,</l>
               <l>H'has then this Comfort 'twill not Rack him long,</l>
               <l>The warmer Love the sooner 'twill be cold,</l>
               <l>For no extreme in Nature long can hold.</l>
               <l>But if the Venom yet more dang'rous prove,</l>
               <l>Take what I here prescribe—and laugh at Love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>First set before your Eyes as fair a Piece</l>
               <l>As ever Ancient <hi>Rome</hi> produc'd, or <hi>Greece;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Brighter than <hi>Hellen</hi> that set <hi>Troy</hi> on Fire,</l>
               <l>And chast as Infants that ne'er knew desire:</l>
               <l>That Icy Virtue keeps the Lover warm,</l>
               <l>(For nothing that's Immodest long can Charm)</l>
               <l>Strip but this Puppet of it's Gay attire,</l>
               <l>It's—Gauzes, Ribbons, Lace, Commode and Wire,</l>
               <l>And tell me then what 'tis thou dost admire?</l>
               <l>First 'tis her pretty Shoe that so prevails;</l>
               <l>The charm can ne'erly in her Toes and Nails.</l>
               <l>Her Leg, long, little, wretchedly compos'd,</l>
               <l>Shall hinder what is worse to be disclos'd,</l>
               <l>Only her Breasts there is no passing by,</l>
               <l>Because made bare to Court th' admiring Eye:</l>
               <l>These, when they Lace, up to their Chins they Buoy,</l>
               <l>And in short heavings artfully employ:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:44898:14"/>
There they look well; but when the Night is come</l>
               <l>They'r down agen just even with the Bum.</l>
               <l>Next, let her nat'ral Sett of Teeth be shown,</l>
               <l>If she's not Thirty, for she then has none;</l>
               <l>With eating Sweet-meats rotted from the Gum;</l>
               <l>So that her Breath is not the best Perfume.</l>
               <l>Her Face, indeed, we own were wond'rous fair,</l>
               <l>If there a Head belong'd to't that had Hair.</l>
               <l>Upon old <hi>Time</hi> you may a <hi>Forelock</hi> find,</l>
               <l>But theirs are false, or brought round from behind.</l>
               <l>Thus Woman, tho by Fools and Flatt'rers Fam'd,</l>
               <l>Let her Defects from Head to Foot be nam'd,</l>
               <l>Is the most vain unfinish't Peice that Nature ever Fram'd</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This nice inspection of her Person done,</l>
               <l>Let all her little Implements be shown:</l>
               <l>Open her secret Boxes; Patches here</l>
               <l>You'l hoarded find, her Paints and Washes there:</l>
               <l>Loves artfull Lime twigs, where the chatt'ring Ape</l>
               <l>Sits Perch'd, and han't the Judgment to Escape;</l>
               <l>Pleas'd with his Station there the Buzzard sings,</l>
               <l>But finds his Shackles when he'd use his Wings.</l>
               <l>If in her Bed you e'er perceive her fast,</l>
               <l>Mind how her Face is crusted o'er with Past,</l>
               <l>Or nasty Oils us'd nightly to repair</l>
               <l>Her Skin, quite spoil'd—with taking of the Air.</l>
               <l>The scatter'd Pieces of her artfull Frame</l>
               <l>(More than wou'd take up a whole Day to Name)</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44898:14"/>
Lie strew'd around, and such a Prospect Yield,</l>
               <l>As Spoils when Routed Armies leave the Field.</l>
               <l>Hip-Cushions, Plumpers, Massy Pads for Stays—</l>
               <l>And thousand other things, dispers'd a thousand ways.</l>
               <l>So that the Fair (like Bone lace when 'tis wrought)</l>
               <l>Can't altogether in one Piece be brought</l>
               <l>(Her Toils in order and her Am'rous Gins)</l>
               <l>Without five hundred Pound a Year in Pins.</l>
               <l>A thoughtfull Creature must conclude from hence</l>
               <l>The best of 'em not worth that vast Expence;</l>
               <l>That the short snatches of Delight we court,</l>
               <l>We pay so dear for that it palls the Sport.</l>
               <l>Then, what a perfume where she comes is lent?</l>
               <l>All over strew'd to hide her nat'ral scent.</l>
               <l>So they that stink of <hi>Onions,</hi> if they eat</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Garlick,</hi> twill make the fainter smell retreat;</l>
               <l>But then a stronger scent supplies the Room:</l>
               <l>And so she cures her Rankness by perfume.</l>
               <l>Thus Wooing different we from hunting find</l>
               <l>For there w'are pleas'd when Puss is in the Wind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If o're the Fop his Passion yet prevails,</l>
               <l>And he'l weigh Reason only in his Scales,</l>
               <l>Neither to be perswaded, forc'd or sham'd,</l>
               <l>But, proud of Bondage, scorns to be reclaim'd;</l>
               <l>Let him Woo on—A little time will shew</l>
               <l>He is an Ass, and all our Doctrine true.</l>
