            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. Concerning the purely Divine Nature, and <hi>Things</hi> thereof.</head>
            <p n="1">1. GOD in his Divine Nature was infinitely blessed in the Sight and Enjoyment of himself from all Eternity, above and beyond all possibility of Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Diminution to his Blessedness, by any thing, meer Creatures, Angels or Men, good or bad, can ever be, think, say or do, to all Eternity; yea, even Creature-nature, in the Mediator's won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful compounded Person, set up by the immediate Divine Hand (though by unchangeable personal Union with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, all one incomprehensible God) adds not to the infinite Blessedness of the Divine Nature; but <hi>was set up from the Beginning, and possess'd by the Lord
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43038:3"/>
in the beginning of his Way,</hi> towards the Creation of Angels and Men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22, 23. This was <hi>the Beginning of the Creation of God,</hi> Revel. 3. 14. Divine Nature had no Beginning.</p>
            <p>The whole Creature-part in Christ's Person, Root and exalted Branch, adds not to the Glory of the Divine Nature, but was set up in reference to the twofold Creation of Angels and Men, natural and spiritual, and as the Means to let down the Visions of the Divine Glory at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-hand, with safety to the spiritual Sight, Understanding and Enjoyment of blessed Angels and Men in their new-created Capacities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Divine Nature, the Divine Essence and Form are the infinite Divine Father and Son. The Divine Form, Image or Glory of the Divine Essence, is the Son thereof, by eternal and ineffable Generation; very God of very God, in the most absolute Sense; co-equal and co-eternal with the Father; both are one Infinite, Incomprehensible, Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But the Divine Essence is not the Form; nor Form the Essence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43038:3"/>The Three distinct invisible Powers in the Divine Essence or Father, did from all Eternity shine forth in the divine Form or Son, to God's own infinite Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, Enjoyment and Delight. The same three are, therein, the immediate Object of Sight and Enjoyment, to the whole Creature-part of the Mediator, Root and exalted Branch, as in unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able personal Union with the Divine Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Form in him; but are never so to any meer Creatures, blessed Angels or Saints, to all Eternity, in Heaven. They can never so <hi>approach unto,</hi> or see and enjoy <hi>the Divine Light</hi> or Glory, immediately, as he does, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 18. In, with, and through his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Creature-Spirit, as born of that which in him <hi>is God,</hi> (<hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1.) and therein <hi>Partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> (2 Pet. 1. 4.) can and will they see and enjoy the Divine Glory, mediately, as let down to them by the exalted Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Son and Branch, being Members of that spiritual Body, his true Gospel-<hi>Church,</hi> to which he, therein, <hi>is Head, Col.</hi> 1. 18. For this Purpose <hi>it pleas'd the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43038:4"/>
Father</hi> or Divine Essence, <hi>that even in</hi> the lowest Creature-part of <hi>the Mediator,</hi> the exalted Son and Branch, <hi>all Fulness should dwell,</hi> all the divine and Creature-fulnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Perfections of his divine Form and Creature-root.</p>
            <p>The Divine Essence, singly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractedly consider'd, in and by it self, is absolutely invisible for ever; nor will the Divine Form, Glory, Image, or Visibility thereof, and of the three that are one, therein, ever be the immediate Object of Sight and Enjoyment to any meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, blessed Angels or Saints, to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; but only to the whole Creature-nature in Christ's Person, Root and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Branch. Never will any meer Creatures be found in personal Union with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, as Creature-nature in Christ is. They will never have Divine Nature, an Ingredient into their personal Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; or as the supream Principle of Life and Operation in them, as some in our Days have most presumptuously and unwarrantably affirm'd: for then would there be an innumerable Multitude of Christs and Gods, the greater sort of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytheism.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:43038:4"/>The Divine Form or Son, is <hi>the Eternity,</hi> the supream Heaven of Heavens, <hi>the high and lofty</hi> Divine Essence, or Father <hi>inhabited</hi> from all Eternity, in distinction from the Creature-form, Glory or Image thereof; <hi>the high and holy Place,</hi> or heavenly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-temple, of immediate <hi>Divine Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (<hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 1.) in personal Union with the Divine inhabitant, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15.</p>
            <p>This heavenly Creature-Spirit, House and Temple, with the Life and Things of God therein, was prepar'd by and within himself, to be communicated in the distinct appointed Portions thereof, <hi>to them that love him</hi> (1 Cor. 2. 9.) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he first,</hi> even from Eternity, <hi>lov'd them,</hi> 1 John 4. 19. These spiritual, heavenly Creature-things of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to Men and Angels, by a new or second Creation, are quite out of the reach or sight of the highest single natural Understanding of Man, at best, in the but restor'd first-Covenant-Law-life of the Creature, given in the first Creation. No intellectual Eye, Ear or Heart, therein, <hi>can see, hear,</hi> perceive, conceive, receive, own, <hi>or know</hi> what to make of them;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43038:5"/>
               <hi>Isa.</hi> 64.4. Hence does Man <hi>account them,</hi> and all right Words about them, <hi>Foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 9, 14. Here's the Case of Man at best, in but <hi>the living Soul of the first</hi> Adam: In the Life of <hi>the quickning Spirit of the second</hi> Adam, and the new, spiritual, infallible, all-discerning Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, therein, do Saints <hi>see and know all things,</hi> divine, and both spiritual and natural Creature-things, (in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Differences, Distinctions, Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Superiorities) even <hi>the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 10. And as they have an infallible Understanding to know all things; they have also therein, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible Will, in unchangeable Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with the Infinite Divine Will, for the doing all things after God's own Heart. In his Heavenly Creature-<hi>Spirit, can any</hi> rightly <hi>worship his Divine Spirit,</hi> John 4. 23. In it only can any rightly perform all Duties to God, and to their Fellow-Creatures. All these things lie hid from (and are unpracticable by) Man, as out of the Reach of his own Understanding, and desiring or performing Power of his own Will. So will he not regard, look, or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43038:5"/>
               <hi>seek after God,</hi> for <hi>the Life</hi> and things <hi>hid with Christ in God,</hi> Rom. 3. 11. Col. 3. 3. <hi>Paul,</hi> with others that come to be true Saints, till the spiritual Seed of true Life be waken'd up in them, are wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of any such heavenly Creature-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Life and things of God, however eminent in restor'd Law-life, Wisdom and Righteousness of Man, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. Hence they verily think <hi>they do God Service,</hi> in persecuting Gospel-Saints, as the arrantest Hereticks and Blasphemers in the World, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 9, 11. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 2. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd natural Man, at best, understands not the transform'd, truly regenerate spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Man's Understanding, nor any of the Divine or spiritual things, he thereby understands and speaks of. <hi>He cannot know them</hi>; for <hi>they can only be spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally discern'd,</hi> and he has no spiritual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. If therefore he fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>lean and trust to his own Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> at highest, <hi>for directing his Steps,</hi> contrary to God's Counsel, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 5, 6. <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 23.) he is gone for ever, he never sets one Foot in the Paths of Life. A Man of deepest Reason, most soaring,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43038:6"/>
searching, natural Capacity, vastest Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his rational and intellectual Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with all Imbelishments of Art or acquir'd Accomplishments, may be <hi>Paul</hi>'s most <hi>unreasonable Man</hi> to be dealt with, or discours'd, in Gospel-Matters, <hi>which he therefore desir'd his Thessalonian Converts to pray for his Deliverance from,</hi> 2 Thess. 3. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>What's here said in this first Chapter, may give some aim towards right thoughts of God's Divine Nature and Things, which are to be acknowledg'd above and beyond all Conception or Language, by the Understanding or Tongue of natural Man or Angel; yea, will be Master of wonder to blessed Angels and Saints to all Eternity, in their spiritual new-Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation-Capacities.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. The twofold Purposes or Counsels of God within himself from Eternity, with reference to the twofold Creation of Angels and Men.</head>
            <p n="1">1. GOD, in the free Purposes and Counsels of his own Divine Mind, did, from Eternity, when he pleas'd, determine to create Angels and Men, and to give them immortal Spirits, by a first Creation; but, to put into them <hi>a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Seed</hi> (1 Pet. 1. 23.) of a mortal, earthly, though pure and spotless, First-Covenant Law-life, in which to be but mystical <hi>Trees of Good and Evil.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>he will break down this first Building, and pluck up this Tree</hi> (though <hi>of his own planting</hi>) by the Roots, <hi>Ier.</hi> 45.4. This changeable good Life and Things, given them in their first Creation, could not answer the Needs and Wants of their immortal Spirits, nor enable them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43038:7"/>
the whole Counsel, Will, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, in an everlasting well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing active Obedience to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He did, therefore, in his Free-Grace-Purposes (another sort of Counsels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himself) determine, from the same Eternity, by his own immmediate divine Power, to form, produce and set up a heavenly Creature-spirit of originally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Holiness, everlasting Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, infallible Truth, and eternal Life, and to take it into personal Union with his divine Nature, in the Mediator.

            <p>The new and everlasting Covenant-Life (given by a second Creation of them) God's own heavenly Creature-life (with all the things thereof, the Wisdom and Righteousness of God therein) is a Life, a Glory, that unspeakably <hi>excels</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>and will remain for ever,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 10, 11.

            <head>CHAP. III. The preparatory Condescensions of God, towards accomplishing the said two-fold Purposes or Counsels, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the twofold Creation of Angels and Men.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE first of the three distinct Powers in the Divine Nature, call'd Father, did by the peculiar Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof, in the one Divine Mind of all three, produce, beget, form and set up a Creature-spirit of originally immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Holiness, everlasting Righteousness, infallible Truth, and eternal Life. This, in the Creature-part of Christ's wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful compounded Person, is call'd by the Name of its peculiar Divine Producer, Father.</p>
            <p>This was the first Step of God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Condescension towards the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Angels and Men; <hi>the Beginning of the Creation of God</hi> (Revel. 3. 14.)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43038:9"/>
that will have no ending. This is the supream Root of all Creature-being and Life, in both Creations or <hi>Worlds</hi> (Heb. 1. 2.) natural and spiritual, by a first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Creation of Angels and Mer, and also of the Creature-Son and Branch in the very Mediator's Person. This originally unchangeable Creature-Spirit, in personal Union with the divine Nature, was situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated too high, above the Capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the immediate Hand of God, either for the first Creation of Angels and Men, or the giving them eternal Life by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, so as to answer and fulfil the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Counsels of God concerning them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second therefore of the Divine Three in One, call'd the Word, did, in the one Divine Mind of the Three, cause the said Creature-root to bring forth a Creature-Son and Branch, in the Fountain-purity of all earthly mortal First cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Law-life, determin'd of God to be set up in Angels and Men, by a first Creation of them.</p>
            <p>This Creature-Son and Branch is call'd by the Name of its peculiar divine Causer, in the Creature-part of the Mediator's
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43038:9"/>
Person, the Word. This Word, as <hi>the Lamb slain from the Foundation of the World,</hi> (Revel. 13. 8.) and exalted by and out of that Death, into the originally unchangeable Life of his Creature-root and Father, became the living Word of God, and immediate Creator of all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, by a first Creation, and of an innumerable Multitude of both by a second. He will also be the immediate Performer of the whole Divine Will, on all Angels and Men, good and bad, in the final Love or Wrath of God, in Heaven or Hell, to all Eternity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In order to all this, did the third of the Divine Three, call'd Holy Ghost, cause the said Creature-root and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the supream mystical <hi>Abraham,</hi> to perform a sacrificing Death-work on his Creature-Son; and caus'd the said Creature-Son, as the supream mystical <hi>Isaac,</hi> not only to submit thereto, in a compleat Passive Obedience to the Divine Will; but (in the supreamly partaken of heavenly Creature-life of his Root, and Love thereto) to join therewith, in Active Obedience to the Divine Will, for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43038:10"/>
on the said Death-work on himself. The like did he, in our mortal Nature, when in the Fulness of God's appointed time, taken by him, in the Fountain-pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thereof, above and beyond what it was in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> before his Fall. He was, therein, also <hi>full of Grace and Truth,</hi> John 1. 14. <hi>full of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Luke 4.1. <hi>He was Son of Man in Heaven</hi> (in full Possession of the eternal Life of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-root, without any mortal Life about him) at same time, that he was Son of Man on Earth in our mortal Nature (<hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 13.) and long before. All in Christ's Person, below his infinite Divinity and Creature-root, is call'd Man. His whole Creature-nature, Root and Branch, in personal Union, is the heavenly Creature-spirit or Holy Ghost, render'd communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to Angels and Men, by the exalted Creature-Son and Branch. This Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Son was one of the three Men that did eat of <hi>Abram</hi>'s Meat, else would not have own'd his worshipping him, in Prayer, for <hi>Sodom,</hi> when the other two created Angels were gone towards it, to destroy it, and deliver <hi>Lot, &amp;c.</hi> The
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43038:10"/>
two good Angels are also call'd Men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 1-8. and <hi>v.</hi> 22-33. Satan al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so with his evil Angels, <hi>are Men of Sin,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>Christ was active in carrying on the Death-work upon himself, as First-born of every Creature; and so was he, in his second Sacrifice, by carrying on the Death of our whole mortal Nature, in him, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Soul and Body. By the Holy Ghost or heavenly Creature-spirit in him, did he crucify the Spirit of our Nature in himself, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 49, 50. He was also a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Giver up of his Body into the Hands of Men, under Devils, to put a full Period to all that was mortal about him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 17, 18. <hi>He laid down the Life of our</hi> whole mortal <hi>Nature, and took it up again,</hi> in the originally incorruptible, immortal, eternal Creature-life of his Root, above all Deaths, or Enemies. And by his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated heavenly Creature-spirit, or Holy Ghost in Saints, will he enable them to be active in carrying on the like Death-work on the Spirit of Nature, at best, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and freely also to give up their bodily Life, into the Hands of evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43038:11"/>
and Men, God's and their Enemies, where God so permits and orders, for the witnessing his Gospel-Truths.</p>
            <p>The Record, Witness, or Products of the first and second of the Divine Three, Father and Word, in the Creature-part of the Mediator's Person, as brought into inseparable Union by the Third, bears the Name of the peculiar Divine Causer, Holy Ghost. All these things were transacted and done, by and within God himself, before any meer Creatures, Angels or Men were brought forth. The Three in the Divine Nature, <hi>with their Record in Heaven</hi> (the Divine Form) <hi>are one</hi>; and <hi>the same Three, as bearing Witness in Earth</hi> (the Creature-part of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor) <hi>agree in one.</hi> The one Divine Mind is declar'd and done, in and by both, and all, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.7,8. By what was done of the Divine Three, by their distinct Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts and Operations, in the Creature-part of the Mediator, will they let down themselves to the Sight and Enjoyment of blessed Angels and Saints for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:43038:11"/>The Divine is not the Creature-nature in Christ; nor, in his whole Creature-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the Creature-root, the exalted Branch. And his whole Divine and Creature-Person, is most intimately one with the Divine Essence or Father, <hi>the Head of all in him,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 3.

himself, as <hi>the Lamb slain</hi> in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-purity of the first, and ascended into the originally unchangeable Gospel-life of the second, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. All this was done within God himself, by the Mediator, as the <hi>Lamb slain from</hi> (or in) <hi>the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both Worlds</hi> (natural and spiritual, this World and the World to come) laid in himself, the Creator of both.

This is the only possible Means and Way, for their being transform'd and exalted into the originally unchangeable never-sinning Creature-life of God, in the Mediator, the only Life or Principle of everlasting Active Obedience to God, and Blessedness to Man. All true thorow-Followers of the Lamb slain (in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row unpleasing Way to Nature, at best)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43038:13"/>
will find all their own Life and Things, with unspeakable Gain, in an infallible, all-discerning, spiritual Understanding, and incorruptible Will, by personal Union with Christ in his heavenly Creature-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of true Holiness and eternal Life. And so will they find themselves in unchangeable Harmony with, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the infinite Divine Will. This is <hi>the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> in which they that are born of God, by the new-creating Workmanship of Christ passing upon them (to the Death of their natural Spirit, and Resurrection into his spiritual Life) come to be <hi>Heirs and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs,</hi> under and <hi>with Christ, of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thus became the exalted Creature-Son and Branch in the Mediator, <hi>of the First-born of every Creature</hi> (in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-purity of a mortal earthly Life) <hi>the First-born from the Dead,</hi> (Col. 1. 15, 18.) in the originally immortal Creature-life of his Root and Father. So became he the living Word of God, (<hi>the Book of Life of the Lamb slain</hi> and exalted) <hi>in which were written</hi> ( by the super-wonderful myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

Whoever do finally refuse <hi>to die with him,</hi> (and lose all their own mortal, earthly Life and Things, receiv'd in their first Creation, or restor'd since, with all Works or Fruits, done or brought forth by them, therein) will never attain that heavenly, eternal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-life of their Creator, in which <hi>to live and reign with him,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 11, 12. True Followers of the slain Lamb of God, will be enabled to say with him, <hi>I was dead</hi> in my own mortal, earthly Law-spirit of Works, <hi>and am alive</hi> in his Gospel-spirit of Grace and Truth <hi>for evermore,</hi> Rev. 1. 18. All that establish themselves in their own Law-spirit of Works, and Righteousness of Man, will be found unchangeable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God's Righteousness, in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43038:14"/>
Gospel-spirit, and so in unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Union with the God of this World, the Devil. Such mystical Sodomites, in Filth of Spirit, Enmity to God and his Gospel-spirit of Grace, will have worse of it for ever, under the Wrath of God, than common Sinners in Filth of Flesh, wallowing in the miry Filths and Bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of literal <hi>Sodom, Mat.</hi> 11. 23, 24.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thus became the exalted Branch in the Mediator, the ready prepar'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Hand and living Word of God, for performing his whole Divine Mind and twofold Purposes thereof, in the twofold Creation of Angels and Men, and for the dealing with them, both and all, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their own Life, given them in their first Creation, in love to his own, offer'd them by a Second; or, as from love to their own, in the first, unchangeably ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own (offer'd by a second) in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Devil.</p>
            <p>The said exalted Son and Branch, did bring forth Angels and Men, out of their radical Existencies in himself, into their personal Subsistencies and Individuations in themselves. This was their first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

in the same kind of mortal, earthly First-Covenant Law-life, himself had first taken, in the supream Fountain-puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, as <hi>First-born of every Creature</hi> therein, and rightly us'd in order to the second, in which he became <hi>the First-born from the Dead,</hi> in a Life above all Deaths, temporal or eternal. Thus was it true, in the immediate Creator, as well as in meer Creatures, Angels and Men; <hi>First, that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 46. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Love to our selves in our own Life, receiv'd in our first Creation, is the unpardonable Sin against the Holy Ghost, or heavenly Creature-spirit of Christ, and Life thereof, offer'd by a second.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The exalted Creature-Son, or living Word of God, his prepar'd and fitted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Hand, for the twofold Creation of Angels and Men, was also his ready prepar'd infallible Mouth, Wisdom and Word, to declare to them, as soon as made, his whole Counsel, Will and Command, for the right Use of their natural Beings and Life, given them in their first Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in order to a second; and that, as their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43038:15"/>
unspeakable Concern, as well as Duty, for finding the Salvation of Heaven, or scaping the Damnation of Hell. Final refusing the Loss of all their own, in the first, for his own, by a second, will be everlasting Destruction to all that so do.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Christ, as exalted Creature-Son and Branch, became the ready prepar'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate sacrificing High-Priest of God, <hi>after the Order</hi> (and in the Power) <hi>of the</hi> Original <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> (<hi>Heb.</hi> 5.6,10. &amp; 6.20. &amp; 7. 17.) his Creature-root and Father, who first perform'd the sacrificing Death-work upon himself, when in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-purity of all mortal First-creation Life. Thus is the immediate Creator of Angels and Men, by a first Creation, the immediate High-Priest of God, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the like sacrificing Death-work on them, therein, as his Creature-Father had before perform'd upon himself. This exalted Son and Branch, was <hi>the Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedec, Priest of the most high God, that met</hi> Abram, <hi>returning from the Slaughter of the four Kings, and bless'd him,</hi> Gen. 14. 18, 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 1. He was also one
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43038:15"/>
of the three Men, <hi>Abram</hi> pray'd to and worshipp'd, as God, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.) which no good Angels would ever own, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. &amp; 22.9. The Devil and his proud self-exalting evil Angels, own themselves as Gods, (in the uncontroll'd Soveraignty of their own Wills, <hi>above</hi> and against <hi>all that is truly called God, and to be worshipp'd</hi>) requiring Divine Worship to be paid them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 14.12-14. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 3, 4. Yea, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan most presumptuously attempted to bring the Lord himself to own, fall down and worship him as the true God, whom he knew to be the true Lord and God (<hi>Mark</hi> 1. 24.) he and all Angels and Men ought to worship, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 8-10. Christ own'd the wise Mens worshipping him, when born in our Nature (<hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 1, 11.) and after; others worshipping him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.2. &amp; 9.18. with eight other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the four Evangelists.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And lastly; Christ as exalted Branch, was in the fully partaken of Life of his Creature-root, the ready prepar'd infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Example and unerrable Pattern for Angels and Men to follow, by the like Death of Nature in them, at best, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43038:16"/>
to a happy Resurrection into the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual everlasting righteous Life of their Creator. All that finally refuse a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission in Passive Obedience to this Change, will perish for ever. For this Change, as their Duty and unspeakable Concern, did he represent himself in such Transactions as had pass'd in the Creature-part of his Person, to all the Angels sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and higher intuitive natural Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing than Man's, though in but the same First-Covenant Law-life of the Creature, as Man. He appear'd to the Angels, immediately, <hi>as four living Creatures that had the Likeness of a Man,</hi> (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.5.) the comprehensive Sum of all changeable First-Creation-Being and Life. The word Man, comprehends all. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individual Man is a Microcosm, or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser World, having all found in the Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosm, or greater, without him, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, peculiar to himself. He has Being; an earthy Body, with Elements, and all inanimate Simples or Compounds; a threefold Life, or Spirit of Lives, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7.) Vegetable, with Grass, Herbs, Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Life of Sense, with Birds,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43038:16"/>
Beasts, Fishes and creeping things; an intellectual Exercise of the Life of his natural Spirit, above and without the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, while in it, with Angels, but inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to them, therein. Then, besides all this, has he the rational Exercise of his natural Understanding, by bodily Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, not found in any Parts of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er World, Angels or Beasts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The four living Creatures,</hi> by which Christ represented himself to the Angels, <hi>had the</hi> Face or <hi>Likeness of a Man</hi>: And they are call'd again and again, <hi>the</hi> (or one) <hi>living Creature</hi> (Ezek. 1.20,21. &amp; 10. 15, 17, 20.

While Man thus rambles and flies abroad for a self-pleasing delusive Happiness, amongst the Delights of the Sons of Men, he never looks or seeks after God, and his heavenly Creature-life and Things, the peculiar De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the Sons of God. These heavenly Creature-things, offer'd by a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are out of the Reach of all single natural Understanding of Man, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9.) and the only way for attaining them, is most contrary to his natural Will.

            <p>When the good Angels had let down their Wings (importing a perfect Rest and Cessation from the Labours or Exercise of their own Spirits, Wills and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings) <hi>a Voice from the Firmament, over their Heads,</hi> calls them out of the said Death of Nature, into a living spiritual Faith, working by love to Christ, as seen by them, <hi>the Man upon a Throne,</hi> as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Son and Branch, in his heavenly Creature-life. Hereby were they actually possess'd of eternal Life, and infallibly sure of being compleated therein, in God's time. They patiently waited (with a holy kind of Impatience, well-pleasing to God, also) in longing Desires and Pantings after the actual Gift of the Holy Ghost or Gospel-Spirit of the Man, they saw upon his Throne, therein. They, with Old-Testament-Saints, waited four thousand Years, for this promis'd unspeakable Gift, <hi>which was not given</hi> to either or any of them <hi>till Christ was ascended</hi> in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.39. But, as inseparably uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith, by a living spiritual Faith,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43038:18"/>
working by Love thereto, <hi>they</hi> all <hi>had a good Report</hi> with God, as well-pleasing and acceptable to him, though they had not receiv'd his promis'd Holy Ghost, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 39. All along the said four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years, the good Angels with Old-Testament-Prophets and other Saints, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd to</hi> pry, <hi>look into,</hi> and consider <hi>what time the Spirit of Christ in them</hi> (as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd by a spiritual Faith therein) <hi>did sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, when it testified before-hand, the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ, and the Glory that should follow, with the Holy Ghost sent down from Heaven; and clear Gospel-preaching, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd therein,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 10-12. On this account, the good Angels had Cause of Rejoicing at the Birth of Christ, in our Nature, as their own concern, as well as Man's, though not in reference to Sin. For they never sinn'd, at all, nor were in danger of ever sinning, after their first change from Nature to Grace. They rejoic'd also, on behalf of Mankind, who are all born Sinners. The high Joy of the good Angels, on these Accounts, at Christ's Birth, is recorded. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 8-14.</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:43038:18"/>By the first Demeanour of the good Angels, is implied the contrary Behaviour of the evil ones. The good follow'd Christ, their Head: the evil ones turn'd from their true Head, as they went, or were going, a while, with the good, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Light. <hi>Satan</hi> made himself a contrary, opposite Head to Christ, and, <hi>with his Tail, drew a third part of the</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, (<hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 4.) signified by <hi>Stars,</hi> (<hi>Iob</hi> 38. 7.) into the same Condition with himself, under him as their Head, in the self-chosen earthly Life of the first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in unchangeable Enmity to God and his heavenly Life, offer'd them, by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. As thus it was with the evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, so, too oft, with Men. Under high spiritual enlightning Gifts, many that have gone a while with Gospel-Saints, after Christ, as their Head, finding his Cross, or the Death-work of his heavenly on their earthy Spirit, to be pass'd under, in order to be married to him, as risen from the Dead, they turn away from him under Satan's Witch-crafts (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 3.) to set up for themselves in their <hi>holy Flesh,</hi> or righteous Life, given them in their first
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43038:19"/>
Creation, in unchangeable Enmity to God and his holy Gospel-Spirit, offer'd by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.

            <p>A third part of the Angels will perish for ever. Of Mankind, the many in the broad, easy, self-pleasing Way to Hell, out-number Christ's few, in the narrow Way to Heaven, though they, also, out of all Generations, will be a numberless Multitude, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 9.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. Concerning the Trinity.</head>
            <p>THE three distinct Powers in the Divine Essence or Father, shining forth, from all Eternity, in the Divine Form or Son, consider'd separately, in each, or jointly in both, are call'd <hi>Father, Word and Holy Ghost,</hi> 1 John 5. 7. The one of these is not the other in the Divine Father or Son.</p>
            <p>The word, Father, as the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is call'd, in distinction from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Form or Son, is of a very differing Consideration from the same Word, as signifying the first of the Divine Three in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43038:21"/>
both. So, the word, Son, as signifying the Divine Form, is of a very differing Signification from the same Word, as sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the Second of the Divine Three, in Father and Son. The like may be said of the Third of the Divine Three, the Holy Ghost, in Father and Son, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Significancy from what the Divine Father and Son, jointly together, are so call'd, as the one Infinite Divine Being.</p>
            <p>The Three distinct Divine Powers in the Divine Father and Son, do beget and set up their distinct secondary Record or Witness of themselves, in a Creature-Form, distinct from the Divine Form. The whole Creature-nature of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, Root and Branch, is call'd <hi>Earth,</hi> in distinction from the Divine Form in him, the supream Heaven of Heavens. Their threefold Witness in Earth, is signified by <hi>Spirit, Water and Blood,</hi> 1 John 5.8. The same Three that are One in the Divine Nature, agree in compleating the one Mind of all Three, in the Earth, or whole Creature-nature of the Mediator. The Witness of the First of the Divine Three, is Spirit, a Creature-spirit of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43038:22"/>
immortal, Holiness and eternal Life. The Witness of the Second, is call'd Water, signifying the Creature-Son and Branch, in the Fountain-purity of all mortal Being and Life, design'd to be set up in Angels and Men, by a first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Blood signifies the Death of that, as <hi>first-born of every Creature,</hi> in order to its Resurrection into the originally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Life of its Root and Father, and, therein, <hi>first-born from the dead.</hi> In, by and through this Creature-form, do the three in the Divine let down the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of themselves, to the spiritual Sight and Enjoyment of Angels and Men; and by such Transactions, therein, do notify to both, the only Means and Way for their true Blessedness, by the Death and Loss of all Life and Things receiv'd by them, in the mortal First-Covenant Law-life of the first Creation, in order to ascend into and receive his originally immortal new and everlasting Covenant Gospel-life, by a second, communicated to them by the exalted Son and Branch, <hi>as first-born from the dead</hi>; and, therein, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Performer of the one Will of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43038:22"/>
Divine Three, in both Creations, and in dealing with all Angels and Men, Good and Bad, in final Love or Wrath, to all Eternity, accordingly as they submit, or refuse to submit to the Terms of receiving the Life, offer'd by a second.</p>
            <p>Thus was the Foundation laid, within God himself, in the Creature-part of the Mediator, for rendring the three that are one in the Divine Nature, discernable and enjoyable to blessed Saints and Angels, in their spiritual new-Creation Capacities. Man's highest Wisdom and Understanding sees not the heavenly Creature-things of God, by which only the Divine Three can be known, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. So, all his Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Thoughts and Words, about the Trinity, can be but implicite random-Conjectures and Discourses, not seeing or knowing what he says.</p>
            <p>The immediate discernable Objects of Man's highest natural Understanding, are but the mortal Life and Things of the first Creation, <hi>by which they</hi> ought to conclude and <hi>may know, there is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power and Godhead</hi>; but see nor that, nor his heavenly Creature-things, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,

            <p>The Three in the Divine Essence or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, singly and abstractedly consider'd, will be absolutely invisible to Saints and Angels in Heaven to all Eternity. And the Divine Form, Son or Glory thereof, in Christ's Person, will never be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Object of their Sight, but be let down to them, in the first Conjunction thereof, with his Creature-root, through the exalted Creature-Son and Branch in him, the immediate Creator of all. This is <hi>the Branch, God made strong for himself,</hi> (<hi>Psal.</hi> 80. 15.) to perform his whole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mind, in both Creations; in this World, and the eternal World to come. This is <hi>the Branch that shall reign on Earth, execute Iudgment and Iustice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as the Lord our Righteousness,</hi> Jer. 23. 5, 6. &amp; 33. 15, 16. By and through this exalted Branch, the immediate Do-all, in both Creations, will the same Three in the Divine Essence, that shin'd forth in the Divine Form, from Eternity, let down themselves to blessed Angels and Saints, to Eternity. All the Three in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43038:23"/>
Divine Essence, and heavenly Creature-Glories, are one Trinity, and that Trinity, one individual God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 20.</p>
            <p>The Three that are One in the Divine Nature, are the immediate Object to the Sight and Enjoyment of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-nature in Christ (Root and exalted Branch) that's in personal Union there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: but never so, to any meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, blessed Saints or Angels, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15, 16. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27. They are personally united with the exalted Branch, in him, as Members of his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical, spiritual Body, to which he is Head. But never so to his Creature-root; and much less, yet, to his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>The Three in the Divine Nature, shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth to meer spiritual Creatures, by and through the exalted Branch, are no where, in Scripture, call'd a Trinity, nor said to be three Persons. If they be three Persons, as three distinct individual An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or Men, in Angelical or humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are, would they not be three distinct individual Gods? would not this be the asserting a Tritheism, the lesser sort of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43038:24"/>
Polytheism? If they be call'd three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, it must be, as acknowledg'd in a Unity, transcendently above meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who are so, in one specifical hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or angelical Nature. The three, in God, are three, in one individual Divine Nature, shining forth to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in the Mediator's one individual Creature-nature, which, in and with his Divine Nature, is, with his Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Essence, one individual God. In this Sense, if any, may they be call'd three Persons. But the acknowledging three distinct Powers in God, may justly secure any, from the Imputation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titrinitarianism. They are so three, that the first is not the second; nor second, the third. The Divine Form in Christ, is not the Divine Essence, nor his Creature-nature, his Divine; nor his Creature-root, the Branch in him; but all one individual incomprehensible God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 30. He that says (knows and owns) God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Divine and Creature-Son, says all that God is, or is God. Man, in the fallible Understanding and corruptible Will of his First-creation Life, can never
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43038:24"/>
truly see, rightly know and do the one Will of both. All, therefore, that trust to their own Understanding, deny both the Divine Father, and the divine and heavenly Creature-Son. <hi>Whosoever denies the</hi> Divine and Creature-<hi>Son, hath not the Father. But he that</hi> rightly <hi>acknowledges the Son, hath the Father also,</hi> 1 John 2.22, 23. Antichristian Deniers of both, pass in reputed Orthodox Man's Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, under Satan, God of this World, as the only true Christians, excommunicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or casting out of their worldly Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the true Owners of both, as the arrantest Hereticks and Blasphemers in the World.</p>
            <p>God the Son, or Mediator, in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Creature-glories of the Divine Essence or Father, is call'd <hi>a Person,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. In his Creature-part, he is call'd <hi>the Brightness of the Divine Glory</hi> in himself; and, therein, <hi>the express</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-<hi>Image</hi> of God's whole Divine Person, Essence and Form, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>The Creature-root in the Mediator is God's Soul, not immediately discernable to the highest spiritual Understanding of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43038:25"/>
meer Creatures: but, in its first Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with Divine Nature, is let down to their Sight and Enjoyment, in and by the exalted Creature-Son and Branch, as God's Body, or Visibility of all, to them. Of the Creature-root, God's Soul, himself says, in reference to the unpardonably sinning Shepherds (or pretending Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Way to Heaven, and Peace with God, in but the restor'd Life and Righteousness of Man) <hi>my Soul loath'd them, and their Soul, also, abhorred me,</hi> Zech. 11. 8.</p>
            <p>Every individual Man, in the three es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Ingredients into his personal Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, <hi>Spirit, Soul and Body</hi> (1 Thess. 5. 23.) is a shadowy Image of the three in one God; and of the Divine Spirit, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-root or Soul, and Creature-body or Branch, in Christ's wonderful compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Person. Man, in another Sense, was in the primitive Purity of his whole Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a shadowy Image of God's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. This was lost, to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by their first Sin, in and with <hi>Adam.</hi> The Reason therefore of the threaten'd Death on Murderers (that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43038:25"/>
               <hi>whosoever sheds Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed: for in the Image of God, made he Man,</hi> Gen. 9. 6.) relates to Man's being the Image of God, in the former Sense, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26, 27. The Image of him, in the latter, being wholly lost, the Murderers of him, in reference to that, might seem unaccountable.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of Man, singly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractedly consider'd, may seem a dark Shadow of the very Divine Essence, as comprehending in it, a threefold distinct Life, rational, sensual, and vegetable; but all three, invisible and unexercis'd, till brought into hypostatical or personal Union with its fitly organiz'd Body. And, all the said three Lives, when brought into Exercise, are called a living Soul, in distinction from the Spirit, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately consider'd; and, from the Body, that's the personal Appearance or Visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the whole Man. And, in both and all, the Man is but one Person.</p>

            <p>IN general, all are one individual God. In particular, the Divine Form or Son (though most intimately one with the Divine Essence or Father, in the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Divine Nature) became personally united with the Creature-form of God, the Divine Essence or Father, remaining, ever, single and uncompounded therewith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>A Mediator is not of one</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>but God,</hi> in his Divine Essence, <hi>is one.</hi> God the <hi>Mediator,</hi> as consisting of

            <p>The Divine and Creature-Son will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a Mediator, for ever, in Heaven, between infinite Divinity and elect Angels and Men, in their compleated spiritual Beings, and New-creation Capacities; not in reference to Sin, or any Danger or Possibility of Sinning, ever incident to them.

No Man or Angel hath seen God, immediately, at any time, in his purely Divine Nature, nor ever will, or can, to all Eternity, in Heaven.

That he meant the immediate Sight of the very Divine Glory, Form, or Face of God, in the Mediator, appears by God's favourable Answer to his mistaking Thought, saying, <hi>no Man</hi> or Angel) <hi>can</hi> ever so <hi>see me, and live. But there's a</hi> heavenly Creature-<hi>place by me,</hi> in personal Union with my Divine Glory, <hi>through which, as my back-parts, thou mayest see me; but my Divine Face</hi> or Glory, <hi>shall never be</hi> immediately <hi>seen,</hi> by thee, or any meer Creature, to all Eternity, in Heaven, <hi>v.</hi> 20-23.

            <p>Thus will the Dignity and Prerogative of the infinite Divinity, and the peculiar Privilege of Creature-nature in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, be preserv'd, in the transcendent Superiority of both and all, above all meer Creatures, Saints and Angels, for evermore.

            <p>Creature-nature, of immediate Divine Begetting, qualifies him to mediate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two vastly distinct Natures, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and meer creaturely, in Angels and Men; so as to answer all that can rightly be desir'd by them, and to enable them, to answer all that God requires of them. By his right Performances, therein, on both and all Accounts, Divine Nature can't suffer the least Diminution, nor meer Creatures, Angels or Men, be swallow'd up, or consum'd, in their highest Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The infinite Dignity of the one,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43038:28"/>
and unspeakable Privileges of the other, will ever be preserv'd by the Mediator. <hi>He is the wonderful Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father</hi> (of Saints and Angels) <hi>the Prince of Peace,</hi> the only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer of their everlasting Peace with God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 6. He transforms and translates us, out of the earthly Life of the Creature, and fallible Understandings, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our own corruptible Wills, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in our first Creation, into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, eternal Gospel-life of himself, our Creator, and infallible spiritual Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of all things, and incorruptible Will, therein, for the right doing all things, God requires of us; which is the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God, in unchangeable Harmony with his infinite Divine Will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Head of every Man, is Christ; the Head of the Woman is the Man; and, the Head of Christ, is God,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 3. The Woman, or natural Man, in the changeable Womanish Life of the First-creation, is, by Death, and Resurrection into the unchangeable manly Life of the second, brought into the glorious Liberty
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43038:29"/>
of the Sons of God, into unchangeable Harmony with the infinite Divine Will. In this Transformation, the manly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ, becomes the Head of the transform'd womanish Spirit of Man; and, the Head of every such spiritual Man, is Christ; and, the Head of Christ's whole compounded Person, is God, the single, uncompounded Divine Essence or Father of all. But all these Superiorities and Inferiorities, in God the Father, and his Divine and Creature-Son, are swallow'd up in Christ's wonderful compounded Person, into an equality, as with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Father, one incomprehensible God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 30.

            <head>CHAP. VIII. The Mystery of <hi>Godliness,</hi> and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Iniquity.</head>
            <p>TO awaken'd spiritual <hi>Saints, it is given to know the Mystery of the Kingdom of God, the Mystery and Power of Godliness: but, to them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> such spiritual Life and Knowledg, all the spiritual heavenly Creature-things of God, <hi>prepar'd for them that love him, are done</hi> and spoken <hi>in Parables,</hi> earthly Figures and Similitudes. So, <hi>hearing, they hear, but do not understand; seeing, they see, yet not perceive,</hi> or rightly take the mystical Truths, therein and by, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 13, 14. and <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 11, 12. They desire not to understand them, they are so contrary to their own Wills, and self-Interests. They, rather, like, chuse and approve of Satan's Mystery of Iniquity, and embrace the Doctrine that carries on that, which gratifies their own
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43038:30"/>
Wills, both as to self-Interests in this World, and a delusive Hope, therein, for true Blessedness, in the World to come, also. In Conclusion, <hi>he that hath not</hi> the Life, God has prepar'd and offer'd by a New Creation, which alone is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have,</hi> or thinks to be eternal Life, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 18. And so, will he find eternal Death, in a most exquisite Sensibleness of his whole Being, Spirit, Soul and Body, under the unquenchable Wrath of God. This will Men get, by following Satan's delusive Gospel, in his Mystery of Iniquity. Those that shall be Saints, till the spiritual Seed of true Saintship be waken'd up in them, may be, for a time, under the same delusive Power of Satan, with others. <hi>Paul,</hi> till then, was a fierce, self-confident Enemy to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Saints and Truths, in the Law-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Man, under Satan's Mystery of Iniquity, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. All reading of the Scriptures, or hearing them expounded by Men, in Law-righteousness, however eminent in their own Understandings, will never deliver from being captivated
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43038:30"/>
by Satan's Mystery of Iniquity. All Scripture is <hi>a Book seal'd,</hi> Isa. 29. 11. Let Man, in but his own Understanding search the Scriptures, he will not come to Christ, the living Word and Book of God, for that Life, in which, alone, 'tis possible to understand, receive and own the mystical Truth of all. Such Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with their self-confident Hearers, should they be at this Work, longer than <hi>Methuselah</hi> liv'd, they'd still be wholly to seek, as when they began, as to that eternal Life and things of God, in which, 'tis possible to enter into his Kingdom, or scape the Damnation of Hell. Awaken'd Saints, in their new spiritual, infallible, all-discerning Understanding, are enabled to see and declare, not only, the heavenly Creature-life and things of God, therein; but, to pry and <hi>search into the deep things of the infinite Divinity,</hi> in Christ's Person, (1 Cor. 2. 9, 10.) <hi>to understand all things,</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 15.) the divine and spiritual things of God, and what the natural things of Man, given him in his first Creation, amount unto. <hi>The becoming a little Child,</hi> as to the Life, Wisdom, Will and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43038:31"/>
of Man, in order to a receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heavenly spiritual eternal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-life and Things of God, his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his everlasting Righteousness, true Holiness, a new infallible Understanding, for knowing all things, and a new incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Will, for doing all things well, in God's Sight; this, Christ makes abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary to our ever entrin into his Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 3. and <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 17. <hi>Paul,</hi> an eminent self-confident Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee, in the Law-righteousness of Man, and a fierce Persecutor of Gospel-Saints, was, doubtless, of high esteem with those that in his Law-principle were wise, strong and honourable. But, when a Gospel-Saint, he became as a little Child, a <hi>Fool weak, and despicable,</hi> in the Judgment of those, <hi>who were wise, strong and honourable in</hi> restor'd Law-life and First-covenant Attainments from <hi>Christ; Phil.</hi> 3. 6-11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10. When a Gospel-Saint, <hi>he renounc'd the Knowledg of Christ himself, after the Flesh</hi>; to be married to him in that Spirit, into which risen, out of the Death of our Nature, in himself, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4. He had, now, a Life
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43038:31"/>
and Things, as far above all, given An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, in their first Creation, as the Heavens are higher than the Earth. This <hi>Life, hid with Christ in God,</hi> from Man's highest Understanding; and, all Man regards, given up, in Sacrifice to God, what Esteem could he find, with Men? This has been the Case of true Saints, Prophets and Apostles, and of Christ himself, all along this World, from <hi>Abel,</hi> to this Day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 34, 35. While any are confident in Satan's My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Iniquity, preferring the Law-life of the Creature and Righteousness of Man, to the Gospel-life of the Creator and everlasting Righteousness of God, therein, such are the greatest Haters of true Saints, and were the Murderers of Christ himself, when <hi>Pilate</hi> a Heathen Judg, would have releas'd him, as <hi>finding no Fault in him,</hi> John 18. 38. &amp; 19. 4, 6. Christ warns his true Followers, to expect the like Usage, from such, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 18-20. &amp; 16. 1, 2. Saints, fix'd in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Mind, with God, become the most hateful to all, fix'd in the Law-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Man, in unchangeable Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43038:32"/>
with the Devil. <hi>In the Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> and Righteousness of Man, <hi>they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Power of Godliness and Righteousness of God,</hi> as a diabolical Fiction, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. Such said of Christ himself, <hi>he had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and was mad.</hi> Here's the demeanour of any, fix'd in Satan's Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, to such as experience and declare the Mystery of Godliness. Hence, are God's true New-<hi>Ierusalem</hi>-Saints a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, all along this World, under Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Reign. But, when Christ shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the second time, in his all-powerful, all-discovering Gospel-light, and enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Reign on Earth, they'l be <hi>a Praise in the Earth.</hi> For this, therefore, all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Saints and Angels continually pray, <hi>and keep not silence,</hi> Isa. 62. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Man's Wisdom denies true Godliness to be any Mystery, at all, which God's Wisdom declares without Controversy, and beyond all dispute or question, to be <hi>a great Mystery,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Mind of God therein, as to the eternal Concerns of Men, are easy to be understood, says Man: impossible to be understood, says God, by Man's
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43038:32"/>
highest Understanding, in the Light, Wisdom, and Righteousness of Man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 14. <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 11. God, here says, what learned Man should say, in his highest Wisdom. <hi>'Tis not in Man,</hi> to make one right Step towards eternal Life, in his own best natural Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Reason or Wisdom, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 23. 'Tis, says Man's Wisdom, and warrants final Peace with God, therein (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 1-10.) <hi>where there's no</hi> such <hi>Peace.</hi> Boldly and confidently does Man's <hi>lying Spirit of Divination,</hi> in Satan's Gospel-Divines, say this, and <hi>warrant their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, they'l confirm their Word,</hi> v. 6.</p>
            <p>Man may know God's infinite Divine Power, <hi>by the things that are made</hi> in the First-creation: but, sees neither his Divine Nature and things thereof, nor any of his hidden, spiritual, eternal Creature-things, prepar'd to be given, by a new or second Creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. All Mankind are capable of, and may receive the common Salvation, as a Fruit of Christ's Death, in our Nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Discoveries of his Truth, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-life, if they will, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. But,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43038:33"/>
as to special Salvation, or eternal Gospel-life, <hi>this is not of him that willeth, but of God, who will shew such Mercy, to whom he will,</hi> Rom. 9. 15, 16. Many, in all possible Attainments in the former, will perish for ever.</p>
            <p>Satan attempted to bring Christ himself to be a Member of his Church, or Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and worship him as God, in his Mystery of Iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 8, 9. where are we, till infallibly experiencing his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-life, and therein the Mystery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness? All along this World, under God's most wise Permission, <hi>Satan and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Ministers, transform'd into the Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ and his,</hi> carry all before them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13-15. <hi>All, in</hi> but <hi>their own Spirit and worldly Life,</hi> at best, <hi>wonder</hi> and run <hi>after them,</hi> (Revel. 13. 3, 4.) <hi>worshipping the Dragon,</hi> and under and with him, <hi>opening their Mouth in Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy against God, and his</hi> Creature-name, that's his heavenly <hi>Tabernacle, and them that dwell therein,</hi> v. 5,6. And <hi>it is given to him</hi> and his Party amongst Men, <hi>to make War with Saints, and overcome them, ver.</hi> 7. They are condemn'd as Traitors,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43038:33"/>
discovering his Counsels in the Mystery of Iniquity, and he will cause them, to be so accounted, also, against Heathen <hi>Cesars,</hi> and others, of his Party, under him. Christ himself was condemn'd and murder'd, on this Pretence, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 12, 15. Saints can discover him, when <hi>sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God</hi> (2 Thess. 2. 4.) to be the worst of all Creatures, <hi>the Man of Sin, and Son of Perdition,</hi> ver. 3. Will he quietly bear this Discovery? will he not, by his humane Instruments, shew his utmost Rage against them? and, God permits. But be it as it will; the Sum of all true Gospel-teaching, is a declaring <hi>the Mystery of Godliness,</hi> for the Salvation of Men and preventing their Damnation; and, a discovering Satan's <hi>Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> for the Damnation of Men, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting their Salvation. So, only, can Saints, with <hi>Paul, become free from the Blood of all Men,</hi> (Acts 20. 26. Ezek. 33. 7-9.) as having no Share in that Guilt, by which they bring that Blood upon their own Heads, which will be found to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount unto no less than eternal Death to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43038:34"/>
their whole Beings, Spirit, Soul, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in a Resurrection of Damnation. The experimental Knowers of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery and Power of Godliness, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Discoverers of the Mystery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will have <hi>a Resurrection of Life,</hi> (John 5. 29.) above all Deaths, temporal or eternal.</p>

            </head>
            <p>EVIL Mankind, in <hi>Adam,</hi> joyn'd with evil Angel-kind, in Satan, through a mutual Union of Love to themselves and one another, electing or chusing for themselves, their own earthly, mortal, First covenant Law-life of the Creature, given by a First-creation, in preference and opposition to the heavenly, immortal, Second-covenant Gospel-life of the Creator, offer'd them by a second or
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43038:34"/>
new Creation. The evil Angels herein, did, at first, commit the unpardonable Sin against the Holy Ghost, under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Beamings forth of Christ's hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Creature-Gospel spirit, the Son of everlasting Righteousness, upon their highest, single intuitive natural Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They had no superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Rank of Creatures, in the First-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, already fallen, above them in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety and Power, to tempt them. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> They were all, actually created and set up, in their compleated personal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Life, at first; Mankind receive their personal Beings, successively, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration after Generation. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind's first Sin, in <hi>Adam,</hi> was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such clear Knowledg of their own unspeakable Concern, as well as Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, though in the same kind of First-covenant Law-life, with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. The inferiour Ingredients into Man's personal Constitution (bodily, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual-life, tho created pure and incorrupt) rendred his intuitive Discerning, inferiour to that of Angels, where 'twas single and alone. Hence, what was immediately
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43038:35"/>
and more convincingly made known to Angels, was represented to <hi>Adam,</hi> by a figurative <hi>Tree of Life</hi>; and, himself, in distinction from that, by the <hi>Tree of Good and Evil.</hi> The former represented Christ to him, in that heavenly Creature-life, offer'd by a new Creation: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, represented himself to himself, as but a mystical Tree of Good and Evil, in his own Life, given in his first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, corruptible and changeable, mortal and perishable, with all the earthly things, therein, Will, Understanding, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Wisdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with all Works or Fruits ever possible to be done or brought forth, therein. By, and under the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Subtlety and Power of the Devil, the mystical Old Serpent, was <hi>Adam,</hi> in the primitive Purity of his whole Being, and Mankind, in him, as their Head and Representative, induc'd, perswaded and deceiv'd, so as to prefer Satan's self-pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lie, to God's Spirit of Grace and Truth. So, under and with the Serpent, he chose his own earthly Life of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in preference to God's own heavenly Creature-life of the Creator. Many of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43038:35"/>
Mankind, when restor'd out of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Death of their own Spirits, into the Light, Life and Righteousness of Man, do <hi>sin again,</hi> in their own Persons, <hi>after the Similitude of</hi> Adam's first <hi>Transgression, who,</hi> at best, in Innocency, <hi>was</hi> but <hi>a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Second</hi> Adam <hi>who was to come,</hi> in the Fountain-purity of our Nature, and also, <hi>full of the Holy Ghost</hi> (Luke 4. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 14.) his heavenly Creature-spirit of <hi>Grace and Truth,</hi> Rom. 5. 14. This Sin, again, in their own Persons (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all sad Experience of fallen Mankind, thereby, in <hi>Adam,</hi> and all Warnings and Counsels of God, since) is unrepentable by them, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 6.) and unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 27. This is the Case of any, that conclusively and absolutely prefer their own restor'd earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life of the Creature and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Man, to the heavenly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-life of the Creator, and everlasting Righteousness of God, therein. <hi>All, that will not</hi> receive and <hi>have,</hi> the heavenly Creature-life of God (by submitting to the Death of restor'd Nature, at best, the Loss of all their own Life and things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in)
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43038:36"/>
               <hi>God will take away</hi> the said Life, <hi>from them,</hi> again, and lay them down, for ever, under his unquenchable Wrath, in eternal Death, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 18. This is that, Christ says, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Whosoever will save his Life, shall lose it: and, whosoever will hate and lose his own Life, for my Sake,</hi> from Love to my heavenly Creature-life, <hi>shall find it,</hi> with unspeakable Gain, as chang'd by Death and Resurrection, into an eternal Life. Satan was at it, with Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 8, 9.) to stay and set up with and under him, as a State of true Happiness, in the mortal Life of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and, by his Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> was at the same Point, to pity and spare himself, there, saying, <hi>be</hi> the Death thereof, <hi>far from thee: this shall not be unto thee.</hi> Christ discover'd and declar'd this Word of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to be Satan's Counsel, in and by him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 21-23.</p>
            <p>As the first Sin of Angels was differing from Man's first Sin, so was the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Punishment of evil Angels, was the giving them their own evil Choice, their own self-chosen earthly Life, receiv'd in their First-creation, with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43038:36"/>
all the things thereof, their own Wisdom, Righteousness, Subtlety and Power, all natural Excellencies and Perfections, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as by them abus'd, turn'd into, and us'd, in unchangeable Enmity to God and his heavenly Creature spirit of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. God also permitted to them the Exercise of a ruling Power over sallen Mankind, all along this World, by which, Satan carries on the same delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Work, as on <hi>Adam,</hi> at first: that the Life, given in the First-creation, is eternal, no need of a second; nor, therefore, of the Death of the first. <hi>Ye shall not die,</hi> Gen. 3. 3. This is Satan's uniform Lie, all along this World, that the Life given in the First-creation is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. You must die, or never live and reign with me, in my heavenly Creature-life, which is eternal: This is Christ's <hi>Truth,</hi> his <hi>faithful Saying,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 11, 12. There's nothing more pleasing to Man's Will, in the restor'd earthly Life of the First <hi>Adam,</hi> than Satan's Lie: and, nothing so universally contrary to it, as God's Truth; that, the Death and Loss thereof, with all the things therein, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43038:37"/>
neceessary to any Man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that Life which is eternal, by a new Creation. Man, in the restor'd Life of the First <hi>Adam</hi>'s living Soul, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est spiritual enlightning Gifts, convincing him of the Life offer'd by a Second, and of the Necessity of parting again, with the restor'd earthly Life and things of the <hi>First</hi> Adam<hi>'s living Soul,</hi> for the heavenly Life and Things of the <hi>Second</hi> Adam<hi>'s quickning Spirit</hi>; under all this Mercy, is Man liable, through his own unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Folly, to be bewitch'd back from looking after Christ's heavenly, Gospel-life, shew'd and offer'd him, and to set up for himself, under and with Satan, in his own earthly Law-life and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, signified by <hi>Holy Flesh,</hi> Gal. 3. 1, 3. This may be call'd a Sinning after the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the evil Angels first Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, under the clearest Discovery of the Life offer'd by a new Creation, with the Terms of receiving it, and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Concern for submitting thereto, as the only possible Means to find eternal Life, or scape eternal Death.</p>

At Man's rate of Judging, the evil Angels were in the Right, as keeping what they receiv'd in their First-creation, all the Glories and Excellencies, Wisdom and Power, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>

The receiving from Christ, as a Fruit of his meritorious Sufferings and Death in our Nature, the renew'd Life and Righteousness of the First-creation, is of him that willeth. All may receive that, if they will. But, the attaining and receiving of the Life, God offers, by a Second-creation, <hi>this is not of him that willeth or runneth,</hi> in his own Spirit and Will, at best, <hi>but of God who will shew this Mercy, to whom he will, only,</hi> Rom. 9. 15, 16. All, that finally elect or chase for themselves their own earthly Life of the Creature, reject the heavenly Creature-life of the Creator.

            <head>CHAP. X. The second Sacrifice of Christ, in our whole human Nature, Spirit, Soul, and Body.</head>
            <p>IN and by his first Sacrifice, he became the immediately fitted Hand of God, (the living Word of God, which is God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1-3.) for performing the whole Divine Will, in both Creations of Angels and Men, and in dealing with them, all, for ever, in final Love or Wrath.</p>
            <p>This first Sacrifice related not to the Pardon of Sin, in Angels or Men. They were none of them, then, extant in their own personal Beings. A Preparation for preventing Sin, in both and all, was thereby made; notwithstanding which, many Angels sinn'd and fell, irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43038:39"/>
All Mankind sinn'd and fell, in and with <hi>Adam</hi>; but, recoverably, both as to their Sin and Punishment, and also to a being render'd capable of that true Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation-life, they, at first refus'd. This second Sacrifice of Christ, therefore, in our Nature, related only to the Sins of Mankind. The good Angels never sinn'd, at all. The evil, were absolutely unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable. In reference to Sin, therefore, Christ took on him the Nature of Man, not of Angels, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16.) and, therein, became a little lower than Angels, even than evil Angels, in the Glory of their First-creation, chosen by them, and granted them by God, in his just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them, with a ruling Power over Mankind, therein, all along this short-liv'd World; and then to be stripp'd of all their worldly Power and Glory, and laid down, for ever, in everlasting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, under his unquenchable Wrath, in the lowest Hell-part of the eternal World, to come.</p>
            <p>In reference to this second Sacrifice of Christ, we are to consider his Entrance into this World, in our Nature. The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

               <hi>Mary was found with Child, of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,</hi> Mat. 1. 18. <hi>An Angel appears to</hi> Joseph, <hi>in a Dream, telling him, that what was conceiv'd in her, was of the Holy Ghost; and, warn'd him, that when born, he should call his Name, Iesus, that would save his People from their Sins; and, Immanuel,</hi> also, was he to be call'd, that is, <hi>God with us,</hi> ver. 20-23. <hi>Isa.</hi> 7. 14. The like Account, as to his wonderful Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>the Womb of the Virgin,</hi> we find, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 26-35. and <hi>his Birth,</hi> Luke 2. 7. The good <hi>Angels rejoic'd thereat</hi> (Luk. 2. 13, 14.) not in reference to a procuring their Pardon for Sin, having never sinn'd; but, as knowing thereby, the time draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near, for them (with Old-Testament-Saints) to receive the Holy Ghost, which they waited for, all along, four thousand Years, by a living spiritual Faith, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Love to God, therein, and amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an indissoluble Union with Christ, therein. But, <hi>the Holy Ghost was not given</hi> to Angels or Saints, till our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in <hi>Christ, was ascended and glorified, Iohn</hi> 7. 39. Both the said Angels and Saints <hi>obtain'd a good Report with God,</hi> as

well-pleasing to him, by a living spiritual Faith therein, <hi>though they had not receiv'd the promis'd Holy Ghost,</hi> Heb. 11. 39. From the good Angels Concern, herein, <hi>did they,</hi> with Old-Testament-Prophets, <hi>desire to</hi> pry, <hi>look into, and diligently to search out what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ in them, did signify, when it testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied beforehand, the Sufferings of Christ, and the Glory that should follow</hi> (1 Pet. 1. 10-12.) to our ascended, glorified Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in him; and to them, by the Holy Ghost's being sent down from Heaven, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Angels, with the Spirits of Old-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Saints, departed, and New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Gospel Saints, in the mortal Body, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.1-4. This is the other, <hi>better Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter (Christ told his Disciples, the Father</hi> in pursuance and for accomplishing of his Free-Grace-Mercy, to them, <hi>would send</hi>) than he had yet been to them, as a flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bridegroom, in the but restor'd First-covenant Life and Righteousness of Man, therein, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 26. <hi>This better Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he told them, would teach them all things</hi> (divine and spiritual) and so <hi>bring to their Remembrance, all that he had</hi> hitherto, <hi>spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

to them,</hi> in Parables, earthly Figures and Similitudes, in which, the mystical divine and spiritual Truths, lay hid from them, as well as others.</p>
            <p>The good Angels also rejoic'd at the Birth of Jesus, on the behalf of Mankind, in general; and, of Saints, in special, as the means for recovering all, out of the Darkness and Death, into which brought by their first Sin and Punishment thereof, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9. <hi>The World was made by him,</hi> yet when <hi>he came into the World, none,</hi> in their worldly Life of the Creature, at best, either <hi>knew, receiv'd,</hi> or own'd him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.10. The righteous First-Covenant professing Jews, in Union of mind with evil Angels, were the most signally enrag'd Contradicters, Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and Murderers of him, for his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Doctrine of Salvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.13-15. The exalted Son and Branch, was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Former of himself, in the Womb of the Virgin, <hi>the Son of God, on Earth,</hi> remaining, still, what he was in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <hi>the Son of Man in Heaven,</hi> John 3. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:43038:41"/>Evil Angels and Men were God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive Hand, under his infinite over-rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wisdom and Power, to finish the Death-work on all that was mortal, about him, in our Nature; and so, oft, on Saints, to their greatest Good, and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies greatest hurt.

But, witnessing his Kingdom, <hi>not to be in that worldly</hi> Law-life, but in his Gospel-life of Grace and <hi>Truth,</hi> (<hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 36, 37.) they murder'd him, and so, compleated the Death of him, as to that mortal Law-life, wherein they would have made him their King. They chose rather to be Subjects to a Heathen King, than such a King as he own'd himself to be, (<hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 12, 15.) who would have made him such a King, as would have render'd them Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Enemies to <hi>Cesar.</hi> Here's the

            <p>
               <hi>The God of this World</hi> offer'd Christ, a far larger Bribe than the Jews did, <hi>all the Kingdoms of this World,</hi> visible and invisible, under him (all worldly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Human and Angelical) in Case he would own his Kingdom to be in this First-creation Worldly-life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 8, 9.

            <head>CHAP. XI The Difference of Christ's Death, in our Nature, as to the intent and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof, from Saints Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to him, by the Death of Nature, in them.</head>
            <p>CHRIST's condescending to take our Nature, and, therein, <hi>by the Grace of God, to taste Death for every Man,</hi> (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9.) was in reference to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Sins of Mankind, in <hi>Adam,</hi> and, also, in their own Persons. This was God's appointed Way, for the redeeming and recovering them out of their fallen State, wherein <hi>born, dead in Trespasses and Sins,</hi> (Ephes. 2. 1. Col. 2. 13.) into the Light, and also Life, receiv'd by them, in their First-creation. All may receive this general Redemption-Mercy, the Common-Salvation-Work of Christ, as a Fruit of his meritorious Sufferings and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43038:43"/>
Death, in our Nature, if they will. But, as to the special eternal Salvation of the Elect, in his new and everlasting Covenant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-life, <hi>this is not of him that willeth or runneth,</hi> in the most fruitful Exercise of his own restor'd First-covenant Law-life, <hi>but, of God's</hi> Free-Grace-<hi>Mercy, which he will</hi> (effectually and infallibly) <hi>shew, to whom he pleases, only.</hi> The ceasing from their own Life, Will, and Understanding, is the only appointed Way for their receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this special eternal Salvation-life of God. <hi>Iude</hi> (with others) writ of both these distinct Salvations, common and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, temporal and eternal. And when he had, with all Diligence, inform'd them of the former, he found it needful to exhort them, <hi>to contena earnestly,</hi> in Prayer to God, <hi>for a</hi> living spiritual <hi>Faith, working by Love to him, in the latter,</hi> in which, only, true Saintship and Salvation ever could or will be found, by any Man, <hi>Iude v.</hi> 3. <hi>Thus is Christ the Saviour of all Men,</hi> with a common or general Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; <hi>but of them that believe</hi> in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-life, and place all their Hopes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in that, <hi>with a special,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43038:43"/>
10. <hi>They trust in the living God, that living Word of God, which is God,</hi> John 1.1. Those that wax confident in the common Salvation, the restor'd Life and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Man, do trust in that Life, for Entrance into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which Christ crucified, in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-purity of it, in himself. <hi>God will,</hi> not only, <hi>that all Men should be saved,</hi> with the common Salvation, but has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them capable also <hi>of receiving the Knowledg of the Truth,</hi> (1 Tim. 2. 4.) his Gospel-spirit of Grace and Truth, by the convincing Discoveries thereof, to their natural Understandings. But, after all this, are they liable to apostatize, fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and finally refuse so great Salvation, as is thereby offer'd them, and perish for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4-6.</p>
            <p>The submitting, in Passive Obedience, to the Death and Loss of all, receiv'd from Christ, in the Common-Salvation-Benefit of his Death, rendring them but holy Flesh, is absolutely necessary to their find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the special, eternal Salvation-life of his holy Gospel-spirit, the Holy Ghost. Otherwise, after all, receiv'd in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Salvation,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43038:44"/>
they'l find everlasting Destruction. Conformity to Christ's Death, by the Death of Nature, at best, in us, is the appointed way, to reign with him, in the Life he is ascended into, out of the Death thereof, in himself, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11, 12. Nor Devil, nor Jews, could prevail with him, to own his Kingdom in the Fountain-purity of his worldly Law-life; but, in that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-spirit of eternal Life, he was to ascend into, out of the Death thereof. <hi>Paul,</hi> when a Gospel-Saint, would no longer <hi>know,</hi> or own <hi>Christ himself, after the Flesh,</hi> in but the restor'd fleshly First-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Law-life and Righteousness of Man, but, in his holy Gospel-spirit and Righteousness of God, therein, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>As married to him, therein, only, is it ever possible for any, to bring forth Fruit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God,</hi> Rom. 7. 4. All, fix'd by Satan and themselves, in the Common-Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, become the most irreconcileable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to those, in the special. Those that own but <hi>the Form of Godliness,</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Man, in the Common-Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a State of true Happiness, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43038:44"/>
finally <hi>deny the Power of Godliness</hi> in Christ's Gospel-life, they are mystical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, (after all such temporary Faith in Christ, by which they have receiv'd their own Life, again, from him) the most criminal Sinners, <hi>spiritual</hi> Sodom, Egypt, <hi>and</hi> Babylon, <hi>such as crucified our Lord,</hi> (Revel. 11. 8.) and have been the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of true Saints, all along this World, <hi>from Abel,</hi> downwards, and will so be, to the ending thereof; <hi>and, reckon, they do God Service, therein,</hi> John 16. 2.

            <p>The Surrender and Loss of the Life of our own Spirits, at best, and our own fallible Understandings and corruptible Wills, therein, is the only Way to arrive at the happy Experience of an infallible Understanding and an incorruptible Will, in God's heavenly Creature-life, the only Principle of everlasting well-pleasing active Obedience to him, and Blessedness to us. A ceasing from the best Works, and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the best Fruits, performable or producible by us in our own Spirit, Will, and Way, to live in God's Sabbath-Spirit of true Rest, to us in him and him in us, and Delight only in such incorruptible Fruits as can be brought forth by us, in his Spirit only, <hi>this is such a Fast, and such a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath as he has chosen,</hi> Isa. 58. 5, 13.

This gets Man, by a change from his own earthly, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual sinning Life of Vanity, to God's own heavenly never-sinning Gospel-life.

All, that by a delusive Confidence in their own earthly Life, given them in their First-creation, finally despise God's heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, offer'd by a second, do chuse Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Lie, in Union with him, in the first, in unchangeable Enmity to God's Truth, offer'd by a second.

So, come they to be chang'd from a visible First-covenant People of God, in their own holy Flesh, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Man, into an invisible Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, in his Holy Ghost, or heavenly Creature-Gospel-spirit; and, therein, have a <hi>Life hid with Christ in God,</hi> Col. 3. 1-4.

            <p>
               <hi>The Seed</hi> of Life, put into Angels and Men, in their First-creation, was <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,</hi> in the second, <hi>incorruptible.</hi> This latter is the Life, <hi>which by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, is preach'd</hi> and made known, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23-25. This, Saints come to be the happy Experiencers of, as the Root, Spring, and Principle of their Desire,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43038:49"/>
Thought, and Action. By Death of the First-creation, and Resurrection into the Second, was Christ himself, as <hi>First-born from the dead,</hi> qualified to be the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Creator of Angels and Men, by a First, and the giver to them of eternal Life, by a Second-creation of them. So, only, can any be Subjects to him, in his heavenly Kingdom. None that finally refuse <hi>to suffer and die with him,</hi> in the First, <hi>can</hi> ever <hi>live and reign with him, in the Second,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>By true Regeneration, the corruptible Life, with the fallible Understanding and corruptible Will of the Creature, is chang'd and transform'd into the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and infallible Life, Will and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Creator; <hi>the marvellous Light and glorious Liberty of the Sons of God.</hi>

            <p>The changeable, fallible, womanish Spirit of the First <hi>Adam,</hi> at best, is the mystical <hi>Iezebel, or false Prophetess,</hi> as to Mens eternal Concerns, exactly servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Satan's Designs, in such Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Scriptures of Truth, as to preach up, with all Confidence, his Lie, for Salvation; to them and their finally deceived Hearers everlasting Destruction.

            <p>By the wrong Use of their own Free-will, did evil Angels, at first, set up for themselves, in a Shadow of Divine Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, to be as Gods, in the uncontrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Exercise of their own Wills, as God is, in his infinite Divine Will. And, they soon drew Mankind, in <hi>Adam,</hi> to make the same Choice, with them, <hi>to be as Gods,</hi> telling them, <hi>that God knows</hi> they shall be so, and will own them, therein,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43038:50"/>
as having made a right Choice, for their everlasting Blessedness, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.5. In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of this first destructive Lie, as soon as any of Mankind are restor'd into the Life and Righteousness of Man, by the Redeemer, Satan is at the same Point, with them, as, at first, in <hi>Adam,</hi> and prevails with many such redeem'd ones, to strike up an everlasting Covenant with him, in the First-creation-life of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in unchangeable Enmity to God and the everlasting Life of their Creator. To all such, <hi>God says, what have you to do, to take the Words of my</hi> new and everlasting <hi>Covenant, in your Mouth,</hi> (Psal. 50. 16.) as pretending to preach my Gospel, when Ministers of Satan's other, no Gospel, in a direct Contrariety to mine? <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6,7.</p>

            <p>MAN, in the former, is said to be <hi>a Partaker of the Holy Ghost,</hi> or heavenly Creature-Gospel-spirit of Christ, the living Word of God, under highest spiritual enlightning Gifts. These are <hi>the best Gifts, to be coveted</hi> or desir'd, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable by and upon Man's natural Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; but short yet, of <hi>the more excellent Way</hi> or the very spiritual Life and Gospel-Principle of all right Desire, Thought and Action. Without this, call'd <hi>Love,</hi> as rendring any true Lovers and Beloveds of God, <hi>Fulfillers of the</hi> whole <hi>Law,</hi> Mind and Will of God, after his own Heart, all's <hi>nothing,</hi> as to eternal Life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 31. &amp; 13. 1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8, 10. The natural Understanding (with all such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning

spiritual Gifts, receiv'd thereon) is to be given up, in Sacrifice to God, with the Life wherein exercis'd, for the new spiritual, eternal Gospel-life of God, and true infallible Understanding, therein. Man, under all spiritual Enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, discovering to him, the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gospel-life of the Creator, offer'd by a New Creation, is yet liable, by Satan's Witchcrafts, with his own Consent, to be fetch'd back again, from looking after, or owning Christ's Gospel-life, though known to be his unspeakable Concern, to submit to God's Terms and appointed Way of receiving it, as the only way to find the Salvation of Heaven or scape the Damnation of Hell, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 3. &amp; 5. 7, 8. Thus prevalent was Self-love, at first, in evil Angels, under the clearest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their unspeakable Concern as well as Duty; and, they prevail to bring Men, under the like Knowledg of their eternal Concerns, to make the same wrong destructive Choice, to their known eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ruine. They are perswaded by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to receive his self-pleasing Lie, that by a being made perfect in their Flesh, the

fleshly Life of the Creature, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Man, they will find Peace with God, and Entrance into his Kingdom. This, yielded to, and absolutely conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is <hi>the unpardonable and unrepentable Sin against the Holy Ghost,</hi> Heb. 6. 4-6. &amp; 10. 26, 27. This Sin excludes any, for ever, <hi>from any Benefit of Christ's</hi> merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Sacrifice, leaving them nothing but a certain fearful looking for of Wrath and fiery Indignation, which will devour all such</hi> wilful, incorrigible <hi>Adversaries</hi>; forcing them to dwell with and under everlasting Burnings, as in unchangeable Union of Mind, with the Devil.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:43038:52"/>In Man's Day of judging, such are the only true super-eminent spiritual Saints: in God's, unchangeable Enemies, and the highest sort of Adversaries to him and his Saints. In the ever-new Life of God, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a New Creation, Saints come to experience a new infallible spiritual Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and an incorruptible Will, in Harmony with the very infinite Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mind and Will. In this Life and Principle of Desire, Thought, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can they answer that Command, for <hi>loving the Lord their God, with all their Heart, Soul, Strength, and Mind, and the true</hi> mystical <hi>Neighbour,</hi> Christ, in his Gospel-life, and spiritual Saints, born of God, therein: No fix'd Law-spirited, however righteous Man, loves, but hates the Lord his God, and the true Scripture-Neighbour, Christ and true Saints, the new eternal Gospel-life, in him and them (Head and Members, one mystical Body, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27.) the true Neighbour) with a perfect, unchangeable hatred. This may seem the dangerous Case of the self-confident Lawyer, that tempted Christ, saying, <hi>Master, what shall I do to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43038:52"/>
inherit eternal Life? Christ asks him, what's written in the Law? how readest thou?</hi> These are two distinct Questions. The Lawyer agreed with Christ, in answer to the first, as to <hi>what was written in the Law.</hi> But, was to seek, for answering the second, as to the right reading or understanding, in what Spirit and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Life, 'twas ever possible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what was written, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.25-28. The implacable <hi>Haters of the true</hi> spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Neighbours, Christ and his Brethren, will go away into everlasting Punishment; and the</hi> true <hi>Lovers of them, into Life eternal,</hi> Mat. 25.31-46.

Spiritually enlighten'd Men, finally refusing to submit to the Terms of receiving Christ's offer'd spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Gospel-life (though, a while, among Gospel-Saints, as Members of the true Church, owning Gospel-Truths) will, at length, <hi>depart from them,</hi> and become their most signal Antichristian Enemies, 1 John 2. 18, 19. <hi>Such prove grievous Wolves</hi> to Christ's true Sheep, (<hi>Act.</hi> 20. 29, 30. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 16.) Satan's choicest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43038:53"/>
to disswade and <hi>draw away Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after them,</hi> from looking after, or owning any such thing as Christ's Gospel-life, or Doctrine thereof. Hereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come they the most criminal Sinners, of all Mankind. This, <hi>after they had run well,</hi> among true Saints, owning Gospel-Truths. <hi>Who did hinder</hi> or <hi>call them back, that they should not</hi> finally <hi>obey the Truth? Gal.</hi> 5.7. The Devil. He, prevailingly, call'd them back, from what Christ fairly offer'd, and invited them to, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. Such become Satan's chief Apostles, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of his other Gospel; fitted for his Work, in calling others back, from all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Truths, as diabolical Illusions. So, do <hi>they shut up the Kingdom of God,</hi> and set open Satan's; exclude, explode and deny all Christ's Gospel-Truths, and preach up Satan's Lie, the Life of the Creature, given in the First-creation (transform'd into the Appearance of, and deck'd with all Scripture-Titles, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Gospel-life of the Creator, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd by a second) as a State of true Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

Teachers of Satan's other Gospel, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with all Wisdom, Subtlety, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and Dexterity of Expression, may thus be dressing up Satan's Lie, with all Scripture-Language of Christ's Gospel-Truth, so as with their Hearers to grow irrefragably confident (under Satan's strong Delusion, and God's giving them up, thereto) as verily to think, they are in a State of true Salvation. Thus, the renew'd Old Man, passes for the new Creature; restor'd Nature, for a State of Grace; Reformation of Naturals, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation into Spirituals; Satan's and Man's Nothings, for God's All-things; the restor'd mortal Life and Things of the Creature, for the immortal Gospel-life and Things of the Creator.

At this rate, all along this World (Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's permitted Reign, and Man's Day of judging, under him, in Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and remarkably, in this long Anti-christian

Man's highest Wisdom calls nothing in his pretended Divinity, by the right Name; but, the contrary, in all Extremity. Satan's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel passes currant for Salvation; and Christ's, for a Blasphemous Fiction of the Devil, and Madness.

            <head>CHAP. XIV. Concerning the two Covenants, first and second.</head>
            <p>THE Life, given Angels and Men, in their First-creation, was the Principle of a First-covenant-communion with, and worshipping of God. Many Angels, and all Mankind, in <hi>Adam, by such Knowledg of God, as they had, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by the things that were made, glorified him not as God; were not thankful</hi> for what they had received, nor made the right Use thereof, in Sacrifice to his Will, in order to receive the eternal Gospel-life of their Creator, by a new or second Creation, the only Principle of a new and everlasting Covenant with him. <hi>They became vain in their Imaginations, professing</hi> and owning <hi>themselves wise</hi> enough to know what was best for themselves to do, in their own First-covenant Law-spirit of Works, as not needing any other Life or Things for
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43038:55"/>
true Happiness, in a Second, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19-22. <hi>God made Man upright,</hi> (Eccl. 7.29.) pure and incorrupt, in the First, but not incorruptible, as in the Second. All Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are sad experimental Witnesses of this, however many of them, all along this World, deny it with their Mouths. The Disputers of this World, under Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Inspirations, <hi>seek out many Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> to defend and maintain their evil Choice and false Confidence in the First, (as transform'd into the Likeness, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd with all Scripture-Titles, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Second) in unchangeable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God and the Second.</p>
            <p>This greatest Folly, as to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Concerns, are many guilty of, taking great Pains to dispute themselves into everlasting Destruction. They decry the New-covenant-life, and, therein, the Wisdom and <hi>Righteousness of God,</hi> which Christ requires all, <hi>to seek after</hi> (Mat. 6. 33.) and complains, that <hi>no Man will,</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 11.) while confident in his own fallible Understanding, in which, he can never make one right Step in the Paths of Life to himself, or Peace with God, <hi>Ier.</hi>

Such have been, all along this World, Haters and Murderers of true Saints, Prophets, Apostles, and Christ himself, for the Life and Doctrine of the Second-covenant. True Saints, under <hi>the Inspirations of the Almighty,</hi> are gradually <hi>ceasing from the Labours</hi> of their own Law-spirit of Works, at best, or delighting to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43038:56"/>

This is the true mystical <hi>Fast and Sabbath, which he has chosen,</hi> and requires Men to keep, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. Man is but a mystical Tree of Good and Evil, in his own Spirit, Will and Way; a mystical Tree of Life, in God's.

The delighting in, and feeding on the best Fruits of our own Spirits, in preference to God's, is the self-same thing with <hi>Eve</hi>'s Apple, and our first Transgression, in <hi>Adam.</hi> All First-covenant Life, Wisdom, Righteousness, Works, and Fruits of Man's own Law-spirit of Works, are to be given up, in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

to God, in order to our arriving at the happy Experience of the spiritual, heavenly Creature-life, Righteousness and Wisdom of God, <hi>working all our Works</hi> in his Spirit of Grace and Truth, (<hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 21.) and <hi>bringing forth</hi> right <hi>Fruits to him,</hi> Rom. 7. 4.</p>
            <p>That the First-Covenant Life, given Man in his first Creation, was eternal, is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Lie, (carried on, all along this World, by all manner of Disguises, in his evil Angelical Subtlety) in opposition to God's Truth, in the second. <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moses, to direct to First-Covenant Righteousness of Man, in the living Soul of the first <hi>Adam; but Grace and Truth come by Iesus Christ,</hi> in the quickning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the second; <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. God rewards the Righteousness of Man, for a season, <hi>as a Debt</hi> to him, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4.) but takes away such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from Saints, the inward Comforts of a good Conscience, there; and, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, outward also, by the permitted Hands of evil Angels and Men, to make room in them for his eternal Life and Blessings, where all is of Grace, both
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43038:57"/>
Works and Rewards. <hi>Iob</hi> was a signal Experiencer of both; and <hi>Paul</hi> also, with other Saints; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6-11.</p>
            <p>All that passes in Man's day of judging, and Words of his own Wisdom, for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, will, in God's day of judging, be found, by all that trust thereto, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death. All first-Creation Life and Things thereof, all Works and Fruits, done and brought forth, therein, will pass for nothing in God's day.</p>
            <p>The Temporary Wrath of God, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saints into the <hi>lowest Hell,</hi> in this World, from which there is Deliverance (<hi>Psal.</hi> 86.13.) is God's way for delivering them from the Wrath and Hell to come, which are eternal. The Saints Hell, in this World (as <hi>plagu'd and chasten'd all the day long,</hi> Psal. 73. 14. while <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> have <hi>more than Heart could wish,</hi> v. 7.) is their true Purgatory, cleansing them from all Filth of Flesh and Spirit, and God's way of bringing them into the never-sinning Life and everlasting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of his Spirit of Grace and Truth.</p>
            <p>Man, in his own Spirit, Will and Way, at best, has no right Knowledg of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43038:58"/>
true God; or, God of this World, the Devil; or what the Heaven or Hell-part of the eternal World to come, amount unto; so, on he goes, in the delusive Pleasures of this Mortal World, and Things thereof, literal or mystical, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of his natural Understanding, <hi>without any looking after God,</hi> for his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Heavenly, Eternal, New-Covenant Life and Things, without which, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to find the Salvation of Heaven, or scape the Damnation of Hell.</p>
            <p>The Death of Man's Spirit, at best, in but the restor'd first-Covenant Life of the Creature, is the only way to find the Life of the Creator, in the second. The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> has nothing, but what Death will swallow up into Victory. The Life of the quickning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> will swallow up all Deaths into Victory; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 53, 54. The deepest Reason, and highest Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Man, in a first-Covenant righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life, is by Death and total loss there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the only way to find all again, by way of Resurrection, the very Reason, Wisdom and Righteousness of God, in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43038:58"/>
the quickning Spirit of the second <hi>Adam. Paul</hi> obediently parted with all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for the latter; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6-11. God challenges the Disputers of this World, standing up, with Confidence, in defence of their own Reason and Wisdom, <hi>to produce their strong Reasons,</hi> against him, and see what all will amount unto; <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 21. 'Tis Man's true Interest and greatest Reason, to give up his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Wisdom, for God's. <hi>Iob</hi> was, a while, at this disputing Trade of Man, against God, as <hi>Elihu</hi> charges him; <hi>Iob</hi> 34. 35-37. At this work, we find him, under the Cross, challenging the Almighty to answer his strong Reasons, in Self-defence, and for his Justification, in the Life, wherein he had been eminently righteous; <hi>Iob</hi> 19. 6-11. &amp; 30. 1-10. &amp; 31.35. When Christ told any that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd after eternal Life, the parting with all they have, or can do, in their own Spirit, was necessary to the finding Eternal Life, in his; away they went, and walk'd no more with him; <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 16-22. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 17-22. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 25. &amp; 18. 18-23. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 66.

            <p>All, fix'd in the former, under Satan, unchangably hate and persecute the latter. In their holy Flesh, Righteousness of Man, they fight against God's holy Gospel-spirit and Righteousness of God, in true spiritual Saints.

               <hi>Paul</hi> singles out the particular History of <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ishmael,</hi> in this Point; <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 22-31.

of Religion and Worship of God, so as nothing must pass for Gospel, but what Man pleases to give his Approbation to. The Jews <hi>built the Sepulchres of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> under pretence of paying Honour to them, and owning their Counsel, when with their Fathers, Murderers of all such, and in unchangeable Enmity to all their Words, rightly understood. <hi>If they had been in the days of their Fathers, they say, they would not have been Partakers with them in the Blood of the Prophets</hi>; Mat. 23. 29-31. Under all these Pretences, and self-deceiving Imaginations, Christ declares them, fix'd in the self-same mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Mind of Enmity, with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, against all true Prophets, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self also, as soon appear'd, and therefore ask'd them, <hi>how they could</hi> think to <hi>escape the Damnation of Hell?</hi> ver. 33. Since all such dealings of the Jews with their own true Prophets and Christ himself, with his Apostles, in the foretold long Antichristian Day, now near ending, how have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, idolatrous Haters of Christ and his Gospel-Truths and Saints, been found under the Name Christian, building

            <head>CHAP. XVI. Concerning meer Creaturality in Angels and Men in their first, and also, in their highest spiritual, second, New-Creation Capacities; with some account of all, possible to be done by any in their first, and the differing Ends of all, at last.</head>
            <p>HAving already spoken of the ready prepar'd Hand, the exalted Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Son and Branch in the Mediator's Person, the living Word of God, as qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and fitted for a first and second creating of Angels and Men; come we, now, to consider, what they, both and all, amount unto, for ever, as but meer Creatures, not only in their natural Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Life of the Creature, given them by a first, but also spiritual Beings and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43038:63"/>
Life of the Creator, given by a second Creation of them.</p>
            <p>Angels were all created, at first, in their compleat Personalities, invisible immortal Beings, without any innate Capacity of, or connatural Tendency to the exercise of a threefold Souly or Animalish Life, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, sensual, and vegetable, in and by a fitly Organiz'd Body. As for Mankind, they do gradually descend from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in a continued Succession, Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after Generation, for a compleating their Personal Beings, from the beginning to the ending of this mortal World.</p>
            <p>What became of Angels, good and bad, by the first well-pleasing Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the former, and first unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sin of the latter, has been above-spoken to, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. of this Treatise. Man, inferiour to Angels, in their single intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive natural Understandings, (tho in the same kind of Mortal, Earthly, First-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Life) is, in his compleated Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, a much more comprehensive Being, than an Angel. He is the most compleat shadowy Image of God, on all accounts, in the whole Natural, Mortal, First-Creation
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43038:63"/>
World, visible or invisible. This is signified concerning him, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction from Angels and all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, therein, created before him, in a readiness for his Entertainment. Of none thereof is it said by God, as of him; <hi>Let us make Man in our Image, after our Likeness</hi> (Gen. 1.26.) as the Compend or Epitome of all other Creatures, and something more, peculiar to himself, the rational Exercise of his Mind, in and by a Body, found in no Creatures, above or below him. So find we, a peculiar Consultation of the three that are one, to draw an earthly shadowy Image and Representation of themselves, in every individual Man.</p>
            <p>This Enlargement of Man's Personal Being, beyond Angels, expos'd and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him liable to vain sinful Desires and Thoughts, so as to wallow in Mire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Satan's Swine, feeding on Husks, the lowest Dust of this World (below any Palate in any evil Angels, to savour, any Belly, Desire or Appetite in them, to lust after, delight in, or feed upon, being never link'd with mortal Bodies or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Life) Pleasures, in common with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43038:64"/>
brute Beasts. So, the Enlargement of Man's Being, beyond Angels, was a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution to his intuitive Understanding, in common with them, and to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of his Natural Will, as exposing him, to a running out in his Desires, after the lower sort of Desirables, in the vast heap of vanishing Shadows, in the visible Parts of this First-creation World. And evil Angels, tho they care not for such things themselves, have Power, through God's most wise Permission, to shoot their fiery Darts into Mens Spirits, and kindle in them evil Lustings after such visible things, in which, they keep the far greater part of Mankind, wallowing in Mire, as their Swine, far from any looking after God, at all.</p>
            <p>The Soul, or threefold animalish, souly-Life of Man, distinct from his Spirit, ceases, as to exercise, at the Death of his Body. The Spirit, then, retreats to the full Experience and Exercise of its supream, intuitive Way of discerning and converse with Angels, good or bad; in a spiritual Intuitiveness, with the good, Gospel-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, or natural, with the evil, Law-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43038:64"/>
(Lawyers) from the beginning, on their First Sin and Fall; setting up the Law-life of the Creature, given in the First-creation, against the Gospel-life of their Creator, offer'd by a Second; and so, their Lie, against God's Truth. <hi>The Devil was a Murderer from the Beginning,</hi> (John 8. 44.) and his fix'd Law-party of Mankind, in the restor'd Law-life-Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Righteousness of Man, have been, under him, the irreconcileable Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Murderers of Christ himself and his Gospel-Saints, all along this World. At the Death of the Body, Man (good or evil) is dead. His Spirit is, for a time, strip'd of the threefold Souly-life, as to exercise, that are essential Ingredients, into his personal Constitution. At last, Saints will recover their Bodies, in <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Life,</hi> and, therein, the right Exercise of their whole Beings, Body, Soul, and Spirit, in the incorruptible New-creation Order of all, to Eternity. Incorrigible Sinners, also will receive their Bodies, <hi>in a Resurrection of Damnation, Iohn</hi> 5. 28, 29. Saints, in their glorified Bodies and whole personal Beings, will be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43038:65"/>
everlastingly blessed, in the Enjoyment of God; and incorrigible Sinners, in their whole Beings, most exquisitely sensible under God's everlasting Curse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable Wrath, without any Hope or Possibility of mitigation or end of their Torments, to an endless Eternity. 'Tis a most <hi>fearful thing,</hi> thus <hi>to fall into the Hands of the living God,</hi> to be dealt with, in final Wrath, and infinite revenging Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 31.) without any Day's-man or Mediator to stand between them and such Wrath; but, instead thereof, will he be their Accuser, Witness and Pleader against them, Judg and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of them, and the infallible irresistible Executor of his infinite and everlasting Wrath upon them. All this, will he do, so easily, as by the Word of his Mouth, by which he made them. <hi>With the Breath of his Lips will he slay the</hi> incorrigibly <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> (Isa. 11. 4.) Satan, with his <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> his innumerable Multitude of evil Angels, and serpentine Seed of Men. <hi>His Breath, like a stream of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, will kindle</hi> his unquenchable Wrath upon them, both and all, as having ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43038:65"/>
themselves, fitted perpetual Fuel for it, in the <hi>Tophet, ordain'd of old, the Lake of Fire and Brimstone, prepar'd for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> with their innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable serpentine Seed of Men, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 33. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 10.</p>
            <p>This will be the everlasting Condition of all <hi>Inhabitants of the Earth, and of the Sea,</hi> in distinction from the <hi>Dwellers in Heaven,</hi> who will have eternal Joy and Blessedness, in the Sight and Enjoyment of God, for evermore. All, that in this World, take up their Rest and Dwelling in but the earthly Law-life and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Man, as needing nothing, therein, for true Blessedness (<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17.) <hi>these Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth,</hi> will, with the <hi>Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Sea</hi> (all that Party of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that wallow in the miry Filths of literal <hi>Sodom, foaming out their own Shame</hi>) find their Portion in the same <hi>Lake of Fire and Brimstone,</hi> in the Hell-part of the eternal World to come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 20. <hi>Iude</hi> 13. <hi>Dwellers in Heaven, that have their Conversation in Heaven,</hi> (Phil. 3. 20.) <hi>Minds, fix'd on things above,</hi> the peculiar Delights of the Sons of God, these, only,

            <p>Come we now to consider, what was ever possible to be done by Angels or Men, in their First-creation earthly Life, at best, with reference to their finding
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43038:66"/>
eternal Life, or scaping eternal Death. The Death and Loss of all, therein, Life, Wisdom, Righteousness, Works, Fruits, by Passive Obedience, in Sacrifice to the Divine Will, is undispensably necessary, to the finding eternal Life, the heavenly Creature-life of the Creator. In the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of God's unquestionable Wisdom, and Appointments of his declar'd undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Will, this is the Way to eternal Life. When any ask'd Christ, what they must do, to inherit or find eternal Life, and confidently asserted, all these things they had done, in the restor'd righteous Life and Wisdom of their own Spirit, in their own Will and Way; his reply upon them, and Counsel to them, was, <hi>Part with all this,</hi> and follow me, in the true Regeneration, by Death and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, out of the Death of the Creature, into the Life of the Creator. To this effect, was Christ's constant Answer to such Enquirers. And their constant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting such Counsel, and departing from him, sorrowful and amaz'd thereat, we find, in these Scriptures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 16-22. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 17-22. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 18
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43038:67"/>
-23. None can do the Divine Will of the Father, but in the partaken of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Creature-life and Will of the Son; nor, therefore, enter into his Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21. None but new Creatures can ever come there, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. &amp; 6.15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16, 17. In the restor'd Light of the First-creation, by him that lighteth every Man that comes into this World, (<hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9.) ought all Heathens to walk, and keep that kind of good Conscience, that consists in a moral Obedience thereto, as their Principle. In the restor'd First-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Law-life, ought Men to walk, in such Obedience to that higher Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, as amounts to the legal good Conscience, withstanding all brutish Lusts and sinful Desires of their sensual Life. But all this done, till the partaking of, and experiencing the Life of the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit of the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> or a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spiritual Faith therein, working by Love to God, and walking therein, so as to have the evangelical good Conscience, we have nothing of that eternal Life, in which, only, any can ever enter into the Kingdom of God. <hi>Paul</hi> could truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43038:67"/>
to the Jewish Council, <hi>that he had liv'd in all</hi> these three sorts of <hi>good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science before God,</hi> successively, one after another, in Obedience to the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Law, and Gospel, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.1. And he found his evangelical good Conscience, by living and walking in Christ's Gospel-spirit, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 25.) to comprehend and unspeakably out-do, all, performable by any, in the two former. This, indeed, is the only right Performer of all Duty to God and our Fellow-creatures, in God's Sight.</p>
            <p>All First-covenant Life, receiv'd by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel or Man, in their First-creation, is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively character'd in Scripture, by <hi>Flesh, Grass, a fading Flower,</hi> call'd <hi>a vain Shew,</hi> or vanishing Shadow; all their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Excellencies and Perfections therein, all, but <hi>a Glory to be done away,</hi> in order to receive the heavenly Creature-life and Image of God, in Christ, with the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things of God, therein, the Wisdom and Righteousness of God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 6-8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 24, 25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10, 11.

               <hi>Answ.</hi> They will, till Satan's Reign and Man's Day, under him, are at a full Period. But, what are Men like to get by this Contest? Eternal Death. True Saints oft suffer a violent temporal Death, from such self-confident Contenders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God and them. <hi>Man's</hi> own falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reason or <hi>Wisdom perverts him,</hi> turns him away, from looking after the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Wisdom and Reason of God, to his own sudden unfore-seen everlasting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, <hi>Isa.</hi> 47. 10, 11. He searches the Scriptures, thinks he understands those written Oracles of God, yet never comes to Christ, the living Word of God, for the Life, therein witness'd and declar'd, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 39, 40. The Scriptures are <hi>a Book seal'd,</hi> as to Man's Understanding; that reaches not to the heavenly Creature-life and things therein signified, under Figures, Types and shadowy Similitudes, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.11. All spiritual, Salvation-truths, signified from the beginning of <hi>Genesis</hi> to the End of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> are fast lock'd up and hid from Man's highest single na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Understanding.</p>

               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:43038:69"/>The losing all, in our own Law-spirit of Works, is the only way to find and do all in God's Spirit of Grace, <hi>Esphes.</hi> 2. 8-10. <hi>'Tis by Grace,</hi> only, or in the never-sinning Life of God's Spirit of Grace, in Christ Jesus, communicated to them, <hi>any can be finally sav'd</hi>; never, in their own boasting Law-spirit of Works.</p>

            <p>HE is so call'd in the Scriptures of Truth; <hi>God of this World.</hi> And he uses all his evil Angelical Subtlety and Power, for the blinding and deceiving Men, so as to keep them from any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding or looking after God, for his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-life, wherein alone any can be saved, or ever enter into his Kingdom, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4.

But, says of him, <hi>he hath nothing in me:</hi> nor shall be able to touch, or ever meddle with, so as finally to overcome any Partakers of my all-powerful Gospel-life, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 18. Saints, therein, are
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43038:71"/>
Fence-proof against all the Gates, or Strength of Hell, all the Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, evil Angels and Men, <hi>Rulers of the Darkness of this World</hi> (Ephes. 6. 12.) in their own dark-spirited worldly Life and Wisdom, of the First-creation.</p>
            <p>The first unpardonable Sin of the evil Angels, was their turning as they went, or were a while following Christ, towards that Life, he represented himself in, to them and the good Angels, and in the Passage thereto, by way of Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, in such Transactions as had pass'd in the Creature-part of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Person, before they were brought forth. In a contrary Demeanour to that of the good Angels, they turned as they went, in love to themselves, in their own self-chosen mortal Life, given them in their first Creation, in unchangeable Enmity to God, and the Heavenly eternal Creature-Life of their Creator, offer'd them, by a second. The good Angels did <hi>let down their Wings,</hi> ceas'd from the mortal Life of their first Creation, and Exercise of their own fallible Understandings and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Wills therein, signified by letting
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43038:72"/>
down their Wings, in Conformity to their Head, in the Death of the first Creation, and Resurrection into the Life of the second. So, pass'd out of their own mortal First-Covenant Law-Life, into God's own New-Covenant Gospel-Life, of originally immortal Holiness and everlasting Righteousness; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.5-26.</p>
            <p>The Devil and his Angels <hi>kept not their first Estate, but left their own Habitation</hi>; Jude 6. To Man's Wisdom, they, only, kept their first Estate, the Life and Things given them, in their first Creation. And, consequently, in the Wisdom of Human Nature, is Man ready to follow the evil Angels first Choice, as best. Here's the case of many, restor'd into the First-Covenant or First-Creation-Life of the Creature; ready to establish themselves therein, as a state of true Salvation. This <hi>Paul</hi> fear'd, and labour'd to prevent in his <hi>Israel</hi>-Brethren; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 1-3. At this dangerous Point, were the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> in the delusive First-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant House of feasting and rejoycing (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17.) as not, at all, needing any other Life, by a second or
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43038:72"/>
new Creation, for their everlasting Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness.</p>
            <p>On the first unpardonable Sin of the evil Angels, <hi>they were</hi> immediately <hi>cast down to Hell, deliver'd into Chains of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to be reserved unto Iudgment</hi>; 2 Pet. 2. 4. They, by their Sin, fix'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their own self-chosen Life, in Preference and Opposition to the eternal Creature-Life of their Creator; and God, in his righteous Judgment, giving them up to, and thereby, fixing them in their own Choice, <hi>was a casting them down to Hell.</hi> In this Hell, and their <hi>Chains of Darkness,</hi> are they Rulers in this dark, mortal, first-Creation World. <hi>The Chains of Darkness, in which they are reserv'd to the Iudgment of the Great Day,</hi> are all Life, Wisdom, Righteousness, Excellencies and Perfections of their Angelical Nature, given them in their first Creation, as turn'd by their Abuse of all, into the greatest Wickedness, Madness and Folly, in unchangeable Enmity to God, and his Heavenly Creature-life, shewn and offer'd them, by a second. So are they in a state, in all Extremity, contrary to what
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:43038:73"/>
they were created in, chang'd by Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Self-love, from a state of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary changeable Obedience, to a state of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, unchangeable Enmity to God. An absolute Exclusion of them from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, is called a casting them down to Hell. God, not only gave them their Choice, but also, in the abusive Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their self-chosen Life, a permitted ruling Power over Mankind, all along this World, as God thereof, under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining, limiting, over-ruling infinite Wisdom and Power of the true God, so as that he can never hurt any true Saints or Subjects of God's everlasting Kingdom. Yet, even Saints, for a time, are under their Power. Yea, <hi>he told Christ himself, all the Kingdoms of this World, and Glory of them, were his, offering all,</hi> as his greatest Bribe, to the true King in the World to come, <hi>in case he would fall</hi> down, own, and worship him, as God; <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 8, 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 5-7. Christ denied not, that all the Kingdoms of this World were at his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, by God's most wise Permission. He that said this to Christ, in the Fountain-Purity of the First-Creation, and <hi>full of</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:43038:73"/>
that Spirit of <hi>Grace and Truth,</hi> that's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd by a second, what will he not do to Saints before their experiencing any thing of Gospel-life, or when but in some little beginnings thereof, and Enemies within, Foes of their own House, in their own Spirits and whole Nature, in Union of Mind with him, in Enmity to God and his Gospel-Spirit, in themselves? He is permitted a Power of transforming his Earthly Spirit, into the likeness of Christ's Heavenly Creature-Spirit, that's the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious House and <hi>Temple of God</hi>; and, therein, <hi>to shew</hi> and assert <hi>himself to be God,</hi> the very infinite Divine Being; 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 4. And, herein, is he undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable by the highest single natural Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Man, in but First-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Principles, tho, indeed, the worst of all Creatures, the supream <hi>Man of Sin, and Son of Perdition</hi>; v. 3.</p>
            <p>This <hi>God of this World,</hi> who passes with Man, for the true God, will not be able finally <hi>to blind</hi> and deceive <hi>any but them that are lost</hi>; 2 Cor. 4. 3. If it were possible, <hi>he would</hi> so <hi>deceive the very Elect,</hi> by his <hi>false Christs,</hi> evil Angels, and his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43038:74"/>
               <hi>false Prophets und Apostles,</hi> amongst Men, <hi>transform'd into the likeness of Christ's true</hi> ones; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13-15. Clothing their own First-Covenant Law-Life, with all Scripture-Language and Titles, belonging to God's own Heavenly Creature, New-Covenant Gospel-Life, as the true Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, new Creature, State of Grace, in which they have true Joy, and final <hi>Peace with</hi> God; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 1-10. All this is confidently asserted, by Men, under Satan's lying Spirit of Divination. With such, the renew'd old Man, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd First-Covenant Law-Life, given in the first Creation, must pass for the new Creature, without all Scruple or Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and does so pass, in and with the most reform'd People or Churches of this World, in but First-Covenant Principles. All Worldly Preachers and Hearers, in but Worldly, First-Covenant Principles, confidently take Satan's other Gospel, that's no Gospel, for Christ's true; <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6, 7. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 5.</p>
            <p>Restor'd First-Covenant Law-Life, is so far from rendring any, Fence-proof against the evil Angelical Rulers of this
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43038:74"/>
World, that they make that, their strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Hold, and Men, eminent therein, their choicest Instruments, to oppose, dispute against, contradict and blaspheme the Heavenly Creature-Life, and Gospel-Righteousness of God, wherein any can be sav'd.</p>
            <p>Let Satan, in his superiour evil-angelical Wisdom, and Men in their inferiour hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Wisdom, under his Influence, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Scriptures, all, therein, shall seem to run current, for carrying on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Design, to the everlasting Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his blinded Teachers and Hearers, Leaders and Followers. That shall be preach'd up, as a State of true Salvation and final Peace with God, which, if fix'd in, will be found a State of unchangeable Enmity to God, and eternal Death to Man. All, establish'd in the First-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Law-Life and Righteousness of Man, in unchangeable Enmity to the Gospel-Life and Righteousness of God, go on, to their dying moment, with their delusive Laodicean Confidence therein, to their sad long eternal Condition, in the World to come. <hi>Paul</hi> was confident, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while,

but not fixedly, wilfully and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonably, in his Law-Spirit of Works, against God's Gospel-Spirit of Grace, in true Saints; but, immediately on Gospel-Conviction and Conversion, gave up the Life and Righteousness of his own Spirit, in Sacrifice to God, in order to find all again with Usury, in God's eternal, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting righteous Gospel-Spirit of Grace and Truth; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6-11.</p>
            <p>Many, not only eminent in the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Man, but under highest spiritual enlightning Gifts (receiv'd on their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Understandings, amounting to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the Holy Ghost (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4-6.) in the all-discovering Light, but not the all-powerful Life thereof) are <hi>bewitch'd</hi> back again, <hi>by Satan,</hi> to set up for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in their own holy Flesh, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Man, Life of the Law, against God's holy Gospel-Spirit; refusing to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Death of their own Spirit, at best, for the Life of his. This do they, tho they know Christ himself, crucified that Law-Spirit of Works, in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-purity of it, in his own Person (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 3.) the preserving of which, was

after the Gospel-Life and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, therein; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26.

            <p>He that prevail'd with the first <hi>Adam,</hi> in the Primitive Purity of our Nature, when he found the second <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fountain-Purity of our Nature, a little lower than his Angelical Nature (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9.) he most presumptuosly <hi>tempted him, to fall down and worship him, as God.</hi> What Work is he like to make with Men, in but the restor'd Life, Wisdom and Righteousness of Man, with Filth of Spirit, Enmity to God and his Spirit of Grace, under all?</p>

Hereby, does he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to quench and extinguish the Mind and Life of Christ's Gospel-Spirit in them, keeping up the War of their Flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mind, his Party in them, against their Spiritual Mind, Christ's Party, <hi>so that they cannot do the things they would</hi> (Gal. 5.17.) fully and constantly, till this War within them be finish'd, by a full extinguishing of the Life of their own Spirit, and Mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thereof.

When all Allurements fail, they will, in the Exercise of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Malice, try to fright them out of their Gospel-Profession, and, if permitted (as oft they are) to murder their Bodies, Christ himself was so dealt with by them, and warns his Followers to expect the like; <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 20. &amp; 16. 1, 2. Evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men have a kind of short, self-pleasing Heaven, in this World; and Saints a short, and to their natural Spirit, unpleasing Purgatory-Hell, by which, cleans'd from all Filth of Flesh and Spirit. The former are ripening and fitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the eternal Hell, and God is ripening and fitting the latter, for the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Heaven, in the World to come. God's temporary Wrath upon them, bringing

            <p>When Satan appear'd or stood before the Lord, before whom, he knew it was to no purpose (because impossible) to conceal his way of deceiving, in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s case, he down-right acknowledg'd it, that <hi>he would be a lying Spirit in the Mouth of all his Prophets. And God said, Go, and do so; Thou shalt perswade him, and prevail also</hi>; 1 Kings 22. 22. Thus did he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, as God's permissive Hand, to the Destruction of <hi>Ahab.</hi> His four hundred false Prophets, pleas'd <hi>Ahab,</hi> to his Ruin, and were highly esteem'd; and, God's
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43038:78"/>
one true Prophet that counsell'd him for his good, was <hi>cast</hi> by him <hi>into a Prison, and fed with Bread of Affliction, and Water of Affliction</hi>; v. 26. 27. <hi>He hated</hi> Micaijah, the Lord's true Prophet, as not prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying, what he reckon'd good, concerning him; but, loved and rewarded Satan's false Prophets, as pleasing to his own Will, and after his own Heart's Desire. So, <hi>Ieremy,</hi> who counsell'd King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the preserving their Lives, was cast into a Dungeon, where he sunk in the Mire, while Satan's false Prophets pleas'd them, to their Destruction; <hi>Ier.</hi> 38. 5, 6.

            <p>Satan, that acknowledg'd to God, he would be a lying Spirit in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, is so far from being discover'd by the highest Wisdom or Understanding of Man, in but First-Covenant or First-Creation natural Principles, that he will pass with them, there, for Christ and

God most high, when, indeed, the worst of all Creatures; 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2,3,4. Where God permits this, and not only so, but, in Judgment, gives them up to Satan's Man-pleasing strong Delusions, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving his Lie, rather than God's Truth, the Issue will be, eternal Death to their whole Beings, Spirit, Soul and Body, in <hi>a Resurrection of Damnation</hi>; ver. 10, 12. Men are either brought by Satan, in love to their own righteous earthly mortal Life, given them in their first Creation, to hate God's Heavenly Creature Gospel-Life, offer'd by a second; or by the elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love of God, to hate their own Life, at best, so as to give it up, in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God, in love to, and as the only way for attaining and experiencing his New-Covenant everlasting Gospel-Life, by a second or new Creation; <hi>ver.</hi> 13. This latter is Christ's Counsel (<hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26.) in the Mystery of Godliness: the former, Satan's, in his Mystery of Iniquity. Satan's Counsel is, for sparing, saving and keeping the Life of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, given in the first Creation: Christ's Counsel, is, for the Surrender and Loss of

that, and all the things thereof, for the Life of the Creator, offer'd by a second, and things of God, therein. The keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former, in Preserence and Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the latter, Christ declares will be the loss of all Life and Righteousness, God's and Man's too, on which, their whole Beings, Spirit, Soul and Body, will be laid down, for ever, in the Nakedness of their own unpardonable Guilt, under the unquenchable Wrath of God, for evermore; <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 39. &amp; 16. 25. <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 35. <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 33. <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 25. Man, not only eminent in the First-Covenant Life, Wisdom and Righteousness of Man, but under highest spiritual enlightning Gifts, on his natural Understanding (short of the very Gospel-Life of Christ, or a living spiritual Faith, working by Love to him, therein) is yet within Satan's reach, to beguile, bewitch, and fetch back into an unchangeable Union with him, in the first Creation, and unchangeable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God and his Heavenly Life, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd by a second; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 31. &amp; 13. 1, 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 3. &amp; 5. 7. Satan would keep all Mankind, in the dead, corrupt

State of Nature, wallowing in Mire as his Swine, spending and ending their Days in this World, in the brutish Lusts of literal <hi>Sodom.</hi> But, when cast out, as to this kind of Work in them, as fast as any are brought by Christ, out of such Filth of Flesh, into the Righteousness of Man, he attempts and frequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails to get into such mystical <hi>cleans'd Houses,</hi> and fix them with himself, in Filth of Spirit, unchangeable Enmity to God, and his everlasting righteous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Spirit of Grace and Truth; and then, he has a sevenfold surer hold of them, than ever; <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 43-45. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 24-26.

But, corrupt Nature or Filth of Flesh, fix'd in, with literal <hi>Sodom,</hi> is unpardonable, also. And, therein, do the greater part of Mankind, run their Race in this World, from their Cradles to their Graves.

            <p>Yet, farther, Satan will not only exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise his permitted ruling and tempting-Power over Mankind, all along this World, but after his Imprisonment at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Christ's thousand Years Reign on Earth, and his loosening out of it, at the ending thereof, will he, as his last and most transcendently presumptuous Attempt, rally up his <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> his innumerable Multitude of evil Angels and Men, and in the transform'd Appearance and counterfeit Guise of Angels of Light and true Saints, besiege the New-<hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>-City of true Saints, in the very Glory of the Resurrection, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 1-3. &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 7-9.

The imputed Righteousness of God, to the compleating the imperfect Personal Righteousness of Man (for a First-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Communion with, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God in that Principle) is still but the fading Beauty, and Righteousness of Man, in and with which, he is liable <hi>to play the Harlot</hi> with the Devil, in Enmity to Christ, as offer'd to be a spiritual Head, Lord, Bridegroom and Husband to them, in his Heavenly, Eternal Gospel-Life, by a new Creation of them.

Imputed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Comeliness of God, to Man, in the First-Covenant, on Man's abuse of all, in him, in Union with the Devil, is withdrawn again, and he, for ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of all or any <hi>Benefit of Christ's Sacrifice,</hi> in our Nature; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. In the second Covenant Gospel-Life of God, Man comes to have the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, in him, under and with Christ. This is a Life, a Wisdom, a Righteousness and <hi>a Glory never to be done away.</hi> In this, only, can any enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43038:85"/>
in our own Law-spirit of Works; all such, seeing, working and walking, are to be given up and parted with, in Passive Obedience to the Will of God, in order to find all again with unspeakable Gain, by seeing, working, walking, and doing all things, in the Gospel-Life of God, the only Principle of everlasting, well-pleasing, active Obedience to him, and Blessedness to us. In the infallible Understanding of his Spirit, can we know all things, and in the incorruptible Will thereof, can we do all that God requires of us. God himself, therein, works all our Works for us (<hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 12.) and we work all our Works, in him. These are the only Works, that will not be burnt up, at the last Day; <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 21. All Christ's Gospel-Words, seem'd <hi>hard Sayings,</hi> even to his Disciples, while known to them, but as a fleshly Bridegroom, in a restor'd First-Covenant Principle of seeing, working and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 60. To give up all inward Riches of their own Spirits, all Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Wisdom, Works, Fruits (every thing, given them in their first Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or done by them, therein, at best)
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43038:85"/>
this seems a hard Saying, exceeding strange and amazing to Man's Wisdom. <hi>The</hi> very <hi>Disciples were exceedingly amaz'd</hi> at such words of Christ, saying, <hi>Who then can be sav'd</hi> at all? <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 24, 25. This was a narrower Question, than he ask'd, that said to Christ, <hi>Master, are there few that be saved?</hi> Luke 13.23. If there be no possibility of entring into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, by the best, Man can do or be, in the restor'd Life, Wisdom and Righteousness of his own Nature, he is ready, with the Disciples, to ask the same Question. Consequently, is he ready to deny the Truth of Christ's Saying, and that as a Duty to God, that sure, he would never require more of Man, for his true Blessedness, than the utmost he can do, in the Life, given him, in his first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or restor'd since. The Disputers of this World, under Satan's delusive Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in defence of their Worldly Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Life, Desire, Thought and Action, will never have done, till the ending of the Devil's Reign, and commencing of Christ's. Such Disputers are not to be striven with, but, in Meekness instructed,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43038:86"/>
and if they'll hear, well and good: if they be peremptory and conclusive, in their own fallible Understandings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting and blaspheming all right Gospel-words of Counsel, for true Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Saints may pray, and desire other Saints Prayers, for a Deliverance from such unreasonable Men; who (tho tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Believers in, and Owners of Christ, in the restor'd First-Covenant-Life and Righteousness of Man, which he cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in himself) are mystical Infidels, as to that New-Covenant Gospel-Life and Righteousness of God, he is ascended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. They call all the right Words and Doctrine thereof, a blasphemous Fiction. Here's the pass, true New-Covenant Saints, with their spiritual Faith in Christ's Gospel-Life, are at, with First-Covenant Believers, in their restor'd Law-life. All Contests with them, amount but to <hi>a vain,</hi> unprofitable <hi>jangling.</hi> Such <hi>Teachers of the Law, understand neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm</hi> (1 Tim. 1.6,7.) utterly denying the Gospel-Principle of true Love to God and our Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in which, alone, possible to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:43038:86"/>
and fulfill'd; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8, 10. But, still, this remains to be the Saints Duty, with <hi>Paul, to become all things to all Men</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 20-22.) stooping and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending to all kinds and degrees of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, in the Light of Nature, Law, and Gospel, owning what's good, in any; but, in order to lead them into, and build them up in, what's unspeakably better, Christ's Gospel-Spirit of everlasting Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and infallible Truth. They will, also, as their Duty, bear with such, as at present, persecute them, as Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the Law, by preaching the Gospel-Cross and Death-work of God's Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on their Earthly Law-Spirit of Works, at best. This, Man's Wisdom calls <hi>a blaspheming</hi> or evil-speaking of <hi>the Law,</hi> Moses, <hi>and God</hi>; Acts 6. 11-13. <hi>Paul</hi> was at this Work, for a time, in his own Law-Spirit: Yet, at length, became a most eminent Preacher of the Gospel; and then, was as fiercely persecuted, by such as he once was, in their own Law-Spirit of Works. In Man's day of judging in Religion, and interpreting the Scriptures in the Words of his own Wisdom, all
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43038:87"/>
his Preachings and Writings, therein, will exactly conduce to the carrying on the whole Counsel of the Devil, in his Mystery of Iniquity, for the Damnation of Men, and preventing their Salvation. And, as in Church, so in State-Affairs, may we see what Man's deepest Reason and Wisdom amounts unto, as to his own eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns in the case and end of <hi>Achitophel. His Counsel was, as if a Man inquir'd at the Oracle of God,</hi> and that, under such a Man of God, as was King <hi>David.</hi> In Conclusion, on God's crossing him, and disappointing his Counsel, in the Case of <hi>Absalom, he hang'd himself</hi>; 2 Sam. 16. 23. &amp; 17. 23. Thus, is Man (trusting to his own Understanding, at best, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his Steps) gone, at every turn, in this World, and the World to come.</p>
            <p>To enumerate particular Heresies, all along, since the Primitive Apostolical Gospel-day (and, remarkably, in our own Day, and Nation, within the compass of sixty Years) would be endless, and to no end. If God's Gospel-Truth, be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc'd, and receiv'd, all the Disputes and Controversies, manag'd in the fallible
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43038:87"/>
Understanding of Man, on all hands, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Satan's Lie, in his Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, will be discover'd, and laid in the Dust.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIX. Concerning true Charity or Love.</head>
            <p>TRue spiritual Saints, in God's Gospel-Spirit, call'd <hi>Love,</hi> are the only right Performers of all Duty to God and their Fellow-Creatures, therein. They have a right Love to all Men (not known to be fix'd in Enmity to God and them) and a peculiar <hi>Brotherly Kindness</hi> to the Houshold of Faith, Christ's and their spiritual Brethren. Yet, are none reckon'd by Men, in their own Wordly Life and Wisdom, at best, so universally uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, as reckoning all, below their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Principle of true Life, to be in great danger of Damnation. Men, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd Life, Wisdom and Righteousness of their own Spirits, are ready to say to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43038:88"/>
them, as the Disciples said to Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Who then can be sav'd,</hi> at all? Are all Mankind damn'd, both corrupt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? This amazing Truth, renders Saints, in all appearance, the most uncharitable of all Men. If <hi>all the World wonder after the Beast, and worship the Dragon, that gives Power to his</hi> Human <hi>Beast,</hi> his false Prophets and Apostles (in their Wordly First-Creation Principles, at best, all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Wisdom of Man) what a most uncharitable, censorious Creature, must the true Saint appear to be? <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 3-7. If all <hi>that dwell on the Earth,</hi> fix and set up for entring into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, in but their own Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life, in which none can ever enter thereinto, what must Christ's <hi>few in the narrow way, whose Names are written in the Book of Life of the Lamb, slain from the Foundation of the World,</hi> be accounted? v. 8. <hi>They that are of the World,</hi> in but the Earthly Life of the first Creation, <hi>preach up that,</hi> in the Righteousness, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Glory of it, as a state of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; <hi>and the World,</hi> all in that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>hear</hi> and own their Doctrine, as
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43038:88"/>
God's Gospel-Truth. <hi>We are of God,</hi> says <hi>Iohn, he that knoweth God, heareth us: he that is not of God, heareth not us</hi>; 1 Joh. 4. 5, 6. What is Man's Wisdom like to say, to this? You are in the right Principle for Salvation, and all, short there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or contrary thereto, in a delusive Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, doing, saying and worshipping they know not what. This is your most presumptuous, uncharitable and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Opinion of others, and a justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your selves, as the only true People of God. The First-Covenant righteous teaching and professing Jews said to Christ, <hi>they were born of God, and that he had a Devil, and was mad</hi>; Joh. 8.48. and 10.20. and 8. 52. <hi>Now we know that thou hast a Devil.</hi> Here's the Language of a First-Covenant People, fix'd in their own Earthly Spirit, concerning Christ himself and his Followers, by the Death of that, into the Life of his Heavenly; his Holy Ghost, they call the Devil. While <hi>the God of this World</hi> passes for the true God, with any, what other Language can be expected from them? <hi>If the World hate you,</hi> says Christ, <hi>ye know that it hated me,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43038:89"/>
before it hated you</hi>; Joh. 15. 18. It was the highest Rank of Men, in the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, a righteous visible People of God, that contradicted, blasphem'd and murder'd Christ himself. What can his true Followers expect? His chusing them out of the World, his transforming them, by death of their own Earthly Spirits, and Resurrection into the Life of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, will render them hateful to all, fix'd in their own Earthly; <hi>ver.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>True Saints in Christ's Gospel-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, can answer that Command of God, in Sincerity and Truth (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44.) <hi>Love their Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They</hi> can truly <hi>forgive other Mens Trespasses against them.</hi> These are Commands, too hard for Man, in his own Nature and Spirit, at best, to answer. The right performing them is an infallible Evidence of their being born of God's Heavenly Creature-Spirit, or Holy Ghost; <hi>ver.</hi> 45. They that pray, <hi>God would forgive their Trespasses against</hi> him, <hi>as they forgive others Trespasses against</hi> them, in case they do not so forgive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they pray, in effect, God would not forgive them; <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:43038:89"/>True Saints, on all accounts, are truly and universally, the only right Performers of all Duties to God and their Fellow-Creatures, by a true universal Charity or Love to all Men, not fix'd in Enmity to God. Such, 'tis their Duty, in Union of Mind with God, <hi>to hate with a perfect Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi>; Psal. 139. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>Christ himself said, of our Nature in the Fountain-Purity of it, <hi>I can of my self do nothing</hi>; John 5. 30. The only doing Principle, for everlasting well-pleasing, active Obedience to the Divine Will, in me and my Followers, is my Heavenly Creature Gospel-Spirit of Grace and Truth.</p>
            <p>Against this Spirit of Truth, God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Satan to carry on his Mystery of Iniquity, by transforming his Earthly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the likeness of Christ's Heavenly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Spirit, that's God's House, and as <hi>sitting in that Temple of God, shewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be God.</hi> And then, are his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters (preaching up the Righteousness of Man, only, for eternal Life) <hi>transform'd into the</hi> likeness of the Gospel-<hi>Ministers of the Righteousness of God</hi>; 2 Cor. 11.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43038:90"/>
13-15. They dress up Satan's and their Earthly, with all the Titles belonging to Christ's Heavenly Spirit; and are receiv'd and own'd, beyond all Dispute and Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, as true Ministers of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Where Satan, in and by his Party, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, sits on the Judgment-Bench (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 13.) and Gospel-Saints forc'd to stand at the Bar, all right Gospel-words, for their Defence, will be reckon'd matter of Condemnation to them, without any need of other Witnesses against them. Christ himself was thus handled. <hi>He has spoken Blasphemy, says the High-Priest, What think ye? Guilty of Death, say the Iews,</hi> as his Jury; on which <hi>they did spit in his Face, and smite him, saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, who is he that smote thee,</hi> Mat. 26. 65-68. They not only condemn'd, but ridicul'd him, in their proceeding towards the murdering of him. This did they to him, who had that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in him, which created all Angels and Men.</p>
            <p>True Saints give no ground for any to despair of Salvation, who are not guilty of the unpardonable Sin against the Holy
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43038:90"/>
Ghost, in a fix'd wilful, unchangeable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Gospel-Spirit of God. They also endeavour, by all Condescensions, Ways and Means, to bring them into the Knowledg and right owning of Christ's Gospel-Truth, in which, alone, any can be sav'd. Final Refusers of their Gospel-Counsels, will persecute them, for their Pains, as has been experienc'd in all Times. And, we are now drawing near to, yea, are in the worst of Times, since <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, under the permitted Exercise of <hi>Satan's great Rage, because he knows he has but a short time,</hi> to the finishing of his Reign over Mankind, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. All manner of Wickedness encreases and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, more and more, continually; such Wars, Tumults and Confusions, of all sorts, as now are, have not been the usual Experience of former days. All tends to the running down the present Generation, towards that <hi>Midnight</hi>-darkness; a State, in which, Christ declares, that at his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Coming, he shall find the World, at near the same pass, Mankind were found in at the Flood; <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 37-39. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:43038:91"/>Under all these Discouragements, Saints have an infallible fore-head-Sight, what Matters will come to, on all Hands, at the winding up of all, in the final Love or Wrath of God. Then, the unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Charity of Men, warranting Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Peace with God, in a Principle, where never to be found, will be sadly and remedilesly experienc'd by themselves and their blinded Followers, to have been the leading their Hearers into everlasting Destruction, with themselves. Then all Persons and Things, all Words and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, will be call'd by the right Names. Under Satan's permitted Reign, all things in Religion and the Worship of God, have been call'd by wrong Names, all along this World, and will more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently be so call'd, to the full ending thereof. In these last Days, and near approach of the second Coming of our Lord, will there be more Scoffing at any such thing, and a more universal Disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and Denial of the Spirit he will come in, than ever, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XX. The Conclusion of this whole Treatise, shewing the Security of true Saints, all along this troublesom confounded World; wherein God never suffers the Rulers of this dark World, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils or Men, to do any thing to them, in their implacable Malice, but what his infinite Wisdom and Power over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules into a constant Conducibleness to their greatest Good. This, with many other things, are the Matters of this Concluding Chapter.</head>
            <p>TRUE Saints have God, and Christ himself, on their Side, in a Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nership with them, under all the Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Contradictions of Men, to their Words of God's Wisdom, Words which the Holy Ghost, his Gospel-spirit in them,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43038:92"/>
teaches. In Blaspheming such Words, they blaspheme Christ himself and God Most High. Christ say'd to such as <hi>search'd the Scriptures,</hi> in but their own Understandings (and thought they had eternal Life, in such Obedience as was performable by them, in the restor'd Life of their own Law-spirit of Works) <hi>ye will not come to me,</hi> the living Word of God, for my Gospel-life of Grace and Truth, in which only, any can be sav'd, or enter into my Kingdom, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39,40. From the same infallible Mouth of God, we have a yet seemingly harder Saying than this; <hi>No Man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me,</hi> by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Power of his electing Love, <hi>draw,</hi> bring and give <hi>him to me,</hi> John 6. 44. <hi>And, I will give eternal Life to as many as the Father hath given me,</hi> (John 17. 2.) to all, <hi>whose Names are written in me,</hi> the living Word and <hi>Book of Life,</hi> (Revel. 13. 8.) <hi>predestinated to be conform'd to me,</hi> in that heavenly, eternal Creature-life, into which I was exalted, <hi>as the Lamb slain, from the Foundation of the World,</hi> out of the Death of the First-creation,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:43038:92"/>
into the Life, appointed to be given An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, by a Second, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. The attaining eternal Life, <hi>is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,</hi> in the Life, Will and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own Spirit, at best; but of the Will of God, <hi>who will shew to whom he please, such Mercy,</hi> as is the Free-Grace-Gift of quite another Life, Will and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than was given Angel or Man, in their First-creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>The Election,</hi> or Elect from among Mankind, <hi>will obtain what they seek for,</hi> even eternal Life; <hi>the rest will be blinded</hi> by Satan, and find eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. These, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the like Sayings in the Scripture, seem exceeding hard to Man's Wisdom, in which, if the attaining eternal Life, or scaping eternal Death, be not in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his own Will; and if the things of God, in his eternal Gospel-life, be quite out of the reach of his own Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so as that it is impossible to be sav'd, in his own Will and Way, he is ready with his strong Reasonings to charge God himself with Unrighteousness, as requiring Impossibilities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 14-21. Man,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43038:93"/>
with all <hi>his strong Reasons, when he produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his Cause,</hi> and stands up in his own Defence against God, will be found <hi>less or worse than nothing,</hi> Isa. 41. 21, 24. All seeming hard Sayings, in the Scriptures of Truth, about Mens eternal Concerns, (the finding eternal Life, depending sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly and meerly, on the electing Love of God) exclude none from the Hope of a Share or Portion therein, till guilty of the unpardonable Sin against the Holy Ghost or Gospel-spirit, and so, of unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enmity to God. Even Gospel-Saints know not who are elected of God, till it appear to them, by the self-evidencing Fruits of Christ's Gospel-spirit, in them. On this account, <hi>Paul knew</hi> his Gospel-converts, amongst the Thessalonians, <hi>to be the Elect of God,</hi> 1 Thess. 1.4,5. Those that are elected of God, and shall be true Saints, are born, with all others of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>dead in Trespasses and Sins,</hi> Ephes. 2. 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13. Could the self-confident righteous Scribes and Pharisees, think <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalen</hi> and <hi>Zacheus,</hi> the Elect of God, while in the same corrupt Spirit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with other Publicans and common
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43038:93"/>
Sinners, in Filth of Flesh? Could awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd Gospel-Saints think <hi>Paul</hi> elected of God, when they saw him a fierce Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and Blasphemer of all Gospel-Truths? None are absolutely excluded from a Hopefulness of a Share in God's electing Love, and so of finding eternal Life, till fix'd by their own sinful, unpardonable Choice (and God's righteous Judgment upon them, in giving them up thereto) in Filth of Flesh or Spirit, corrupt or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Nature, rendring them a literal or mystical <hi>Sodom,</hi> in unchangeable Enmity to God and his Gospel-spirit of Grace and Truth. No Scriptures, rightly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and understood, give ground to any, for despairing or giving up all Hopes of God's electing Love, save to the two abovesaid Sorts of Sinners. A distrusting our own Understandings, and Wills, at best, as to the finding eternal Life, or ever answering the whole Mind, Will, and Counsel of God; such a kind of Despair, is a Duty, of high Concern; and, a false Confidence therein, is exceeding dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as answering Satan's whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, to our eternal Destruction. God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warns
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43038:94"/>
us hereof, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 23. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 5-7. None will finally take this warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the Elect, and not they, till the dormant Seed of Gospel-life, unknown to themselves, be actually quicken'd and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd up in them. The Words of God's Wisdom and Counsel about our eternal Concerns, are universally contrary to the Words of Man's Wisdom. Christ told the self-confident Law-righteous Scribes and Pharisees (who reckon'd themselves and Followers, such as were <hi>born of God,</hi> (<hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 41.) and could not miss the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Heaven) they were <hi>Serpents, a Generation of Vipers, that could not escape the Damnation of Hell,</hi> Mat. 23. 33. He calls them <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> not as pretending, only, to, and not really experiencing the Righteousness of Man; but, as account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves, therein, the only true Saints, in the Kingdom-life and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God, when in unchangeable Enmity thereto. All such Interpreters of Scripture, exploding, denying and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming Christ's Gospel-life and Truths, in which any can ever enter into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are said <hi>to shut up the Kingdom of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43038:94"/>
Heaven, disswading any that are looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Life, in which,</hi> alone, possible <hi>to enter into it,</hi> as a most dangerous delusive Fiction, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Except our</hi> Life and <hi>Righteousness</hi> be quite of another kind, than the Law-life and Righteousness of Man, to wit, the Gospel-life and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God, by a New or Second-creation, <hi>we can in no wise, enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 5. 20. The highest Rank of Antichristian Enemies to true Saints, and their Doctrine of Grace, in the Words of God's Wisdom, are such righteous Men, who set up for Salvation, in the same Law-principle of restor'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as Christ found the teaching and professing Jews, in. Under all blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Contradictions, and Persecuting-work of such as set up in the restor'd earthly Law-life and Righteousness of Man, in preference and opposition to the Heavenly Gospel-life and Righteousness of God, Saints have <hi>God on their Side; who can be against them,</hi> (Rom. 8.31.) so as <hi>to do them</hi> the least <hi>Harm?</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 13, 14. Whatever Devils or Men, as God's permissive Hand, can, in their implacable
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:43038:95"/>
Malice, do to them, is infallibly overrul'd by God's infinite Wisdom and Power, for their greatest Good. They are secur'd from any hurt, by <hi>the great red Dragon,</hi> or any of his innumerable serpentine Seed of Mankind, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.3-5. What was the Issue of the first War, in Heaven, between <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, in the heavenly Life and Glory of the New or Second-creation, and the Dragon and his Angels, in the earthly Life of the first, we find, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. They were utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of Heaven, from ever entring thereinto, as transform'd by themselves into the Guise or Appearance of true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Angels of Light. And, by such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Work, <hi>does that Old Serpent, the Devil and Satan, deceive the whole World,</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 9.) all, in but the worldly Principle of Life, and Righteousness of Man. By such deceitful <hi>transforming Work of Satan and his Angels</hi> of Darkness, <hi>into Angels of Light,</hi> and his Ministers of but the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Man, into the Likeness of Christ's true Gospel-Ministers of the Righteousness of God, does he decry all Gospel-Truths, as the greatest Heresies
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43038:95"/>
and Blasphemies in the World. Christ himself suffer'd himself, to be so dealt with, by them. When Saints declare the Gospel-life, and assert, that therein, only, any can ever enter into Heaven, or scape the Damnation of Hell; they do not deny that any in the corrupt or righteous Life of their own Nature or Spirit, can ever come to experience Christ's Gospel-life, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his Kingdom; but endeavour to be instrumental, under Christ, for leading them thereinto, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24-26.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Does the Gospel-Doctrine of true Salvation discourage or condemn the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Man, in the honest moral Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, walking in a Sutableness to the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Light of Nature, restor'd by Christ, in all Mankind, as</hi> a Light which lighteth every Man that comes into the World? John 1. 9. <hi>Does it discourage the righteous First-covenant Iew, or Christian, walking in his higher kind of good Conscience, in the restor'd First-covenant Law-life, as his Principle, owning the imputed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ, there, for the compleating him, in a First-covenant-Communion with,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43038:96"/>
and worshipping of God? Consequently, does it judg and condemn the moral Heathen, or legally righteous First-covenant Iew or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, for teaching and exhorting others, to walk in such Obedience to God, as is performa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the said Light of Nature, or Life of the Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Nothing of all this, is justly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable to the right Teaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. Moral and legal Righteousness of Man is good for himself and his Fellow-creatures in this World, (<hi>Iob</hi> 35. 8.) and better in God's Sight, than gross Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Injustice, vile Affections and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Lusts: but, as to entring into the Kingdom of God, in the World to come, not at all, available, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15. God himself testified of <hi>Iob</hi> to the Devil, <hi>that there was none like him in the Earth, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, upright Man, fearing God and eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil,</hi> Job 1. 8. The Devil (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Iob,</hi> in all this, to be rewarded of God, as a Debtor to him, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4.) for such Righteousness, in a Plenty of this World's temporary good Things) replied, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Hast thou not bless'd the Work of his Hands, and encreas'd his Substance in

the Land? Take all this away</hi> again, <hi>and see, if he curse thee not to thy Face,</hi> v. 11. <hi>God puts it into Satan's Power,</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental, herein, for the Trial of <hi>Iob</hi>'s Patience, and carrying on the Work of his Cross upon him, in a Conducibleness to his greatest Good. <hi>His</hi> ten <hi>Children are kill'd by a great Wind, blowing down the House, where they were Feasting</hi>; all his Goods were taken away by wicked Men, under the Influence of the Devil. Thus far, <hi>Iob</hi> did bear his Trial, <hi>without sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or charging God, foolishly; blessing the Lord, that gave him, and then took all the said Gifts away, again, from him.</hi> Then Satan desires the Liberty of smiting his Body, and God grants him a limited Power, as to that. Then Satan moves his Wife, to counsel him, to do what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, had said to God, (<hi>Iob</hi> 1. 11.) <hi>Curse God and die,</hi> Chap. 2. 9. Job <hi>rebukes her, saying, shall we receive Good from God, and not Evil? In all this did not</hi> Iob <hi>sin with his Lips,</hi> Job 2. 5-10. But, when he felt the Cross or Death-work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, on his very Spirit, as to the Life, Wisdom, and Righteousness of Man,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43038:97"/>
and Satan's permitted working upon him, in this Hour and Power of Darkness, he was sorely put to his utmost Trial, and utter'd many hard Words against God's strange and wonderful Dealings with him, reflecting upon his faithful Walking, (<hi>Iob</hi> 29. 2.) so as not, in the least, to deserve any such dealing of God with him, <hi>Iob</hi> 3. &amp; 19. 1-11. &amp; 31. 35. <hi>He desires that the Almighty would answer him.</hi> Here's the Case and Demeanour of the Mirror of Patience, next the Lord himself, under all Sufferings, in our Nature. <hi>Elihu char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges him with multiplying his Words against God,</hi> Job 34. 37. <hi>The Lord himself char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges him with darkning Counsel, by Words without Knowledg,</hi> Chap. 38. 1, 2. He saw not, as yet, or understood the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Advantage of all this strange Dealing of God, with him. So, <hi>contended with the Almighty,</hi> and therein, <hi>reprov'd God himself,</hi> Chap. 40. 1, 2. He reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his former Condition and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in all worldly Prosperity, and such an Eminency in Wisdom and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, that when he open'd his Mouth in Counsel, <hi>Princes refrain'd talking, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43038:97"/>
Nobles held their Peace; now, Children of Fools abhor'd him, made him their Song and By-word, not sparing to spit in his Face, Iob</hi> 29. 9, 10. &amp; 30. 8-10. He comes, at length, <hi>to abhor himself,</hi> in such a Change of Life and Mind, for the better, as to rejoice in seeing all the fading Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Wisdom and Righteousness of his own Spirit, turn'd into Dust and Ashes, as the Way of God, for experiencing his heavenly Creature-life, above all Deaths, and his eternal good Things, therein, the Righteousness and Wisdom of God, and his living and <hi>working all his Works, in God's Spirit</hi> of Grace and Truth. But, in the hundred and forty Years of his Life, after all this, we hear not a Word of such high Esteem with Men, as when eminent in the Wisdom, and Righteousness of Man.</p>
            <p>Were the restor'd Life and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Man, all that God requires of him, for entring into his Kingdom, Godliness would be no Mystery. The Light of Nature, in all Men, convinces, judges and condemns all gross Sins, vile Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and brutish Lusts in all others, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43038:98"/>
themselves also, who are guilty thereof. And, then, also, Satan would have no Mystery of Iniquity, to make use of, in his destructive Practisings upon Mankind. But, for this, he has, not only all the Wisdom, Righteousness and Glory of the First-creation, in himself and Men, to deceive them, by; but a permitted Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, also, to transform all that, in himself and Men, into the Appearance and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ's Gospel-life, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God, and by his Ministers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Men, to dress it up with all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Language and Titles of the very Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Truths of God; Regeneration, New-Creature, and the like. So does Satan, as the supream mystical Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with his whole Babylonish Party of evil Angels and Men, (furnish'd with all Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the First-creation, and counterfeit Appearances also of the Second) carry on his Work, in the womanish Spirit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, against God's manly Spirit of Grace, as deck'd and adorn'd with all worldly Glory, Pomp and Beauty, and having <hi>a gilded</hi> (not golden) <hi>Cup, full of Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, by which, to deceive, if possible, the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:43038:98"/>
very Elect,</hi> and, infallibly, all others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlasting Destruction. Even <hi>Iohn,</hi> the peculiarly beloved Disciple, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Apostolical Saint, <hi>marvel'd to see</hi> the Pomp and Glory of Satan and his whole Party, herein, and in all that, call'd, <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,</hi> Babylon <hi>the Great, Mother of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, and Abominations of the Earth</hi>; all, amounting to a rebellious fixing in the earthly Life of the Creature, in unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enmity to God, and the heavenly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-life of the Creator, offer'd by a New-creation. The Righteousness and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Man are the best sort of things, in Nature's First-creation; <hi>spiritual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning Gifts are the best Gifts,</hi> towards a New-creation, receivable by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Understanding; and yet, Man, in all these Advantages, short of the very Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-life of God, or a living spiritual Faith therein, <hi>is nothing,</hi> has nothing that will give him Entrance into the Kingdom of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 31. &amp; 13. 1, 2. The best things in Nature, are corruptible, and if corrupted, become the worst of all things. The highest Light, Wisdom and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, therein, establisht, in preference
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43038:99"/>
to the marvelous Light, Wisdom and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God, offer'd by a New-creation, <hi>is the greatest Darkness,</hi> Wickedness and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.23. Mystical <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> is worse than literal, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.23,24.</p>
            <p>The prevailing Power and Danger of Self-love, did most signally appear in the first Sin of evil Angels. Under the clearest Knowledg of the Will and Command of God, that was possible to be given to their supream natural intuitive Understandings, for the right use of their natural Beings and Life, given them in their First-creation, in order to the Second, they turn'd away from God's Offer of the latter, in Love to themselves, in the former. This did they, in a known Rebellion against God, and a known Contrariety to their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Concern, for finding eternal Life or scaping eternal Death. They preferr'd the Life of the Creature in themselves, to the Life of the Creator, in himself, in an unchast, adulterous, murdering Mind of unchangeable Enmity to their Creator, as offer'd to become their Lord, Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom and Husband, in the Life of that all-powerful Spirit, that gave them their
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43038:99"/>
own Beings and Life, by a First-creation. They added to this first unpardonable Sin, the drawing all Mankind, in <hi>Adam,</hi> to make the same evil Choice, for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And, all along this World, when any are restor'd into the Life of the First-creation, and brought under high spiritual enlightning Gifts, convincing Discoveries and Offers of the heavenly Creature-life of God by a Second, evil Angels do attempt, and prevail with many, under such Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, to fetch them back again, from Christ's offer'd eternal Gospel-life of the Creator, in his holy Spirit, and set up for themselves in their own holy Flesh, or earthly Life and Righteousness of Man. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 3. &amp; 5. 7, 8. <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> with many others, are signal Instances of such Apostacy from Christ, under the prevailing Influence of evil Angels. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord came upon</hi> Saul, so that he was among the Prophets of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the enlightning Gifts thereof, by which <hi>God turn'd him into another Man, gave him another Heart,</hi> to see, know, and seek after him. But, he turn'd from God, and <hi>the Spirit of God departed from him</hi>;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43038:100"/>
and when his Life was in danger, he ask'd Counsel of the Devil, in a known Witch, what would become of him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 6, 9, 11. &amp; 16. 14. &amp; 28. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Balaam,</hi> taken by the Lord, for a time, out of the Hands of the Devil, was forc'd, contrary to his own and the Devil's, and <hi>Balak</hi>'s Mind, to bless, instead of cursing <hi>Israel.</hi> He declares, that <hi>he heard the Words of God, and knew the Most High, saw the Visions of the Almighty,</hi> Numb. 24. 16. He pray'd, that <hi>he might die the Death of the Righteous, and that his last End might be like his,</hi> Numb. 23. 10. <hi>He tells</hi> Balak, <hi>if he would give him his House full of Silver and Gold, he will speak what the Lord says,</hi> Chap. 24. 13. After all this, the Holy Ghost in <hi>Peter,</hi> charges him, with <hi>loving the Wages of Vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 15. When he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self disabled to curse <hi>Israel,</hi> he counsell'd the Midianitish Women, to go amongst them, to allure them to Whoredom, and so, to cause the Lord to appear against them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 16. And, listing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the Midianites Army, <hi>was slain, with the five Kings of</hi> Midian, <hi>by the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites Sword,</hi> v. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:43038:100"/>None, in the restor'd Life of Man, and under the enlightning Discoveries and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of the Gospel-life of God, are out of Satan's reach, till <hi>born of God.</hi> Then have they a Life in them, <hi>which the evil one cannot touch,</hi> 1 John 5. 18. All re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd Life and Righteousness of Man, renders Men but natural <hi>Branches in Christ, Servants in the House of God,</hi> liable to be turn'd out again, and <hi>cast into</hi> unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Fire,</hi> John 15. 1-6. &amp; 8. 35. In all restor'd Law-life, and Freedom of their own Wills, <hi>Men are under the Law,</hi> and <hi>under the Curse,</hi> (Gal. 3. 10.) in danger of the final condemning Power thereof, while destitute of that Gospel-life, that's the only continuing Principle of infallible everlasting well-pleasing Obedience to God. This brings with it, into Man, the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Christ makes Men free indeed</hi>; in a free Will to Good only, under an Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of ever doing Evil, therein. The Will of Man, in New-creation-life, is in unchageable Harmony with the very Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will. In this, <hi>he never sins.</hi> But, in his own Will, till fully crucified, the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43038:101"/>
Saint continually sins, opposing and <hi>fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against</hi> his spiritual Will, that never sins, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 9. &amp; 1. 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15, 19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. In the First-creation, at best, Man was but a mystical <hi>Tree of good and evil,</hi> but changeably good, and liable, by his own choice, to become unchangeably, unpardonably, and unrepentably evil. In the second, he becomes a particular Tree of Life, under and with Christ, amongst the innumerable Multitude of blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints, unchangeably Good, and under an Impossibility of ever becoming unchangeably evil. The uncontroll'd So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of our own Will, at best, and the highest Light of our own Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fix'd in, is the <hi>greatest Darkness</hi> and Bondage. The unchangeable Subjection and <hi>Captivity</hi> of our Will <hi>to the Will of God,</hi> is the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5.</p>
            <p>Man, in all the Light, Life, Wisdom and Righteousness of the First-creation, (restor'd by Christ, as the Common-Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation-Benefit of his Death in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-purity thereof) is still within the Compass of Satan's universal Monarchy
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43038:101"/>
or Kingdom of this World, in Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the marvellous Light and glorious Liberty of the Sons of God, in Christ's reigning Gospel-spirit of the World to come. The Old Serpent was too hard for humane Nature, and so, for all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in <hi>Adam,</hi> at best, in the primitive Purity, and personal Perfection of all First-creation-life and Things. We must quit all kindred with the first <hi>Adam</hi>; yea, with Christ himself, as a Husband and Head to us, in but the restor'd fleshly Life and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Man, to be married to him as our spiritual Lord, and Bridegroom, in that quickning Spirit of the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> his Gospel-spirit of <hi>true Holiness,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 16. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45-47. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 24. Christ crucified the living Soul of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in himself, by which, he purchas'd the restoring of that, in Mankind; and, therein, also, became an unerrable Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to them, for the right Use thereof, in Passive Obedience to the Will of God, in order to the attaining that heavenly, eternal, incorruptible Creature-life, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into, which is the only Principle of everlasting well-pleasing active Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43038:102"/>
to God, and Blessedness to Man.</p>
            <p>Man, in his First-creation, at best, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Fall, had but a fallible Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and a corruptible Will. And, what was fallible, Satan could and did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: what was corruptible, he could and did corrupt: all Mankind are sad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Witnesses of both. And, the same things can he do to any, in but the restor'd Life and Righteousness of Man, of the First-creation sort, ever since.</p>
            <p>If we consider the small part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind this Day, under the Name, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and even amongst them, so call'd, somewhat rare to find such as walk in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the common Light of Nature, as honest moral Heathens, and much less yet, as First-covenant Believers in Christ, and much less yet, as having a living spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Faith in his Second-covenant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-life; all this put together, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, evidence the near approach of Christ's second Coming, of which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has said, <hi>that when he comes, shall he find Faith on the Earth,</hi> (Luke 18. 8.) a Faith in that Gospel-life, he will come in? Both <hi>Wise Virgins,</hi> in New-covenant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-principles;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43038:102"/>
and <hi>foolish</hi> ones, in but First-covenant Law-principles, cleans'd from filth of Flesh, only, will be found all <hi>slumbring and sleeping,</hi> Matth. 25. 1-12. Yet, will he own the Wise, but <hi>to the Foolish, he will say, I know you not</hi>; so, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 21-23. In the dark <hi>Midnight</hi>-Season to both, will he come, to the amazing Surprize of the Foolish, and unspeakable Joy of the Wise. All are requir'd <hi>to watch</hi> (the time of his Coming, being unknown to both and all) <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 1-13. 'Twill be a like amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing surprize to the far greater Number of Mankind, as <hi>the Flood</hi> to the Old World; <hi>or Fire from Heaven, on</hi> Sodom, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 26-30. The Day or time of his Coming, is kept secret, from the Knowledg of spiritual Saints, and the very <hi>Angels of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 24. 36. (yea, and from <hi>the Son</hi> himself, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 32.) Saints are requir'd, therefore, to <hi>watch</hi> continually, not knowing the time of his Coming, <hi>v.</hi> 42. <hi>A thousand Years with the Lord is as one Day; and one Day as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.8. 'Twas said, sixteen hundred Years ago, <hi>This is the last time,</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:43038:103"/>
(1 John 2.18.) and, <hi>yet a little while, and he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry</hi> beyond the appointed time, for his second Coming, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 37. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 3. A Day, an Hour, a little time, in God's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, may be a long time, in Man's. When the Disciples ask'd Christ (after his Resurrection, and ready to ascend into the Glory, he will come again, in) <hi>Wilt thou at this time, restore again the Kingdom to Israel?</hi> his Answer was, <hi>It is not for you</hi> (or any) <hi>to know the Times or Seasons, which the Father has put in his own Power,</hi> Act. 1. 6, 7. Satan can be willing, Man should be presumptuously fore-telling, with great Confidence, what is utterly unpossible for him, to know; that, while busy about an Impossibility, he may be so ignorant and regardless of the Gospel-spirit and Glory, he will come in, as may render his second Coming, most amazingly frightful to him, amongst and with Millions of others, who will be found in unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enmity to that Spirit, he will come, in. Yet, after all this, and God's with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Knowledg of the time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, 'tis Man's Duty to observe the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:43038:103"/>
Signs of Christ's Approach, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.3. And, such Signs are now remarkable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all former Days; <hi>the Harvest</hi> seems very near <hi>ripe for the Sickle</hi> of God's Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, <hi>the Press full, the Fats overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Wickedness</hi> of Mankind, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>great, Ioel</hi> 3. 13. This is a great Sign, that <hi>the Day of the Lord is near,</hi> v. 14. But, preparatory to the Lord's personal Appearance, <hi>will he send</hi> his Gospel-<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to gather his Elect together</hi> out of all Mankind, that Day, on Earth, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31.) and <hi>they will call up his Gospel-Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> from amongst Men, into an Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them, in the said Work, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 12. That Gospel-dispensation will be accompanied with a more abundant won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-working and Gospel-converting Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than was experienc'd in the primitive Apostolical Gospel-day. This preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Dispensation, by Gospel-Angels and Saints, may seem to be, as to the Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, forty five Years, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11, 12. This Dispensation, will be but <hi>the Sign of the Son of Man in Heaven,</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30.) not his very personal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing. In this Preparatory Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43038:104"/>
will evil Angels, as false Christs, with their false Apostles, amongst Men, in their transform'd Appearances of Christ and his true ones, be permitted to make their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Opposition to true Gospel-Angels and Saints. Satan, with his evil Angels, will not be excluded from such delusive Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by his false Apostles, till Christ comes forth in his own Person. Then, <hi>they'l be imprison'd in the bottomless Pit, and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to deceive</hi> Mankind <hi>any more, till Christ's thousand Years Reign be fulfilled,</hi> Revel. 20. 1, 3. <hi>After Christ's thousand Years Reign, Satan will be loos'd out of his Prison, and</hi> permitted <hi>with his</hi> Gog <hi>and</hi> Magog, his innumerable Multitude of evil Angels and Men (transform'd into the Guise of good Angels and Saints) <hi>to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass the Camp of Saints, God's</hi> New-<hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem-City,</hi> in the very Glory of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, as their last and most transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Presumption, on which, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be destroy'd, for ever, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 7-10.

Then, to all eternity, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

will Saints and Angels acknowledg and ascribe their eternal Blessedness, above all Conception and Wonder, to God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Free-Grace-Mercy and electing Love, as the single and only supream di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing Cause thereof, from those that perish, forever, under his everlasting Curse and unquenchable Wrath.</p>
            <p>The oft saying the same Things, and quoting the same Scriptures, on seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Occasions, is no other than is found in the very Scriptures, where the same things are oft said by the various Pen-men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and, by the same, also.</p>
