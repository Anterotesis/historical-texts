            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadneezer</hi>
was a wicked king, and
therefore God warned him by a
dreame, and by <hi>Daniel</hi> to amende
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:26277:3"/>

made many ſhewes, but reuolted
againe, therefore at the laſt GOD

his power to come
from God. A warning to all rulers
to remember that one ruler is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
which muſt bee ſerued of
them all, or elſe all their buildings

Daniel) <hi>this king walked in his royall
pallace.</hi> The Prophet ſhewes that
he had deſerued this puniſhment
before, and that his dreame which
he had did tell him how that his
kingdom ſhould depart from him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:26277:3"/>
for his pride: yet this reſpite was
granted him, <hi>for twelue moneths,</hi> like
the fortie daies which were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Niniuites:<note place="margin">Ionas. 3 4. 5</note> To try what
he would do vpon his warning, &amp;
whether hee would repent as the
Niniuites did, therefore the holy
Ghoſt ſheweth how the time ran,
and how hee liued after. As if hee
ſhould ſaie, if he wold returne yet,
and be warned by the dreams, &amp;
by the Prophet which I ſent him,
I will ſtaie my hand, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
ſhall not depart from him:
but here he ſhewes that hee forgot
his dreame like a dreame, and was
more deſirous to knowe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what it
meant, than to be warned by it the
twelue moneths ranne moneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
moneth. Now his dreames are
gone, he thinketh that all his end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet <hi>Nabuchadneezer</hi> is all one,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:26277:4"/>
therefore hee getteth him vp into
his pallace amidſt his delightes, to
beake himſelf as it were in the Sun
of all his pleaſures, where in deede
he haſtned God to take al his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
from him, when hee ſhoulde
haue repented, as <hi>Daniel</hi> willed
him, and ripped vp his ſinnes, and
bewailed his life, and poured forth
teares, and preuented his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with praier vppon his knees,
then was hee ſtalking in his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,
and thinking what ſinne
ſhould be next, to fill vp the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his rebellions, that GOD
might not ſpare him when hee
iudged.</p>
            <p>So the wicked will not ſuffer the
propheſies of God againſt them
to be vaine, but they will put God
in mind of their puniſhments and
ſinne, till the puniſhment come to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:26277:4"/>
fulfill the threatninges due vnto
them.</p>
            <p>Some thinke that <hi>Nabuchadnee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi>
walked vpon the roofe of his
pallace, from whence he might ſee
all parts of the Cittie round about
him.<note place="margin">Math. 4. 8.</note> Like the mountaine whither
the Tempter lead Chriſt, to ſhew
him the beautie of the world.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Daniel</hi> would ſignifie, that
the King liued in eaſe as hee liued
before, and pleaſed himſelfe in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
ſtill,<note place="margin">Math. 3. 10</note> for all his warning, and
turned his time of repentance to
ſinne. Therefore the Lorde would
defer no longer, but cut him down
like the barren figge tree, to teach
vs to take mercy while it is offered,
to repent while we haue time, and
if God ſpeake but once to vs, to lay
it vp in our harts for euer: not look
to bee ſpoken to againe, becauſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:26277:5"/>
God is not bound to warne vs at
all. One would haue thought that
<hi>Nabuchadneezer</hi> would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
his warning while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
which had ſuch a ſtraunge
and fearefull dreame, and after an
other dreame to confirme it, and
after ſuch a Prophet to expound
it, and the expoſition of it threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſuch a downe-fall vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
One would haue thought he
could not haue forgotten it thogh
he had liued vntil this day. But like
a wonder, which laſteth but nine
daies: ſo is the repentance of them
that are accuſtomed to ſin. When
ſinne is rooted, it ſtickes harde, and
who ſhall weed it? Though God
ſhould ſend vs dreams, though he
ſhould ſhew vs viſions, though he
ſhould raiſe vp Prophets, <hi>Daniell</hi>
himſelfe cannot make this blacke
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:26277:5"/>
Moore white, which hath beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
blacke. We may ſee this in our
ſelues, for what neede we to heare
ſo often of repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, more than of
anything els: but it is ſuch a thing
that we can not frame ourſelues to.
If we bee warned of any thing but
of ſinne, one warning will ſerue:
but we are ſo incorporate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured
with ſinne, that a thouſand
Sermons wil not ſerue: ſo cuſtome
hath made ſinne ſtronger in manie
than the worde of God. Well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
or conſider, or applie it
how he will, after twelue moneths
God will come, and take account
of his dreames, and of his Prophet
which hee ſent to ſee what <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadneezer</hi>
hath profited by them.
Although lied haue leaden feete,
which are long a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> comming, yet
he hath iron handes, which, when
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:26277:6"/>
he commeth will ſtrike home.</p>
            <p>Now God comes and findes
<hi>Nabuchadneezer</hi> vpon his Towers,
when he ſhould haue caſt himſelf
downe to the ground, &amp; thought
vpon his dreames, and <hi>Daniel,</hi> to
humble his pride. Hee was pearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vpon his roofe, and there he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to crowe of his wealth: <hi>Is not
this great</hi> Babel, <hi>that I haue built for
the houſe of my kingdome by the might
of my power, and for the honour of my
maieſty?</hi> See how the man ſtandeth
in admiration of his vanity, like an
vſurer which doteth of his money
as though hee had deſerued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
fame for ſpending his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
vainely, to lay one ſtone vpon
another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hee
ſhould haue ſaide: Is not this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadneezers</hi>
follie, which he hath
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:26277:6"/>
built for a mocke to his name, and
an impeachment to his wiſdome,
for men to ſay when they paſſe by,
looke how our King hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his reuenewes, here lie our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies,
&amp; our tributes in theſe ſtone
walles? But <hi>Nabuchadneezer</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that euerie man will prayſe
him for his follie. Therefore as a
woman when ſhee is prickt vp in
her brauery, thinketh that all doe
admire her, and hath as goodlie
opinion of hir ſelfe, as the Pecocke
hath of his feathers, and frameth al
her trickes, and ſpeeches, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
accordingly: So when <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadneezer</hi>
ſate in his pallace, and
ſaw ſuch ſheeres about him, now,
ſaith pride, thou muſt frame thy
lookes, and geſtures, and ſpeeches
accordingly, or elſe the Kings pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
will bee brauer than the King
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:26277:7"/>
himſelf. So hee beginneth to exalt
his minde higher than his pallace,
and to looke &amp; ſpeake ſtouter then
he did before: the temptation was
no ſooner in his heart, but it was
in his mouth, and he pleaſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
therein ſo well, that he could
not refraine, beeing alone, but as a
foole, admires himſelfe in a glaſſe:
ſo he, when hee was alone, and no
bodie with him, yet he ſtrouted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and bragged by himſelfe, to
thinke what a iolly fellow he was.
Nowe men begin to talke of his
buildings. By this we may ſee how
wealth and honors chaunge man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and howe a gay coate, or a
wrought handkercher, or a golde
ring can braue a mans minde, and
make him looke and ſpeake after
another faſhion than he did. It is a
wonder to ſee what power theſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:26277:7"/>
pettie vaine toyes haue ouer the
minde, to alter and change a man
ſodainely, when hee thinkes better
of himſelfe that day hee weares
them, than any day elſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Before
the holy Ghoſt layeth <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neezers</hi>
words, marke how he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vnto them. <hi>The King ſpake &amp;
ſaid:</hi> was not one enough, but hee
muſt ſay, <hi>ſpake &amp; ſaide?</hi> This doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the words ſheweth, that he
ſpake with a premeditated pride
from his heart root, which ſhould
out whether it were ſinne or no,
come what will come. For the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Ghoſt doth bring in other ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
with <hi>He ſaid,</hi> and no more: but
heere hee ſaith, <hi>He ſpake &amp; ſaide,</hi> as
though hee ſpake twiſe, not as hee
ſpake at other times, but like a man
at defiance, which could not recall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:26277:8"/>
anie worde that he ſaide, but if hee
could ſay more, he would ſay it to
anger him. Did I cal it great Babel?
I may call it great Babel. Did I ſaie
that I built it? I will ſay that I built
it. Did I adde for the honor of my
maieſtie? Let it goe for the honor
of my maieſtie. Thus he ſpake and
ſaid, as though he would bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in his pride, although he were
conſtant in nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>Is not this great <hi>Babel,</hi> which I
haue built for the houſe of the kingdome
by the might of my power, for the honor
of my maiestie?</p>
            <p>Three thinges I note in this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what a glorious opinion
<hi>Nabuchadneezer</hi> had of his vaine
buildings, out of theſe wordes, <hi>Is
not this great</hi> Babel?</p>
            <p>The ſecond, that hee tearmeth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:26277:8"/>
himſelfe the founder of it, as if hee
had done all without an helpe, in
theſe wordes, <hi>which I haue built by
the might of my power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is, that in al his worke
he ſought nothing but vaine glorie
out of theſe words, <hi>for the honour of
my maiestie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe three ſinnes <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer</hi>
doth bewray in one bragge:
and in all theſe three wee are ſo like
him, that the beaſtes were not ſo
like him, when hee became like a
beaſt. Firſt wee haue not ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
an opinion of God, or of
his word, or of heauen, as we haue
of our owne actes, although wee
neuer be able to doe halfe that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer</hi>
did then, yet this is
our manner, to attribute all to our
ſelues, whatſoeuer it bee, riches, or
honors, or helth, or knowledg, as if
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:26277:9"/>
all came by labour, or pollicie, or
art, or nature: if we cannot drawe
it to one of theſe, then we thinke it
fortune, though wee vnderſtand
not what fortune is: for if wee did
count our ſelues beholding vnto
God for them, wee would finde
ſome time to bee thankfull to him.
Laſtly, when we ouer-viewe theſe
matters, this is our ſolace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
to thinke with ourſelues, theſe
are the things that make vs famous
and ſpoken of, and pointed at, and
there wee ende, as though it were
enough to be pointed at. <hi>Is not this
great</hi> Babel?</p>
            <p>That which one loueth ſeemeth
great and pretious aboue all which
hee loueth not, although they are
better then it: ſo do theſe buildings
ſeeme vnto <hi>Nabuchadnezzer.</hi> One
would thinke, that a houſe, though
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:26277:9"/>
it were a faire houſe, were not a
matter for a King to be proud of:
ſtone walles are not ſo pretious,
that hee ſhould repoſe all his honor
vpon lime &amp; morter. But this is a
iuſt thing with God, that vaine
men ſhould haue vaine proſperity,
and vaine comfort, and vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that they may deceiue them
when they truſt to it. Therefore as
the faithfull ſoule looketh vpon the
word, or vp to heauen, and ſaith to
it ſelfe, is not this my ioy, is not this
mine inheritance: ſo the carnall
man, when hee looketh vppon his
buildings, or his money, saith vnto
himſelfe, is not this my ioy, is not
this my life: and while hee pores
and gapes to long vpon it, by little
and little the loue of it growes
more and more in his heart, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
at laſt he mindeth nothing elſe.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:26277:10"/>
This was the firſt dotage of <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond was, <hi>which I haue
built by the might of my power.</hi> What
a vant was this to ſay, that he built
<hi>Babel,</hi> when al hiſtories record, that
it was built by <hi>Semiramis</hi> before
<hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> was. Wherefore
doth hee boaſt of that which an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did? The anſwer is eaſie: why
doe other ſo now? Wee ſee that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man doth labour to obſcure
the fame of others, that they may
ſhine alone, and beare the names,
eſpecially in buildings. If they doe
but adde or alter any thing in their
ſchooles or hoſpitals, or colledges,
they looke ſtraight to bee counted
the founders of them.</p>
            <p>And thus the firſt founders of
many auncient places are forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
ſo it is like that <hi>Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:26277:10"/>
did adde or alter ſome thing in
this Cittie, and therefore he tooke
all to himſelfe. But if <hi>Semiramis,</hi> or
any other had not built it but <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer</hi>
had beene the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of (as he would ſeeme) yet this
had beene a proude and arrogant
ſpeech to ſay, <hi>which I haue built:</hi> for
it was not hee that could build Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
no more than <hi>Nemrod</hi> could
finiſh Babel:<note place="margin">Pſal. 127. 1.</note> but vnleſſe the Lord
build the houſe, the builders build
in vaine.</p>
            <p>Therefore when hee ſayth, <hi>By
the might of my power,</hi> hee ſhould
haue ſaide, by the might of Gods
power.</p>
            <p>But by this you may plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
diſcerne how harde and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
a thing it is for him to hitte
vppon a right worde, or a good
woorke which hath not a good
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:26277:11"/>
thought to bring it foorth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
make the roote ſweete,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 33</note> or the
fruit will be ſower, counterfaite as
cunningly as he can.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, where he putteth in <hi>for
the honour of my maiestie:</hi> hee ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that he was of <hi>Abſolons</hi> honor,
though hee had deſerued ſhame,
yet he would haue fame: becauſe
hee had no children to keepe his
name in remembraunce,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 18. 18.</note> therefore
he erected a piller, which he called
<hi>Abſolons</hi> place: ſo ſtately houſes in
England, beare the names of the
Lords that owe them, for the ſame
vanitie.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Abſolon</hi> thought to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.</note>
as <hi>Nabuchadneezer</hi> thought to
dwel in his pallace, but he was caſt
into a pitte, as <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> was
turned into the wildernes:<note place="margin">Eſay. 22. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18</note> ſo <hi>Sheb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
made his ſepulcher in one cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26277:11"/>
&amp; was buried in another. For
why ſhould pride haue the reward
of humilitie. Honour (ſaith Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)
goeth before humilitie,<note place="margin">Prou. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12</note> that
is, honour is the reward of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
and yet <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> would
bee honoured for his pride. What
hath he done, or <hi>Sheba,</hi> or <hi>Abſolon,</hi>
that they ſhould erect ſuch monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
to bee praiſed after death,
which were not worthy to bee
praiſed in their life? Before the
building of Babel, hee had done
nothing worth the ſpeaking, for
becauſe he liued alway like a beaſt,
therefore God puniſhed him like
a beaſt.</p>
            <p>And doth he deſerue nowe to
bee ſpoken of in all ages, for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
ſtones together? Hereby we
may ſee a ſmall matter maketh
great men proud, and they would
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:26277:12"/>
be prayſed for euery thing they
doe.</p>
            <p>But looke how God ouerthwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them: for in that wherein
they looke to make their greateſt
glorie, they ſhame themſelues the
moſt of all: and that which they
practiſe to exalt them, doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
and ouerthrowe them, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them hatred of ſuch, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
would not meddle with
them: ſinne ſo deceiueth them,
like the blinde Ammorites, that
they take a cleane contrarie waye
vnto their deſires, as wee mae ſee
in the ſecond chapter of the book
of Geneſis, they which built Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
ſaide,<note place="margin">Gen. 11. 4.</note> that they would builde
it to get vnto themſelues a name:
but they get to themſelues ſhame:
for they could not finiſh it, when
they had begun it, but were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:26277:12"/>
in ſuch a wonderful ſort,
to their ſeeming, that they knewe
not what they did: ſo ſodainely
likewiſe they vnderſtoode not a
worde that one another ſpake. So
when <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> came vnto
himſelfe againe, hee ſheweth, that
when hee ſought his owne honor
and glory, honour and glory both
departed from him, and hee was
made like a beaſt: but when hee
ſought the honour and glorie of
GOD, his honour came againe,
and he was made a king.</p>
            <p>This would pull away manie
toies from womens backes, if they
did well weigh and conſider with
themſelues, how God makes them
ridiculous by that, which they do
weare to make themſelues amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
If they did thinke that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſluitie
of apparel, which they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:26277:13"/>
clogge on to pleaſe the world, by
the ſecrete iudgement of GOD,
did not pleaſe but diſpleaſe, they
would bee as much aſhamed of
their attire, as <hi>Eue</hi> was of her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.
Would they weare ſuch
gardes like a Pedlers ſhoppe vpon
their backes, but to pleaſe. See
nowe howe GOD doth mocke
them: for they are not liked, but
diſliked, and worſe thought of for
it, then they that goe in Ruſſet,
and ſeeke no prayſe at all. They
thinke, am I not braue: others
thinke, is ſhe not proude: they
thinke, am I not ſweete: others
thinke, is ſhe not light: yet they
dreame that euerie one prayſeth
them: as <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> thought
that euerie one would honor him
for his pallace.</p>
            <p>If their gorgeous buildings and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:26277:13"/>
brauerie condemne them before
men, how will it condemne them
before God? Therefore when <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>
ſayth, <hi>for the honor of
his maieſtie,</hi> he ſhould haue ſaid for
the honour of Gods maieſtie, and
then this had beene recorded for
his honour indeede, and his houſe
had bene the houſe of God, for as
we ſhould ſpeake, and ſtudie, and
labour to Gods glory, ſo we ſhuld
build alſo to Gods glorie, that our
houſes may be like Temples, as <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badias</hi>
was: but few ſeeke glorie
that waie, they had rather pull
downe then build in ſuch ſorte.
Thus you haue heard what <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer</hi>
ſpake, as though GOD
would deſtroie the thoughts and
pride of ſuch builders. Theſe are
the thoughts and meditations of
princes and nobles, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:26277:14"/>
their buildinges, and open
their coffers, and looke vppon
their traine ſwinging after them,
they thinke as <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi>
thought, <hi>Is not this greate Babel?</hi>
Is not this greate glorie? Are not
theſe the treaſures that ſhall make
my children riche? Is not this
the traine that maketh me reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
in the ſtreetes? Is not
this the houſe that ſhall keepe
my name, and cauſe mee to bee
remembred, and make them
that are children now to ſpeake of
me heereafter, when they ſhall
goe by and looke vpp, and ſee
theſe antikes and knackes ouer
their heades, they will ſaie, Oh
hee that builte this was a greate
man, hee did beare a greate
ſwaie in Court and Countrie,
who but hee while hee liued: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:26277:14"/>
though this King bee dead and
buried, yet his pride eſcaped and
came to vs. <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> hath
children yet aliue, which builde
as highe as hee, goe as braue as
hee, ſpende as vainely as hee,
and are as proude and inſolent as
hee, although they be not Kings
nor Dukes, nor Knightes, nor yet
good Squires. Looke vpon their
pallaces, and then conſider with
thy ſelfe, and thinke whether they
bee of <hi>Nabuchadnezzers</hi> broode,
<hi>Is not this greate Babel?</hi> and is not
Nabuchadnezzer Lorde of it?
Oh if they might liue to walke
in their galleries ſtill, they would
neuer deſyre anye other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
            <p>But Nabuchadnezzer hath
ſhewed the waie before them,
and they muſt all daunce after
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:26277:15"/>
him, though they were as mighty,
though they were mightier then
he, death wil not take his kingdom
for a ranſome. Now what is <hi>Babel</hi>
and what is <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> the
king therof. Now <hi>Babel</hi> is deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the king which built it is
laid in duſt: had it not bene better
to haue built an houſe in heauen,
which might haue receiued him
when he was dead. The name of
theſe pallaces may well bee <hi>Babel,</hi>
that is, confuſion, becauſe they
propheſie confuſion to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
build, them: for their foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is
pride, their wals extortion, theyr
roofe ambition, and all the ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fings
within them is vſurie, bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
cruelty. Now if this be the beſt
which <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> hath to
vant of, what is the worſt which
he may bee aſhamed of? When I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:26277:15"/>
ſee how earneſt hee was about
his dreame, and how looſe he ſate
after in his pallace. Me thinks I ſee
the image of the worlde in one
man: how liuely doth <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer</hi>
reſemble the dreamers of
our time? ſuch inquirie, ſuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to know Gods will, that a
man woulde haue ſworne, if the
king met with a prophet from
heauen that can tell him the truth
&amp; inſtruct him from God, that his
dreame warned him to amend his
life, he will reclaime himſelfe, and
reforme his realme, and become
ſuch a king as was neuer in this
land before. But behold no ſooner
reſolued of his dreame, but he was
readie to bee warned againe, and
was not ſo attentiue to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
as he was to his dream, thogh
hee cared for neither, for when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:26277:16"/>
hee vnderſtoode that his dreame
went about to change the courſe
of his life,<note place="margin">2. Kin 5. 11.</note> he went awaie like Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in a chafe, and cared no more
for his dreame after. Before the
dreame came, all would haue ſayd
that ſuch a dreame woulde haue
humbled his heart for euer. Before
the Prophet came, all would haue
ſaid, that ſuch a Prophet woulde
haue conuerted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a word,
but Nabuchadnezzer is Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer,
&amp; if anie other dream
come more fearefull then this, yet
Nabuchadnezzer will bee Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer,
and loue his pallace
better than paradice: ſo we thinke
if God would ſend a famine vpon
this land, that would make vs feare
him, but God hath ſenta famine &amp;
yet we doe not feare him. If God
would ſend an Earthquake vppon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:26277:16"/>
this land that would make vs feare
him: but God hath ſent an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
vpon this lande, and yet we
doe not feare him: If God would
ſende a peſtilence vpon this lande,
that would make vs feare him: but
God hath ſent a peſtilence, and yet
we do not feare him. If God would
ſend warre vppon this lande, that
would make vs feare him: but God
hath ſent warre, and yet we do not
feare him: therfore what wil make
vs feare him? There be manie that
dreame vppon Religion, as <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer</hi>
dreamed vppon his
dreame. But hee deſired onely to
know what it meant: ſo doe they
deſire only to know.<note place="margin">Mar. 10. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Maister what
ſhall I doe to come to heauen,</hi> ſaith the
yong man to Chriſt: hee would
faine know the way to heauen, but
when Chriſt ſhewed him the way
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:26277:17"/>
he would not take it: ſo they that
goe from preacher to preacher, as
<hi>Nabuchadnezer</hi> ſent from one wiſe
man to another, to bee reſolued in
pointes of Religion, haue ſuch a
ſcruting, ſuch attention, ſuch heat,
as though they would runne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the teachers, that a man
would thinke they would doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
thing, as the Iewes ſeemed to
Moſes,<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 27.</note> and the young man vnto
Chriſt:<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 19 &amp; 19. 3.</note> but when they haue heard
what they can, they doe like <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer,</hi>
as they did before.
Now they ſay it was but a dreame,
becauſe the meaning doth not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
to his will:<note place="margin">1. King. 2. 2</note> So Achab inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the prophet, to ſee what hee
would ſay, but it appeareth that he
neuer meant to followe him, vnles
he would aunſwere as hee would
haue him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:26277:17"/>
When it commeth to the acte,
which is euerie mans triall: then
ye ſhall ſee, who are like <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer,</hi>
which affect only to know:
and who are like <hi>Zacheus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.</note> that is,
which practiſe as they know. For
as the truth is reuealed, ſo it muſt
be witneſſed, or elſe the fall of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer</hi>
ſheweth what will
fall vppon it: becauſe hee would
not do as the dreame warned him,
and as the Prophet counſelled
him, therfore GOD forſooke him,
and his kingdome departed from
him, and hee was thruſt out of
his pallace, and turned like an oxe
into the wilderneſſe, where hee
liued in all pointes like a beaſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the time of ſeuen yeares were
ended.</p>
            <p>A warning vnto all to take
heede of the worlde: for it is the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:26277:18"/>
gentle warner, the next is rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the third and the fourth harder
then it: like the nine plagues of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
which did exceed one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Who can weigh the wrath of
God,<note place="margin">Exod. 8.</note> or the greeuouſnes of ſinne?
Some would think that <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer</hi>
might haue ſpoken all this,
without ſuch offence: for hee did
but ſay that it was a faire houſe, &amp;
that hee builded and erected it for
his honour. Many vnder Princes
delight in worſe vanities then buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and ſpeake vainer oftner in a
weeke. Therefore when you ſee
how it diſpleaſeth God to vant of
theſe earthly thinges, or to impute
any thing vnto our ſelues, thinke
what ſhal be the doome of greater
ſinnes. If <hi>Nabuchadnezzer</hi> became
like a beaſt, and lodged in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
for his pride, they which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:26277:18"/>
beare pride, and couetouſnes, and
luſt, and wrath, and mallice, and all
the legion of ſins in one breſt, ſhall
lodge in hell, and become like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,
becauſe they are like beaſts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie.
Therfore let this be in ſtead
of Daniels warning. If God did
take ſuch account of <hi>Nabuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi>
for his dream, what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
by it, what account will hee
take of vs, what profite wee haue
made of Nabuchadnezzers fall &amp;
puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Thus haue you heard what the
voice ſpake from earth: now you
ſhould heare what the voice ſpake
from heauen, but the time will
not permit, therefore
heere I ende.</p>
