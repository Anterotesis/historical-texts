            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE <hi>Makers and Wholeſale Traders in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of</hi> Engliſh Bone-Lace.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y an Act of Parliament held in the Eighth and Ninth Years of King <hi>William</hi> III. Ch. 24. which has been ſince continued by ſeveral ſubſequent Acts; it was Enacted, That there ſhould be paid to his ſaid Majeſty, his Heirs and Succeſſors, by every Hawker, Pedlar, Petty-Chapman, and every other Trading Perſon going from Town to Town, or to other Mens Houſes, and travelling either on Foot, or with Horſe, Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as therein is excepted) carrying to Sell, or expoſing to Sale, any Goods, Wares, or Merchandiſes, the Yearly Sum of 4 <hi>l.</hi> And upon Payment, or giving Security for the Duty in ſuch manner as is thereby directed, a Licenſe was to be granted to him or her, ſo to Travel or Trade.</p>
            <p>And if any ſuch Hawker, Pedlar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be found Trading as aforeſaid, without ſuch Licenſe; ſuch Perſon ſhould for every Offence forfeit 12 <hi>l.</hi> one Moiety to th e Informer, the other to the Poor of the Pariſh: Which Penalty was by Warrant from a Juſtice of the Peace, to be levied by Diſtreſs and Sale of the Offender's Goods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Provided,</hi> That the ſaid Act ſhould not extend to hinder the real Workers or Makers of Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from carrying abroad, or expoſing to Sale, any Goods of his or her making, in any Mart, Fair, Market, or elſewhere.</p>
            <p>The Makers and Wholeſale Traders in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bone-Lace, moſt of them living in the Counties of <hi>Bucks, Bedford,</hi> and other adjacent Counties, uſually come to <hi>London</hi> once a Week to the Lace-Chambers, where they have fixed certain Shops and Standings. And ſometimes it ſo happens, that they carry ſome Goods to the Houſes or Shops of Milliners, and other Retailers, who are their Cuſtomers: For which ſome of the ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and Wholeſale Traders, have been informed againſt, and forced to pay the Penalty of 12 <hi>l.</hi> altho' it is apprehended, that they are not Hawkers, Pedlars, or Petty-Chapmen, within the Meaning of the ſaid Act, for the Reaſons following:</p>
            <p n="1">I. That by the ſaid Act, ſuch only were intended, who had no fixed Shops, or Standings, where they carried on their Trades; but carried them on chiefly (if not altogether) by travelling from Place to Place. But the ſame was not intended to extend to thoſe that chiefly or conſtantly kept and traded in certain Shops or Standings, and only caſually car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out ſome Goods to the Houſes or Shops of their Cuſtomers.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That thoſe who Sell by Wholeſale to the Retailers, were never intended by the ſaid Act to be obliged to take Licenſes, but only ſuch as go from Place to Place to Sell their Goods by Retail: And only ſuch can be intended or deſcribed by the Names of Pedlars, or Petty-Chapmen.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That they being Makers, as well as Wholeſale Sellers of their Manufacture, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted by the above-mentioned Clauſe in the ſaid Bill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N.B.</hi> That ſoon after the making the ſaid Act, <hi>viz. March</hi> 13. 1698. upon the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of <hi>Edward Hooton</hi> preferred to the Houſe of Commons, complaining of the Hardſhips put upon them, as aforeſaid. The Conſideration of the ſaid Petition was referred to a Committee: Which Committee made their Report. And thereupon it was reſolved, That the Workers of Bone-Lace, his, her, or their Children, Apprentices, Servants, or Agents; and all Wholeſale Dealers in the ſaid Manufacture, tho' they go about from Shop to Shop to any of their Cuſtomers who ſell the ſame by Retail again, ſhall not be deem'd Hawkers and Pedlars, by the ſaid Act of the Ninth and Tenth of his Majeſty's Reign.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Makers and Wholeſale Traders having lately been diſturbed and proſecuted upon the Pretences aforeſaid, a Bill is now depending for their Relief.</p>
