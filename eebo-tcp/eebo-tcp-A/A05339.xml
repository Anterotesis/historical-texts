            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>my Author (knowing that there are ſomeworks ſo naturally great of themſelues, that they challenge the gratious protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Princes) hath offered this his Hiſtorie to the Royall patronage of the most Christian King, two Queenes, and the Dauphin, to the end it might ſtirre them the more to proſecute the popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the lands heerein deſcribed, to bring the Naturals thereof (Sauage and miſerable people) to ciuilitie and right knowledge of God, and ſo to the ſaluation of their ſoules. Aſſuming the like preſumption, I haue hoped (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the defects which neceſſarily attend a ſtranger, who can neuer attaine the naturall <hi>Idiome</hi> of this eloquent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) that it might not be an iniury to your Highneſſe; but an addition of Honor, and ſafetie of tbis worke, if I ſhould dare to inſcribe your Princely name on the forehead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Which bouldneſſe, the noble vndertaking of the Engliſh Nation hath nouriſhed, who haue ſo lately begun (by the permiſsion, and vnder the protection of his excellent Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, your moſt Royall Father) to plant Chriſtianitie in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, being one continent, &amp; next adioining land to theſe.

For who may better ſupport, and manage magnanimous actions, ſuch as be the peopling of lands, planting of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, erecting of ciuill Gouernementes, and propagating of the Goſpell of Chriſt, (which are Royall and Princely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations) then thoſe whom the King of Kings, hath establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as <hi>Atlaſſes</hi> of kingdoms &amp; Chriſtian common weales? God hath neceſsitated in his Prophecie, Kings and Queenes to be nurſing Fathers and nurſing Mothers of his Church: ſo that he hath not onely committed the gouernment of a ripe and ſtrong body, able to ſubſist, but hath impoſed the care of the tenderneſſe and infancie thereof vpon them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander being yet young, would haue runne in the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian games if kings had runne there; now Kings doe run; now Princes doe worke in the Lords harueſt, to ſpread that name which must gather the elect from the vtmost endes of the world, if not in their perſons, yet with their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and meanes. I know your Highneſſe would not be inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but rather excell in ſo noble an action: ſuch an emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is pleaſing to God; your birth leadeth vnto it; Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charitie inuiteth you to be chiefe worker in the ſauing of millions of ſoules: The neceſsitie of your Countrie of Great <hi>BRITAINE,</hi> (ouer populous) doth require it: And laſtly your poore Virginians doe ſeeme to implore your Princely aide, to helpe them to ſhake off the yoke of the diuel, who hath hitherto made them liue worſe then beaſts, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth they may be brought into the fould of Christ, and (in time) to liue vnder your Chriſtian gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: So then hauing thus runne, you ſhall obtaine an euerlaſting Crowne of glory, being as well planter, as defender of the Faith.</p>

            <p>The whole volume of the Nauigations of the French nation into the Weſt Indies (compriſed in three bookes) was brought to mee, to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, by M. Richard Hackluyt, a man, who for his worthy, and profitable labours, is well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to moſt men of worth, not onely of this kingdome, but alſo of forrain parts: and by him this part was ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and choſen from the whole worke, for the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vſe of this Nation, to the end, that comparing the goodneſſe of the lands of the Northerly parts heerein mentioned with that of <hi>Virginia,</hi> which (though in one, and the ſelfe ſame continent and both lands adioyning) muſt be far better, by reaſon it ſtands more Southerly, neerer to the Sunne, greater encouragement may be giuen to proſecute that generous and godly action, in planting and peopling that Country, to the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Goſpel of Chriſt, the ſaluation of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſoules, and generall benefit of this land, too much peſtred with ouer many people. Which tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as I haue ſaid) is but a part of a greater volume. If therefore you finde that ſome references of things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the former part of the ſaid volume are not to be found in this tranſlation, do not thinke it ſtrange, in aſmuch as they could not wel be brought in, except the whole volume ſhould be tranſlated, which of purpoſe was left vndone, as well to auoid your farther charges, as becauſe it was thought needleſſe to tranſlate more then concerneth that which adioyneth to <hi>Virginia.</hi>

What good the Engliſh Nation may reape of this worke, by the onely deſcription that is found therein of Nations, Ilands, Harbours, Bayes, Coaſts, Riuers, Rockes, Shoulds, Sands, Bankes, and other dangers, which the Saylers into thoſe parts may now the more eaſily finde, and auoid, by the knowledge that this tranſlation giueth them of it, let the Nauigators iudge therof, who (for want of ſuch knowledge) haue found themſelues in euident perill of death, and many alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether caſt away. If a man that ſheweth foorth effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually the zealous care he <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hath to the well-fare, and common good of his country, deſerueth praiſes of the ſame, I refer to the iudgement of them that abhor the vice of ingratitude (hatefull aboue all to God, &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) whether the ſaid M. Hackluyt (as well for the firſt procuring of this tranſlation, as for many workes of his, ſet out by him for the good, and euerlaſting fame of the Engliſh Nation) deſerueth not to reape thankes. As for this my labour, if it be cenſured fauorably, and my good affection (in vndertaking the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this worke, for the benefit of this land) taken in good part, it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me to endeauour my ſelfe to doe better heereafter.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The voyage of Monſieur <hi>De Monts</hi> into New France: what accidents hapned in the ſaid voyage: The cauſes of the Icie banks in New found land: The impoſing of names to certaine Ports: The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie wherein they were by reaſon of the ſtay of the other ſhip.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MOnſieur <hi>De Monts</hi> hauing made the Commiſſions and Prohibitions before ſaid, to be proclaimed thorow the Realme of France, and eſpecially thorow the Ports and maritime townes thereof, cauſed two ſhips to be rigged and furniſhed, the one vnder the conduct of captaine <hi>Timothy</hi> of New-hauen, the other of captaine <hi>Morell</hi> of Honfleur. In the firſt, he ſhipped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, with good number of men of account, as well Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen as others. And foraſmuch as Monſieur <hi>De Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trincourt</hi> was, and had beene of a long time, deſirous to ſee thoſe countries of New France, and there to finde out and chuſe ſome fit place to retire himſelfe into, with his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, wife and children, not meaning to be the laſt that ſhould follow and participate in the glory of ſo faire and generous an enterpriſe, would needs goe thither, and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped himſelfe with the ſaid Monſieur <hi>De Monts,</hi> carrying with him ſome quantitie of armours and munitions of <note place="margin">The ſetting foorth out of New-hauen.</note>warre; and ſo weighed anckers from New-hauen the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day of March, 1604. But being departed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too ſoone, before the Winter had yet left off her fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen weed, they found ſtore of Icie banks, againſt the which they were in danger to ſtrike, and ſo to be caſt away: But <note place="margin">Danger.</note>God, which hitherto hath proſpered the nauigation of theſe voiages, preſerued them.</p>
               <p>One might wonder, and not without cauſe, why, in the ſame parallel, there is more Ice in this ſea than in that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9921:14"/>
of France. Whereunto I anſwer, that the Ices that be found in thoſe ſeas are not originary fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame climate, but rather come from the Northerly parts, driuen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any let thorow the vaſt of this great ſea by the waues, ſtormes, and boiſterous flouds, which the Eaſterly and Northerly windes doe cauſe in Winter and Spring time, and driue them towards the South and Weſt: But the French ſeas are ſheltered by Scotland, England and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: which is the cauſe that the Ices cannot fall into it. An other reaſon alſo might be alleaged, and that is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſea, which beareth more towards thoſe parts, becauſe of the larger courſe that it maketh towards Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica <note place="margin">A perillous ſtorme.</note>than towards the lands of theſe our parts. The perill of this voyage was, not onely in the meeting of the ſaid bankes of Ice, but alſo in the ſtormes that vexed them: One of them they had that brake the galleries of the ſhip: And in theſe turmoiles, a Ioyner was caried away by a ſea or flaſh of water to the next doore of death, ouerboord, but he held himſelfe faſt at a tackling, which by chance hung out of the ſaid ſhippe.</p>
               <p>The voyage was long by reaſon of contrarie windes, <note place="margin">Winde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly good in March for the New found lands. The Ile of Sablon or Sand.</note>which ſeldome hapneth to them that ſet out in March for the New found lands, which are ordinarilie caried with an Eaſt or Northren winde, fit to goe to thoſe lands. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken their courſe to the South of the Ile of Sand or <hi>Sablon,</hi> or Sand, for to ſhunne the ſaid Ices, they almoſt fell from <hi>Caribdis</hi> into <hi>Scylla,</hi> going to ſtrike towards the ſaid Ile, during the thicke miſts that are frequent in that ſea.</p>
               <p>In the end, the ſixt of May they came to a certain Port, where they found captaine <hi>Roſſignol</hi> of New-hauen, who did trucke for skins with the Sauages, contrarie to the Kings inhibitions, which was the cauſe that his ſhip was <note place="margin">Port du Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignol.</note>confiſcated. This Port was called <hi>Le Port du Roſſignol,</hi> hauing (in this his hard fortune) this onely good, that a good and fit Harborough or Port, in thoſe coaſts beareth his name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:9921:14"/>
From thence coaſting and diſcouering the lands, they arriued at another Porte, very faire, which they named <hi>Le Port du Moutton,</hi> by reaſon that a Mutton or Wether <note place="margin">Le Port da Moutton.</note>hauing leaped ouerboord and drowned himſelfe came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord againe, and was taken and eaten as good prize. By ſuch accidents many names haue anciently beene giuen on the ſudden, and without any great deliberation. So the <note place="margin">Capitol.</note>Capitol of Rome had his name, becauſe that in digging there, a dead mans head was found. So the citie of Milan <note place="margin">Milan.</note>hath beene called <hi>Mediolanum,</hi> that is to ſay, halfe wooll, for that the <hi>Gaules,</hi> caſting the foundation thereof, found a Sowe halfe couered with wooll: and ſo of ſundry others.</p>
               <p>Being at the Port <hi>du Moutton,</hi> they cabaned and lodged themſelues after the ſauage faſhion, expecting newes of the other ſhip, wherein was the victuals and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie prouiſion for the foode and entertainment of them <note place="margin">About 100. Planters.</note>that were to Winter there, being about an hundred men in number. In this Port they tarried a moneth in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie, for feare they had that ſome ſiniſter accident had hapned to the ſaid other ſhippe, who ſet out the tenth of March, wherein was <hi>Monſieur Du Pont</hi> of <hi>Honfleur,</hi> and the ſaid Captaine <hi>Morel.</hi> And this was ſo much the more important, for that of the comming of the ſaid ſhip depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Deliberation vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into France.</note>the whole ſucceſſe of the buſineſſe. For euen vpon this long tarying, it was in queſtion whether they ſhould returne into France or no. <hi>Monſieur De Pourtrincourt</hi> was of aduice that it were better to die there; whereto the ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Monts</hi> conformed himſelfe. In the meane while many went a hunting, others to fiſhing, for to ſtore the kitchin. Neere the ſaid <hi>Moutton</hi> Porte there is a place <note place="margin">Store of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note>ſo repleniſhed with Rabbets and Conies, that they almoſt did eat nothing elſe. During that time <hi>Monſieur Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plein</hi> was ſent with a ſhalloup to ſeeke farther off a fitter place to retire themſelues, at which exploit he tarried ſo long, that deliberating vpon the returne, they thought to leaue him behind: for there was no more victuals: and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9921:15"/>
they ſerued themſelues with that, that was found in the ſaid <hi>Roſſignols</hi> ſhippe, without which they had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to returne into France, and ſo to breake a faire enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize at the very birth and beginning thereof; or to ſtarue, hauing ended the hunting of Conies, which could not ſtill continue. Now the cauſes of the ſtaie of the ſaid <hi>Monſieur Du Pont,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Morel,</hi> were two; the one, that wanting a Cocke-boate, they imploied their time in the building of one, in the land where they arriued firſt, which <note place="margin">The Engliſh Porte. <hi>Campſeau Port.</hi>
                  </note>was the Engliſh Port: The other, that being come at <hi>Campſeau Port,</hi> they found there foure ſhips of <hi>Baskes,</hi> or men of Saint <hi>Iohn de Luz,</hi> that did trucke with the Saua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, contrarie to the ſaid Inhibitions, from whom they tooke their goods, and brought the Maſters to the ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Monts,</hi> who vſed them very gently.</p>
               <p>Three weekes being expired, and the ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Monts</hi> hauing no newes of the ſhippe he looked for, he deliberated to ſend along the coaſt to ſeeke for them, and <note place="margin">Note heere the good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Sauages.</note>for that purpoſe diſpatched ſome Sauages, to whom hee gaue a French man for companie with letters. The ſaid Sauages promiſed to returne at the time prefixed, being eight daies, whereof they failed not. But as the ſocietie of man and wife, agreeing well together, is a powerful thing; ſo theſe Sauages before their departure, had a care of their wiues and children, and required victuals for them; which was granted. And hauing hoiſed vp ſailes, within few daies after they found thoſe that they ſought for, at a place <note place="margin">La Baye des Iles.</note>called <hi>La Baye des Iles,</hi> who were themſelues in no leſſe feare or griefe for the ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Monts,</hi> than he of them, becauſe they found not, during their voiage, thoſe markes and ſignes that were agreed vpon betweene them, which is, that <hi>Monſieur De Monts</hi> ſhould haue left at <note place="margin">The Ice co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

returned backe to ſeeke it: but hauing found it, forgetfull from what part he came, and not conſidering whether he ſhould goe Eaſt or Weſt, or otherwiſe (for there was no path) he tooke his way quite contrarie, turning his backe from his companie, and ſo long trauelled that hee ſound himſelfe at the ſea ſhoare, where no ſhips were to be ſeen, (for they were at the other ſide of a nooke of land farre reaching into the ſea) he imagined that he was forſaken, and began to bewaile his fortune vpon a rocke. The night being come, euery one being retired, he is found wanting: hee was asked for of thoſe that had beene in the woods, they report in what maner he departed from them, and that ſince they had no newes of him. Whereupon a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant was charged to haue killed him, becauſe they quarrelled ſometimes for matters of Religion. Finally, they ſounded a trumpet thorow the foreſt, they ſhot off the Canon diuers times, but in vaine: for the roaring of the Sea, ſtronger than all that, did expell backe the ſound of the ſaid Canons and trumpets.

               <p>After he had beene cheriſhed, and they ſoiourned yet ſometime, to order the buſineſſe, and to view the lands round about the Ile Saint <hi>Croix,</hi> motion was made to ſend backe the ſhippes into France before Winter, and ſo they that went not thither to Winter, prepared themſelues for the returne.

league of circuit, and at the end of it on the ſea ſide, there is a Mount or ſmall hill, which is (as it were) a little Ile ſevered from the other, where <hi>Monſieur de Monts</hi> his Canon was placed: There is alſo a little Chapell built after the ſauage faſhion. At the foot of which Chapell there is ſuch ſtore <note place="margin">Store of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</note>of muſſels as is wonderfull, which may be gathered at low water, but they are ſmall: I beleeue that <hi>Monſieur De Monts</hi> people did not forget to chuſe and take the biggeſt, and left there but the ſmall ones to grow and increaſe. As for the exerciſe and occupation of our Frenchmen, during the time of their abode there, we will mention it briefely, hauing firſt conducted backe our ſhips into France.</p>
               <p>The Sea and maritime charges in ſuch enterpriſes as that of <hi>Monſieur De Monts,</hi> be ſo great, that he who hath not a good ſtocke and foundation ſhall eaſilie ſinke vnder ſuch a burthen, and for to ſupplie, in ſome ſort, thoſe expences, one is forced to ſuffer and beare infinite diſcommodities, and put himſelfe in danger to bee diſcredited among vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen people, and which is worſe, in a land which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manured, and all ouer growen with foreſts. Wherein this action is the more generous, by ſo much as the perill is more euidently dangerous; and notwithſtanding all this, fortune is not left vnattempted, and to treade downe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thornes that ſtop the way. <hi>Monſieur De Monts</hi> his ſhipes returning into France, he remaineth in a deſolate place, with one barke and one boate onely. And though he is promiſed to be ſent for home at the end of the yeere, who may aſſure himſelfe of <hi>Aeolus</hi> and <hi>Neptunes</hi> fidelitie, two euill, furious, vnconſtant and vnmercifull Maſters? Behold the eſtate whereunto the ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Monts</hi> reduced himſelfe, hauing had no helpe of the King, as haue had al thoſe voiages that haue beene heeretofore deſcribed (except the late Lord <hi>Marquis de la Roche)</hi> and yet it is he that hath done more than all the reſt, not hauing yet loſt his hold. But in the end I feare he ſhall be conſtrained to giue ouer and forſake all, to the great ſhame and reproch

of the French name, which by this meanes is made ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and a by word to other nations. For (as though one would of ſet purpoſe oppoſe himſelfe to the conuerſion <note place="margin">Enuy vpon the priuiledge granted to <hi>Monſieur De Monts</hi> vpon Beuers.</note>of theſe poore Weſterly people, and to the ſetting forward of the glorie of God and the Kings) there be men ſtart vp, full of <hi>Auarice</hi> and <hi>Enuie:</hi> men which would not giue a ſtroke, or draw their ſwords for the Kings ſeruice (as <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> ſhewed one daie to his Maieſty) men which would not indure the leaſt labour in the world for the honour of God, which doe hinder that any profit be drawen from the very prouince it ſelfe, to furniſh to that which is neceſſarie to the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a worke, hauing rather that Engliſhmen and Hollanders reape the profit thereof than Frenchmen, and ſeeking to make the name of God vnknowen in thoſe parts of the world. And ſuch men, which haue no feare of God (for if they had any they would be zealous of his name) are heard, are beleeued, and carry things away at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>Now let vs prepare and hoiſe vp ſailes. <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> made the voyage into theſe parts with ſome men of good ſort, not to winter there, but as it were to ſeeke out his ſeat, and finde out a land that might like him. Which he hauing done, had no neede to ſoiorne there any <note place="margin">The returne of <hi>Monſieur De Poutrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> into France.</note>longer. So then the Ships being readie for the returne, he ſhipped himſelfe, and thoſe of his company, in one of them. The meane while the fame was from all ſides in theſe parts, of the wonders made in Oſtend, then beſieged by their Highneſſe of Flanders, alreadie three yeares paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The voyage was not without ſtormes and great perils: for amongſt others, I will recite two or three which might be placed among miracles, were it not that the Sea-acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are frequent enough, not that I will, for all that, dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſpeciall fauour that God hath alwaies ſhewed in <note place="margin">The firſt perill.</note>theſe voyages.</p>
               <p>The firſt is of a guſt of winde, which in the middeſt of

their nauigation came by night inſtantlie to ſtrike in the ſailes, with ſuch a violent boiſtrouſneſſe that it ouerturned the ſhip in ſuch maner, that of the one part the keele was on the face of the water, and the ſaile ſwimming vpon it, without any meanes or time to right it, or to looſe the tackles. On the ſudden the ſea is all afire, and the Mariners themſelues, all wet, did ſeeme to bee all compaſſed with flames, ſo furious was the Sea (the Sailers call this fire <hi>Saint Goudrans</hi> fire) and by ill fortune, in this ſudden ſurpriſe, there was not a knife to be found for to cut the cables or the ſaile. The poore ſhip, during this caſualtie, remained o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturned, caried continually, one while vpon Mountaines of waters, then another while ſuncken downe euen to hell. Briefely, euery one did prepare to drinke, more than his belly full, to all his friends, when a new blaſt of winde came, which rent the ſaile in a thouſand peeces, euer after vnprofitable to any vſe. Happy ſaile! hauing by his ruine ſaued all this people; for if it had beene a new one they had beene caſt away, and neuer newes had beene heard of them. But God doth often trie his people, and bringeth them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to deaths doore, to the end they may know his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull might, and feare him. So the ſhip began to ſtur and riſe againe by little and little: And well was it for them that ſhe was deepe keeled, for if it had beene a fliboate with a flat bottome and broade belly, it had beene quite ouerturned vp ſide downe, but the ballaſt, which remained beneath, did helpe to ſtirre her vpright.</p>

was that one knew not the houre of the day, becauſe it was darke by reaſon of miſtes, and by conſequent they knew not if it did ebbe or flow. For if it had beene floud they had eaſily doubled it: but it chanced that it was turning water, and by that meanes the ebbe did hinder it. So that approching the ſaid rocke they ſaw no hope to ſaue themſelues, and that neceſſarily they muſt go ſtrike againſt <note place="margin">Neceſſitie maketh vs ſeeke to God.

Then euery one began to pray to God, to craue pardon one of another, and (for their laſt comfort) to bewaile one another. Heereupon Captaine <hi>Roſſignol</hi> (whoſe Ship was taken in New France, as we haue ſaid before) drew out a great knife, to kill therewith Captaine <hi>Timothie,</hi> Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of this preſent voyage, ſaying to him, Doeſt thou not content thy ſelfe to haue vndone me, but wilt thou needs yet caſt me heere away? but he was held and kept from doing of that he was about to doe. And in very truth it was in him great folly, yea rather madneſſe, to goe about to kill a man that was going to die, and he (that went to giue the blow) in the ſame perill. In the end as they went to ſtrike vpon the rocke <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincort,</hi> who had alreadie yeelded his ſoule and recommended his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, asked of him that was at the top if there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope; who told him there was none: Then he bad ſome to helpe him to change the ſailes, which two or three one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did, and already was there no more water but to turne the Ship, when the mercy and fauor of God came to helpe them, &amp; turned the ſhip from the perils wherein they ſaw themſelues. Some had put off their doublets for to ſeeke to ſaue themſelues by climbing vpon the rocke, but the <note place="margin">The third danger.</note>feare was all the harme they had for that time: ſauing that ſome few houres after, being arriued neere to a rocke called <hi>Le nid a L'aigle,</hi> the Eagles neſt, they thought to goe bord it, thinking, in the darkneſſe of the miſt, it had been a Ship, from whence being againe eſcaped they arriued at New <note place="margin">Their return at New ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</note>hauen, the place from whence they firſt ſet out.

groſſe humors, and haue the maſſe of their bodie pory. Item they that be ſubiect to the oppilations of the ſpleene, and they that vſe not a ſturring life, but ſitting and without frequent motion, are more apt and ſubiect to theſe ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Therefore a Phyſitian might ſay that a ſtudent is not fit for that Countrie, that is to ſay, he ſhall not liue there in health: nor thoſe which ouertoile in labors, nor melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly people, men which haue drowſie dreaming ſpirits, nor thoſe that be often viſited with agues, and ſuch other ſort of people. Which I might eaſily beleeue, becauſe that theſe things doe heape much melancholy, cold and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous humors.

For I may ſay (and that truely) that I neuer made ſo much bodily worke, for the pleaſure that I did take in dreſſing and tilling my gardens, to incloſe and hedge them, againſt the gluttony of the hogges, to make knots, to draw out allies, to build arbours, to ſowe wheat, rie, barly, oates, beanes, peaſe, garden hearbs, and to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; ſo much deſire had I to know the goodneſſe of <note place="margin">The labour of the minde.</note>the ground by my owne experience.

               <p>And as for that which concerneth the exterior parts of the body, we haue found great good in wearing woodden pantaphles, or patins with our ſhooes, for to avoide the moiſtneſſe.

The ſaid <hi>Monſieur Du Pont,</hi> not knowing yet the ſtate of our French men, did thinke to finde there an aſſured dwelling, and his lodgings readie: but conſidering the accidents of the ſtrange ſickneſſe whereof we haue ſpoken, he tooke aduice to change place. <hi>Monſieur De Monts</hi> was very deſirous that the new habitation had beene about 40. degrees, that is to ſay, 4. degrees farther then <hi>Saint Croix:</hi> but hauing viewed the coaſt as farre as <hi>Malebarre,</hi> and with much paine, not finding what hee deſired, it was deliberated to goe and make their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in <hi>Port Royal,</hi> vntill meanes were had to make an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler <note place="margin">Tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from S. <hi>Croix</hi> to <hi>Port Royal.</hi>

So euery one began to packe vp his things: That which was built with infinite labour was pulled downe, except the Store-houſe, which was too great and painefull to be tranſported, and in executing of this, many voyages are made.

The Moneth of September did already begin to come, and care was to be taken for the vnlading of <hi>Monſieur Du Pont</hi> his ſhip, to make roome for them that ſhould returne backe into France.

the ſtrength of the bodie is requiſite: And therefore it is not without cauſe that in old time, bad people were threatned to be ſent to the Mill, as to the painefulleſt thing that is: to which occupation poore ſlaues were ſet to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the vſe of water and winde-mils was found out, as the Prophane hiſtories make mention: and the ſame of the <note place="margin">Exod. 11. ver. 4. 5.</note>comming of the people of Iſrael out of the land of Aegypt, where, for the laſt ſcourge that God will ſend to <hi>Pharao,</hi> he declareth by the mouth of <hi>Moiſes,</hi> that <hi>about midnight he will paſſe thorow Aegypt, and euery firſt borne ſhall die there, from the firſt borne of Pharao, that ſhould ſit vpon his throne, to the firſt borne of the maide Seruant which grindeth at the Mill.</hi> And this labor is ſo great, that the Sauages (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be very poore) cannot beare it, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be without bread, then to take ſo much pains as it hath beene tried, offering them halfe of the grinding they ſhould doe, but they chuſed rather to haue no corne.

I adde beſides the bad waters which they vſed, that did not runne from a quicke ſpring, but from the neereſt brooke.</p>

But becauſe it was the Holy weeke, in which time they are imployed, and waite on confeſſions and

BEing come to Rochell, we found there <hi>Monſieur De Monts,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt,</hi> that were come in Poſt, and our ſhip called the <hi>Ionas,</hi> of the burthen of 150. tonnes, readie to paſſe out of the chaines of the Towne, to tary for winde and tyde. The tyde I ſay, becauſe that a great ſhip laden, cannot come to ſea from Rochell, but in ſpring tydes, vpon the new and full moone, by reaſon that in the towne roade there is no ſufficient depth. In the meane while we made good cheare, yea ſo good, that we did long to be at ſea to make diet: which we did but too ſoone, being once come thither: for during two whole monethes we ſaw not a whit of land, as we will farther tell anone. But the workemen, thorow their good cheare (for they had euery one two ſhillings a daies hire) <note place="margin">The praiſes of Rochell.</note>did play maruellous pranckes in Saint Nicholas quarter, where they were lodged, which was found ſtrange in a towne ſo reformed as Rochell is, in the which no notorious riots nor diſſolutions be made; and indeed one muſt behaue himſelfe orderly there, vnleſſe he will incurre the danger either of the cenſure of the Maior, or of the Miniſters of the Towne. Some of thoſe diſordered men were put in priſon, which were kept in the Towne-houſe till the time of going, and had beene further puniſhed, had it not beene vpon conſideration of the voyage, where they knew they ſhould not haue all their eaſes, but ſhould afterwards pay deere enough their madde bargen, in putting the ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Macquin</hi> and Maſter <hi>Georges</hi> to ſo much trouble, to keepe them in order. I will not, for all that, put in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this diſordred people, al the reſt, for there were ſome <note place="margin">

And this maketh me remember the <hi>Croquans</hi> war, amongſt whom I was once in my life, being in <hi>Querci.</hi> It was the ſtrangeſt thing in the world to ſee the confuſion of thoſe woodden ſhooed fellowes, from whence they tooke the name of <hi>Croquans</hi> (that is to ſay

                  </note> Our <hi>Ionas</hi> hauing her full loade, was in the end rowed out of the Towne into the roade, and we thought to ſet out the 8. or 9. of Aprill. Captaine <hi>Foulques</hi> had taken the charge for the conducting of the voyage. But as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly there is negligence in mens buſineſſes, it hapned that this Captaine (who notwithſtanding I haue knowen very diligent and watchfull at ſea) hauing left the ſhip ill manned, not being in her himſelfe, nor the Pilot, but only 6. or 7. mariners good and bad, a great South-eaſt winde aroſe in the night, which brake the <hi>Ionas</hi> cable, faſtend with one onely ancker, and driueth her againſt a forewall which is out of the towne, backing and proping the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the chaine, againſt which ſhe ſtrake ſo many times, that ſhe brake and ſunke downe; and it chanced well that it was then ebbing, for if this miſhap had come in flowing time, the ſhip was in danger to be ouerwhelmed with a farre greater loſſe then we had, but ſhe ſtood vp, and ſo there was means to mend her, which was done with ſpeed. Our workemen were warned to come and helpe in this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, <note place="margin">Hyred work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</note>either to draw at the pompe, at the Capeſtane, or to any other thing; but few there were that endeuoured themſelues to doe any thing, the moſt part of them going away, and moſt of them made a mocke of it. Some hauing gone ſo far as to the oare, went backe complaining that one had caſt water vpon them, being of that ſide that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came out of the pompe, which the winde did ſcatter vpon them. I came thither with <hi>Monſieur De Poutrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> and ſome other willing men, where wee were not vnprofitable. Almoſt all the inhabitants of Rochell were beholding this ſpectacle vpon the rampiers. The ſea was
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9921:41"/>
yet ſtormy, and we thought our ſhip would haue daſhed oftentimes againſt the great Towers of the towne. In the end, we came in with leſſe loſſe then wee thought of. The ſhip was all vnladen, being forced to tackle and furniſh her anew. The loſſe thereby was great, and the voyages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt broken off for euer: for I beleeue, that after ſo many trials, none would haue ventured to goe plant Colonies in thoſe parts; that Country being ſo ill ſpoken of, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one did pittie vs, conſidering the accidents happened to <note place="margin">The courage of <hi>Monſieur De Monts</hi> and his aſſociates.</note>them that had beene there before. Notwithſtanding <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur De Monts</hi> and his aſſociates, did beare manfully this loſſe.

               <p>This great trouble hindered vs aboue a moneth, which was emploied in the vnlading, and lading againe of our ſhip. During that time, we did walke ſometimes vnto the places neere about the towne, and chiefly vnto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the Cordeliers, which is but halfe a league off from <note place="margin">The fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers ought to be furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note>the towne: where being one Sunday, I did maruell how in thoſe places of frontier, there is no better garriſon, having ſo ſtrong enemies neere them. And ſeeing I take in hand to relate an hiſtory of things, according to the true maner of them: I ſay that it is a ſhamefull thing for vs, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Rochell, pray to God euery day in their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations <note place="margin">The Miniſters doe pray for the conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages.</note>for the conuerſion of the poore Sauage people, and alſo for our ſafe conducting, and that our Church-men doe not the like. In very truth we neuer required neither the one nor the other to doe it, but therin is knowen the zeale of both ſides. In the end, a little before our departing, it came to my minde to aske of the Parſon or Vicar of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell if there might be found any of his fraternity that would come with vs, which I hoped might eaſily be done, becauſe there was a reaſonable good number of them: and beſides, that being in a maritime towne, I thought
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9921:41"/>
they tooke delight to haunt the ſeas: but I could obtaine nothing: and for all excuſes, it was tolde me, that none would goe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſuch voyages, vnleſſe they were mooued with an extraordinary zeale and pietie: And that it would bee the beſt way to ſeeke to the fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ieſuites for the ſame. Which we could not then doe, our ſhip hauing almoſt her full lading. Whereupon I remember to haue heard oftentimes of <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt,</hi> that after his firſt voiage, being at the Court, an Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, eſteemed very zealous in the Chriſtian religion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him what might be hoped for in the conuerſion of the people of New France, and whether there were any great number of them. Whereunto he anſwered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a hundred thouſand ſoules might be gotten to <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> (naming a number certaine for an vncertaine.) This Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie man making ſmall account of ſuch a number, ſaid ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by admiration, <hi>is that all!</hi> as if that number did not deſerue the labour of a Church-man. Truly though there were but the hundreth part of that, yea yet leſſe, one muſt not ſuffer it to bee loſt. The good Sheepheard hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <note place="margin">Math. 18. verſ. 12. 132.</note>an hundred ſheepe one aſtray, left the 99. for to go and ſeeke out the one that was loſt. We are taught &amp;) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it ſo) that though there were but one man to be ſaued, our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> had not diſdained to come, as well for him, as he hath done for all the world. In like maner, one muſt not make ſo ſmal account of the ſaluation of theſe poore people, though they ſwarme not in number as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Paris or Conſtantinople.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Cuſtome of the ancient Chriſtians, carying the Euchariſt in their voyages.</note> Seeing it auailed me nothing in demanding for a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to adminiſter the Sacrament vnto vs, be it during our nauigation, or vpon the land: The ancient cuſtome of the Chriſtians came into my minde, which going in voyage did carry with them the holy bread of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and this did they, becauſe they found not, in all places, Prieſts to adminiſter this Sacrament vnto them, the world being then yet full, either of Heathens or Heretickes. So that it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9921:42"/>
was not vnproperly called <hi>Viatic,</hi> which they carried with them trauelling on the way: yet notwithſtanding I am of opinion that it hath a ſpirituall meaning. And conſidering that we might be brought to that neceſſity, not hauing in New France but one Prieſt onely, (of whoſe death wee heard when we came thither) I demanded if they would doe vnto vs, as to the ancient Chriſtians, who were as wiſe as we. I was anſwered that the ſame was done in that time for conſiderations which are not now at this daie. I <note place="margin">Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his funerall oration for his brother.</note>replied that <hi>Satirus Saint Ambroſes</hi> brother, going on a voyage vpon the ſea, ſerued himſelfe with this ſpirituall Phyſicke (as we read in his funerall oration made by his ſaid brother Saint <hi>Ambroſe)</hi> which he did carry in <hi>Orario,</hi> which I take to be a lynnen cloth, or taffita: and well did it happen vnto him by it. For hauing made ſhip-wracke, he ſaued himſelfe vpon a bord, left of his veſſels wracke. But I was as well refuſed in this as of the reſt. Which gaue mee cauſe of wondring: ſeeming to me a very rigorous thing to be in worſe condition then the firſt Chriſtians. For the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is no other thing at this day then it was then: And if they held it precious, we doe not demand it to make leſſer account thereof.</p>

For in places where is no great depth, as in Rochell, one muſt tarry for the high tydes of the full and new Moones, and then paraduenture the winde will not be fit, and ſo one muſt deferre, till a fortnights time. In the meane while the ſeaſon goeth away: as it was almoſt with vs. For we ſaw the houre that after ſo many labours and charges, we were indanger to tary for lacke of winde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Moone was in the waine, and conſequently the <note place="margin">Bad ſuſpition of Captaine <hi>Foulques.</hi>

It was a thing fearefull for them that were not vſed to ſuch a dance, to ſee them caried vpon ſo moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able an ellement, and to be at euery moment (as it were) within two fingers bredth to death.

The 16. of May we met with 13. Holanders, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Spaine, which did inquire of our voyage, and ſo held their courſe.

And they asked vs if we would accept of their companie: we thanked them: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they dranke to vs, and we to them, and they tooke another courſe. But hauing conſidered their veſſell all ſet with greene moſſe on the belly and ſides, we iudged them to be Pirates, &amp; that they had of a long time beaten the ſea, in hope to make ſome priſe. It was then that we began to <note place="margin">Neptunes ſheepe.</note>ſee, more than before, <hi>Neptunes</hi> ſheepe to skip vp (ſo doe they call the frothy waues, when the ſea beginneth to ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and to feele the hard blowes of his Trident. For common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Why is the ſea ſtormie about the Açores.</note>in that place before named the ſea is ſtormy. If one aske me the cauſe why: I wil anſwer, that I thinke it to proceed of a certaine conflict between the Eaſt &amp; weſterly windes, which doe encounter in that part of the ſea, and eſpecially in Summer, when the Weſt windes doe riſe vp, and with a great force pierce and paſſe thorow a great diſtance of ſea, vntill they finde the windes of theſe parts, which doe reſiſt them; Then it is dangerous for a ſhip to be at theſe windy encounters. This reaſon ſeemeth the more probable vnto me, in this, that vntill we came neere the <hi>Açores</hi> we had the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:9921:43"/>
winde fit enough, and afterward, we had almoſt alwaies either South-weſt or Norweaſt, little North and South, which were not good for vs, but to ſaile with the bowline: For Eaſterly windes we had none at all, but once or twice, <note place="margin">Weſterly windes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in the Weſterne Sea.</note>which continued nothing with vs (to ſpeake of.) Sure it is that the Weſterly windes doe raigne much a long that ſea, Whether it be by a certaine repercuſſion of the Eaſt winde which is ſtiffe and ſwift vnder the Equinoctiall line, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue ſpoken elſe-where, or becauſe that this Weſtern land, being large and great, alſo the winde that iſſueth from thence doth abound the more. Which commeth eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Summer, when the ſunne hath force to draw vp the <note place="margin">from whence the windes doe come.</note>vapors of the earth, for the windes come from thence, iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the dennes and Caues of the ſame. And therefore the Poets doe faine that <hi>Aeolus</hi> holdeth them in priſons, from whence hee draweth them, and giueth them liberty when it pleaſeth him. But the ſpirit of God doth confirm it vnto vs yet better, when he ſaith by the mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that Almighty God, among other his maruels, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Pſal. 135.</note>the windes out of his treaſures, which be the Caues whereof I ſpeake.

                  <l>He bringeth foorth the cloudes from the earthes furtheſt parts,</l>

               <p>Continuing then our courſe, we had ſome other ſtormes &amp; hindrances procured by windes, which we almoſt had alwaies contrary, by reaſon we ſet out too late: but they that ſet out in March haue commonly good windes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the great Bancke of Morues or Coddes: of the Sound: our comming to the ſaid Bancke: the deſcription thereof: the fiſhing of New-found-land-fiſh: and of birds: the greedineſſe of birds, called by Frenchmen Hap-foyes, that is to ſay, liuer-catchers: diuers perils: the fauours of God: the cauſes of frequent and long mistes in the Western ſea: Land-markes: the ſight of it: maruellous odours: the boording of two Shaloupes, the landing at the Port <hi>du Moutton:</hi> the comming into <hi>Port Royall:</hi> of two Frenchmen remaining there alone amongst the Sauages.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore wee come to the Bancke, ſpoken of before, which is the great Bancke where the fiſhing of greene Cod-fiſhes is made (ſo are they called when they are not dry, for one muſt goe alande for the drying of them) the ſea-faring-men, beſides the computation they make of their courſe, haue warnings when they come neere to it, by <note place="margin">Warnings neere the great Bancke. Birds called by French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>Godes, Fouquets, Happefoies.</hi>
                  </note>birds, which are knowen: euen as one doth them of theſe our parts, returning backe into France, when one is within 100. or 120. leagues neere it. The moſt frequent of theſe birds, towards the ſaid Bancke, be <hi>Godes, Fouquets,</hi> and other called <hi>Happe-foyes,</hi> for a reaſon that we will declare anone. When theſe birds then were ſeene, which were not like to them that we had ſeene in the middeſt of the great ſea, we began to thinke our ſelues not to be farre from the ſaid Bancke. Which made vs to ſound with our lead vpon a Thurſday the 22. of Iune, but then we found no bottom. <note place="margin">What the ſound is, and how it is caſt.</note>The ſame day in the euening, we caſt againe with better ſucceſſe: for we found bottome at 36. fadams. The ſaid ſound is a peece of lead of ſeuen or eight pound waight, made piramidall wiſe, faſtened at one or diuers lines: and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9921:47"/>
at the biggeſt end, which is flat, one putteth ſome greaſe to it, mingled with butter: then all the ſailes are ſtricken downe, and the ſound caſt: and when that the bottome is felt, and the lead draweth no more line, they leaue off leting downe of it. So our ſound being drawen vp, brought with it ſome ſmall ſtones, with a white one, and a peece of ſhell, hauing moreouer a pit in the greaſe, whereby they iudged <note place="margin">The arriuall to the fiſh Bancke.</note>that the bottome was a rocke. I cannot expreſſe the Ioy that we had, ſeeing vs there, where we had ſo much deſired to be. There was not any one of vs more ſicke, euery one did leape for Ioy, and did ſeeme vnto vs to be in our owne country, though we were come but to the halſe of our voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, at leaſt for the time, that paſſed before we came to Port Royall, whther we were bound.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the word Bancke: and deſcription of the fiſhing Bancke.</note> Heere I will, before I proceed any further, decipher vnto you, what meaneth this word <hi>(Bancke)</hi> which paraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture putteth ſome in paine to know what it is. They ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times call Banckes a ſandy bottome which is very ſhallow, or which is a drie at low water. Such places be mortall for ſhips that meete with them. But the Bancke whereof we ſpeake, are mountaines grounded in the depth of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are raiſed vp to 30. 36. and 40. fadams, neere to the vpper face of the ſea. This Bancke is holden to be of 200. leagues in lenght: and 18. 20. and 24. leagues broad, which being paſſed there is no more bottome found out, then in theſe parts, vntill one come to the land. The ſhips being there arriued, the ſailes are rowled vp, and there, fiſhing is made of the greene fiſh, as I haue ſaid, whereof we ſhall ſpeake in the booke following. For the ſatisfying of my reader, I haue drawen it in my Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy call Map of New-found-land, with prickes, which is all may be done to repreſent it. There is, farther off, other banckes, as I haue marked in the ſaid Map, vpon the which good fiſhing may be made: and many goe thither that know the places. When that we parted from Rochel, there was (as it were) a forreſt of ſhips lying at <hi>Chef de Bois,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:9921:47"/>
(whereof that place hath taken his name) which went all in a company to that country, preuenting vs (in their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) but onely of two daies.</p>
               <p>Hauing ſeene and noted the Bancke, wee hoiſted vp ſailes and bare all night, keeping ſtill our courſe to the Weſt. But the dawne of day being come, which was Saint <note place="margin">The fiſhing of Cod.</note>Iohn Baptiſts Eue, in Gods name we pulled downe ſailes, paſſing that day a fiſhing of Cod-fiſh, with a thouſand mirthes and contentments, by reaſon of freſh meates, whereof we had aſmuch as we would, hauing long before wiſhed for them. <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt,</hi> and a yong man of <hi>Retel</hi> named <hi>Le Feure,</hi> who, by reaſon of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſſe were not come out from their beds nor cabanes, from the beginning of the Nauigation, came vpon the hatches that day, and had the pleaſure, not onely of fiſhing of Cod, but alſo of thoſe birds, that bee called by French mariners, <hi>Happe-foyes,</hi> that is to ſay <hi>Liuer-catchers,</hi> becauſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Happe-foyes</hi> Why ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note>of their greedineſſe to deuour the liuers of the Cod-fiſhes that are caſt into the ſea, after their bellies bee opened, whereof they are ſo couetous, that though they ſee a great powle ouer their heads, ready to ſtrike them downe, yet they aduenture themſelues to come neere to the ſhip, to catch ſome of them, at what price ſoeuer. And they which were not occupied in fiſhing did paſſe their time in that ſport. And ſo did they, by their diligence that wee tooke ſome thirty of them. But in this action one of our ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights fell downe in the ſea. And it was good for him that the ſhip went but ſlow, which gaue him meanes to ſaue himſelfe by taking hold of the rudder, from which he was pulled in a boord, but for his paines was well beaten by Captaine <hi>Foulques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sea-dogges skinnes.</note> In this fiſhing we ſometimes did take ſea-dogges, whoſe skinnes our Ioyners did keepe carefully to ſmooth their worke withall. Item, fiſhes called by Frenchmen <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> which be better then Cod, and ſometimes another kinde of fiſh called <hi>Bars:</hi> which diuerſity did augment our
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9921:48"/>
delight. They which were not buſie in taking neither fiſhes nor birdes, did paſſe their time in gathering the hearts, guts, and other inward parts (moſt delicate) of the Cod-fiſh, which they did mince with lard and ſpices, and <note place="margin">Excellent ſawſiges made with the inwards of Codd.</note>with thoſe things did make as good <hi>Bolonia</hi> ſauſiges, as any can be made in Paris, and we did eat of them with a very good ſtomacke.</p>
               <p>On the euening we made ready to continue our courſe, hauing firſt made our Canons to roare, as well becauſe of Saint Iohn his holy day, as for <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourts</hi> ſake, which beareth the name of that Saint. The next day ſome of our men tolde vs they had ſeene a Bancke of Ice. And thereupon was recited vnto vs, how that the yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">Men ſaued vpon a banck of Ice.</note>a ſhip of Olone was caſt away, by approaching too neere to it, and that two men hauing ſaued themſelues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ice, had this good fortune, that another ſhip, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by, the men tooke them in aboord them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The weather in thoſe ſeas contrary, then in ours.</note> It is to be noted that from the 18. of Iune vntill wee did arriue at Port Royall, we haue found the weather quite otherwiſe to that we had before. For (as we haue already ſaid) we had colde miſtes or fogges, before our comming to the Bancke (where we came in faire ſunſhine) but the next day, we fell to the fogges againe, which (a far off) we <note place="margin">The cauſes of miſts on the Weſt ſea.</note>might perceiue to come and wrappe vs about, holding vs continually priſoners three whole daies, for two daies of faire weather that they permitted vs: which was alwaies accompanied with colde, by reaſon of the Summers ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Yea euen diuers times wee haue ſeene our ſelues a whole ſennight, continually in thicke fogges, twice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſhew of Sunne, but very little, as I will recite heereafter. And I will bring foorth a reaſon for ſuch effects which ſeemeth vnto me probable. As wee ſee the fire to draw the moiſtneſſe of a wet cloath, oppoſite vnto it, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſunne draweth moiſtneſſe and vapours both from the ſea and from the land. But for the diſſoluing of them, there is heere one vertue, and beyond thoſe parts another,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9921:48"/>
according to the accidents and circumſtances that are found. In theſe our countries it raiſeth vp vapours onely from the ground, and from our riuers: which earthly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, groſſe and waighty, and participating leſſe of the moiſt ellement, doe cauſe vs a hot aire, and the earth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of thoſe vapours, becomes thereby more hot and parching. From thence it commeth, that the ſaid vapors, hauing the earth of the one part, and the Sunne on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which heateth them, they are eaſily diſſolued, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining long in the aire, vnleſſe it be in winter, when the earth is waxen colde, and the Sunne beyond the <hi>Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> line, farre off from vs. From the ſame reaſon proceedeth the cauſe, why miſtes and fogges be not ſo frequent, nor ſo long in the French ſeas, as in New-found-land, becauſe that the Sunne, paſſing from his riſing, aboue the grounds, this ſea, at the comming thereof, receiueth almoſt but earthly vapours, and by a long ſpace retaineth this vertue to diſſolue very ſoone the exhalations it draweth to it ſelfe. But when it commeth to the middeſt of the Ocean, and to the ſaid new found land, hauing eleuated and aſſumed in ſo long a courſe a great abundance of vapours, from this moiſt wide Ocean, it doth not ſo eaſily diſſolue them, as well, becauſe thoſe vapours be colde of themſelues, and of their nature, as becauſe the Element which is neereſt vnder them, doth ſimpathize with them, and preſerueth them, &amp; the Sunne beames being not holpen in the diſſoluing of them, as they are vpon the earth. Which is euen ſeene in the land of that countrie, which (although it hath but ſmall heat, by reaſon of the abundance of woods) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it helpeth to diſperſe the miſtes and fogges, which be ordinarily there, in the morning, during ſummer, but not as at Sea, for about eight aclocke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they begin to vaniſh away, and ſerue as a dew to the ground.</p>

eight daies, which were from one Saturday to another, God (who hath alwaies guided theſe voyages, in the which not one man hath beene loſt by ſea) ſhewed vs his ſpeciall fauour, in ſending vnto vs, among the thicke fogs, <note place="margin">Gods fauour in danger.</note>a clearing of the Sunne, which continued but halfe an houre: And then had we ſight of the firme land, and knew that we were ready to be caſt away vpon the rockes, if we had not ſpeedily ſtood off to ſea-ward. A man doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeeke the land, as one doth his beloued, which ſometimes repulſeth her ſweet heart very rudely. Finally, vpon Saturday the 15. of Iulj, about two aclocke in the after noone, the ſky began to ſalute vs, as it were, with Cannon ſhots, ſhedding teares, as being ſory to haue kept vs ſo long in paine. So that faire weather being come again, <note place="margin">Calme wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>we ſaw comming ſtraight to vs (we being fower leagues off from the land) two Shaloupes with open ſailes, in a ſea yet wrathed.

We did ſtretch out our hands, at it were to take them, ſo palpable were they, which I haue admired a thouſand times ſince.

Of this diſcommodity may be drawne heereafter a great good, that theſe miſts will ſerue as a rampier to the country, and one ſhall know with ſpeed what is paſſed at ſea. They tolde vs alſo that they had beene aduertiſed, ſome daies before, by other Sauages, that a ſhip was ſeene at Cap Breton. Theſe French men of S. <hi>Maloe</hi> were men that did deale for the aſſociates of <hi>Monſieur De Monts,</hi> and did complaine that the Baskes, or men of Saint Iohn <hi>De Lus</hi> (againſt the King his Inhibitions) had trucked with the Sauages, and caried away aboue ſix thouſand Beauers <note place="margin">The care of the ſauages for their wiues.</note>skinnes.

                  <note place="margin">Difficulties in comming in.</note> Thurſday the 27. of Iuly we came in with the floud, which was not without much difficultie, for that we had the winde contrary, and guſts of winde from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, which made vs almoſt to ſtrike vpon the rockes.

Finally, being in the Port, it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs a thing maruellous to ſee the faire diſtance and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, and the mountaines and hils that inuironed it, &amp; I wondered how ſo faire a place did remaine deſert, being all filled with woods, ſeeing that ſo many pine away in the world, which might make good of this land, if onely they had a chiefe gouernor to conduct them thither. By little and little we drew neere to the Iland, which is right ouer againſt the fort where we haue dwelt ſince: An Iland I ſay, the moſt agreeable thing to be ſeene in her kinde, that is poſſible to bee deſired, wiſhing in our ſelues to haue brought thither ſome of thoſe faire buildings that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable in theſe our parts, that ſerue for nothing, but to retire wildefowle in, and other birds. We knew not yet, if

                  <hi>Monſieur Du Pont</hi> was gone or no, and therefore we did expect that he ſhould ſend ſome men to meet vs; but it was in vaine: for he was gone from thence 12. daies before. And whileſt we did hull in the middeſt of the Port, <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertou,</hi> the greateſt <hi>Sagamos</hi> of the <hi>Souriquois</hi> (ſo are the <note place="margin">

You ſtand heere a dining (for it was about noone) and doe not ſee a great ſhip that commeth heere, and we know not what men they are: Suddenly theſe two men ran vpon the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke, and with diligence made ready the Canons, which they furniſhed with pellets &amp; touch powder. <hi>Membertou,</hi> without delay, came in a Conow made of barkes of trees, with a daughter of his, to view vs: And hauing found but friendſhip, and knowing vs to be Frenchmen, made no alarme. Notwithſtanding one of the two Frenchmen left there, called <hi>La Taille,</hi> came to the ſhore of the Port, his match on the cocke, to know what we were (though he knew it well enough, for we had the white Banner diſplai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the toppe of the maſt) and on the ſudden foure volly of canons were ſhot off, which made innumerable echoes: And from our part, the fort was ſaluted with three Canon ſhots, and many musket ſhots, at which time our Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not ſlacke of his dutie.

arriued there, on Mondy the laſt of Iuly, and tarried yet in Port Royall vntill the 28. of Auguſt.

we found our ſelues on the top of a high Mountaine, and were forced to come downe with paine enough, by reaſon of ſnowes. But Mountaines be not perpetual in a country.

The next day the Captaine of the ſaid place and Port, came into <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourts</hi> barke to ſee him: we <note place="margin">Suſpition for the comming of <hi>Olmechin.</hi>

That gaue cauſe of bad ſuſpition, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he had promiſed his loue to the Frenchmen. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they were gently receiued. And <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> gaue to the ſaid <hi>Olmechin</hi> a complet gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherewith being clothed, he viewed himſelfe in a glaſſe, and did laugh to ſee himſelfe in that order. But a <note place="margin">The trouble of garments.</note>little while after, feeling that the ſame hindred him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was in October, when he was returned vnto his Cabins, he diſtributed it to ſundry of his men, to the end that one alone ſhould not be ouerpeſtered with it. This ought to be a ſufficient leſſon to ſo many finnical, both men and women, of theſe parts, who cauſe their garments and breſt-plates to be made as hard and ſtiffe as wood, wherein their bodies are ſo miſerably tormented, that they are in their clothes vnable to all good actions. And if the weather be too hot they ſuffer in their great bummes with a thouſand folds, vnſupportable heats, that are more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, than the torments which felons and criminall men are ſometimes made to feele.</p>
               <p>Now during the time that the ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Poutrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> was there, being in doubt whether <hi>Monſieur De Monts</hi> would come to make an habitation on that coaſt, as <note place="margin">Corne ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and vines planted.</note>he wiſhed it, he made there a peece of ground to be tilled, for to ſow corne and to plant vines, which they did, with the helpe of our Apothecary <hi>Maſter Lewes Hebert,</hi> a man, who, beſides his experience in his art, taketh great delight in the tilling of the ground.

So that the Barke hauing touched at three foot of water onely, we thought to be caſt away, and we began to vnlade her, and put the victuals into the Shaloup, which was behinde, for to ſaue vs on land: but being no full ſea, the barke came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flote within an houre. All this Sea is a land ouerflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that of Mount Saint <hi>Michels,</hi> a ſandy ground, in which, all that reſteth is a plaine flat country as far as the Mountaines, which are ſeene 15. leagues off from that place.

               </argument>
               <p>THe night beginning to giue place to the dawning of the day, the ſailes are hoiſed vp, but it was but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perilous nauigation. For with this ſmall veſſell <note place="margin">Danger.</note>they were forced to coaſt the land, where they found no depth: going backe to ſea it was yet woorſe: in ſuch wiſe that they did ſtrike twice or thrice, being raiſed vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine onely by the waues, and the rudder was broken, which was a dreadfull thing. In this extremity they were conſtrained to caſt anker in the ſea, at two fadams deepe, and three leagues off from the land. Which being done, <hi>Daniel Hay</hi> (a man which taketh pleaſure in ſhewing foorth his vertue in the perils of the ſea) was ſent towards the Coaſt to view it, and ſee if there were any Port. And as he was neere land he ſaw a Sauage, which did daunce, ſinging <hi>yo, yo, yo,</hi> he called him to come neerer, and by <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Oigoudi,</hi> or S. <hi>Iohns</hi> riuer. Sauages of ſundry nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not one another.</note>ſignes asked him if there were any place to retire ſhips in, and where any freſh water was. The Sauage hauing made ſigne there was, he tooke him into his ſhaloup, and brought him to the Barke, wherein was <hi>Chkoudun</hi> Captaine of the riuer of <hi>Oigoudi,</hi> otherwiſe Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> riuer; who being brought before this Sauage, he vnderſtood him no more
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9921:61"/>
than did our owne people: true it is, that by ſignes he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended better than they what he would ſay. This Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage ſhewed the places, where no depth was, and where was any, and did ſo well indenting and winding heere and there, alway the led in hand, that in the end they came to the Port ſhewed by him, where ſmall depth is: wherein the barke being arriued, diligence was vſed to make a forge <note place="margin">A forge and an ouen made.</note>for to mend her with her rudder, and an ouen to bake bread, becauſe there was no more bisket left.</p>
               <p>Fifteene daies were imployed in this worke, during the which <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt,</hi> according to the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">A creſſe ſet vp.</note>cuſtome of Chriſtians, made a Croſſe to be framed and ſet vp, vpon a greene bancke, as <hi>Monſieur De Monts</hi> had done two yeeres before at <hi>Kinibeki</hi> and <hi>Malebarre.</hi> Now among theſe painefull exerciſes they gaue not ouer make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good cheere, with that which both the ſea and the land might furniſh in that part. For in this Port is plentie of fowle, in taking of which many of our men applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: ſpecially the ſea larkes are there in ſo great flights that <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> killed 28. of them with one <note place="margin">Abundance of larkes and fiſhes.</note>Caliuer ſhot. As for fiſhes, there be ſuch abundance of Porpeſes, and another kinde of fiſh, called by Frenchmen <hi>Soufleurs,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Blowers,</hi> that the ſea ſeemes to be all couered ouer with them. But they had not the things neceſſary for this kinde of fiſhing, they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues then with ſhell-fiſh, as of Oyſters, Skalops, periwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <note place="margin">Shell-fiſh.</note>whereof there was enough to be ſatisfied. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages of the other ſide did bring fiſh, and grapes within <note place="margin">Grapes.

The ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> ſeeing the grapes there, maruellouſly faire, commanded him that wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on his chamber, to lay vp in the Barke a burthen of the vines from whence the ſaid grapes were taken. Our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary M. <hi>Lewes Hebert,</hi> deſirous to inhabit in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, had pulled out a good quantity of them, to the end to plant them in Port Royall, where none o<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After certaine daies, the ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt,</hi> ſeeing there great aſſembly of Sauages, came aſhore, and to giue them ſome terrour, made to march before him one <note place="margin">The triall of French wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons before the Sauages.</note>of his men, flouriſhing with two naked ſwords. Whereat they much wondred, but yet much more when they ſaw that our Muskets did pierce thicke peeces of wood, where their arrowes could not ſo much as ſcratch. And therefore they neuer aſſailed our men, as long as they kept watch. And it had beene good to ſound the Trumpet at euery <note place="margin">Good inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note>houres end, as Captaine <hi>Iames Quartier</hi> did. For (as <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> doth often ſay) <hi>One muſt neuer laie bait for theeues,</hi> meaning that one muſt neuer giue cauſe to an enemy to thinke that he may ſurpriſe you: But one muſt alwaies ſhew that he is miſtruſted, and that you are not aſleepe, chiefely when one hath to doe with Sauages, which will neuer ſet vpon him that reſolutely expects them; which was not performed in this place by them that bought the bargain of their negligence very deare, as we will now tell you.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">See in the next booke.</note> Fifteene daies being expired, the ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trincourt</hi> ſeeing his barke mended, and nothing remaining <note place="margin">Signes of conſpiracy.</note>to be done, but a batch of bread, he went ſome 3. leagues diſtant within the land, to ſee if he might diſcouer any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity: But in his returne he and his men perceaued the Sauages running away thorow the woods in diuers troupes of 20. 30. and more; ſome bowing themſelues as men that would not be ſeene: others hiding themſelues in the graſſe not to be perceiued: others carrying away their ſtuffe, and Canowes full of corne, for to betake them to their heeles: Beſides the women tranſporting their children, and ſuch ſtuffe as they could with them. Thoſe actions gaue cauſe to <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> to thinke that this people did

plot ſome bad enterpriſe. Therefore being arriued he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his people, which were a making of bread, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire themſelues into their Barke. But as yong people doe <note place="margin">Yong men diſobedient.</note>often forget their duty, theſe hauing ſome cake, or ſuch like thing, to make, had rather follow their likeriſh appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, than to doe that which was commanded them, taried till night without retiring themſelues.

                  <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> thinking vpon that which had paſſed the day before, did aske whether they were in the barke; and hearing they were not, he ſent the ſhaloupe vnto them, to command and bring them aboord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note>they diſobaied, except his Chamberlain, who feared his maſter. They were fiue, armed with muskets and ſwords, which were warned to ſtand ſtill vpon their guard, and yet (being negligent) made not any watch, ſo much were they addicted to their owne wils. The report was, that they had before ſhot off two muskets vpon the Sauages, bicauſe that ſome one of them had ſtolne a hatchet. Finally, thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages, either prouoked by that, or by their bad nature, came at the breake of day without any noiſe (which was very eaſie to them, hauing neither horſes, waggons nor woodden-ſhooes) euen to the place where they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe: And ſeeing a fit opportunity to play a bad part, <note place="margin">Murther done by the Saua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note>they ſet vpon them with ſhots of arrowes, and clubs, and killed two of them. The reſt being hurt began to crie out, running towards the ſea ſhoare. Then hee which kept watch within the barke, cried out all affrighted, O Lord! our men are killed, our men are killed. At this voice and cry, euery one roſe vp, and haſtily, not taking leaſure to fit on their cloathes, nor to ſet fire to their matches, ten of <note place="margin">Succour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>them went into the ſhaloup, whoſe names I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but of <hi>Monſieur Champlein, Robert Grauè (Monſieur Du Pont</hi> his ſonne) <hi>Daniel Hay,</hi> the Chirurgion, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, and the Trumpeter: All which (following the ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt,</hi> who had his ſonne with him) came aland vnarmed. But the Sauages ran away as

faſt as euer they could, though they were aboue three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, beſides them that were hidden in the graſſe (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their cuſtome) which appeared not. Wherein is to be noted how God fixeth, I know not what terror in the face of the faithfull, againſt infidels and miſcreants, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſacred word, when he ſaith to his choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <note place="margin">

               <p>Whileſt that <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> was comming aſhore, there was ſhot from the Barke ſome ſmall caſt pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vpon ſome Sauages, that were vpon a little hill, and ſome of them were ſeene fall downe, but they be ſo nimble in ſauing their dead men, that one knew not what iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">The burying of the dead.</note>to make of it. The ſaid <hi>Monſieur de Poutrincourt,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could get nothing by purſuing of them, cauſed pits to be made to bury them that were dead, which I haue ſaid to be two, but there was one that died at the waters ſide, thinking to ſaue himſelfe, and a fourth man which was ſo ſorely wounded with arrow ſhots, that hee died being brought to Port Royall; the fifth man had an arrow ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his breſt, yet did ſcape death for that time: But it had beene better he had died there: for one hath lately tolde vs that he was hanged in the habitation that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur De Monts</hi> maintaineth at <hi>Kebeck</hi> in the great riuer of <note place="margin">Conſpiracy.</note>Canada, hauing beene the author of a conſpiracy made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Captaine <hi>Monſieur Champlein,</hi> which is now there.

               <p>In this bad occurrence, <hi>Monſieur Du Ponts</hi> Sonne, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue named, had three of his fingers cut off, with a ſplint of a musket, which being ouer charged did burſt, which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the company very much, that was afflicted enough by other occaſions: Neuertheleſſe the laſt dutie towards the dead was not neglected, which were buried at the foot of the Croſſe that had beene there planted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is before ſaid. <note place="margin">The inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Sauages.</note>But the inſolencie of this Barbarous people was great, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the murthers by them committed; for that as our men did ſing ouer our dead men, the funerall ſeruice and praiers accuſtomed in the church, theſe raskals, I ſay, did dance and howled a far off, reioycing for their traiterous treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and therefore, though they were a great number, they <note place="margin">The timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſſe of the Sauages.</note>aduentured not themſelues to come and aſſaile our people, who, hauing at their leaſure done what we haue ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe the ſea waxed very low, retired themſelues vnto the Barke, wherein remained <hi>Monſieur Champdorè,</hi> for the gard thereof.

During theſe attempts, the Sauages (thinking, I beleeue, that that which had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betweene vs was but a ieſt and a play) would needs come againe familiarly vnto vs, and offered to truck, diſſembling that they were not them that had done thoſe villanies, but others, which, they ſaid, were gone away. But they were not aware of the fable, how the <hi>Storke</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken among the <hi>Cranes,</hi> which were found doing ſome dammage, was puniſhed as the others, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhe pleaded that ſhe was ſo far from doing any harme, that contrariwiſe ſhe did purge the ground from Serpents, which ſhe did eat. <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> then ſuffered <note place="margin">The ſhelles of mother of pearles.</note>them to approch, and made as though he would accept of their wares, which were Tabacco, Carkenets and brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets made with the ſhels of a fiſh called <hi>Vignaux</hi> (and <hi>Eſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gni</hi>

And as the ſociety was renued the ſaid <hi>Poutrincourt</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <note place="margin">Stratagem.</note>to nine or ten that were with him, to make the matches of their Muskets round, like to a round ſnare, and that when he ſhould giue a ſigne, euery one ſhould caſt his ſtring vpon the Sauages head that ſhould be neere him, and ſhould catch him, euen as the hangman doth with him that he hath in hand: And for the effecting of this, that halfe of his people ſhould goe aland, whileſt the Sauages were buſie a trucking in the ſhaloup: which was done; but the execution was not altogether according to his deſire. For he intended to ſerue himſelfe with them that ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as of ſlaues to grind at the hand-mill and to cut wood; wherein they failed by ouer much haſte. Neuertheleſſe ſix <note place="margin">Reuenge.</note>or ſeuen of them were cut in peeces, which could not ſo well run in the water as on the land, and were watched at the paſſage, by thoſe of our men that were aland.</p>
               <p>That done, the next day they indeuored to goe farther, although the winde was not good, but they went but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle forward, and ſaw onely an Iland ſix or ſeuen leagues off, to which there was no meanes to come, and it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>L'ile douteuſe,</hi> the doubtfull Ile, which being conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note place="margin">L'ile douteuſe.</note>and that of one ſide the want of victuals was to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and of the other that the winter might hinder their courſe, and beſides they had two ſicke men, of whom there was no hope of recouery; counſell being taken it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued <note place="margin">Reſolution for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</note>to returne into Port Royall: <hi>Monſieur De Poutrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> beſides all this, being yet in care for them whom he had left there, ſo they came againe for the third time into Port <hi>Fortunè,</hi> where no Sauage was ſeene.</p>

which was againe broken: in ſuch ſort that being at the mercy of the waues, they arriued in the end, as well as they could among the Ilands of <hi>Norombega</hi> where they mended it. And after their departure from the ſaid Ilands they came <note place="margin">Menane.</note>to <hi>Menane,</hi> an Iland about ſix leagues in length, betweene S. <hi>Croix</hi> and <hi>Port Royall,</hi> where they taried for the winde, which being come ſomewhat fauourable, parting from <note place="margin">Perill.</note>thence new miſchances happened. For the ſhaloup being tied at the Barke, was ſtricken with a ſea ſo roughly, that with her noſe, ſhee brake all the hinder part of the ſaid barke, wherein <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> and others were. And moreouer not being able to get to the paſſage of the <note place="margin">A very ſwift current.</note>ſaid Port Royall, the tide (which runneth ſwiftly in that place) carried them towards the bottom of <hi>Bay Françoiſe,</hi> from whence they came not foorth eaſily, and they were in as great danger as euer they were before, for as much as ſeeking to returne from whence they came, they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues <note place="margin">Perill.</note>carried with the winde and tide towards the Coaſt, which is high rockes and downe fales, where, vnleſſe they had doubled a certaine point that threatned them of wrake they had beene caſt away.

               </argument>
               <p>THe publike reioycing being finiſhed, <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> had a care to ſee his corne, the greateſt part whereof he had ſowed two leagues off from our Fort, vp the riuer <hi>L' Equille:</hi> and the other part about our <note place="margin">The ſtate of Corne.</note>ſaid Fort: and found that which was firſt ſowen very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but not the laſt, that had beene ſowed the ſixth and ten daies of Nouember, which notwithſtanding did grow vnder the ſnow, during Winter, as I haue noted it in my ſowings. It would be a tedious thing to particulariſe all that was done amongſt vs during Winter: as to tell how the <note place="margin">Coales. The vſe of the compaſſe in land voiages.</note>ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> cauſed many times coales to be made, the forge-coale being ſpent: That he cauſed waies to be made thorow the woods: That we went tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Foreſts by the guide of the Compaſſe, and other things of ſuch nature. But I will relate that, for to keepe vs merry and cleanly, concerning victuals, there was an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">The inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Bon temps.</hi>
                  </note>eſtabliſhed at the table of the ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trincourt,</hi> which was named <hi>L' ordre de bon temps,</hi> the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of good time (or the order of mirth) at firſt inuented by <hi>Monſieur Champlein,</hi> wherein they (who were of the ſame

table) were euery one at his turne and day (which was in fifteene daies once) Steward and Cater. Now his care was that we ſhould haue good and worſhipfull fare, which was ſo well obſerued, that (although the Belly-Gods of theſe parts doe often reproch vnto vs that we had not <hi>La Rue</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>La Rue aux Ours,</hi> or Beare ſtreet, is, as Pie-corner, or ſuch a Cooke place in London.</note>
                  <hi>aux Ours</hi> of Paris with vs) we haue ordinarily had there, as good cheare as we could haue at <hi>La Rue aux Ours,</hi> and at farre leſſer charges. For there was none, but (two daies before his turne came) was carefull to goe ahunting or fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and brought ſome dainty thing, beſides that which was of our ordinary allowance. So well, that at breakfaſt we neuer wanted ſome modicum or other, of fiſh or fleſh: and at the repaſt of dinners and ſuppers, yet leſſe; for it was the great banquet, where the Gouernour of the feaſt, or Steward (whom the Sauages doe call <hi>Atoctegi)</hi> hauing made the Cooke to make all things ready, did march with his napkin on his ſhoulder, and his ſtaffe of office in his hand, with the colar of the order about his necke, which was worth aboue foure crownes, and all them of the order following of him, bearing euery one a diſh. The like alſo was at the bringing in of the fruit, but not with ſo great a traine. And at night after grace was ſaid, he reſigned the Colar of the order, with a cup of wine, to his ſucceſſor in that charge, and they dranke one to another. I haue heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſaid that we had abundance of fowle, as Mallards, <hi>Outards,</hi> Geeſe, gray and whit, Partriges and other birds: Item, of <hi>Ellans</hi> (or ſtagge fleſh) of <hi>Caribous</hi> (or Deere) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, Otters, Beares, Rabbets, Wilde-cats (or <hi>Leopards) Nibachès</hi> and ſuch like, which the Sauages did take, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we made as good diſhes of meat, as in the Cookes ſhops that be in <hi>La rue aux Ours</hi> (Beare ſtreet) and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtore: for of all meates none is ſo tender as <hi>Ellans</hi> fleſh (whereof we made good paſties) nor ſo delicate as the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerstaile.

them to ſell publikely, and to truck it for bread, <note place="margin">Before in chap. 13.</note>whereof our people had abundantly. And as for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie meat brought out of France, that was diſtributed equally, as much to the leaſt as to the biggeſt. And the like with wine, as we haue ſaid. In ſuch actions we had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies 20. or 30. Sauages, men, women, girles and boies, <note place="margin">The vſage of the Sauages.</note>who beheld vs doing our offices.

But as for the <hi>Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos Membertou</hi> and other <hi>Sagamos</hi> (when any came to vs) they ſat at table eating and drinking as we did: and we tooke pleaſure in ſeeing them, as contrariwiſe their abſence was irkeſome vnto vs: as it came to paſſe three or foure times that all went away to the places where they knew that game and Veniſon was, and brought one of our men with them, who liued ſome ſix weekes as they did without ſalt, without bread and without wine, lying on the ground <note place="margin">The Sauages haue care of the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note>vpon skinnes, and that in ſnowy weather. Moreouer they had greater care of him (as alſo of others that haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten gone with them) than of themſelues, ſaying, that if they ſhould chance to die, it would be laid to their charges to haue killed them: And heereby it may be knowen that we were not (as it were) pent vp in an Iland as <hi>Monſieur De Villegagnon</hi> was in <hi>Brafill.</hi> For this people loue Frenchmen, and would all, at a neede, arme themſelues for to maintaine them.</p>
               <p>But, to vſe no digreſſion, ſuch gouernment as we haue ſpoken of, did ſerue vs for preſeruatiues againſt the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <note place="margin">Mortality.</note>diſeaſe.

Why raines and miſts be ſcarſe in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> We had faire weather almoſt during all the Winter. For neither raines nor fogges are ſo frequent there as heere, whether it be at ſea or on the land: The reaſon is, becauſe the Sunne beames, by the long diſtance, haue not the force to raiſe vp vapours from the ground heere, chiefely in a country all woody. But in Summer it doth, both from the ſea and the land, when as their force is augmented, and thoſe vapours are diſſolued ſuddenly or ſlowly, according as one approcheth to the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> line. For we ſee that <note place="margin">Why it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth between the <hi>Tropiques.</hi>
                  </note>betweene the two <hi>Tropiques</hi> it raineth in more abundance both at ſea and on the land, ſpecially in <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> than in <hi>Africa,</hi> becauſe the Sunne by ſo long ſpace of ſea, hauing drawen vp much moiſtnes from the maine Ocean, hee diſſolueth them in a moment by the great force of his heat; where contrariwiſe towards the New found lands they maintaine themſelues along time in the aire, before they be turned into raine or be diſperſed: which is done in Summer (as we haue ſaid) and not in winter: and at ſea more than on the land. For on the land the morning miſts ſerue for a dew, and fall about eight a clocke: and at ſea they dure two, three, and eight daies, as oftentimes wee haue tried.</p>
               <p>Seeing then wee are ſpeaking of Winter, wee ſay that raines being in thoſe parts rare, in that ſeaſon, the Sunne likewiſe ſhineth there very faire, after the fall of ſnowes, which we haue had ſeuen or eight times, but it is eaſily melted in open places, and the longeſt abiding haue beene <note place="margin">Snow is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</note>in February.

For as that winter was as milde in theſe parts, theſe laſt Winters of the yeares 1607. 1608. haue beene the hardeſt that euer was ſeene; it hath alſo been a like in thoſe countries, in ſuch ſort that many Sauages di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the rigor of the weather, as in theſe our parts many poore people &amp; trauellers haue been killed through the ſame hardneſſe of Winter weather.

Pilchers.</note> then was needfull vnto vs for our ſuſtenance. <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> made two Hogſheads full of them to bee ſalted, and one hogſhead of <hi>Sardines,</hi> or Pilchers to bring into France for a ſhew, which were left in our returne at S. <hi>Maloes,</hi> to ſome Merchants.</p>
               <p>Among all theſe things the ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Poutrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> did not neglect to thinke on his returne. Which was the part of a wiſeman, for one muſt neuer put ſo much truſt in mens promiſes, but one muſt conſider that very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten many diſaſters doe happen to them in a ſmall moment <note place="margin">Preparation for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.</note>of time. And therefore, euen in the Moneth of Aprill, he made two Barkes to be prepared, a great one and a ſmall one, to come to ſeeke out French-ſhips towards <hi>Campſeau,</hi> or New-found-land, if it ſhould happen that no ſupply ſhould come vnto vs. But the Carpentry-worke being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, one onely inconuenience might hinder vs, that is, <note place="margin">Great ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight. <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt</hi> his inuention.</note>we had no pitch to calke our veſſels. This (which was the chiefeſt thing) was forgotten at our departure from <hi>Rochel.</hi> In this important neceſſity, the ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Poutrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> aduiſed himſelfe to gather in the woods quantity of the gumme iſſuing from Firre-trees. Which he did with much labour, going thither himſelfe, moſt often with a boy or two: ſo that in the end he got ſome hundred pounds weight of it. Now after theſe labours, it was not yet all, for it was needfull to melt and purifie the ſame, which was a neceſſary point and vnknowen to our ſhip-Maſter <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur De Champ-dorè,</hi> and to his Mariners, for as much as, that the pitch we haue, commeth from <hi>Norwege, Suedland,</hi>

the ſaid lembeckemelted, and dropped downe into a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but it was needfull to be very watchfull at it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that if the fire had taken hold of the gum, all had beene loſt. That was admirable, eſpecially in a man that neuer ſaw any made. Whereof the Sauages being aſtonied did ſay, in words borrowed from the Baſques, <hi>Endia chauè</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Why the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages call all French men Normands.</note>
                  <hi>Normandia,</hi> that is to ſay, that the Normands know many things. Now they call all Frenchmen Normands, except the Baſques, becauſe the moſt part of fiſhermen that goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhing there, be of that nation. This remedy came very fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto vs, for thoſe which came to ſeeke vs were fallen into the ſame want that we were.</p>
               <p>Now, as he which is in expectation hath neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment nor reſt vntill he hath that which he deſireth; likewiſe our men, in this ſeaſon had often their eies vpon the great compaſſe of Port Royall, to ſee if they might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer any ſhip a comming; wherein they were oftentimes deceiued, imagining ſometimes they had heard a Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, other while to perceiue a ſaile: and very often taking the Sauages boates, that came to ſee vs, for French ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loups.

               </argument>
               <p>THe Sunne did but begin to cheere the earth, and to behold his Miſtres with an amorous aſpect, when the <hi>Sagamos Membertou</hi> (after our praiers ſolemnely made to God, and the break-faſt diſtributed to the people, according to the cuſtom) came to giue vs aduertiſment that he had ſeene a ſaile vpon the lake, which came towards our <note place="margin">The old Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages haue good ſight.</note>Fort. At this ioyfull newes euery one went out to ſee, but yet none was found that had ſo good a ſight as he, though he be aboue 100. yeeres old; neuertheleſſe we ſpied very ſoone what it was. <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt,</hi> cauſed in all diligence the ſmall Barke to be made ready for to goe to view further. <hi>Monſieur De Champ-dorè</hi> and <hi>Daniel Hay</hi> went in her, and by the ſigne that had beene told them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certaine that they were friends, they made preſently to <note place="margin">Salutations by Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhots.</note>be charged foure Canons &amp; 12. fawkonnets, to ſalute them that came ſo far to ſee vs. They on their part did not faile in beginning the ioy, &amp; to diſcharge their peeces, to whom they rendered the like with vſury. It was onely a ſmall barke vnder the charge of a yong man of Saint <hi>Maloes,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Cheualier,</hi> who being arriued at the Fort, deliuered his letters to <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt,</hi> which were read

publikely. <q>They did write vnto him, that for to helpe to <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tents of the letters written to <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt.</hi>
                     </note> ſaue the charges of the voyage, the ſhip (being yet the <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas)</hi> ſhould ſtay at <hi>Campſeau</hi> Port, there to fiſh for Coddes, by reaſon that the Merchants aſſociate with <hi>Monſieur De Monts,</hi> knew not that there was any fiſhing farther than that place: Notwithſtanding if it were neceſſary he ſhould cauſe the ſhip to come to Port Royall. Moreouer, that the <note place="margin">The Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur De Monts</hi> broken, and why.</note>ſociety was broken, becauſe that contrary to the King his Edict, the Hollanders, conducted by a traiterous French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, called <hi>La Ieuneſſe,</hi> had the yeare before taken vp the Beuers and other Furres, of the great riuer of <hi>Canada;</hi> a thing which did turne to the great dammage of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which for that cauſe could no longer furniſh the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the vnhabiting in theſe parts, as it had done in times paſt.</q> And therefore did ſend no body for to remaine there, after vs. As we receaued ioy to ſee our aſſured ſuccour, we felt alſo great griefe to ſee ſo faire and ſo holy an enterpriſe broken: That ſo many labours and perils paſt ſhould ſerue to no effect: and that the hope of planting the name of <note place="margin">Monſieur De Poutrincourt. <hi>his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </note>God and the Catholike faith ſhould vaniſh away.

               <p>It was great griefe vnto vs to abandon (without hope of returne) a land that had produced vnto vs ſo faire Corne, <note place="margin">The Engliſh nation going to Virginia with a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous intent to plant true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and ſo to <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">

All that could be done vntill that time, was to finde out a place, fit to make a ſetled dwelling, and a land of good fertility. And that being done, it was great want of courage to giue ouer the enterpriſe, for another yeare being paſſed, the neceſſity of maintaining an habitation there, ſhould be taken away, for the land was ſufficient to yeeld things neceſſary for life. This was the cauſe of that griefe which pierced the hearts of them which were deſirous to ſee the Chriſtian Religion eſtabliſhed in that country. But on the contrary, <hi>Monſieur De Monts,</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:9921:71"/>
and his aſſociates, reaping no benefit, but loſſe, and hauing no helpe from the King, it was a thing which they could not doe, but with much difficulty to maintaine an habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in thoſe parts.</p>

                  </note> Now this enuy for the trade of Beuers with the Sauages, found not onely place in the Hollanders hearts, but alſo in French Merchants, in ſuch ſort that the priuiledge which had beene giuen to the ſaid <hi>Monſieur De Monts</hi> for ten yeares, was reuoked. The vnſatiable auarice of men is a ſtrange thing, which haue no regard to that which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, ſo that they may rifle and catch by what meanes ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. <note place="margin">Robbing from the dead.</note>And thereupon I will ſay moreouer, that there haue beene ſome of them that came to that country to fetch vs home, that wickedly haue preſumed ſo much as to ſtrip the dead, and ſteale away the Beuers, which thoſe poore people doe put, for their laſt benefit, vpon them whom they bury, as we will declare more at large in the booke following. A thing that maketh the French name to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, &amp; worthy diſdain among them, which haue no ſuch ſordide quality at all, but rather hauing a heart truly noble <note place="margin">The Sauages be of a noble minde.</note>and generous, hauing nothing in priuate to themſelues, but rather all things common, and which ordinarily doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent gifts (and that very liberally, according to their ability) to them whom they loue and honor. And beſides this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, it came to paſſe that the Sauages, when that we were at <hi>Campſeau,</hi> killed him that had ſhewed them the Sepulchers of their dead. I need not to alleage heere what <hi>Herodote</hi> reciteth of the vile baſeneſſe of King <hi>Darius,</hi> who thinking to haue caught the old one in the neſt (as ſaith the prouerbe) that is to ſay, great treaſures, in the Tombe of <note place="margin">The faire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis.</hi>

               <p>From thence forward we had winde at will, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time it happened once, that being vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, I cried out to our Pilote <hi>Monſieur De Champdore,</hi> that we were ready to ſtrike, thinking I had ſeene the bottome of the ſea; but I was deceiued by the Raine-bow which did <note place="margin">The Raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the water.</note>appeare with all his colours in the water, procured by the ſhadow, that our boareſpright ſaile did make ouer the ſame, being oppoſite to the Sunne, which aſembling his beames, within the hollowneſſe of the ſame ſaile, as it doth within the clouds, thoſe beames were forced to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerberation in the water, and to ſhew foorth this wonder. In the end we arriued within foure leagues of <hi>Campſeau,</hi> at a Port, where a good old man of Saint Iohn <hi>De Lus,</hi> called Captaine <hi>Saualet,</hi> receiued vs with all the kindneſſe in the world.

               <p>We were 4. daies there, by reaſon of the contrary wind. Then came we to <hi>Campſeau,</hi> where we taried for the other Barke, which came two daies after vs. And as for <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur De Poutrincourt,</hi> as ſoone as he ſaw that the corne

For if one enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the conſideration of his face, two ſhall not be found who in euery reſpect doe reſemble one another: If he bee conſidered in the voice, the ſame variety ſhall be found: If in the ſpeech, all Nations haue their proper and peculiar language, whereby one is diſtinguiſhed from the other. But in maners and faſhion of life, there is a maruellous difference, which (without troubling

our ſelues in croſsing the Seas to haue the experience thereof) we ſee viſibly in our very neighborhood. Now foraſmuch as it is a ſmall matter to know, that people differ from vs in cuſtomes and maners, vnles we know the particularities thereof; a ſmall thing is it likewiſe to know, but that, which is neere to vs: but the faire Science is to know the maner of life of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World, for which reaſon <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> hath beene eſteemed, becauſe he had ſeene much and knowen much.

For ſome haue wept, ſeeing the birth of man vpon this worldly Theater. Others haue reioyced at it, as well becauſe Nature hath giuen to euery creature a deſire to preſerue his owne kinde, as for that, Man hauing beene made mortall by ſinne, he deſireth to bee in ſome ſort reſtored againe to that loſt right of immortality, and to leaue ſome viſible image iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, by the generation of children.

As for our Sauages of New France, when that I was there, thinking nothing leſſe than on this Hiſtory, I tooke not heed of many things which I might haue obſerued: But yet I remember, that as a woman was deliuered of her child they came into our Fort, to demand very inſtantly for ſome greaſe or oyle to make the child to ſwallow it downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they giue him the dugge or any food: they can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no reaſon for this, but that it is a cuſtome of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. Whereupon I coniecture that the diuell (who hath alwaies borrowed ceremonies from the Church, as well in the ancient as in the new law) would, that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (ſo doe I call them that beleeue not in God, and are out of the Communion of Saints) ſhould be anointed like to Gods people: which vnction he hath made to be inward, becauſe the ſpirituall vnction of the Chriſtians is ſo.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the impoſition of names.</head>
               <p>AS for impoſition of names, they giue them by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is to ſay, they haue great quantity of names, which they chuſe and impoſe on their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. <note place="margin">The dignity of elderſhip or firſt borne.</note>But the eldeſt ſonne commonly beareth his fathers name, adding at the end ſome diminutiue: as the eldeſt of <hi>Membertou</hi> ſhall be called <hi>Membertouchis,</hi> as it were the leſſer, or the yonger <hi>Membertou.</hi> As for the yonger Son, he beareth not the Fathers name, but they giue him ſuch name as they liſt: And hee that is borne after him ſhall beare his name, adding a ſyllable to it: as the yonger of <hi>Membertou</hi> is called <hi>Actaudin,</hi> he that commeth after is called <hi>Actaudinech.</hi> So <hi>Memembourré</hi> had a ſonne named
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:9921:81"/>
                  <hi>Semcoud,</hi> and his yonger was called <hi>Semcoudech.</hi> It is not for all that a generall rule, to adde this termination <hi>ech.</hi> For <hi>Panoniacs</hi> yonger Sonne (of whom mention is made in <hi>Membertous</hi> warre againſt the <hi>Armouchiquois,</hi> which I haue deſcribed in the Muſes of New France) was called <hi>Panouiagués:</hi> ſo that this termination is done according as the former name requireth it. But they haue a cuſtome <note place="margin">The chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of names.</note>that when this elder brother, or father, is dead, they change name, for to auoid the ſorrow that the remembrance of the deceaſſed might bring vnto them. This is the cauſe why, after the deceaſe of <hi>Memembourré, &amp; Semcoud,</hi> (that died this laſt Winter) <hi>Semcoudech</hi> hath left his brothers name, and hath not taken that of his father, but rather hath made himſelfe to be called <hi>Paris,</hi> becauſe he dwelt in <hi>Paris.</hi> And after <hi>Panoniacs</hi> death, <hi>Panoniagues</hi> forſooke his name, and was, by one of our men, called <hi>Roland:</hi> which I finde euill and vndiſcreetly done, ſo to prophane Chriſtians names, and to impoſe them vpon Infidels: as I remember of another that was called <hi>Martin. Alexander</hi> the Great (though he was an Heathen) would not that any ſhould beare his name, vnleſſe he ſhould render himſelfe woorthy thereof by vertue. And, as one day a ſouldier, bearing the name of <hi>Alexander,</hi> was accuſed before him to be voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and lecherous, he commanded him, either to forſake that name, or to change his life.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Braſiliens</hi> (as <hi>Iohn De Leri</hi> ſaith, whom I had rather follow in that which he hath ſeene, than a Spaniard) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe names to their children of the firſt thing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth before them, as if a bow and ſtring come to their imagination, they will call their child <hi>Ourapacen,</hi> which ſignifieth a bow and a ſtring, and ſo conſequently. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our Sauages, they haue at this day names without ſignification, which peraduenture in the firſt impoſing of them, did ſignifie ſome thing, but as the tongues do change the knowledge thereof is loſt. Of all the names of them that I haue knowen, I haue learned none, ſauing that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:9921:82"/>
                  <hi>Chkoudun</hi> ſignifieth a <hi>Trowt:</hi> and <hi>Oigoudi</hi> the name of the riuer of the ſaid <hi>Chkoudun,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>to ſee.</hi> It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certaine, that names haue not beene impoſed, to what thing ſoeuer, without reaſon. For <hi>Adam</hi> gaue the name to euery liuing creature, according to the property and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, and conſequently names haue beene giuen to men ſignifying ſomething: As <hi>Adam</hi> ſignifieth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Among the Romans, ſome were called <hi>Lucius,</hi> becauſe they were born at the breake of day; Others <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for that the Mothers belly was cut at the birth of him that firſt did beare this name: In like maner <hi>Lentulus, Piſo, Fabius, Cicero,</hi> &amp;c. all nick-names, giuen by reaſon of ſome accident, like our Sauages names, but with ſome more iudgement.</p>

But at this day the moſt part make their breſts to ſerue for alurements to whoredome, and being willing to ſet themſelues at eaſe, free from the childrens noiſe, do ſend them into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where peraduenture they be changed or giuen to bad nurſes, whoſe corruption and bad nature they ſucke with their milke. And from thence come the changelings, weake and degenerate from the right ſtocke whoſe names they beare. The Sauage women beare a greater loue than that towards their yong ones: for none but themſelues doe nouriſh them: And that is generall thorowout all the Weſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:9921:82"/>

And for this maner of nurſing their children, are the ancient German women praiſed by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> becauſe that euery one did nurſe their Children with her owne breſts, and would not haue ſuffered that another beſides themſelues ſhould giue ſucke to their children. Now our Sauage women do giue vnto them, with the dugge, meats which they vſe, hauing firſt well chawed them: and ſo by little and little bring them vp. As for the ſwadling of them, they that dwell in hot Countries and neere the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> haue no care of it, but leaue them free vnbound. But draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the North, the mothers haue an euen ſmooth boord, like the couering of a drawer or cupborod, vpon which they lay the child wrapped in a Beauer fur, vnles it be too hot, and tied thereupon with ſome ſwadling band, whom they carry on their backes their legges hanging downe: then being returned into their Cabins they ſet them in this maner vp ſtraight againſt a ſtone or ſome thing elſe.

We haue alreadie ſpoken of this at the end of the 17. chapter. So then I finde that they haue wrong to be called Barbarous, ſeeing that the ancient Romans were far more Brabarous than they, who oftentimes ſold their <note place="margin">The cauſe why the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages loue their children more than we doe in theſe parts.</note>children for to haue meanes to liue. Now that which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to loue their children more than we doe in theſe parts is, that they are the maintenance of their fathers in their old age, whether it be to helpe them to liue, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from their enemies: And nature conſerueth wholly in them her right in this reſpect. By reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that which they wiſh moſt is to haue number of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <note place="margin">Genſ. 2. verſ. 28.</note>to be thereby ſo much the mightier, as in the firſt age of the world, when virginity was a thing reproouable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Gods commandement to man and women to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, multiply and repleniſh the earth: but after it was filled, this loue waxed maruellous cold, and children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be a burthen to fathers and mothers, whom many haue had in diſdaine, and haue verie often procured their <note place="margin">Meanes to eaſe the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of France.</note>death: Now is the way open for France to haue a remedy for the ſame.

               <p>MAn being created after the image of God, it is good reaſon that he acknowledge, ſerue, worſhip, praiſe and bleſſe his Creator, and that therein he imploy his whole deſire, his minde, his ſtrength and his courage. But the nature of man hauing been corrupted by ſinne, this faire light that God had firſt giuen vnto him, hath beene ſo darkned, that he is becom therby to loſe the knowledge of his beginning. And for as much as God ſheweth not himſelf vnto vs by a certaine viſible forme, as a father or a King might doe; man finding himſelfe ouercome with pouerty and infirmity, not ſetling himſelfe to the contemplation of the wonders of this Almighty workman, and to ſeeke him as he ought to be ſought for, with a baſe and brutiſh ſpirit, miſerably hath he forged to himſelfe gods, according to his owne fancy: And there is nothing viſible in the world, but hath beene deified in ſome place or other: yea euen in that rancke and degree, imaginary things hath alſo beene put, as Vertue, Hope, Honour, Fortune, and a thouſand
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:9921:84"/>
ſuch like things: Item infernall gods, and ſickneſſes, and all ſorts of plagues, euery one worſhipping the things that he ſtood in feare of. But notwithſtanding, though <hi>Tuliie</hi> hath ſaid, ſpeaking of the nature of the gods, that there is no nation ſo ſauage, or brutiſh nor ſo barbarous, but is ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſome opinion of them: yet there haue been found, in theſe later ages, nations that haue no feeling thereof at all: which is ſo much the ſtranger that among them, there <note place="margin">Idolaters in <hi>Virginia.</hi>
                  </note>were, and yet are, Idolaters, as in <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>

And beſides, he which is not ſtained with any bad opinion, is much more capable of true adoration, than the other: being like to a bare table, which is ready to receiue what colour ſoeuer one will giue to it. For when any people hath once receiued a bad impreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of doctrine, one muſt roote it out from them before another may be placed in them. Which is very difficult, as well for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of men, which doe ſay, our fathers haue liued in this ſort: as for the hindrance that they giue them which doe teach them ſuch a doctrine, and others whoſe life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth thereupon, who doe feare that their meanes of gain be taken from them: euen as that <hi>Demetrius</hi> the ſiluer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, <note place="margin">Act. 19. verſ. 24.

                  <q>This ſaid people (ſaith he) hath not any beleefe of God <note place="margin">The Saua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada.</note>(that may be eſteemed) for they beleeue in one, whom they call <hi>Cudoüagni,</hi> and ſay, that he often ſpeaketh to them, and telleth them what weather ſhall fall out. They ſay that when he is angry with them hee caſteth duſt in their eies. They beleeue alſo, that when they die they goe <note place="margin">The ſtate of ſoules after death.</note>vp into the ſtarres, and afterwards they goe into faire greenefields, full of faire trees, flowers and rare fruits. After they had made vs to vnderſtand theſe things, wee ſhewed them their error, and that their <hi>Cudoüagni</hi> is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Spirit that deceiueth them, and that there is but one God, which is in Heauen, who doth giue vnto vs all, and is Creator of all things, and that in him we muſt onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and that they muſt be baptiſed, or goe into hell. And many other things of our faith were ſhewed them: which <note place="margin">People ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be conuerted. <hi>Agoiuda</hi> ſignifieth wicked.</note>they eaſily beleeued, and called their <hi>Cudoüagni, Agoiuda.</hi> So that many times they requeſted our Captaine to cauſe them to be baptized, and the ſaid Lord (that is to ſay, <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacona) Taiguragni, Domagaia,</hi> with all the people of their towne came thither for that purpoſe: but becauſe we knew not their intent and deſire, and that there was no body to inſtruct them in the faith, wee excuſed our ſelues to them for that time, and bad <hi>Taiguragni</hi> and <hi>Domagaia</hi> to make them vnderſtand that we would returne another voyage, and would bring Prieſts with vs and <hi>Chréme,</hi> telling them, for an excuſe, that one cannot be baptized without the ſaid <hi>Chréme,</hi> which they did beleeue.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:9921:85"/>
things, which I haue thought good (being incident to <note place="margin">The Saua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges beleefe and faith.</note> this matter) to inſert heere; his words are theſe: <q>The moſt part of them be people without law, according as I could ſee and informe my ſelfe, by the ſaid great <hi>Sagamos,</hi> who told mee that they verily beleeue there is one God, who hath created all things. And then I asked him, ſeeing that they beleeue in one onely God: by what meanes did hee place them in this world, and from whence they were <note place="margin">Of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of man.</note>come? He anſwered mee, that after God had made all things, he tooke a number of arrowes, and did ſticke them into the ground, from whence men and women ſprung vp, which haue multiplied in the world vntill now, and that mankinde grew by that meanes. I anſwered him, that what he ſaid was falſe: But that indeed there was one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, who had created all things both in Heauen and Earth. Seeing all theſe things ſo perfect, and being no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that did gouerne in this world, he tooke ſlime out of the Earth, and created thereof our firſt father <hi>Adam:</hi> And while he did ſleepe, God tooke one of his ribes, and formed <hi>Euah</hi> thereof, whom hee gaue to him for company, and that this was the truth that both they and we were made <note place="margin">They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue one God, one Sonne, one Mother, and the Sunne.</note>by this meanes, and not of arrowes, as they did beleeue. He ſaid nothing more to me, but that he allowed better of my ſpeech than of his owne. I asked him alſo if he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not that there were any other but one onely God? He ſaid vnto me that their beleefe was: There was one onely God, one Sonne, one Mother, and the Sunne, which were foure. Notwithſtanding, that God was ouer and aboue all; but that the Sonne was good, and the Sunne, by reaſon of the good which they receiued of them: As for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhee was naught and did eat them; and that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not very good. I ſhewed him his error according to our faith, whereunto he gaue ſome credit. I demanded of him if they neuer ſaw nor heard their anceſtors ſay that God was come into the world: He told me hee had not ſeene him: but that anciently there were fiue men, who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:9921:85"/>
towards the ſetting of the Sunne, met with God, <note place="margin">Of fiue men whom the Sauages beleeue to haue ſeene God. Men trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtones:</note>who demanded of them, Whither go yee? They anſwered, We goe to ſeeke for our liuing: God anſwered them, You ſhall finde it heere. But they paſſed further, not making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny account of that which God had ſaid vnto them; who tooke a ſtone and therewith touched two of them, who were turned into ſtones: And he ſaid againe to the three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Whither goe yee? and they anſwered as at the firſt time: and God ſaid vnto them a gaine, Paſſe no further, you ſhall finde it heere: and ſeeing that they found no <note place="margin">And into ſtaues.</note>food they paſſed further: And God tooke two ſtaues, and touched therewith the two formoſt, who were transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into ſtaues. But the fift man ſtaied and would paſſe no further: And God asked him againe, Whither goeſt thou? Who made anſwer, I go to ſeeke for my liuing: and God told him, Tarry and thou ſhalt finde it: and he ſtaied without paſſing any further: And God gaue him meat, and he did eat of it: and after he had made good cheare he returned among the other Sauages, and told them all that you haue heard. He alſo told me, that at another time there was a man who had ſtore of <hi>Tabacco</hi> (which is an hearbe <note place="margin">Of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man whom the Sauages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue to haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with God. Tabacco.</note>the ſmoke whereof they take) and that God came to this man and asked him where his pipe was: The man tooke his Tabacco pipe and gaue it to God, who dranke very much <hi>Tabacco.</hi> After he had taken well of it, God brake the ſaid Tabacco-pipe into many peeces, and the man as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, Why haſt thou broken my Tabacco-pipe, and thou ſeeſt well that I haue none other? And God tooke one which he had, and gaue it him, ſaying vnto him: Lo, heere is one which I giue to thee, carry it to thy great <hi>Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> let him keepe it; and if he keepe it wel, he ſhall not want any thing, nor any of his companions: The ſaid man tooke the Tabacco-pipe, which he gaue to his great <hi>Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> who (whileſt he had it) the Sauages wanted for nothing in the world: But that ſince the ſaid <hi>Sagamo</hi> had loſt this Tabacco-pipe, which is the cauſe of the great famine
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:9921:86"/>
which ſometimes they haue among them. I demanded of him, whether he did beleeue all that; he told me, yes, &amp; that it was true. Now I beleeue that that is the cauſe why they ſay that God is not very good. But I replied and ſaid vnto him, that God was all good, and that without doubt it was the Diuell that had ſhewed himſelfe to thoſe men, and that if they did beleeue in God as we doe, they ſhould want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſhould be needfull for them: That the Sunne which they ſaw, the Moone and the Starres, were created by the ſame great God, who hath made both Heauen and Earth, and that they haue no power, but that which God <note place="margin">I doe not thinke that this Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy may be expounded to theſe people, though one could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſpeak their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</note>hath giuen them: That we beleeue in that great God, who by his goodneſſe did ſend vnto vs his dearely beloued Son, who being conceiued by the Holy Ghoſt, tooke humane fleſh within the virgin wombe of the Virgin Mary, hauing been 33. yeeres on earth working infinit miracles, raiſing vp the dead, healing the ſicke, driuing out Diuels, giuing ſight to the blinde, ſhewing vnto men the wil of God his Father, for to ſerue, honour and worſhip him, hath ſpilled his bloud, and ſuffered death and paſſion for vs, and for our ſinnes, and redeemed mankind, being buried and riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, went downe into hell, and aſcended vp into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, where he ſitteth at the right hand of God his father. That this was the beleefe of all Chriſtians, which doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in the Father, in the Sonne, and in the holy Ghoſt, which be not for all that three Gods, but are one ſelfeſame and one onely God, and one Trinity, wherein there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before nor after, nothing greater nor leſſer. That the Virgin Mary, Mother to the Sonne of God, and all men and women that haue liued in this world, doing Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and ſuffered Martyrdome for his name, and who, by the permiſſion of God, haue wrought miracles, and are Saints in Heauen in his Paradiſe, pray all for vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this great diuine Maieſtie, to pardon vs our faults and ſinnes, which we do againſt his law and commandements: And ſo by the Saints praiers in Heauen, and by our owne
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:9921:86"/>
that we make to his diuine Maieſtie, he giueth vs what we haue need of, and the Diuell hath no power ouer vs; and can doe vs no hurt. That if they had this beleefe they ſhould be eue as we are. That the Diuell ſhould not be able to doe them any more harme, and they ſhould not want what ſhould be needfull for them. Then the ſaid <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamo</hi> ſaid vnto mee, that he granted all that I ſaid. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him what ceremony they vſed in praying to their God: he told me that they vſed no other ceremony, but that euery one did pray in his heart as he would. This is the cauſe why, I beleeue, there is no law among them, neither doe they know what it is to worſhip or pray to God, and liue the moſt part as brute beaſts: And I beleeue that in ſhort time they might be brought to be good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, if one would inhabit their land, which moſt of them doe deſire. They haue among them ſome Sauages whom <note place="margin">What Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages ſpeake to the Diuell.</note>they call <hi>Pilotoua,</hi> who ſpeake viſibly to the Diuell, and he telleth them what they muſt doe, as well for warres as for other things: And if he ſhould command them to goe and put any enterpriſe in execution, or to kill a French man or any other of their nation, they will immediately obey to <note place="margin">The Saua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in dreames.</note>his command. They beleeue alſo that all their dreames are true; and indeed, there be many of them which doe ſay that they haue ſeene and dreamed things that doe happen, or ſhall come to paſſe: but to ſpeake thereof in truth they be viſions of the Diuell, who doth deceiue and ſeduce them.</q> So farre <hi>Monſieur Champleins</hi> report. As for our <hi>Souriquois,</hi> and other their neighbours, I can ſay nothing elſe, but that they are deſtitute of all knowledge of God, haue no Adoration, neither doe they make any diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, liuing in a pitifull ignorance; which ought to touch the hearts both of Chriſtian Princes, and Prelates, who ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">A leſſon for Chriſtian Princes and Prelates.</note>often doe employ vpon friuolous things that which would be more than ſufficient to eſtabliſh there many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, which would beare their names, about whom theſe poore people would flocke and aſſemble themſelues. I do
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:9921:87"/>
not ſay they ſhould goe thither in Perſon, for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is heere more neceſſary, and beſides euery one is not fit for the Sea: but there are ſo many perſons well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that would imploy themſelues on that, if they had the meanes: They then that may doe it are altogether vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable. <note place="margin">To all ſorts and degrees of people.</note>Our preſent age is fallen, as one might ſay, into an <hi>Astorgie,</hi> wanting both loue and Chriſtian charity, and retaine almoſt nothing of that fire which kindled our Fathers either in the time of our firſt Kings, or in the time of the <hi>Croiſades</hi> for the holy land; yea contrariwiſe if any venture his life, and that little meanes he hath, vpon this generous Chriſtian worke, the moſt part doe mocke him for it, like to the <hi>Salamandre,</hi> which doth not liue in the middeſt of flames, as ſome doe imagine, but is of ſo cold a nature that ſhee killeth them by her coldneſſe. Euery one would runne after treaſures, and would carry them away without paines taking, and afterward to liue frolike; but they come too late for it, and they ſhould haue enough if <note place="margin">Luk. 12. verſ. 31.</note>they did beleeue, as is meet to doe, in him that hath ſaid: <hi>Seeke firſt the kingdome of God, and all theſe things ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto you ouer and aboue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs returne to our Sauages, for whoſe conuerſion it reſteth vnto vs to pray to God that it will pleaſe him to open the meanes to make a plentifull harueſt to the further manifeſtation of the Goſpell: for ours, and generally all thoſe people euen as farre as <hi>Florida</hi> incluſiuely, are very eaſie to be brought to the Chriſtian religion, according as I may coniecture of them which I haue not ſeene, by the diſcourſe of Hiſtories. But I finde that there ſhall be more facility in them of the neerer lands, as from <hi>Cap-Breton</hi> to <hi>Malebarre,</hi> becauſe they haue not any ſhew of religion (for I call not religion vnleſſe there be ſome <hi>Latria</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſeruice) nor tillage of ground (at leaſt as farre as <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uakoet)</hi> which is the chiefeſt thing that may draw men to beleeue as one would, by reaſon-that out from the Earth commeth all that which is neceſſarie for the life, after the

generall vſe we haue of the other Elements. Our life hath chiefely need of meat, drinke and clothing. Theſe people (as one may ſay) haue nothing of all that, for it is not to be called couered, to be alwaies wandring and lodged vnder foure ſtakes, and to haue a skinne vpon their backe: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I call eating and liuing, to eat all at once and ſtarue <note place="margin">The right meanes to bring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages to ones deuotion.

Whoſoeuer then ſhall giue bread and clothing to this people, the ſame ſhall be, as it were, their God, they will beleeue all that he ſhall ſay to them. Euen as the Patriarch Iacob did promiſe to ſerue God if he would giue him bread to eat and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to couer him.

They hold that the woman was firſt made, which by coniunction with one of the gods had children. All theſe people doe generally beleeue the immortality of the ſoule, and that after death good men are in reſt, and the wicked in paine: Now them that they eſteeme to be the wicked are their enemies, and they the good men: In ſuch ſort that, in their opinion, they ſhall all after death be well at eaſe, and ſpecially when

Item, that yeare that the Engliſh men were there, it came to paſſe within 60. leagues off from them (as ſaid the <hi>Virginians)</hi> that a body was vnburied, like to the firſt, and did ſhew, that being dead in the pit, his ſoule was aliue, and had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled very farre, thorow a long and large way, on both ſides of which did grow very faire and pleaſant trees, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the rareſt fruits that can be ſeene: and that in the end he came to very faire houſes, neere to the which he found his father, which was dead, who expreſly commanded him to returne backe and to declare vnto his frinds the good which it behooued them to doe for to enioy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this place: And that after he had done his meſſage <note place="margin">Hiſt. gen. of the Indies. 4. booke, the 124. chap.</note>he ſhould come thither againe. The generall Hiſtory of the Weſt Indies reporteth, that before the comming of the Spaniards into <hi>Perou,</hi> they of <hi>Cuſco</hi> and thereabout, did likewiſe beleeue the reſurrection of the bodies. For ſeeing that the Spaniards, with a curſed auarice, opening the ſepulchers for to haue the gold and the riches that were in them, did caſt and ſcatter the bones of the dead heere and there, they praied them, not to ſcatter them ſo, to the end that the ſame ſhould not hinder them from riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: which is a more perfect beleefe than that of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and of the Greekes, which the Goſpell and the <note place="margin">Luc. 20. verſ. 27.

Some of our Weſterne Indians, expecting this reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, haue eſteemed that the ſoules of the good did got into heauen, &amp; them of the wicked into a great pit or hole, which they thinke to be far off towards the Sunne ſetting, which they call <hi>Popoguſſo,</hi> there to burne for euer: and ſuch is the beleefe of the <hi>

Many of the ancient Chriſtians, grounded vpon certaine places of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> of <hi>S.

But ſuch opinions haue beene reiected by the reſolution of the Doctours of <hi>Sorbone</hi> in the time of King Philip the faire, and ſince by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Florence.</hi> Now if the Chriſtians haue held that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is it much to theſe poore Sauages to bee entred in thoſe opinions that we haue recited of them?</p>
               <p>As concerning the worſhipping of their gods, of all them that be out of the Spaniſh dominion, I finde none but the <hi>Virginians</hi> that vſe any diuine ſeruice (vnleſſe we will alſo comprehend therein, that which the <hi>Floridians</hi> doe, which we will recite heereafter) They then repreſent their gods in the ſhape of a man, which they call <hi>Kevuaſovuock.</hi> One onely is named <hi>Kevuas.</hi> They place them in houſes and Temples, made after their faſhion, which they call <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicómuck,</hi> wherein they make their praiers, ſinging and <note place="margin">

And <note place="margin">Plin. lib. 2. cap. 7.</note>indeed <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith: <hi>That there is nothing which ſheweth more the weakneſſe of mans wit, than to ſeeke to aſſigne ſome image or figure to God.

ſauing that when they goe to warie, the <hi>Paracouſi</hi> maketh ſome praier to the Sunne for to obtaine victory, and which being obtained he yeeldeth him praiſes for it, with ſongs to the honour of him, as I haue more particularly ſpoken in my firſt booke the 10. chapter.

                  <hi>Monſieur De Belleforeſt</hi> writeth to haue taken from the ſaid Hiſtory that which he mentioneth of their bloudie ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, like to them of the <hi>Mexicains,</hi> aſſembling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in one field, and ſetting vp there their lodges, where after many dances and ceremonies, they lift vp in the aire and offer to the Sunne, him vpon whom the lot is fallen to be ſacrificed. If he bee bold in this thing, he preſumeth no leſſe where he writeth the like of the people of <hi>Canada,</hi> whom he maketh ſacrificers of humane bodies, although they neuer thought on it. For if Captaine <hi>Iames Quartier</hi> hath ſeen ſome of their enemies heads, dreſſed like leather, ſet vpon peeces of wood, it doth not follow that they haue beene ſacrificed, but it is their cuſtome to doe ſo, like to the ancient Gaulois, that is to ſay, to take off the heads of their enemies whom they haue killed, and to ſet them vp in, or without their Cabins as a Trophee: which is vſuall thorow all the Weſt Indies.</p>
               <p>To returne to our <hi>Floridians,</hi> if any one will call the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they doe to the Sunne, to be an act of religion, I will not contrary him. For in the old time of the golden age, when that ignorance found place amongſt men, many (conſidering the admirable effects of the Sunne and of the Moone, wherewith God vſeth to gouerne things in this low world) attributed vnto them the reuerence due to the Creator: And this maner of reuerence is expounded vnto <note place="margin">Iob 31. verſ. 26. 27.</note>vs by <hi>Iob,</hi> when he ſaith: <hi>If I haue beholden the Sunne in his brightneſſe, and the Moone running cleere: and if my heart hath been ſeduced in ſecret, and my mouth hath kiſſed my hand: this alſo had beene an iniquity to be condemned: for I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the great God aboue.</hi> As for the hand kiſſing it is a kind of reuerence which is yet obſerued in doing homages.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:9921:90"/>
Not being able to touch the Sunne, they ſtretch forth their hands towards it, then kiſſed it: or they touched his Idoll, and afterwards did kiſſe the hand that had touched it. And into this idolatry did the people of Iſrael ſometime fall, as we ſee in <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ezech 8. ver. 16. Braſilians.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In regard of the <hi>Braſilians,</hi> I finde by the diſcourſe of <hi>Iohn De Leri</hi> (whom I had rather follow than a Spaniſh Authour, in that which he hath ſeene) that not onely they are like vnto ours, without any forme of religion or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, but that they are ſo blind and hardned in their <hi>anthropophagie,</hi> that they ſeeme to be in no wiſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Chriſtian doctrine. Alſo they are viſibly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and beaten by the diuell (which they call <hi>Aignan)</hi> and with ſuch rigor, that when they ſee him come, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the ſhape of a beaſt, ſometimes of a bird, or in ſome ſtrange forme, they are as it were, in deſpaire. Which is not with the other Sauages, more hitherward, towards New-found-land, at leaſt with ſuch rigor. For <hi>Iames Quartier</hi> reporteth that he caſeth earth in their eies, and they call him <hi>Cudoüagni:</hi> &amp; there, where we were (where they call him <hi>Aoutem)</hi> I haue ſometimes heard that he had ſcratched <hi>Membertou,</hi> being then, as it were, a kinde of Soothſaier of the Country. When one tels the <hi>Braſilians</hi> that one muſt beleeue in God, they like that aduice well enough, but by and by they forget their leſſon and returne againe to their owne vomit, which is a ſtrange brutiſhnes, not to be willing at the leaſt to redeeme themſelues from the diuels vexation, by religion Which maketh them vnexcuſable, ſeeing alſo they haue ſome memory remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in them of the generall flood, and of the Goſpell (if it be ſo that their report be true) for they make mention in their ſongs that the waters being once ouerflowne, did couer all the earth, and all men were drowned, except their Grandfathers, who ſaued themſelues vpon the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <note place="margin">In the firſt booke third Chapter.</note>trees of their Country. And of this flood other Saua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, mentioned by me elſe where, haue alſo ſome tradition.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:9921:91"/>
As concerning the Goſpell, the ſaid <hi>de Leri</hi> ſaith, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing once found occaſion to ſhew vnto them the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, and how it is meet to beleeue in God, and their miſerable condition, they gaue eare vnto him with great attention, being all amazed for that which they had heard: and that thereupon, an ancient man, taking vpon him to ſpeake, ſaid, that in truth he had recited won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things vnto them, which made him to call to minde, that which many times they had heard of their Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that of a long time ſithence <hi>a Mair</hi> (that is to ſay, a ſtranger, clothed and bearded like to the Frenchmen) had beene there, thinking to bring them to the obedience of the God which he declared vnto them, and had vſed the like exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them: but that they would not beleeue him. And therefore there came another thither, who, in ſigne of acurſe, gaue them their armours, wherewith ſince they haue killed one another: and that there was no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood they ſhould forſake that maner of life, becauſe that all their neighbour Nations would mocke them for it.</p>
               <p>But our <hi>Souriquois, Canadians</hi> and their neighbours are not ſo hardened in their wicked life, no neither the <hi>Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> nor <hi>Floridians,</hi> but will receiue the Chriſtian doctrine very eaſily, when it ſhall pleaſe God to ſtirre vp them that be able to ſuccour them, neither are they viſibly tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, beaten and torne by the Diuell, as this barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Braſil,</hi> which is a ſtrange malediction, more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular vnto them, than to other Nations of thoſe parts. Which maketh me beleeue that the voice of the Apoſtles may haue reached ſo farre, according to the ſaying of the ſaid old ancient man, to which hauing ſtopped their eares, they beare a particular puniſhment for it, not common to others, which peraduenture haue neuer heard the word of God, ſince the vniuerſall floud, whereof all thoſe Nations, in more than three thouſand leagues of ground haue an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure knowledge, which hath beene giuen them by traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from father to ſonne.</p>

hauing knowen their nakedneſſe, deſtitute of clothes, did <note place="margin">Genſ. 3.</note>ſow figge leaues together for to hide their ſhame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: But God made vnto them coates of skinnes, and clothed them with it; and this before they went out of the garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Eden.</hi> Clothing then is not only to defend vs from cold, but alſo for decencie, and to couer our ſhame. And neuertheleſſe many nations haue anciently liued, and at this day doe liue naked, without apprehenſion of this ſhame, decencie, and honeſtie. And I maruell not of the <hi>Braſilien</hi> Sauages that are ſuch, as well men as women, nor of the ancient Picts (a nation of great Britaine) who <hi>(He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodian</hi> ſaith) had not any vſe of clothes, in the time of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus</hi> the Emperour: nor of a great number of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that haue beene and yet are naked: for one may ſay of them, that they be people fallen into a reprobate ſenſe, and forſaken of God: But of Chriſtians which are in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> vnder the great <hi>Negus,</hi> whom we call <hi>Preſter-Ihon;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nakedneſſe of the Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians.</note>which, by the report of the Portingals that haue wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hiſtories of them, haue not their parts which wee call priuie members, any waies couered. But the Sauages of New France and of <hi>Florida,</hi> haue better learned and kept in minde the leſſon of honeſtie, than thoſe of <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> For they couer them with a skinne tied to a latch or gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of leather, which paſſing between their buttocks, ioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the other end of the ſaid latch behind. And for the reſt of their garments, they haue a cloake on their backs, made with many skinnes, whether they be of Otters or of Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: and one only skin, whether it be of <hi>Ellan,</hi> or Stagges skinne, Beare, or Luſerne, which cloake is tied vpward with a leather riband, and they thruſt commonly one arme out, but being in their cabins, they put it off, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be cold: And I cannot better compare it than to pictures that are made of <hi>Hercules,</hi> who killed a lion and put the skinne thereof on his backe. Notwithſtanding they haue more ciuilitie, in that they couer their priuie <note place="margin">The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note>members. As for the women, they differ onely in one

thing, that is, they haue a girdle ouer the skin they haue on: and doe reſemble (without compariſon) the pictures that be made of Saint Iohn Baptiſt. But in Winter they make good Beuer ſleeues, tied behind, which keepe them very warme. And after this maner were the ancient Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans clothed, by the report of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> hauing the moſt part of the body naked.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Armouchiquois</hi> and <hi>Floridians</hi> they haue no furres, but onely ſhamois: yea the ſaid <hi>Armouchiquois</hi> haue very often but a peece of matte vpon their backe, for faſhions ſake, hauing neuertheleſſe their priuie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <note place="margin">Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note>couered. God hauing ſo wiſely prouided for mans infirmitie, that in cold countries he hath giuen furres, and not in the hot, becauſe that otherwiſe men would make no eſteeme of them.

But although that Nature indeuoureth herſelfe alwaies to doe good, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſhee is ſometimes ſhort and forced in her actions, and thereof it commeth that we haue monſters and vgly things, contrary to the ordinary rule of others. Yea euen ſometimes after that nature hath done her office, we helpe by our artes to render that which ſhe hath made, rediculous and miſshapen: As for example, the <hi>Braſilians</hi> are borne as faire as the common ſort of men, but comming out of the wombe, they are made deformed in ſquizing of their noſe, which is the chiefeſt part wherein conſiſteth the beauty of man. True it is that as in certaine Countries
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:9921:102"/>
                  <note place="margin">The Braſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be ſhort noſed.</note> they praiſe the long noſes, in others the hawke noſes, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Braſilians</hi> it is a faire thing to be flat noſed, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo among the Moores of <hi>Africa,</hi> which we ſee to be all of the ſame ſort. And with theſe large noſtrils, the <hi>Braſilians</hi> are accuſtomed to make themſelues yet more deformed by Art, making great holes in their cheekes, and vnder the lower lippe, for to put therein greene ſtones and of other colours, of the bigneſſe of a teſter: ſo that thoſe ſtones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, it is a hideous thing to ſee thoſe people. But in <hi>Florida,</hi> and euery where, on this ſide the <hi>Tropique</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> our Sauages be generally goodly men, as they be in Europe: if there be any ſhort noſed one it is a rare thing. They be of a good ſtature, and I haue ſeene no dwarffes there, nor any that drew neere to it. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (as I haue ſaid elſewhere) in the Mountaines of the <hi>Iroquois,</hi> which are beyond the great fall of the great riuer of <hi>Canada,</hi> there is a certaine Nation of Sauages, little men, valiant and feared euery where, which are more often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailers than defenders. But although that where we dwelt the men be of a good height, neuertheleſſe I haue ſeen none ſo tall as <hi>Monſieur De Poutrincourt,</hi> whoſe taleneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth him very well. I will not ſpeake heere of the <hi>Patagons,</hi> a people which is beyond the riuer of <hi>Plate,</hi> whom <hi>Pighafetta</hi> in his voyage about the world, ſaith to be of ſuch an height, that the taleſt among vs could ſcarſe reach to their girdle.

But I will willingly come to the other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of body of our Sauages, ſeeing the ſubiect cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs thereunto.</p>
               <p>They are all of an Oliue colour, or rather tawny colour, like to the Spaniards, not that they be ſo borne, but being the moſt part of the time naked, they greaſe their bodies, <note place="margin">
                     <p>The colour of the Saua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                     <p>The importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of flies.</p>
                  </note>and doe anoint them ſometimes with oile, for to defend them from the flies, which are very troubleſome, not onely, where we were, but alſo thorow all that new world and euen in <hi>Braſil,</hi> ſo that it is no wonder if <hi>Belzebub</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:9921:102"/>
prince of flies hath there a great Empire. Theſe flies are <note place="margin">The diſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the flies of New France.</note>of a colour drawing towards red, as of corrupted bloud, which maketh me to beleeue that their generation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth but from the rottenneſſe of woods. And indeed we haue tried that the ſecond yeare, being in a place ſomwhat more open, wee haue had fewer of them than at the firſt. They cannot endure great heat, nor winde: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (as in cloſe darke weather) they are very noyſome, by reaſon of their ſtings, which they haue, long for ſo ſmall a body: &amp; they be ſo tender that if one touch them neuer ſo little they are ſquiſed. They begin to come about the 15. <note place="margin">When the flies come in and when they goe out.</note>of Iune, and doe retire themſelues in the beginning of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember. Being in the Port <hi>De Campſeau</hi> in the moneth of Auguſt I haue not ſeene nor felt any one; whereof I did wonder, ſeeing that the nature of the ſoile and of the woods is all one. In September, after that this vermine is gone away, there grow other flies like vnto ours, but they are not troubleſome, and become very bigge. Now our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages <note place="margin">The Sauages remodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the flies.</note>to ſaue themſelues from the ſtinging of theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, rubbe themſelues with certaine greaſes and oiles, as I haue ſaid, which make them foule and of a tawniſh colour. Beſides that alwaies they lie on the ground, or be expoſed to the heat and the wind.</p>
               <p>But there is cauſe of wondering, wherefore the <hi>Braſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and other inhabitants of <hi>America</hi> betweene the two <hi>Tropikes,</hi> are not borne blacke as they of <hi>Africa,</hi> ſeeing that it ſeemeth it is the ſelfeſame caſe, being vnder one and the ſelfeſame parallell and like eleuation of the Sunne. If the Poets fables were ſufficient reaſons for to take away this ſcruple, one might ſay that <hi>Phaeton</hi> hauing done the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh deed in conducting the Charet of the Sunne, onely <hi>Africa</hi> was burned, and the horſes ſet againe in their right courſe, before they came to the New world. But I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">From whence commeth the burning of <hi>Africa.</hi>
                  </note>ſay, that the heat of <hi>Lybia,</hi> being the cauſe of this blackneſſe of men, is ingendred from the great lands ouer which the Sunne paſſeth before it come thither, from
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:9921:103"/>
whence the heat is ſtill carried more abundantly by the ſwift motion of this great Heauenly torch. Whereunto the great ſands of that Prouince doe alſo helpe, which are very capable of thoſe heates, ſpecially not being watered <note place="margin">Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence proceedeth the cooling of America.</note>with ſtore of riuers, as <hi>America</hi> is, which aboundeth in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and brookes as much as any Prouince in the World: which doe giue perpetuall refreſhing vnto it, and makes the region much more temperate: the ground being alſo there more fat, and retaining better the dewes of Heauen, which are there abundantly, and raines alſo, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons abueſaid. For the Sunne finding in the meeting of theſe lands thoſe great moiſtneſſes, he doth not faile to draw a good quantitie of them, and that ſo much the more plentifully, that his force is there great and maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: which makes there continuall raines, eſpecially to them that haue him for their zenith. I adde one great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the Sunne leauing the lands of <hi>Africa,</hi> giueth his beames vpon a moiſt element by ſo long a courſe, that he hath good meanes to ſucke vp vapors, and to draw toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him great quantitie thereof into thoſe parts: which maketh that the cauſe is much differing of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of theſe two people, and of the temperature of their lands.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Black haires.</note> Let vs come to other circumſtances, and ſeeing that we are about colours, I will ſay, that all they which I haue ſeene haue blacke haires, ſome excepted which haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram colour haires: but of flaxen colour I haue ſeene none, and leſſe of red: and one muſt not thinke that they which are more Southerly be otherwiſe: for the <hi>Floridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Braſilians</hi> are yet blacker than the Sauages of New found land. The beard of the chinne (which our Sauages call <hi>migidoni)</hi> is with them as blacke as their haires. They all take away the producing cauſe thereof, except the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamos,</hi> who for the moſt part haue but a little. <hi>Membertou</hi> hath more than all the others, and notwithſtanding it is not thicke, as it is commonly with Frenchmen. If theſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:9921:103"/>
people weare no beards on their chinne (at the leaſt the moſt part) there is no cauſe of maruelling. For the ancient Romans themſelues, eſteeming that that was a hinderance vnto them, did weare none, vntill the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, who firſt began to weare a beard. Which they tooke for ſuch an honour, that a man accuſed of any crime, had not that priuiledge to ſhaue his haires, as may be gathered by the teſtimonie of <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> ſpeaking <note place="margin">A. Gel. li. <hi>3 c. 4.</hi>
                  </note>of <hi>Scipio,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Paul.</hi> As for the inferiour parts, our Sauages doe not hinder the growing or increaſing of haires there. It is ſaid that the women haue ſome there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. And according as they be curious, ſome of our men haue made them beleeue, that the French women haue beards on their chinnes, and haue left them in that good opinion, ſo that they were very deſirious to ſee ſome of them, &amp; their maner of clothing. By theſe particularities one may vnderſtand, that all theſe people haue generally leſſer haires than we: for along the body they haue none at all: ſo farre is it then that they be hairie as ſome thinke. This belongeth to the inhabitants of the Iles <hi>Gorgades,</hi> from whence <hi>Hanno</hi> the Carthaginien captaine brought two womens skinnes, which he did ſet vp in the temple of <hi>Iuno</hi> for great ſingularitie: But heere is to bee noted what we haue ſaid, that our ſauage people haue almoſt all their haires blacke: for the Frenchmen in one and the ſelfeſame degree are not commonly ſo. The ancient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <note place="margin">The corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall qualities of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Gaullois.</note>
                  <hi>Polybius, Caeſar, Strabo, Diadore</hi> the Cicilian, and particularly <hi>Ammian Marcellin,</hi> doe ſay, that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Gaullois</hi> had almoſt all their haires as yellow as gold, were of high ſtature, and fearefull for their gaſtly lookes: beſides quarelſome and readie to ſtrike: a fearefull voice, neuer ſpeaking but in threatning. At this time thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are well changed. For there are not now ſo many yellow haires: nor ſo many men of high ſtature, but that other nations haue as tall: As for the fearefull lookes, the delicacies of this time haue moderated that: and as for
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:9921:104"/>
the threatning voice, I haue ſcarſe ſeene in all the <hi>Gaules</hi> but the Gaſcons, and them of Languedoc, which haue their maner of ſpeech ſome what rude, which they retaine of the Gotiſh and of the Spaniard, by their neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. But as for the haires it is very farre from being ſo commonly blacke. The ſame author <hi>Ammian</hi> ſaith alſo, that the women of the <hi>Gaules</hi> (whom he noted to be good ſhrewes, and to bee too hard for their husbands, when they are in choler) haue blue eies: and conſequently the men: and notwithſtanding in that reſpect wee are much mingled: which maketh that one knoweth not what <note place="margin">The beauty of the eies.</note>rareneſſe to chuſe for the beautie of eies. For many doe loue the blue eies, and others loue them greene: which were alſo in ancient time moſt praiſed. For among the Sonnets of <hi>Monſieur de Couci,</hi> (who was in old time ſo great a clerke in loue matters, that ſongs were made of it) greene eies are praiſed.</p>
               <p>The Germans haue kept better than we the qualities which <hi>Tacitus</hi> giueth them, likewiſe that which <hi>Ammian</hi> reciteth of the <hi>Gaullois:</hi> In ſo great a number of men (ſaith <hi>Tacitus)</hi> there is but one faſhion of garments: They haue blue eies and fearefull, their haires ſhining as gold, and are very corpulent. <hi>Pliny</hi> giueth the ſame bodily qualities to the people of the <hi>Taprobane,</hi> ſaying that they haue redde haires, their eies blue, and the voice horrible and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Wherein I know not if I ought to beleeue him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the climate, which is in the 8, 9. and 10. degrees onely, and that in the kingdome of <hi>Calecute,</hi> farther off than the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> line, the men are blacke. But as for our Sauages, concerning their eies, they haue them neither blue nor greene, but blacke for the moſt part, like to their haires: and neuertheleſſe their eies are not ſmall, as they of the ancient <hi>Scythians,</hi> but of a decent greatneſſe. And I may ſay aſſuredly and truely, that I haue ſeene there as faire boies and girles, as any can be in France. For as for the mouth, they haue no bigge mooriſh lippes, as in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:9921:104"/>
and alſo in Spaine; they are well limmed, well boned, and well bodied, competently ſtrong: and neuertheleſſe we had many in our company who might haue wreſtled well enough with the ſtrongeſt of them: but being hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there would be made of them very good men for the warre, which is that wherein they moſt delight. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, <note place="margin">Monſtrous bodies. <hi>Plin.</hi> 6. booke, cap. 31.</note>among them there is none of thoſe prodigious men whereof <hi>Pliny</hi> maketh mention, which haue no noſes in their faces, or no lips, or no tong: Item, which are without mouth, &amp; without noſe, hauing but two ſmall holes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one of them ſerueth for to breath, the other ſerueth in ſtead of a mouth: Item, which haue dogges heads, and a dogge for king: Item, which haue their heads on the breſt, or one onely eie in the middeſt of the forehead, or a flat broad foot to couer their heads when it raineth, and ſuch like monſters. There is none alſo of them which our Sauage <hi>Agohanna</hi> told captaine <hi>Iames Quartier</hi> that hee <note place="margin">In this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke, chap. 25.</note>had ſeene in <hi>Saguenay,</hi> whereof we haue ſpoken heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

               <p>Being well compoſed, they cannot chuſe but be nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſwift in running. We haue ſpoken heeretofore of the nimbleneſſe of the <hi>Braſilians, Margaias</hi> and <hi>Ou-etacas:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nimbleneſſe of bodie, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 25.</note>but all nations haue not thoſe bodily diſpoſitions. They which liue in mountains haue more dexteritie than they of the vallies, becauſe they breath a purer and cleerer aire, and that their food is better. In the vallies the aire is groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and the lands fatter, and conſequently vnholeſommer. The nations that be between the <hi>Tropikes,</hi> haue alſo more agilitie than the others, participating more with the firie nature than they that are farther off. This is the cauſe why <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Gorgones</hi> and Iles <hi>Gorgonides</hi> (which <note place="margin">Gorgones.</note>are thoſe of <hi>Cap <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erd)</hi> ſaith, that the men are there ſo light of foote, that ſcarſe one may follow them by the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:9921:105"/>
in ſuch maner, that <hi>Hanno</hi> the Carthaginian could not catch any one of them. He maketh the like relation of the <hi>Troglodytes,</hi> a nation of <hi>Guinee,</hi> whom hee ſaith are called <hi>Therothoens,</hi> becauſe they are as ſwift in hunting vpon the land, as the <hi>Ichthyophages</hi> are prompt in ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſea, who almoſt are as ſeldome wearie therein as a fiſh. And <hi>Maffeus</hi> in his Hiſtories of the Indies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, that the <hi>Naires</hi> (ſo the nobles and warriours are called) of the kingdome of <hi>Malabaris,</hi> are ſo nimble and ſo ſwift, as it is almoſt incredible, and doe handle ſo well their bodies at will, that they ſeeme to haue no bones, in ſuch ſort, that it is hard to come to skirmiſh againſt ſuch men, foraſmuch as with this agilitie, they aduance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coile as they liſt. But for to make themſelues ſuch, they helpe nature, and their ſinewes are ſtretched out euen <note place="margin">

Now although that which I haue ſaid be true, yet for all that there be nations out of the <hi>Tropikes,</hi> who by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <note place="margin">Hazael. 2.

For the holy Scripture maketh mention of one <hi>Hazael</hi> an Iſraelite, of whom it witneſſeth, that he was as light of foot as a Roe bucke of the fields. And for to come to the people of the North, the <hi>Heruli</hi> are renouned for being ſwift in runing, by this verſe of <hi>Sidonius:</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Curſu Herulus, iaculis Hunnus, Francuſque natatu.</hi> And by this ſwiftneſſe the Germans ſometimes troubled very much <hi>Iulius Caeſar.</hi> So our <hi>Armouchiquois</hi> are as ſwift as grey hounds, as we haue ſaid heertofore, and the other Sauages are little inferior vnto them, and yet they do not force nature, neither doe they vſe any Art to run well. But as the ancient <hi>Gaulois,</hi> being addicted to hunting (for
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:9921:105"/>
it is their life) and to warre, their bodies are nimble, and ſo little charged with fatte, that it doth not hinder them from running at their will.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Their dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Now the Sauages dexteritie is not knowen onely by running, but alſo in ſwimming; which they all can doe: but it ſeemes, that ſome more than others. As for the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilians</hi> they are ſo naturall in that trade, that they would ſwimme eight daies in the ſea, if hunger did not preſſe them, and they feare more that ſome fiſh ſhould deuoure them, than to periſh through wearineſſe. The like is in <hi>Florida,</hi> where the men will follow a fiſh in the ſea, and will take it vnleſſe it be too bigge. <hi>Ioſeph Acosta</hi> ſaith ſo much of them of <hi>Peru.</hi> And as for that which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth breathing, they haue a certaine Art to ſuppe vp the water, and to caſt it out againe, by which meanes they will remaine eaſily in it a long time. The women likewiſe haue a maruellous diſpoſition to that exerciſe: for the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Florida</hi> maketh mention that they can paſſe great riuers in ſwimming, holding their children with one arme: and they climbe very nimbly vp the higheſt trees of the countrey. I will affirme nothing of the <hi>Armouchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quois,</hi> nor of our Sauages, becauſe I tooke no heed to it: but it is very certaine that all can ſwim very cunningly. For the other parts of their bodies they haue them verie perfect, as likewiſe the naturall ſenſes. For <hi>Membertou</hi> (who is aboue an hundred yeeres old) did ſee ſooner a ſhaloupe or a Canow of the Sauages, to come afarre off vnto Port Royall, than any of vs: and it is ſaid of the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilians</hi> and other Sauages of <hi>Peru</hi> hidden in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, that they haue the ſmelling ſo good, that in ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the hand, they know if a man be a Spaniard or a French man: And if he be a Spaniard, they kill him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remiſſion, ſo much doe they hate him for the harmes that they haue receiued of them.

               <p>IT is no maruell if the Ladies of our time do paint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: for of a long time and in many places that trade hath had beginning. But it is reprooued in the holy bookes, and made a reproach by the voices of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as when <hi>Ieremy</hi> threatneth the Citie of <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ierem. 4. verſ. 30.</note>
                  <hi>When thou ſhalt be deſtroied</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what wilt thou doe? though thou clotheſt thy ſelfe with skarlet, though thou deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thy ſelfe with Ornaments of gold, though thou painteſt thy face with colours, yet ſhalt thou trim thy ſelfe in vaine: for thy louers will abhor thee, and ſeeke thy life.</hi> The Prophet <note place="margin">Ezech. 23. verſ. 40.</note>
                  <hi>Ezechiel</hi> maketh the like reproach to the Cities of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> which he compareth to two leaud har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, who hauing ſent to ſeeke out men comming from far, and being come, they haue waſhed themſelues, and painted their faces, and haue put on their faire ornaments. The <note place="margin">4.

The Romans did anciently paint their bodies with vermillion (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith) when they entred in triumph into Rome, and he addeth, that the Princes &amp; great Lords of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> made great account of that colour, wherewith they wholly painted themſelues red: alſo both the one and the other did ſerue themſelues therewith to make their god fairer: And that the firſt expence which was allowed of by the Cenſors and Maſters of Accounts in Rome was
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:9921:106"/>
of the monies beſtowed for to colour with vermilion the face of Iupiter. The ſame author reciteth in another place, <note place="margin">Plin. lib. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>30.</hi>
                  </note>that the <hi>Anderes, Mathites, Moſagebes</hi> and <hi>Hipporeens,</hi> people of <hi>Libya,</hi> did plaiſter all their bodies ouer with red chaulke. Briefely, this faſhion did paſſe as farre as to the North. And thereof is come the name that was giuen to the Picts, an ancient people of <hi>Scythia,</hi> neighbours to the <hi>Gothes,</hi> who in the yeare 87. after the Natiuity of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> vnder the Empire of <hi>Domitian</hi> made courſes and ſpoiles thorow the Iles which lie North ward, where hauing found men who made them reſiſtance, they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe without doing any thing, and liued yet naked in their cold Countrie vntill the yeare of our Lord 370. At which time vnder the Empire of <hi>Valentinian</hi> being ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ammian lib.</hi> 26. &amp; 27.</note>with the Saxons and Scots they tormented very much them of Great Britan, as <hi>Ammian Marcellin</hi> reciteth: and being reſolued to remaine there (as they did) they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Britons (which now are Engliſhmen) wiues in marriage. Whereupon being denied, they retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the Scots, of whom they were furniſhed, vpon condition that the maſculine race of the Kings comming to faile among them, that then the women ſhould ſucceed in the Realme. Now theſe people were called <hi>Picts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the paintings which they vſed vpon their naked bodies, which (ſaith <hi>Herodian)</hi> they would not couer with <note place="margin">Herod. 3. booke.</note>any clothing for feare to hide and darken the faire painting they had ſet vpon it, where were ſet out beaſts of all ſorts, and printed with Iron inſtruments, in ſuch ſort that it was vnpoſſible to take them off. Which they did (as <hi>Solin</hi> ſaith) euen from their infancy: in maner that as the child did grow, ſo did grow thoſe fixed figures, euen as the markes that are graued vpon the yong pompions. The <hi>Poet Claudian</hi> doth alſo giue vs many witneſſes of this in his <hi>Panegyriques,</hi> as when he ſpeaketh of the Emperour <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his Grand-father:</p>

               <p>This hath beene noted by <hi>Monſieur de Belleforeſt,</hi> and afterward by the learned <hi>Sauaron</hi> vpon the obſeruation that <hi>Sidoine de Polignac</hi> maketh thereof. And albeit that our <hi>Celtique Poitevins,</hi> called by the Latines <hi>Pictones,</hi> be not deſcended from the race of thoſe (for they were anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Gaullois</hi> euen in <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> time) neuertheleſſe I may well beleeue that this name hath beene giuen them for the ſame occaſion as that of the <hi>Picts.</hi> And as cuſtomes once brought in among a people are not loſt but by the length of many ages (as we ſee yet the follies of Shroue-Tueſday to continue) ſo the vſes of painting, whereof we haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken remaineth in ſome Northerly Nations. For I haue heard ſometimes <hi>Monſieur Le Comte D'Egmond</hi> tell, that he hath ſeene in his yong yeares them of <hi>Brunzwich</hi> come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fathers houſe with their faces greaſed with painting, and their viſage all blacked, from whence peraduenture this word of <hi>Bronzer</hi> may be deriued, which ſignifieth in <hi>Picardy</hi> to blacke. And generally I beleeue that all thoſe Northerly people did vſe painting, when they would make themſelues braue. For the <hi>Gelons</hi> and <hi>Agathyrſes,</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Scythia</hi> like the <hi>Picts,</hi> were of this fraternity, and with Iron inſtruments did colour their bodies.

                  </note>likewiſe, then called Britons, by the ſaying of <hi>Tertullian.</hi> The Gothes, beſides the Iron inſtruments, did vſe vermillion to make their faces and bodies red. Briefely, it was a ſport in the old time to ſee ſo many <hi>Antikes,</hi> men and women: for there are found yet old Pictures, which he that hath made the Hiſtory of the Engliſhmens voyage into <hi>Virginia</hi> hath cut in braſſe, where the <hi>Picts</hi> of both ſex are painted out, with their fair inciſions, and ſwords hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the naked fleſh, as <hi>Herodian</hi> deſcribeth them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Weſt Indians.</note> This humour of painting hauing beene ſo generall in theſe parts, there is no cauſe of mocking, if the people of

the Weſt Indies haue done, and yet do the like: which is vniuerſall &amp; without exception among thoſe nations. For if any one of them maketh loue, he ſhall be painted with blue or red colour, and his Miſtres alſo. If they haue veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in abundance, or be glad for any thing, they will doe the like generally. But when that they are ſadde, or plot ſome treaſon, then they ouercaſt all their face with blacke, and are hideouſly deformed. Touching the body, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages apply no painting to it, which the Braſilians and Floridians doe, the moſt part whereof are painted ouer the bodie, the armes and thighes with faire branches, whoſe painting can neuer be taken away, becauſe they are prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the fleſh. Notwithſtanding many <hi>Braſilians</hi> doe paint onely their bodies (without inciſion) when they liſt: and this with the iuice of a certaine fruit which they call <hi>Genipat,</hi> which doth blacke ſo much, that though they waſh themſelues, they cannot bee cleane in ten or twelue daies after.

And the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> had for marke the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the foreskinne, by the which they are ſequeſtred from other nations, and knowen for Gods people. But as for other bodily inciſions, ſuch as anciently the <hi>Picts</hi> did make, and the Sauages doe yet make at this day, they haue beene anciently very expreſly forbidden in the Law of <note place="margin">Leu. 19. 28.

               <p>The Spaniſh women in <hi>Peru</hi> do go beyond that, for their ſhooes are ſet ouer with nothing but plates of gold and ſiluer, and garniſhed with pearles. True it is that they are in a countrie, which God hath bleſſed abundantly with all theſe riches. But if thou haſt not ſo much of them, do not vex thy ſelfe at it, &amp; be not tempted through enuy: ſuch things are but earth, digged and purified with a thouſand troubles, in the bottome of hell, by the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible labor, &amp; with the life of men like vnto thee: Pearles are but dew, receaued within the ſhell of a fiſh, which are <note place="margin">Pearles what they be.</note>fiſhed by men that be forced to become fiſhes, that is to ſay, to be alwaies diuing in the depth of the ſea.

often is laſciuiouſneſſe hidden. Happie are the people which not hauing the occaſions to ſinne, doe purely ſerue God, and poſſeſſe a land which furniſheth them of that which is neceſſarie for life. Happie are our Sauage peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple if they had the full knowledge of God: for in that caſe they be without ambition, vaine-glorie, enuie, auarice, &amp; haue no care of theſe braueries, which wee haue now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: but rather doe content themſelues to haue <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachias,</hi> hanging at their eares, and about their necks, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, armes, and legges. The <hi>Braſilians, Floridians,</hi> and <hi>Armouchiquois,</hi> doe make carkenets and bracelets (called <hi>bou-re in Braſill,</hi> and by ours <hi>Matachias)</hi> of the ſhelles of thoſe great ſea cockles, which be called <hi>Vignols,</hi> like vnto ſnailes, which they break &amp; gather vp in a thouſand pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then doe ſmooth them vpon a hot ſtone, vntill they do make them very ſmall, and hauing pierced them, they make them beads with them, like vnto that which wee call <hi>Pourcelaine.</hi> Among thoſe beads they intermingle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſpaces other beads, as blacke as thoſe which I <note place="margin">Iet.</note>haue ſpoken of to be white, made with Iet, or certain hard and black wood which is like vnto it, which they ſmooth and make ſmall as they liſt, and this hath a very good grace. And if things are to be eſteemed for their faſhion, as we ſee it practiſed in our merchandiſes, theſe colars, skarffes, and bracelets made of great periwincles or pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celaine, are richer than pearles, (notwithſtanding none will beleeue me heerein) ſo doe they eſteeme them more than pearles, gold or ſiluer: And this is that which they of <note place="margin">Beades much eſteemed.</note>the great riuer of <hi>Canada</hi> in the time of <hi>Iam.

At this day they haue not any more of them, or elſe they haue loſt the knowledge to make them: For they vſe <hi>Mattachias</hi> very much, that are brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them out of France. Now as with vs, ſo in that country,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:9921:111"/>
women doe decke themſelues with ſuch things, and will haue chaines that will goe twelue times about their necks, hanging downe vpon their breſts, and about their hand wreſts, and aboue the elbow. They alſo hang long ſtrings of them at their eares, which come downe as low as their ſhoulders. If the men weare any, it will bee onely ſome yong man that is in loue. In the country of <hi>Virginia</hi> where <note place="margin">Pearles in Virginia. Copper.</note>ſome pearles be found, the women do weare carkenets, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and bracelets of them, or elſe of peeces of copper (made round like ſmall bullets) which is found in their mountaines, where ſome mines of it are. But in Port Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and in the confines thereof, and towards New-found land, and at <hi>Tadouſſac,</hi> where they haue neither pearles nor vignols, the maides and women doe make <hi>Mattachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> with the quilles or briſtles of the <hi>Porc-epine,</hi> which they die with blacke, white, and red colours, as liuely as poſſibly may be, for our skarlets haue no better luſtre <note place="margin">Excellent skarlet die.</note>than their redde die: But they more eſteeme the <hi>Matta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi> which come vnto them from the <hi>Armouchiquois</hi> countrey, and they buy them very deare; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can get no great quantitie of them, by reaſon of the warres that thoſe nations haue continually one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another. There is brought vnto them from France <hi>Mattachias</hi> made with ſmal quilles of glaſſe mingled with tinne or lead, which are trucked with them, and meaſured by the fadam, for want of an ell: and this kind of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe is in that country, that which the Latins doe call <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus muliebris.</hi> They alſo make of them ſmall ſquares of ſundry colours, ſowed together, which they tie behinde, on the little childrens haires. The men doe not much care for them, except that the <hi>Braſilians</hi> doe weare about their neckes halfe moones of bones very white, which they call <hi>y-aci</hi> of the Moones name: And our <hi>Souriquois</hi> doe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe weare ſome iollities of like ſtuffe, without exceſſe. And they which haue none of that, doe commonly carry a knife before their breſts, which they doe not for ornament: but
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:9921:112"/>
for want of pocket, and becauſe it is an implement which at all times is neceſſary vnto them. Some haue girdles made of <hi>Matachias,</hi> wherewith they ſerue themſelues, only when they will ſet out themſelues and make them braue. The <hi>Autmoins</hi> or Sooth-ſaiers do carry before their breaſts ſome ſigne of their vocation, as we will heereafter ſay. But as for the men of the <hi>Armouchiquois</hi> they haue a faſhion to weare at their hand-wreſts, and aboue the ancle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone of the foot, about their legs, plates of Copper, fetter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and about their waſts girdles, faſhioned with Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per quils as long as the middle finger filed together the <note place="margin">

And there are yet in Scotland Sauage men, which neither ages, nor yeeres, nor the abundance of men could yet reduce vnto ciuilitie. And although that (as we haue ſaid) the men be not ſo deſirous of <hi>Matachias</hi> as the women, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the men of <hi>Braſill,</hi> not caring for clothing, take great pleaſure to decke and garniſh themſelues with the feathers of birds, and doe vſe thoſe wherewith we vſe to fill our beds whereon we lie, and chop them as ſmal as pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat, which they die in red, with their Braſill-wood, then hauing anointed their bodies with certaine gums, which ſerue them in ſtead of paſte or glue, they couer themſelues with thoſe feathers, and make a garment at one clap, after the anticke faſhion: which hath made (ſaith <hi>Iohn de Leri</hi> in his Hiſtorie of <hi>America)</hi> the firſt of our men that went thither to beleeue that the men which be called Sauages were hairie ouer all their bodies, which is nothing ſo. For (as wee haue alreadie ſaid) the Sauages in what part ſoeuer, haue leſſer haires than we. They of <hi>Florida</hi> doe alſo vſe this kinde of downe, but it is onely about their heads, to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:9921:112"/>
make themſelues more vglie. Beſides this that wee haue ſaid, the <hi>Braſilians</hi> doe make frontlets of feathers, which they tie and fit in order of all colours: thoſe frontlets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like in faſhion to thoſe rackets or periwigges, which Ladies vſe in theſe parts, the inuention whereof they ſeeme to haue learned of thoſe Sauages. As for them of our New France, in the daies that be of ſolemnitie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing among them, and when they goe to the warres, they haue about their heads as it were a crowne made with long haires of an Ellan or Stagge, painted in redde, paſted, or otherwiſe faſtned, to a fillet of leather of three fingers bredth, ſuch as <hi>Iames Quartier</hi> ſaith he had ſeene with the King (ſo doth he call him) and Lord of the Saua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which he found in the towne of <hi>Hochelaga.</hi> But they doe not vſe ſo many ornaments of feathers as the <hi>Braſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which make gownes of them, cappes, bracelets, gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and ornaments for their cheekes, and targets vpon their loines, of all colours, which would bee more tedious than delightfull to ſpecifie, ſince it is an eaſie matter for euery one to ſupplie the ſame, and to imagine what it is.</p>

If then our Sauages haue <note place="margin">Sturgeons, Salmons, and other fiſh.</note>veniſon and fiſh abundantly, I doe not thinke them ill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: for many times we haue receaued of them quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of Sturgeons, of Salmons and other fiſhes: beſides their veniſon, and Beuers which liue in ponds, and liue partly on the land, partly in the water.

If they haue not the vſe of ſalt, the moſt parte of the world doe vſe none.

As for modeſtie they vſe it being at table with vs, and eate very ſoberly: but at home in their owne houſes (as the <hi>Braſilians)</hi> they ſtretch out their bellies as much as they can, and doe not leaue eating as long as there is any meat: And if any of ours be at their <hi>Tabagie,</hi> they will bid him doe as they doe.

they are all in a round (or very neere) and doe dance with vehemencie, ſtriking with their feet vpon the ground, and lifting themſelues vp as in halfe a leape: And as for their hands they hold them cloſe, and their armes in the aire, in forme of a man that threatneth, with a motion of them.

               <p>WE haue ſaid in the laſt Chapter that dancing is profitable for the preſeruation of health. Alſo it is one of the cauſes why our Sauages do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ſo much in it: But they haue yet ſome other preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiues which they vſe very often, that is to ſay, ſweates, whereby they preuent ſickneſſes.

                  </note> In <hi>Florida</hi> they haue their <hi>Iarvars,</hi> who continually carry a bagge full of hearbs and drugges hanging about their necks to cure the ſicke, which are for the moſt part ſicke of the Pox: and they blowe vpon the parts affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vntill they draw the very bloud from it.</p>

This contagion doth conuert it ſelfe into boiles broader then the thombe, which diſperſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues throughout all the bodie, and euen as farre as the face, and being touched therewith they beare the marks thereof all their life time, fowler then lepers, as well <hi>Braſilians</hi> as other nations.

               <p>And among the Chriſtians, many (not caring for God no longer then they receaue good gifts of him) doe ſeeke for the healing of their diſeaſes by charmes and helpe of Witches: So among our Sauages the <hi>Aoutmoin</hi> hauing ſome ſore in cure, inquireth often of his diuell to know whether he ſhall heale or no: and hath neuer no anſwer but doubtfully, by <hi>if,</hi> or <hi>and.</hi> There bee ſome of them which ſometimes doe make incredible cures, as to heale one that hath his armes cut off. Which notwithſtanding I know not, why I ſhould finde it ſtrange, when I conſider what <hi>Monſieur de Buſbeque</hi> writeth in his diſcourſe of his Embaſſie into Turkie the fourth Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Comming neere vnto <hi>Buda,</hi> the Baſha ſent ſome of his houſhold Seruants to meete vs, with many Haraldes and officers: But among the reſt a faire troupe of yong men on horſe-backe, remarkable for the nouelty of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. They had their heads bare and ſhauen, vpon the which they had made a long bloudie ſlaſh, and thruſt diuers feathers of birds within the wound, from whence the very pure bloud did trickle downe: but inſteed of ſhrinking at it, they went lifting vp their heads with a laughing countenance. Before me marched ſome foote men, one of them had his armes naked and hanging down on his ſides: both which armes aboue the Elbowe was thruſt quite through with a knife that ſtucke faſt in them. Another was naked from his head to the nauell, hauing the skinne of his-backe ſo iagged vp and downe in two places, achwart which he had made to paſſe, an hatchet of armes, which he did carry in ſcarffe wiſe as we would doe a cuttleaxe. I ſaw another of them who had fixed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the crowne of his head a horſe ſhooe with many nailes, and of ſo long continuance that the nailes were ſo fixed and faſt in the fleſh, that they ſtirred not. Wee entred
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:9921:125"/>
into Buda in this pompe, and were brought into the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhas houſe, with whom I treated of my affaires. All this youthly company little caring for their wounds were in the lower court of the houſe; And as I was a looking on them the Baſha asked of me what I thought of it: All well ſaid I, except that theſe men doe with the skinne of their bodies, that which I would not doe with my coat: For I would ſeeke to keepe it whole. The Baſha laughed, and we tooke our leaue.</q>

                  <note place="margin">The triall of the Sauages conſtancy.</note> Our Sauages doe very well ſometimes make triall of their conſtancie, but we muſt confeſſe that it is nothing in regard of the things aboue rehearſed. For all that they do is to put burning coales vpon their armes, and to ſuffer their skinnes to burne, ſo that the marks thereof doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine there for euer: which thing they doe alſo on other parts of the body, and ſhew theſe marks to ſay that they <note place="margin">Romans.</note>haue a great courage. But the ancient <hi>Mutius Sceuola</hi> did much more then that, burning courageouſly his arme in the fire, after he had miſſed the killing of king <hi>Porſenna.</hi> If this were of my purpoſe I would declare the cuſtomes <note place="margin">Lacedemonians.</note>of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who did make euery yeare a feaſt to the honour of <hi>Diana,</hi> where the yong boies did ſhew their triall by whipping of themſelues: Item the cuſtome of the <note place="margin">Perſians.</note>ancient <hi>Perſians,</hi> who worſhiping the Sunne, which they called <hi>Mithra,</hi> none could be receiued to that fraternity vntill he had giuen his conſtancy to be knowen, by foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore kindes of torments, of fire, of water, of faſting, of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſſe, and other things.</p>
               <p>But let vs return to our Sauages Phyſicions &amp; Chierur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons. Although the number of them be but ſmall, yet ſo it is that the hope of their liuing doth not conſiſt wholy in <note place="margin">Healthfull Country.</note>that trade. For as concerning the ordinary ſickneſſes they are ſo rare in thoſe parts, that the verſe of <hi>Ouid</hi> may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well applied vnto them:

Which may be coniectured by the report that we haue made heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of an old man in <hi>Florida,</hi> who had liued that great age. In ſuch ſort that it is no particular miracle of that which <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith that the <hi>Pandorians</hi> doe liue 200. yeares or that they of <hi>Taprobane</hi> are liuely and nimble at a 100. yeares old. For <hi>Membertou</hi> is aboue a 100. yeares old, and yet hath not one white haire on his head, and ſo ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily be the others. And that which is more in euery age they haue all their teeth, and go bareheaded, not caring at leaſt to make any hats of their skinnes, as the firſt did that vſed them in theſe parts of the world. For they of <hi>Pel<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Concord is a cauſe of long life.</note> That which alſo procureth the health of our Sauages, is the concord which they haue among them, and the ſmal care they take for the commodities of this life, for the which we torment and vex our ſelues. They haue not that ambition, which in theſe parts gnaweth and fretteth the mindes and ſpirits, and filleth them with cares, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blinded men to goe to the graue in the very flower of their age, and ſometimes to ſerue for a ſhamefull ſpectacle to a publike death.</p>
               <p>I dare alſo, and that very well, attribute the cauſe of this diſpoſition and long health of our Sauages, to their maner of life, which is after the ancient faſhion, without curioſity. For euery one doth grant that <hi>Sobrietie</hi> is the mother of <note place="margin">Sobriety.</note>health. And although they ſometimes exceed in their <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bagies</hi> or feaſts, they diet themſelues afterwards well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, liuing very often eight daies more or leſſe with the ſmoake of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> not returning to hunting vntil they
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:9921:126"/>
be a hungry. And that beſides being nimble they want no exerciſe, ſome way or other. Briefely there is no mention amongſt them of thoſe ſhort ages which doe not out paſſe fourty yeares, which is the life of certaine people of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia</hi> (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith) which doe liue of <hi>Locuſtes</hi> (or graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopers) <note place="margin">Multitude of officers is the ſigne of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted eſtate.</note>ſalted in the ſmoake. Alſo corruption is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, which is the foſtering mother of <hi>Phyſitions</hi> and of Magiſtrates, and of the multiplicity of officers, and of publike extortioners, which are created and inſtituted for to giue order vnto it, and to cut off the abuſes. They haue no ſutes in law (the plague of our liues) to the proſecuting whereof we muſt conſume both our yeares &amp; our meanes, and very often one cannot obtaine iuſtice, be it either by the ignorance of the Iudge, to whom the caſe is diſguiſed, or by his owne malice, or by the wickedneſſe of an Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that will ſell his Clyant. And from ſuch afflictions do proceed the teares, fretfulneſſes, and deſolations, which <note place="margin">Eccleſiaſt. 30. at the end of the chapter.</note>bring vs to the graue before our time. <hi>For ſorrow</hi> (ſaith the wiſe man) <hi>hath killed many, and there is no profit in it.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Heere aboue chap. 14.</note> I haue ſaid in the chapter of the <hi>Tabagie</hi> that among the Sauages, the women are not in as good a condition as they were anciently among the <hi>Gaullois</hi> and <hi>Germans.</hi> For (by the report of <hi>Iames Quartier</hi> himſelfe) they labour more then the men, ſaith he, whether it be in fiſhing, be it in til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or in any thing elſe. And notwithſtanding they are neither forced, nor tormented: but they are neither in their <hi>Tabagies</hi> nor in their counſels, and doe the ſeruile buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for want of ſeruants. If there be any veniſon killed, they goe to flay it and to fetch it, yea were it three leagues off: and they muſt finde it out by the onely circumſtance that ſhall be deſcribed to them by words. They that haue priſoners doe alſo employ them to that, and to other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as to goe fetch wood with wiues: which is folly in them to goe fetch drie and rotten wood very farre
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:9921:130"/>
off for to warme them, although they be in the middeſt of a forreſt. True it is that the ſmoake is very irkeſome to them: which it may be is the cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Touching their ſmaller exerciſes; when the winter doth approch they prepare that which is neceſſary to oppoſe themſelues againſt this rigorous aduerſary, and make mattes of ruſhes, wherewith they garniſh their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, <note place="margin">Mattes.</note>and others to fit vpon, and all very artificially, yea alſo colouring their ruſhes, they make partitions in their workes, like to them that our gardeners doe make in their garden knots, with ſuch meaſure and proportion as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is found amiſſe therein. And becauſe that the body <note place="margin">The currying and dreſſing of skinnes.</note>muſt alſo be clothed, they curry and ſupple the skinnes of Beuers, Stagges and others, as well as can be done heere. If they be little they few many together, and make cloakes, ſleeues, ſtockens, and ſhooes, vpon all which things they make workes which haue a very good grace. Item they <note place="margin">Panniers.</note>make Panniers of ruſhes and rootes, for to put their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities in, as corne, beanes, peaſon, fleſh, fiſh and other things. They make alſo purſes of leather, vpon which <note place="margin">Purſes.</note>they make workes woorthy of admiration, with the haires of Porckepines, coloured with red, black, white and blew, which <note place="margin">Dies.</note>be the colours that they make, ſo liuely that oures ſeeme in nothing to be comparable to them. They alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe <note place="margin">Diſhes.</note>themſelues in making diſhes of barke to drinke, and put their meates in, which are very faire according to the ſtuffe.

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:9921:133"/>
And notwithſtanding, before that ciuility, they haue done great actions. Our Sauages, although they bee naked, are not voide of thoſe vertues, that are found in men of ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, For <hi>euery one</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle) hath in him, euen from his</hi>

                  <hi>birth, the principles and ſeedes of vertue.</hi> Taking then the fowre vertues by their ſprings, we ſhall finde that they participate much of them. For firſt concerning fortitude and courage, they haue thereof as much as any nation of the Sauages (I ſpeake of our <hi>Souriquois</hi> and of their alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) in ſuch ſort, that ten of them will alwaies aduenture themſelues againſt twentie <hi>Armouchiquois:</hi> not that they be altogether without feare (a thing which the fore alea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth reproch to the ancient <hi>Celtien-Gaullois,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The ancient Gaullois were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare.</note>who feared nothing, neither the motions of the earth, nor the tempeſts of the ſea, ſaying, that this was the property of an hairebraine fellow) but with that courage they haue, they eſteeme that wiſedome giueth vnto them much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. They feare then, but it is that which all wiſe men doe feare, and that is death, which is terrible and dreadfull, as ſhe that rifleth all, through which ſhee paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. They feare ſhame and reproch, but this feare is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen germane to vertue. They are ſtirred to doe good by <note place="margin">What it is that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages doe</note>honour, for as much as he, amongſt them, is alwaies hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and getteth renoune to himſelfe that hath done ſome faire exploit. Hauing theſe things proper vnto them, they are in a mediocritie, which is the very ſeate of vertue. One point maketh this vertue of force and courage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in them, that is, they are too reuengefull, and in that they put their ſoueraing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment, which inclineth <note place="margin">Sauages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengefull.</note>to brutiſhneſſe. But they are not alone, for all thoſe nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons how farre ſoeuer they may ſtretch themſelues from one Pole to the other, are infected with this vice. The Chriſtian Religion onely may bring them to reaſon, as in ſome ſort ſhe doth with vs (I ſay in ſome ſort) becauſe that wee haue men very vnperfect, as well as the Sauages.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Temperance.</note> Temperance is another vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſiſting in the medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:9921:134"/>
in things that concerne the pleaſures of the body: for as for that which concerneth the minde he is not called temperate or vntemperate, who is mooued with ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or with deſire to learne, or that emploieth his time in toies. And for that which concerneth the body, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or vntemperance, is not applied to all things that might be ſubiect to our ſenſes, vnleſſe it be by accident, as to colour, to a picture: Item to flowers and good ſentes: Item to ſongs and hearing of orations, or commedies: but rather to that which is ſubiect to feeling, and to that which ſmelling ſeeketh by arts, as in eating and drinking, in perfumes, in the venerian act, to teniſe play, to wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to running, and ſuch like. Now all theſe things do depend of the will; which being ſo, it is the part of a man to know how to bridle his appetites.</p>
               <p>Our Sauages haue not all the qualities requiſite for the perfection of this vertue. For as for meates we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their vntemperance, when they haue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and they doe eat parpetually, yea ſo farre as to riſe in the night to banquet. But ſeeing that in theſe our parts many are as vicious as they, I will not be to rigorous a Cenſurer of them. As for the other actions there is no more to be reprooued in them then in vs: yea I will ſay leſſe, in that which concerneth the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enerian</hi> action, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are little addicted: not comprehending heere, <note place="margin">Heeretofore chap. 13.</note>for all that, them of <hi>Florida,</hi> and in hotter countries, of whom wee haue ſpoken heeretofore.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Liberality.</note> Liberalitie is a vertue as worthy praiſe, as auarice and prodigalitie, her oppoſites are blame worthy. It conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in giuing and receauing, but rather in giuing in time and place, and according to occaſion, without exceſſe. This vertue is proper and befitting great perſonages, which be as it were Stewards of the goods of the earth, which God hath put into their hands, for to vſe them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally, that is to ſay to diſtribute them to him that hath none, not being exceſſiue in needleſſe expences, nor too
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:9921:134"/>
ſparing where magnifiicencie is to bee ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Our Sauages are praiſe worthy in the exerciſe of this vertue, according to their pouerty. For as we haue ſaid before, when they viſit one another, they giue mutuall preſents one to the other. And when ſome French <hi>Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> commeth to them, they doe the like with him, caſting at his feete ſome bundle of Beuers, or other furres, which be all their riches: And ſo did they to <hi>Monſieur de Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trincourt,</hi> but he tooke them not to his owne proper vſe, but rather put them into <hi>Monſieur de Monts</hi> his ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, becauſe he would not goe againſt the priuiledge giuen vnto him. This cuſtome of the ſaid Sauages pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth but from a liberall minde, and which hath ſome generoſitie. And although they bee very glad when the like is done vnto them, yet ſo it falleth out, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the venture, and put themſelues in hazard to looſe their merchandiſe. And who is hee amongſt vs that doth more than they, that is to ſay, which giueth but with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to receaue? the Poet ſaith,
<q>
                     <l>Nemo ſuas gratis perdere vellet opes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </l>
                  </q>
There is no body that giueth, intending to looſe. If a great perſonage giueth to a meane man, that is for to draw ſome ſeruice from him. Euen that which is giuen to the poore, is to receiue the hundred fold, according to the promiſe of the Goſpel. And for to ſhew the galantneſſe of our ſaid Sauages: they doe not willingly cheapen, and do content themſelues with that which is giuen them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly with a willing minde, diſdaining and blaming the faſhions of our petie merchants, which bee an houre a <note place="margin">Heeretofore 1 booke chap. 17.</note>cheapning for to buy a Beuer skinne: as I ſaw being at the riuer Saint Iohn, whereof I haue ſpoken heeretofore, that they called a yoong merchant of Saint <hi>Maloes Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoria,</hi> which is a word of reproch among them, borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Baskes, ſignifying as it were, a hagling fellow. Finally, they haue nothing in them but frankneſſe and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie in their exchanging. And ſeeing the baſe maners
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:9921:135"/>
of ſome of our men, they demanded ſometimes, what they came to ſeeke for in their countrie, ſaying, that they came not into ours: and ſeeing that wee are richer than they, we ſhould giue them liberally that which we haue,</p>
               <p>Out of this vertue, there groweth in them a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence which cannot appeare, and remaineth hidden, but for all that they are prouoked by it, doing all they can for to welcome their friends. And <hi>Membertou</hi> was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that ſo much honour ſhould be done vnto him as to ſhoot off our Canons when he did arriue, becauſe he ſaw that the ſame was done to the French Captaines in ſuch a caſe, ſaying that it was due vnto him, ſeeing that he was a <hi>Sagamos.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Page 224.</note> Heere Hoſpitality may be mentioned, but hauing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken theereof heeretofore, I will refer the Reader to the chapter of the <hi>Tabagi,</hi> where I giue them the praiſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the <hi>Gaullois</hi> and ancient French-men for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. True it is that in ſome places there be ſome which be friends for the time, and take their aduantage in neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as hath beene noted in <hi>Laudonniere</hi> his voyage. But we cannot accuſe them in that, leaſt we alſo accuſe our <note place="margin">The pietie of the Sauages towards their parents.</note>ſelues, which doe the like. One thing I will ſay that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to fatherly <hi>Pietie,</hi> that the children are not ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as to diſpiſe their patents in old age, but doe prouide for them with veniſon, as the <hi>Storkes</hi> doe towards them that haue ingendred them. A thing which is the ſhame of many Chriſtians, who being weary of their Parents long life, doe oftentimes ſtrip them before they goe to bed, and ſo doe leaue them naked.</p>
               <p>They vſe alſo humanity and mercy towards their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies wiues and little children, whoſe liues they ſpare, but they remaine their priſoners for to ſerue them, according to the ancient right of ſeruitude, brought in amongſt all the nations of the other world, againſt the naturall liberty. But as for the men of defence they ſpare none, but kill as many of them as they can catch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:9921:135"/>
As for iuſtice, they haue not any Law neither deuine nor humane, but that which Nature teacheth them, that one muſt not offend another. So haue they quarels very ſeldome. And if any ſuch thing doe chance to happen, the <hi>Sagamos</hi> quieteth all, and doth iuſtice to him that is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, giuing ſome baſtanadoes to the wrong doer, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him to make ſome preſents to the other, for to pacifie him, which is ſome forme of dominion. If it be one of their priſoners that hath offended, he is in danger to goe to the pot. For after he is killed no body will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his death. The ſame conſideration is in theſe parts of the world. There is no account made of a mans life that hath no ſupport.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Execution of iuſtice made by the Saua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> One day there was an <hi>Armouchiquois</hi> woman, priſoner, who had cauſed a country-man of hers, priſoner, to eſcape away: &amp; to the end to trauel and paſſe on the way ſhe had ſtollen from <hi>Membertous</hi> cabin a tinder-box (for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that they can doe nothing) and a hatchet. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the knowledge of the Sauages, they would not proceed on the execution thereof neere vnto vs, but they went to Cabin themſelues fower or fiue leagues from Port Royall, where ſhe was killed. And becauſe ſhe was a woman, our Sauages wiues and daughters did execute her. <hi>Kinibech-coech</hi> a yong maide of eighteene yeares of age, faire and well ſpotted with colours, gaue her the firſt ſtroake in the throat, which was with a knife: An other maide of the ſame age, handſome enough, called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tembroech,</hi> followed on, and the daughter of <hi>Membertou</hi> which we called <hi>Membertou-ech-coech</hi> made an end. We reprooued them ſharpely for this cruelty, whereof they were all aſhamed, and durſt not ſhew themſelues any more. This is their forme of Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Another time a man and a women, priſoners, went cleane away, without tinder-box or any prouiſion of meat. Which was hard to be performed, as well for the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of way, which was aboue 300. leagues by land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:9921:136"/>
it behooued them to goe ſecretly, and to take heed from meeting with any Sauages. Neuertheleſſe thoſe poore ſoules pulled off the barke of certaine trees, and made a little boat, with the barke of them, wherein they croſſed the <hi>Bay Françoiſe,</hi> and got to the other ſhoare ouer againſt Port Royall, ſhortning their way aboue one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty leagues: and got home into their Country of the <hi>Armouchiquois.</hi>

a chamber aboue the lower dwelling, for to retire himſelfe, if in caſe any inundation ſhould happen: In ſuch ſort that ſome Beuers cabin is aboue eight foot hight, all made with wood, piramide wiſe, and dawbed with mudde.

If any man doth aske why they flie not away, one muſt conſider that they be birds onely of two three, or fower moneths old, which haue beene there hatched in the ſpring time, and haue not yet wings great enough to take ſlight, though they be well fleſhie and in good plight.

                  <hi>OPpian,</hi> in the booke that he hath made vpon this ſubiect, ſaith, that in the hunting of beaſts and of <note place="margin">Compariſon betweene hunting, hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and fiſhing.</note>birdes, beſides the facility, there is more content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and delight then in fiſhing, becauſe that a man hath many retreats, one may get himſelfe into the ſhadow, one may meet with brookes to quench his thirſt, one may lie downe on the graſſe, one may take his repaſt vnder ſome ſhelter. As for birdes one may take them in the neſt and with bird-lime, yea of themſelues very often they fall into the nets. But poore fiſher-men caſt their baite vpon an vncertainty; yea, double vncertaintie, as well becauſe they know not what aduenture ſhall happen vnto them, as becauſe they are vpon an vnconſtant and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tameable Element, whoſe very ſight onely is fearefull: They are alwaies wandering from place to place, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects

to tempeſts, and beaten with ſtormes and winds. But yet in the end he concludeth that they are not deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all pleaſure, but rather that they haue enough, when they are in a Shippe well built, well tight, well cloſed, and ſwift in ſailing. Then cutting the waues they goe to ſea, where the great skulls of deuouring fiſhes are, and caſting into the ſea a line well twiſted, the weight of it is no ſooner in the bottome, but that as ſoone the baite is ſnatched vp, and ſuddenly the fiſh is drawen vp with <note place="margin">An Emperour delighting in fiſhing.</note>great pleaſure. And in this exerciſe did <hi>Marc Antonia,</hi> the Sonne of the Emperor <hi>Seuerus</hi> delight himſelfe very much: notwithſtanding <hi>Platoes</hi> reaſon, who forming his common-wealth hath forbidden his Citizens the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of fiſhing, as vnnoble, and iliberall, and foſterer of idleneſſe. Wherein he did groſſely <hi>aequiuocate,</hi> ſpecially when he chargeth fiſher-men with idleneſſe. Which is ſo euident that I will not vouchſafe to refute him. But I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel not of that which he ſaith of fiſhing, ſeeing that with the ſame he alſo reiecteth hauking, vpon the ſame reaſons. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith that it is more laudable to take either a Hart, a Roebuck, or a Hare, then to buy them: but he wadeth not ſo farre as the other. Howſoeuer it be, the Church, which is the firſt order in humane ſociety, whoſe Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is called Royall by the great Apoſtle Saint Peter, hath permitted fiſhing to church-men, and forbidden hunting and hauking.

When winter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <note place="margin">Fiſhes doe retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in Winter.</note>all fiſhes are aſtoniſhed, and ſhunne the ſtormes and tempeſts, euery one where he may: ſome doe hide themſelues in the ſand of the ſea, others vnder the Rocks, others doe ſeeke a milder country where they may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at reſt.

And then our ſaid <note place="margin">The fiſhes rendez-vous.</note>Sauages that know the Rendez-vous of euery one, and the time of their returne, goe to waite for them in good deuotion to bidde them welcome. The Smelt is the firſt fiſh of all that preſent himſelfe in the Spring.

Item the Pilchers doe come in their ſeaſon, in ſuch aboundance that ſometimes willing to haue ſome thing more for our ſupper then ordinary, in leſſe then the ſpace of an houre, wee had taken enough of them to ſerue vs for three daies. The Dolphins, Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons <note place="margin">Dolphins, Sturgions, Salmons.</note>and Salmons doe get to the head of the Riuer in the ſaid Port Royall, where ſuch quantitie of them are, that they carried away the nets which we had laid for them, by reaſon of the multitude of them that we ſaw there. In all places fiſh aboundeth there in like maner, as wee our <note place="margin">Fiſhing of the Sauages.</note>ſelues haue ſeene. The Sauages doe make a hurdle, or

And as for the Dolphins, Sturgions and ſalmons, they take them after that maner, or doe ſtrike them with harping irons, ſo that theſe people are happie. For there is nothing in the world ſo good as theſe freſh meats. And I find by my <note place="margin">The abuſe of <hi>Pithagoras.</hi>
                  </note>reckening that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was very ignorant, forbidding in his faire goulden ſentences the vſe of fiſhes without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. One may excuſe him, in that fiſh being dumbe hath ſome conformity with his ſect, wherein dumbneſſe (or ſilence) was much commended. It is alſo ſaid that he did it becauſe that fiſh is nouriſhed in an Element enemy to mankinde. Item that it is a great ſinne to kill and to eat a creature thar doth not hurt vs. Item that it is a delicious &amp; luxurious meat, not of neceſſity (as indeed in the <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphiques</hi> of <hi>Orus Apollo,</hi> fiſh is put for a marke of delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and voluptuouſneſſe) Item that he (the ſaid <hi>Pythagoras)</hi> did eat but meats that might be offered to the gods: which is not done with fiſhes: and other ſuch toies recited by <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Convivial</hi> queſtions. But all thoſe ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be fooliſh: and I would faine demand of ſuch a man if being in <hi>Canada</hi> he had rather die for hunger then to eat fiſh. So many anciently to follow their owne fancies, and to ſay theſe be we, haue forbidden their followers the vſe of meats that God hath giuen to man, and ſometimes laied yoakes vpon men that they themſelues would not beare. Now whatſoeuer the Philoſophy of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> is, I am none of his. I finde better the rule of our good religious men, which pleaſe themſelues in eating of fleſh, which I liked well in New France, neither am I yet diſpleaſed when I meet with ſuch fare.

And the <hi>Gaullois</hi> hauing done ſome notable ſeruice to the Emperour <hi>Probus,</hi> they demanded of him for recompence, permiſſion to plant Vines: which he granted vnto them: But they were firſt denied by the Emperor <hi>Nero.</hi> But why doe I aleadge the <hi>Gaullois,</hi> ſeeing that in Braſill, being a hot countrie, there
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:9921:150"/>
was none vntill that the Frenchmen and Portugeſes had planted ſome there: So there is no doubt but that the Vine will grow plentifully in the ſaid Port Royall, ſeeing likewiſe that at the riuer Saint Iohn (which is twentie leagues more Northward than the ſaid Port) there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them: yet for all that not ſo faire as in the countrie of the <hi>Armouchiquois,</hi> where it ſeemeth that <hi>Nature</hi> did delight herſelfe in planting of them there.</p>

               <p>They alſo plant great ſtore of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> a thing moſt precious with them, and vniverſally amongſt all thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is a plante of the bigneſſe of <hi>Conſolida maior,</hi> the <note place="margin">Tabacco and the vſe of it.</note>ſmoake whereof they ſucke vp with a pipe in that manner that I will declare vnto you, for the contentment of them that know not the vſe of it. After that they haue gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this hearbe, they lay it to dry in the ſhade, and haue certaine ſmall bagges of leather, hanging about their neckes or at their girdles, wherein they haue alwaies ſome and a Tabacco-pipe with all, which is a little pan hollowed at the one ſide, and within whoſe hole there is a long quill or pipe, out of which they ſucke vp the ſmoake, which is within the ſaid pan, after they put fire to it with a cole that they laie vpon it. They will ſometimes ſuffer hunger eight daies, hauing no other ſuſtenance then that ſmoake. And our Frenchmen who haue frequented them are ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:9921:151"/>
with this drunkenneſſe of Tabacco, that they can no more be without it, then without meat or drinke, and vpon that doe they ſpend good ſtore of mony.

But it is the more excuſable in the Sauages, by reaſon they haue no greater deliciouſneſſe in their <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bagies,</hi> or bankets, and can make cheere to them that come to viſit them with no greater thing, as in theſe our parts one preſents his friend with ſome excellent wine: In ſuch ſort that if one refuſeth to take the Tabacco-pipe, it is a <note place="margin">The Sauages doe thinke that God hath taken Tabacco.</note>ſigne that he is not a friend.

                  </note> The prouince of Braſill hath taken her name, as wee thinke, of a certaine tree which we call <hi>Breſill,</hi> and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages of the countrie <hi>Arabouton,</hi> it is high, and as bigge as our Oakes, and hath the leafe like to the Box leafe.

But hee that would thinke to whiten his linnen with the aſhes of that wood, would farre deceiue himſelfe. For he ſhould finde it died in redde. They haue alſo Palme trees of ſundry ſorts: And trees the wood whereof, of ſome, is yellow, and others violet. They haue alſo ſome that haue the ſent of Roſes, and others ſtinking, whoſe fruits are dangerous to be eaten. Item a kinde of <hi>Guayac</hi> which they name <hi>Hinouraé,</hi> which they vſe for to cure a diſeaſe called among them <hi>Pians,</hi> as dangerous as the Pox. The tree which beareth the fruit that wee call the Indian Nut, is called among them <hi>Sabaucaië.</hi> They haue alſo Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten trees, of the fruit whereof they make beds, which they hang betweene two forks or poſts. This countrie is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie in many other ſorts of fruit trees, as Orenge trees, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron trees, Leamon trees, and others, alwaies greene, whereby the loſſe of that countrie where the Frenchmen had begun to inhabite, is ſo much the more greeuous vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that loue the welfare of France. For it is more than euident, that the dwelling is there more pleaſant and delightfull then the land of <hi>Canada,</hi> for the temperature of the aire. True it is that the voiages thither are long, as of fower and fiue moneths, &amp; that in performing of them ſomtimes wants muſt be endured, as may be ſeene by the <note place="margin">The benefit of taking the ſeaſon of the yeare.</note>voiages made thither in the time of <hi>Ville-gagnon:</hi> But to New France where we were, when one beginneth his voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in due ſeaſon, the voiages are but of three weeks, or a moneth, which is but a ſmall time.</p>
               <p>If the ſweetneſſe and delicacies be not there, ſuch as they are in Perou, one muſt not ſay therefore that the countrie is nothing woorth. It is much that one may liue

there inreſt &amp; ioyfully without taking care for ſuperfluous things. The couetuouſneſſe of men hath cauſed that no countrie is thought good, vnleſſe there be Mines of gold in it. And ſots as they be, they doe not conſider that the <note place="margin">The deſpiſing of gold and ſiluer Mines.</note>country of France is now vnfurniſhed of the ſame: And Germany alſo, whereof <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaid, that he knew not whether the gods in their anger or in their fauour had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied gold and ſiluer to that Prouince. They doe not ſee that all the Indians haue not any vſe of ſiluer, and liue more contentedly then we. If we call them fooles they may ſay as much of vs, and peraduenture with better reaſon. They know not that God promiſing to his people a happy land he ſaith that it ſhall be a land of Corne, of Barly, of Vines, of Fig-trees, of Oliue-trees, and of Hony, where they ſhal <note place="margin">Deut 8 v. 8 <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

That it is a thing vnworthy to a man to bury himſelfe in the entrailes of the earth, to ſeeke out for hell, and miſerably to abaſe himſelfe vnder all vncleane creatures: He to whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen an vpright forme, and his face looking vpward, for to behold the Heauen, and to ſing praiſes vnto him: That in Countries where Mines be, the land is barren: That we doe not eat neither gold nor ſiluer, and that the ſame of it ſelfe doth not keepe vs warme in Winter: That he which
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:9921:154"/>
hath Corne in his Barne, Wine in his ſeller, Cattell in his Medowes, and afterwards Codde-fiſh and Beuers, is more aſſured to haue gold and ſiluer, then he which hath Mines <note place="margin">Mines in New France.</note>to finde victuals. And neuertheleſſe there be Mines in New France, as we haue mentioned elſewhere. But that is not the firſt thing that one muſt ſeeke for, men doe not liue with opinion onely.

But there may be drawen a generall commodity to France, that in the ſcarſity, of victuals, one Prouince may ſuccour the other: which might be done now if the Country were well inhabited: ſeeing that ſince we haue beene there the ſeaſons haue alwaies beene good in it, and in theſe our parts rough to the poore, which doe die for hunger, and liueth but in want and penury: in ſtead that there many might liue at their eaſe, who it were better to preſerue then to ſuffer to periſh.

               <p>Of exquiſit woods I know none there, but the Cedar and the <hi>Saſſafras:</hi> but good profit may be drawen from the Firre and Pruſe-trees, becauſe they will yeeld aboundance of gumme, and they die very often thorow ouer much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:9921:154"/>
and very ſoueraigne for medicines. I haue giuen ſome to ſome Churches of Paris for Frankenſence, which hath beene found very good. One may moreouer furniſh the Citie of Paris and other places of France with Sope-aſhes, <note place="margin">Sope aſhes.</note>which at this preſent be all bare and without woods.

So many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies as be in France ouercharged with Children, may diuide themſelues, and take there their portion with thoſe ſmall goods and moueables as they haue. Then time will diſcouer ſome thing a new: and one muſt helpe all the world, if it be poſſible. But the chiefeſt good one muſt aime at, is the eſtabliſhment of Chriſtian religion, in a Country where God is not knowen, and the conuerſion of theſe poore people, whoſe damnation crieth vengance againſt them that may, and ought to employ themſelues thereto, and to contribute, at leaſt with their names, to that effect, ſeeing that they gather vp the fat of the earth, and are conſtituted Stewards of the things of this world.</p>

That done they giue him his owne skinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, &amp; couer therewith the bones tied together with lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, faſhioning it euen ſo as if the fleſh had remained at it.</p>
               <p>It is a thing well knowen that the ancient <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did enbalme the dead bodies, and kept them carefully. Which (beſides the prophane Authours) is ſeene in the holy Scripture, where it is ſaid that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did commande his Seruants and Phiſitions to embalme the body of <hi>Iacob</hi>

From the Riuer of Saint Croix the ſaid deceaſſed <hi>Pano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac</hi> was brought into Port Royall, where againe he was wept for. But becauſe they are accuſtomed to make their lamentations for a long continuance of daies, as during a month fearing to offend vs by their cries (for as much as their cabins were but ſome fiue hundred paſſes off from our forte) <hi>Membertou</hi> came to intreat <hi>Monſieur de Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trincourt</hi> not to diſlike that they ſhould mourne after their wonted manner, and that they would be but eight daies in performing of it. Which he eaſily granted them: And then afterwards they began the next day following, at the breake of day, their weepings and cryings, which we did heare from our ſaid fort, taking ſome intermiſſion on the middeſt of the day. And they mourne by intermiſſion eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cabin his day, and euery perſon his turne.</p>
               <p>It is a thing woorthy maruelling that nations ſo far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant doe agree in thoſe ceremonies with many of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world. For in ancient times the <hi>Perſians</hi> (as we read in many places of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> did make ſuch lamentation, did rent their garments, did couer their heads, did cloath themſelues with a mourning garment, which the holy Scripture doth call <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> and <hi>Ioſephus Schema tapeinon.</hi> Alſo they ſhaued themſelues, and their horſes and mules, as the learned <hi>Druſius</hi> hath noted in <note place="margin">Eſter. 4. v. <hi>Druſ. obſeru.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</note>his obſeruations, alleaging for this purpoſe both <hi>Herodote</hi> and <hi>Plutarch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Aegyptians did as much, and peraduenture more, in that which concerneth lamentations. For after the death of the holy I Fatriarke <hi>Iacob,</hi> All the ancients, men of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the Counſellers of the houſe of <hi>Pharao,</hi> and of the Countrie of Aegypt went vp in great multitude euen as far as to the corne floore of <hi>Atad</hi> in Canaan, and did weepe for him with great and grieuous complaints: In ſuch ſort that the Cananites ſeeing it did ſay: This mourning is grieuous to the <hi>Aegyptians:</hi> and for the greatneſſe and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelty of the ſame mourning they called the ſaid floore

               </p>
               <p>The Romans had hired women to weepe for the dead, and to relate their praiſes by long mournefull complaints: and thoſe women were called <hi>Praeficae,</hi> as it were <hi>Praefectae,</hi> becauſe that they did beginne the motion when it was needefull to lament, and to relate the praiſes of the dead.</p>

               <p>I will not heere make a collection of all the cuſtomes of other nations: for it would neuer be at an end: But in France euery one knoweth that the women of Picardy do lament their dead with great clamors. <hi>Monſieur des Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> amongſt other things by him collected reciteth of one, who making her funerall complaints, that ſhe ſaid to her deceaſſed husband: Good God!

For they recount during the time of a whole day the whole life of their husbands. <hi>Lamia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mou, la mi amou: Cara rident, oeil de ſplendou: Cama leugé bet danſadou: lo mé balen balem, lo m'eſburbat: mati de pes: fort tard cougat:</hi> and ſuch like things: That is to ſay; <hi>My loue, my loue: ſmiling countenance: bright eie: nimble legge: and good dancer: mine owne valiant, mine owne valiant: ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vp, and late a bedde</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>As for the Indians of <hi>Florida,</hi> when any of their <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſtis</hi> dieth they weepe three daies and three nights con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually and without eating: And all the <hi>Paraouſtis,</hi> that be his allies and friendes, doe the like mourning, cutting halfe their haires as well men as women in token of loue.

                  <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> doe ſay, that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> (chiefly in their Kings funerals) did rent their garments, and beſmeered their faces, yea all their heads: and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelues twiſe a day, did march in round, ſinging the vertues of their King: did abſtaine from ſodden meats, from liuing creatures, from wine, and from all daintie fare during the ſpace of 70. daies, without any waſhing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on any bed, much leſſe to haue the company of their wiues: alwaies lamenting.</p>

Notwithſtanding becauſe that we are men, ſubiect to ioy, to griefe, and to other motions and perturbations of minde, which at the firſt motion are not in our power, as ſaith the Philoſopher, weeping is not a thing to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whether it be in conſidering our fraile condition, and ſubiect to ſo many harmes, be it for the loſſe of that which we did loue and held deerely.

               <p>We Chriſtians doe commonly bury the dead bodies, that is to ſay, we yeeld them to the earth (called <hi>Humus,</hi> from whence commeth the word <hi>Homo a Man)</hi> from which they were taken, and ſo did the ancient Romans before the cuſtome of burning them. Which amongſt the Weſt Indians the Braſilians doe, who put their dead into pits digged after the forme of a tunne, almoſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, ſometimes in their owne houſes, like to the firſt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, according as <hi>Seruius</hi> the Commentor of <hi>Virgill</hi> doth ſay. But our ſauages as far as <hi>Perou</hi> do not ſo, but rather do keepe them whole in Sepulchers, which be in many places as ſcaffoldes of nine and ten foote height. the rooffe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is all couered with mattes, whereuponthey ſtretch out their dead rancked according to the order of their deceaſe. So almoſt our Sauages doe, ſauing that their ſepulchers are leſſer and lower, made after the forme of Cages, which they couer very properly, and there they lay their dead.

Which we call to bury, and not to interre ſeeing they are not within the earth.</p>
               <p>Now although that many nations haue thought good to keepe the dead bodies: yet it is better to follow that which nature requireth, which is, to render to the earth that which belongeth vnto her, which (as <hi>Lucrece</hi> ſaith)

               <p>Our Sauages are more kinde then ſo, and haue all that which the office of humanitie may deſire, yea euen more. For after they haue brought the dead to his reſt, euery one maketh him a preſent of the beſt thing he hath.

               <p>So then our Sauages are not excuſable in putting all the beſt ornamentes they haue into the Sepulchers of the dead, ſeeing they might reape commodity by them.
