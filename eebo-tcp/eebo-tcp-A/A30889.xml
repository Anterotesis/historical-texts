            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>LET us now speak a little of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> if in treating of so great a Subject it may be lawful to say but little. Do not thou, O Lord, leave us, to whom thou hast left thy self; but restore Sight to the blinded <hi>Sectaries,</hi> that they may courageously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this thy Gift, which is so wonderfully great, that they believe it not only above themselves to Receive, but also above thee to Give. For, as nothing more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deters the <hi>Jews</hi> from embracing the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> than their being oblig'd to believe in it, that the living GOD, the GOD of <hi>Abraham,</hi> became Man, led a mortal Life, and died on a <hi>Cross</hi>: So nothing more offends many of our <hi>Sectaries</hi> than the Excellency of this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> whilst they cannot persuade themselves, the Bounty of CHRIST could ever make him stoop so low, as to permit that very Body to be held in the Hands of <hi>Priests,</hi> and receiv'd by the Mouths of <hi>Sinners,</hi> which, having been once extended on the <hi>Cross,</hi> now <hi>sits in Glory at the Right-hand of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45225:3"/>But there is not, O ye <hi>Sectaries,</hi> any greater prejudice against you, than the universal Agreement of all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> in their Belief of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> at such time, as you first began to appear, and the exceeding great Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongst your selves in this your Errour. Is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that there was then no Church in the World, which had a right Belief of this <hi>Sacrament</hi>? Or must we think, the Spirit of Truth resides in you, who in this so great Affair contest more fiercely with one another, than with Us? All <hi>Christians</hi> in the World, <hi>Latines, Greeks, Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Abissines</hi> and <hi>Muscovites,</hi> had at that time one and the same Sense of that Sacred Mystery. They all, I say, (except a few <hi>Hussites</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who as they were none of Ours, so neither are they Yours, there not being any amongst you altogether of this Opinion concerning the <hi>Eucharist</hi>) agreed with Us (and still do) that under the <hi>Species</hi> or Appearance of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of CHRIST are really Conceal'd; that there is no <hi>Bread,</hi> no <hi>Wine</hi> remaining; that the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be Ador'd, because there is in it no other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance but CHRIST himself.</p>
               <p>But you, O ye <hi>Sectaries,</hi> were nothing mov'd with this general Consent of <hi>Christians.</hi> You departed from them all, that is, you resolv'd to be <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Nor did you all take one way; but having once left the well known Path of the Church, <hi>You wander'd in your own Inventions:</hi> So that if any one enquires, what your Thoughts are of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> you are fain to tell him a long Story, which in the end wants an <hi>Oedipus</hi> to unfold it. For so numerous are your Dissensions concerning this Point, that there are reckon'd amongst you above fourty different Opinions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together contrary to each other. Nay farther, you do not sufficiently explain, or to speak more truly, do not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, what the several <hi>Sects</hi> amongst you hold. Those of you which follow <hi>Luther,</hi> confess, that our Lords <hi>Body</hi> is really contain'd in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> though they think withall the <hi>Bread</hi> still to remain. The <hi>Hugonots, English
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45225:3"/>
Protestants,</hi> and other <hi>Calvinists</hi> affirm on the contrary, that it is nothing but meer <hi>Bread</hi>; because, say they, CHRIST <hi>is sitting at the Right-hand of the Father,</hi> and therefore cannot be in several places. Others think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; But these two are the most eminent Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mongst you. Let us now see, how absurd they both are.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lutherans</hi> confessing CHRIST's Body <hi>to be really present,</hi> deny nevertheless, that 'tis to be Ador'd. And behold, how excellently they Reason! For, say they, CHRIST instituted not this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that it might be Ador'd, but that it might feed our Souls. Why do they not also say, that Kings and Princes ride a Hunting for Recreation, and not to be Reverenc'd by their Subjects: And that they are therefore mistaken, who, when they meet their King, as he is Hunting, pay him the Respect, due to their Soveraign? CHRIST was on the <hi>Cross, That he might save the Souls of many,</hi> and bear the Reproach, which was due to us; not that he might be there Ador'd. Hadst thou, O <hi>Lutheran,</hi> been then present, wouldst thou have thought it a Crime to have Prostrated thy self on Earth, and Ador'd him hanging on the <hi>Cross.</hi> What madness is it in thee, not to Adore CHRIST, wherever he is; who, wherever he is, is GOD, the Disposer of thy Life, and Judge of thy Soul?</p>
               <p>But this Opinion of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> which asserts the <hi>Bread</hi> to remain in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> is no less contrary to Scripture, than to the Doctrine of the Primitive Church. For if the Bread and CHRIT's Body were both there, CHRIST would not have said, <hi>This,</hi> but here, <hi>is my Body</hi>; nor yet would he have said, <hi>The Bread,</hi> but In the Bread, <hi>which I will give is my Flesh.</hi> And if the Church in the Apostles Time had not believ'd with Us, that there is no Substance of <hi>Bread</hi> remaining in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> St. <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> would not have written, that this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> after the words of Consecration are pronounc'd, <hi>Is the Flesh and Blood of that Incarnate Jesus</hi>; but that after the Consecration, that Flesh and that Blood are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45225:4"/>
added to the <hi>Eucharistical Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine:</hi> Nor yet would St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> have us'd these words, <hi>This which We see, is not Bread, though the taste thinks it to be Bread; but 'tis the Body of</hi> CHRIST; But he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have taught Us, that the Bread, which is seen, is Bread, and the Taste not deceiv'd in it; but that with the Bread is joyn'd CHRIT's Body.</p>
               <p>Nor do the <hi>Calvinists</hi> talk more wisely, when they say, that CHRIST's Body is not really present in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>; but yet that we are really Partakers of it. An Opinion so Foolish, and so Destructive to it Self, that they themselves understand it not. For tell me, O <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> canst thou really receive CHRIST's Body, and CHRIST not be really present? But thou sayst, He is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in Heaven; and cannot be in several places at once. Thou then being only on Earth, and he only in Heaven, how can his Body really come to thee? And when at the same Instant thou Communicat'st at <hi>London,</hi> another at <hi>Geneva,</hi> by what Art can it be effected, that ye should be really Fed with CHRIST's Body, if CHRIST cannot be really present in two places at once?</p>
               <p>Wilt thou say, that thy Soul by Faith flies up into Heaven, and is there really Fed with this Holy Food? This is nothing to the purpose. For though thou mayst by Faith, by Thought, by Will mount above the <hi>Stars,</hi> and Converse in the midst of Heaven; yet art thou still really on Earth: Nor is any part of thee; that is, either thy Mind, or Body <hi>really</hi> in Heaven, there to receive Nourishment. Shouldst thou never so Seriously fix thy Thoughts on <hi>Rome,</hi> or on <hi>Hierusalem</hi>; couldst thou be therefore said to be really at <hi>Rome,</hi> or in <hi>Hierusalem?</hi> It remains therefore, that thou shew, how thy Soul, which ascends not really into Heaven, can be really Fed with the Flesh of CHRIST, unless CHRIST be truly and really on Earth, and there also in many places at one and the same time, since many of you at the very same moment Communicate both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45225:4"/>But thou wilt Reply, thou art indeed ignorant of the manner; yet certainly knowst, that thou art Fed. Is it so? If thou knowst not, by what means these things are done, then art thou not sure, but it may be by <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation.</hi> Why then dost thou with so great Boldness and Fury inveigh against it? But be it, that thou knowst not the Manner; yet thou at least knowst, that the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is such, as may not in Thought and Faith only, but in very Deed, joyn thee to CHRIST's Body, or else thou must confess, that thou dost not indeed receive CHRIST's Body.</p>
               <p>For thou sayst, that by <hi>Faith</hi> thou eatest our Lords Body. Now what doest thou mean by these words? That thou by Faith hold'st and believ'st, Vertue so to flow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Soul from the Body of CHRIST, who is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that thou art thereby in some sort united to him? But this, O <hi>Sectary,</hi> is not really to receive CHRIST's Body, 'tis at most to receive it but imaginarily. For that Power, and those Vertues, which thou say'st, flow from CHRIST into thee, are not indeed CHRIST's Body: And thou believest that thou receivest really nothing else. Nor dost thou, I suppose, eat these Vertues. Why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to elude the Sentence of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who testify, That CHRIST's <hi>Flesh and Blood is in very deed receiv'd</hi>; do you make use of such vain Deceits, saying, that you also hold the same? But if thou say'st, that thou <hi>by Faith</hi> apprehend'st, and believ'st CHRIST's Body to be really Communicated to thee; I answer, that this Faith of thine is, even in thine own Judgement, false and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, as making thee believe, that which is not: Since in thy Opinion our Lords Body is no where but in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and thou art really no where but on Earth.</p>
               <p>But because thou frequently appeal'st to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> come and let us hear, what they say. In St. <hi>Matthew</hi> (Chap. xxvi.) our Saviour says, <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood</hi>: In St. <hi>Mark</hi> (Chap. xiv.) <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood</hi>: In St. <hi>Luke</hi> (Chap. xxii.) <hi>This is my Body; this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45225:5"/>
is the Chalice of the New Testament in my Blood</hi>: In St. <hi>John</hi> (Chap. vi.) <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nless ye shall eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye shall not have Life in you:</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (ch. xi.) pronounces him who comes unworthily to the <hi>Eucharist, Guilty of the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi> These are plain Words, no perplex'd Testimonies, nor things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd but once. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> you, ye stick close to the letter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse all Interpretation, and cry out, we must adhere to the Word of GOD. As if you were the sole Judges, and had Authority, at your pleasure, one while to decide by the bare Text of Scripture, without admitting any Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor; and soon after to appeal to Interpretations, and those only of your own Invention.</p>
               <p>But come on: What do you object against us? Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you say, taken out of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> First, that the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is sometimes in the <hi>Scripture</hi> call'd <hi>Bread and Wine.</hi> Next, that CHRIST said in St. <hi>John</hi> (chap. vi.) <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the Flesh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The words, which I have spoken unto you, are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Life.</hi> Lastly, That CHRIST sits at the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of the Father, and shall come from thence to Judge the quick and the dead. But I answer, that these words are more obscure, than those you would have explain'd by them, to wit, <hi>This is my Body; my Flesh is Meat indeed.</hi> Now what kind of <hi>Philosophy</hi> is this, to explain one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity by a greater; or, that I may speak more truly, to gather the Sense of a clear place from a dark one? But what, if we should say, that these Places, you object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, are to be interpreted by those, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd? What if we deny, that you have any more Right to expound them, than we? You bring only doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Arguments, and such, as will be turn'd upon your selves. Nor will it be any great labour briefly to solve them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45225:5"/>The <hi>Eucharist,</hi> you say, is in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> call'd <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> you say, acknowledge <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to be truly in that <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Proceed, <hi>Sectary,</hi> and by the same Argument more closely press us in this manner. The <hi>Catholicks</hi> in their Discourses and Prayers frequently call the <hi>Eucharist</hi> Bread: They believe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that there is in it true <hi>Bread</hi>; and not only our <hi>Lords Body.</hi> Is not the reason and strength of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the same? Why will you rather make the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> when they mention the <hi>Eucharist</hi> by the Name of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> to assert true <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to be therein, than us <hi>Catholicks,</hi> when we call it by the same Names?</p>
               <p>Give me leave therefore thus to retort this Argument upon you. In the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> we often term the <hi>Eucharist Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi>; and yet believe not any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Bread</hi> or <hi>Wine</hi> to be therein. Therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> using the same Names, be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they acknowledge true <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in it. Lay aside, <hi>Sectary,</hi> the prejudice of thy <hi>Faction,</hi> and tell me, whether thou art not more justly overthrown by the same Argument, with which thou assaulted'st us. For, that we often style this <hi>Sacrament Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> is so well known to those, who live amongst us, that 'twere Impudence to deny it, and gross Ignorance not to know it. How often do we desire, that not only the Eating, but the Effect of this <hi>Bread</hi> may be granted us? How often do we beg of GOD the Father, that this <hi>Bread</hi> may be to us not a pledge of Death, but of Glory? And all this by Similitudes and Figures. Which kind of Speeches you your selves also do not deny to be frequent in Holy Writ. So St. <hi>Bernard</hi> (whom none can without blushing deny to be ours) calls the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist Bread,</hi> when in his first Sermon on the sixth <hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Pentecost</hi> distinguishing <hi>Bread</hi> into several <hi>Species,</hi> he says, <hi>Moreover the seventh kind of Bread is the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, because our Saviour says, the Bread, which I give, is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45225:6"/>
my Flesh for the Life of the World.</hi> We therefore with the <hi>Scriptures</hi> call this Sacrament Bread: Both because, as the Natural Man lives by Bread, so does the Spiritual Man by the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> To signify which, CHRIST commanded it to be made of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and many of the <hi>Fathers</hi> by <hi>Our daily Supersubstantial Bread,</hi> which we are taught to Pray for, understand this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Food. And also, because it is in the Form of <hi>Bread</hi>; but principally because 'twas <hi>Bread</hi> before. For we often call a thing, that now is, by the Name it formerly had. And how often have you heard from our <hi>Writers</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod, which, being turn'd into a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> was certainly no longer a <hi>Rod,</hi> unless you will say, that GOD rather put an Illusion on <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Eyes, than by a real Miracle admonish'd him of his Majesty; and yet even then it was call'd a <hi>Rod</hi>: to wit, Because it had from a <hi>Rod</hi> been chang'd into a <hi>Serpent: And they all cast down their Rods, which were turn'd into Serpents; but</hi> Aaron<hi>'s Rod devour'd their Rods,</hi> Exod. Chap. vii. But not to say much against so weak an Argument. The <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> call the <hi>Eucharist Bread:</hi> Be it so. The <hi>Antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> have often done the same: And we also do the same. Why then may we not be believ'd to think with those, with whom we speak?</p>
               <p>Nor is the Arrow of any greater force, they shoot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us from these words of our Lord: <hi>It is the Spirit which quickneth, the Flesh profiteth nothing.</hi> For if they will have them simply understood, <hi>That the Flesh of Christ profiteth nothing</hi>; I would ask them, why they then say, that our <hi>Lord's Body</hi> is receiv'd by them in the <hi>Eucharist:</hi> Nay, why CHRIST said, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nless ye shall Eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and Drink his Blood, ye shall not have Life in you.</hi> Do they think that CHRIST contradicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? Or will they deny it to have been always believ'd in the Church, that CHRIST's <hi>Flesh profiteth the Receiver</hi>? They must ever be fain to distinguish between the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45225:6"/>
how our Lord's Flesh, being receiv'd, profits, and how it profits not. They must, to wit, acknowledge, that the <hi>Capharnaits</hi> hearing CHRIST's Words, fancy'd to themselves some gross, unworthy, and carnal manner, in which he would affirm, he should be eaten: <hi>My Flesh so taken, as you in your selves imagine, profits not: I will give my self in a more Noble and Spiritual manner than you believe. and being by you taken for Food, will quicken your Souls.</hi> And thus of the manner of taking, and not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the taking it self, did CHRIST say, <hi>The Flesh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing.</hi> Let us now see the Force of your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. CHRIST says, <hi>His Flesh taken as the</hi> Capharnaits <hi>fancy'd, will profit nothing</hi>: Therefore, say you, it will not profit, being taken in such manner, as the <hi>Catholicks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: But thou must first, O <hi>Sectary,</hi> prove, that we think, as the <hi>Capharnaits</hi> did, and that we will not hear the Spirit, <hi>which quickens.</hi> Now both these are false. The <hi>Capharnaits,</hi> as is manifest from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> had no higher conceit of our Saviours words, than that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, His Body should be eaten as other Meats; that it should be divided into parts, taste like Flesh, and being taken Consume. We in a <hi>Spiritual quickning Sense</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that CHRIST is indeed truly and really present in the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> but after a Spiritual and Incomprehensible manner; that he is receiv'd by us, whole, inviolate, and never consuming. Thus will there be a mutual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between those words of our Lord, by which he asserts, that <hi>His Flesh is truly given for Meat</hi>; and those others, by which he shews, that, if you understand this matter Carnally with the <hi>Capharnaits, The Flesh profiteth nothing.</hi> Now if you deny, that <hi>the Flesh of our Lord</hi> is any way profitable, you will contradict those words, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nless ye shall Eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, ye shall not have Life in you.</hi> But if you say, that 'tis in some man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but not in that <hi>Capharnaitical</hi> one, both receiv'd and profitable: This indeed we shall readily grant, but shall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45225:7"/>
withall add, that this Holy manner is in our Church, and that neither these Texts, nor any other, have any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>You say lastly, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> often affirm, that CHRIST is, and shall be in Heaven, till he shall come in great Majesty at the end of the World: And that therefore he cannot be on Earth, in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> in the Hands of the <hi>Priests.</hi> The Answer is ready. CHRIST is and shall be in Heaven in that great and visible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty till the end of the World. He is not seen publickly by us in that Brightness, nor is he yet so much as Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant amongst us, to receive those Offices, which may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed profitable to a Body. Such, as St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, when she Anointed him, and in respect of which our Saviour said, <hi>The poor you have always with you; but me you have not always.</hi> He will not therefore come down from Heaven <hi>In the Glory of His Majesty</hi> till the calling of all Men to Judgment. But he is often present at our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in another manner, after another Fashion, with lesser State; he is, I say, often truly and really present with us here on Earth. He appear'd in the way to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as he was going to <hi>Damascus,</hi> and spake to him in the way. So says <hi>Ananias</hi> to St. <hi>Paul</hi> (Act. ix.) <hi>Our Lord</hi> JESUS <hi>hath sent me, who appear'd to thee in the way, as thou camest.</hi> And <hi>Barnabas</hi> declar'd to the Apostles, <hi>How</hi> Paul <hi>had seen our Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him.</hi> And (<hi>Acts</hi> xxxiii.) <hi>Now the night following our Lord, standing by him, said, Be constant, for as thou hast testify'd of me in</hi> Hierusalem, <hi>so must thou testify at</hi> Rome <hi>also.</hi> And lastly, (Act. xxvi.) <hi>I am</hi> JESUS, <hi>whom thou Persecutest. But arise, and stand upon thy feet: For to this end have I appear'd to thee, that I may ordain thee a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Witness of those things, which thou hast seen, and of those things, in which I will appear to thee.</hi> And say not, that, 'twas an Angel, who having taken CHRIST's shape, appear'd to St. <hi>Paul.</hi> For to let pass its being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45225:7"/>
in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> when our Saviour or when an Angel appear'd to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he himself has in his first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (Chap. xv.) taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the doubt, where, after he had, to prove CHRIST's Resurrection to them, affirm'd him to have been seen after his rising again by his Apostles and Disciples, he adds, <hi>And last of all he was seen of me also, as of an Abortive.</hi> Now 'tis certain, that this his being seen of St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not till some years after the day of his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: For St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a long time a Persecutor, not an Apostle. 'Tis certain also, that 'twas not an Angel, but CHRIST himself, who thus appear'd to St. <hi>Paul</hi>: Since he affirms him to have been the same, that was seen by St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apostles, to assure them of his Resurrection. For sure thou wilt not say, that 'twas an Angel, and not our Lord himself, that appear'd to the Apostles during the fourty days, which were between the <hi>Pasch</hi> and his <hi>Ascension.</hi> Childish moreover would St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Argument be, were it thus to be understood, that CHRIST was undoubtedly risen, because he had seen an Angel in CHRIST's Shape. Our Lord was then really present <hi>on Earth</hi> with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and has been so with several other Saints. He is really also present with us in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but cover'd with the Form of a Creature, and under Vails, that conceal the Creator.</p>
               <p>And do'st thou still say, thou doubt'st, whether the Body, which is in Heaven, can be also on Earth? Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, <hi>Sectary,</hi> it can. Our Lord's Body can be at one time in two several places: And if in two, why not in Infinite? For what hinders our Bodies, that they cannot be at once in several places? Is it not the condition of our Nature? But why cannot he, who fram'd our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, change also its Laws? This is the humble Learning, this is the <hi>Christian Phylosophy</hi> of the Primitive Church. St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> (lib. 11 <hi>Hexam.</hi> cap. 11.) has this Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: <hi>Since his Word is the beginning of Nature, he may
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45225:8"/>
by right assume the giving the Law to Nature, who gave it its Original.</hi> And again (lib. 3. <hi>Hexam</hi> cap. 11.) <hi>The Word of GOD is the efficient Cause of Nature.</hi> But this perhaps thou can'st not sufficiently comprehend: No more indeed canst thou comprehend GOD; and yet GOD is is not therefore less GOD. If thou measurest the Works of GOD by the extent of thy Understanding, how weak, how obscure, how depending on thy self thou wilt make him! Thy Strength of Understanding depends on him, and not his Power on thy Understanding.</p>
               <p>But is there any greater difficulty in granting one Body to be in several Places, than two Bodies to be in one; or admitting, as the <hi>Ppilosophers</hi> speak, <hi>A Penetration of Dimensions?</hi> The difficulty is altogether equal. Now CHRIST brought his reviv'd Body through Stone, <hi>Which was very great at the Door of the Monument,</hi> that is, he shew'd, there might be a <hi>Penetration of Dimensions,</hi> whenever he pleas'd: For the Stone was not roll'd away by the Angel, till St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> came to Anoint our Lord. Mary Magdalen <hi>came, and the other</hi> Mary <hi>to see the Sepulchre: And behold there was a great Earthquake: For the Angel of our Lord descended from Heaven, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing roll'd back the Stone, and sate upon it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the Angel Answering, said to the Women, Fear not you,</hi> Mat. chap. 28. After Christ came to his Disciples through close and solid Walls. <hi>And when it was late that day, the first of the Sabbaths, and the Doors were shut, where the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were gathered together for fear of the</hi> Jews, <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S came, and stood in the midst,</hi> &amp;c. Joh. chap. 20. Again, <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S came, the Doors being shut, and stood in the midst.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here some of you are not asham'd to pretend certain unworthy Trifles, that CHRIST perhaps came in at the Window, or descended by the Tunnel of the Chimney, or open'd the Doors, which before were shut: An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent saying, proceeding, if I am not mistaken, from men, who seek to gain Repute by inconsiderate Cavilling.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45225:8"/>
Is it then to no purpose, that we hear these Words so carefully repeated: <hi>When the Doors were shut: The Doors being shut?</hi> To what end did St. <hi>John</hi> use these Words, but to signify CHRIST's miraculous Entrance, at which himself was present? Why did he not add, that he came in at the Window, or the Chimney, or by opening the Doors, the shutting of which he had so distinctly noted: That he entred then, O <hi>Sectary,</hi> the Doors being shut, is nothing else, but that he entred against the Laws of Nature through the said Doors. <hi>Moreover,</hi> says St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> in his first Book against <hi>Jovinian, He so entred the Doors being shut, which the Nature of Humane Bodies suffers not: Shall we therefore deny that our Lord and St.</hi> Peter <hi>had true Bodies, because contrary to Nature they walk'd on the Waters</hi>? St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> on the four and twentieth Chapter of St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospel has these Words: <hi>But St.</hi> Thomas <hi>had just cause of Admiration, when he saw a Body brought in through Places unpassable to Bodies, all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shut, and no place broken. And 'twas therefore a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, how a Corporal Nature should introduce it self through an in penetrable Body, by an invisible Passage, in a visible appearance, easie to be touch'd, hard to be understood.</hi> And in the same place, <hi>Though St.</hi> Peter <hi>believ'd the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, yet might he be troubled, when he saw our Lord on a suddain with his Body come in upon them into those places, which were incompass'd with lock'd Doors, and close Walls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor did CHRIST at his Resurrection only, but at his Birth also shew this <hi>Penetration of Dimensions,</hi> coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World from the Womb of his most Holy Mother without violating the Enclosers of her Virginity. St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in his two and twentieth Book of the City of GOD (chap. 8.) relates to this purpose a famous Miracle, hapening in his time. He says, <hi>That</hi> Patronia <hi>a</hi> Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian <hi>Matron, had obtain'd from a</hi> Jew <hi>a certain Ring, which she wore bound to her naked Body with a Girdle for the Cure of her Disease. That, she going afterwards in Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45225:9"/>
to the Relicks of St.</hi> Stephen; <hi>the Ring which she wore, fell from her whole and unhurt; the Girdle to which it was ty'd, remaining whole also; that the</hi> Judaical <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy might by a</hi> Christian <hi>Miracle be remov'd from this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man before she was heal'd through the Martyrs Intercession.</hi> He further adds, <hi>They believe not this, who believe not, that our Lord JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S was brought forth without detriment to his Mothers Virginity, and went in to his Disciples the Doors being shut. But let them indeed enquire of this, and if they find it true, believe those. She is a Woman of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, nobly Born, nobly Married, and dwelling at</hi> Carthage; <hi>The largeness of the City, and the Dignity of the Person will not suffer the Truth to be conceal'd from the Enquirers. The Martyr himself, by whose Intercession she was Cur<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly believ'd in the Son of her, who remains a Virgin; in Him, who went in to his Disciples, the Doors being shut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These then are the <hi>Scripture Histories</hi> of our Lords Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and Resurrection; this the Primitive Churches Sense of those Histories; that two Bodies may, GOD commanding it, be together in the same place; or, to speak with the <hi>Phylosopbers,</hi> that there may be a <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of Dimensions</hi> by the Divine Power. Now 'tis certainly no less repugnant to humane Sense and Nature, that two Bodies should be thus together in one place, than that one should be at the same time in many. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty on both sides is not only alike, but the very same. The Church has always acknowledg'd both of them above the force of Nature, but below the Power of GOD, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ever taught her Children, that CHRIST both pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated the Walls, and is present in the <hi>Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in several places at once.</p>
               <p>But there are three things, which you, O <hi>Sectaries,</hi> cannot well digest: The Name of <hi>Mass,</hi> the <hi>Eucharists</hi> being term'd a <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> and lastly the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> The <hi>Mass</hi> is to you so hateful a Word, that the Hating of it is amongst you a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45225:9"/>
token of Love. And yet, were it not, that I confine my self to that briefness, I began with, it might abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly be shewn, that this Holy Word has always been us'd to signify the Celebration of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> 'Tis now about thirteen hundred years, since the time of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> who in his Epistle to <hi>Marcellina,</hi> says, <hi>I began to say Mass:</hi> And soon after, <hi>I began to Pray unto GOD in the Oblation, that he would help,</hi> &amp;c. St. <hi>Telesphorus</hi> Pope and Martyr, who might for his Age have seen St. <hi>John</hi> the Apostle, testifies the <hi>Mass</hi> to have been in his Time, ordaining many things in the Celebration of it: Which very thing the <hi>Sectaries</hi> themselves confess. For the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburgians</hi> in their second Century (cap. 10.) blame him for <hi>Multiplying Masses, encreasing their Ceremonies, and tying them to a certain time.</hi> Behold, how, whilst they unwarily accuse <hi>Telesphorus,</hi> they acknowledge the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of the <hi>Mass:</hi> Confessing even the Name to have been us'd in the very beginning of the Primitive Church. But whatever becomes of the Name, let us consider the thing it self.</p>
               <p>We say, that the Celebration of the <hi>Mass</hi> is a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice truly and properly Propitiatory. You, or rather some of you deny it; for the more Learned agree, at least tacitly, with us. <hi>Isaac Casaubon</hi> but few Months before his Death being in the Presence Chamber of the most Serene King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> I fell in Discourse with him, as did also another Gentleman, a Courtier, but no <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>; whom, were it necessary, I could easily Name. Passing from one thing to another, we hap'ned amongst the rest upon the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> which I earnestly defending, <hi>You need not,</hi> (said <hi>Casaubon) take all this pains, I willingly profess, and do assert it to be manifest from the Rites of the Antient Church, that the</hi> Eucharist <hi>is a Sacrifice; and not only a Sacrifice of Praise, as many amongst us would have it, but a Propitiatory Sacrifice</hi>; Sacrificium <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. These were his very Words: Thus did he in two Languages
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45225:10"/>
express, what kind of Sacrifice he thought it to be. I was not a little glad to hear him; whilst the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who was present at our Discourse, wondred at this his Opinion, affirming, that he was more startled at these words, than at <hi>an hundred Arguments of the Papists.</hi> He can testify the Truth of this, being still alive, and daily attending on the King. And he has been so far from being a <hi>Catholick,</hi> that it cannot be fear'd, he would advantage us by speaking contrary to the Truth.</p>
               <p>And the Oblation indeed of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the <hi>Fathers</hi> call'd <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> that the <hi>Sectaries</hi> no longer dispute with us about the Name; but only about what is to be understood by it. <hi>It cannot,</hi> (says <hi>Kemnitius) be deny'd, that the Antients, when they spake of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Lords Supper, us'd the words Sacrifice, Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Oblation, Host, and Victim; as also the Verbs to Offer, Sacrifice, and Immolate.</hi> Hear therefore, <hi>Sectary,</hi> but St. <hi>Augustin</hi> alone, and thou wilt say, that the Church in his Age us'd not these Words as borrowed or <hi>Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively taken,</hi> but understood them in their proper, true and usual Sense; that the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is a true Sacrifice, properly so call'd, and Propitiatory not for the Living only, but also for the Dead.</p>
               <p>He relates therefore in the ninth Book of his <hi>Confessions</hi> (Ch. 11.) that his dying Mother spake thus, <hi>Lay this Body any where, let not the Care of it trouble you in the least: This only I desire of you, that when you shall be present at our Lords Altar, you will there remember me.</hi> And again, (Chap. 13.) he says of her, <hi>She thought not of having her Body Sumptuously Bury'd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>She commanded us not this, but only requested, that she might be remembred at thy Altar, where she had without one days Intermission constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serv'd, whence she knew the Holy Victim to be dispens'd, by which the Hand-writing that was against us, is blotted out.</hi> He had also before (Chap. 12.) said more plainly; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, when her Corps was carry'd out, we went and return'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45225:10"/>
without Tears. Nor did I so much as weep at those Prayers, we pour'd forth to thee, when the Sacrifice of our Redemption was offer'd for her; her Body now being plac'd near the Grave, before it was deposited therein, as the Custom there is; but I was all the day in secret exceeding sad,</hi> &amp;c. Thou hear'st now, O <hi>Sectary,</hi> not only St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Mother, not only St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> but the very Custom and Sense of the Church in that Age. <hi>When the Sacrifice of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was offer'd for her.</hi> Here thou hast three things: That the Oblation of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is a Sacrifice; that 'tis also Propitiatory. For in vain, or impiously would the Church offer a Sacrifice to our Lord for the Dead, which could not render him Propitious to them. Thou hast lastly, The Church in that Age, wherein, you are wont to say, she was yet Pure, by Publick Consent Praying for the Dead. Hence the Matter is so clear and certain, that the Blindness of those is to be lamented, who refuse so clear a Light.</p>
               <p>Now what is their Complaint against <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>? Does the Word offend them? Or the Thing, that is signify'd by this Word? They say, 'tis a <hi>Popish Fiction,</hi> sprung up under <hi>Innocent</hi> III. in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council. To wit, Because <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is there manifestly Decreed. Now, I ask, <hi>Sectary,</hi> if Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd this Faith to us, who deliver'd it to the <hi>Greeks</hi>? For certainly they wholly agree with us in this matter. Would they, who have rejected our Communion, who hate the very Name of the <hi>Roman Pontifs,</hi> have all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally admitted, and inviolably held such a Doctrine, of so great moment, so newly (as you would have it) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd by the <hi>Latins</hi>? But they have not the Word <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi> What then? They hold and believe th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Thing. For they believe that the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> after Consecration cease to be such, and that instead of them succeed the true <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of our Lord. Why then may we not believe, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> holds
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45225:11"/>
still the same Faith, which she held, before the Word <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> came into use; when the <hi>Greeks</hi> at this very day use not the Word <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and yet have in this matter altogether the same Belief with the <hi>Romans</hi>? Was not the Holy Trinity believ'd to be <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mousian</hi> or Consubstantial, before the Word <hi>Homousian</hi> was ever taken up? What matter is it, if some <hi>Significative</hi> Word, lately found out by Divines, be received into use, as long as the thing signify'd by it, was before part of the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith, though express'd in other Words and Phrases?</p>
               <p>Now that the <hi>Christians</hi> before the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. had the same Belief of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as we now have, may be easily shewn from approv'd Authors, who preceded <hi>Innocent.</hi> St. <hi>Bernard</hi> dy'd fifty years, before <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. was advanc'd to the <hi>Pontificat.</hi> Now what can be more express than these words of his in his Sermon on our <hi>Lords Supper? This is truly an Heavenly Favour, this is certainly an abundant Grace, this is surely a super excellent Glory, that a Priest should hold his GOD, and with his Hand give him to others.</hi> But left he should repeal these Testimonies by such frivolous Exceptions, as you for the most part use (pretending, that an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Darkness had then over-shadow'd all Mankind, and driven them into many and great Errors) let us go back to those Ages, which were even in your own Judgment uncorrupted.</p>
               <p>We have already given you not only the Judgment of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> but also the Opinion and Practice of the Church describ'd by him: That the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is a Victim, whereby our Sins are effac'd; that 'tis a Sacrifice; that 'tis a Propitiation, which is offer'd to <hi>GOD</hi> for the Dead. You require those, that are more Antient than St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin?</hi> St. <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> the very next Age after the the Apostles in his second Apology to the Emperor, has these Words. <hi>As by the Word of GOD our Saviour
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45225:11"/>
JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST was Incarnate, and took Flesh and Blood for our Salvation: So we are taught, that by Prayers taken from GOD's Word the</hi> Eucharist, <hi>by him made Food, with which our Blood and Flesh are through mutation nourish'd, is the Flesh and Blood of that Incarnate JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> who liv'd in the third Age of the Church, says in his eighth Book of the Trinity, <hi>There is no room to doubt of the Truth of the Flesh and Blood: For now both by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our Lord himself, and our own Faith, it is truly Flesh, and truly Blood.</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> of the same Age in his Catechetical Oration (chap. 37.) <hi>We rightly believe, that the Bread, sanctify'd by the Word of GOD, is truly chang'd into the Body of GOD the Word.</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in his two and fiftieth Homily on St. <hi>Matthew</hi> speaks thus, <hi>Why should he disdain to give thee his Body, who did more, that is, laid down his Life for thee? Let us hear therefore, Priests, as well as others; how great, how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable a thing is granted us; let us hear, I Pray, and tremble, he has deliver'd us Flesh, he has set before us him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Immolated.</hi> And St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient than St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> says in his fourth Catechism, <hi>That a Christian Man knows, and certainly holds, this Bread, which is seen by us, not to be Bread, though the Taste thinks it to be Bread, but the Body of</hi> CHRIST; <hi>and the Wine, which is beheld by us, though it seem Wine to the Sense of Tasting, yet not to be Wine, but the Blood of</hi> CHRIST? What needs many Words? No Age of the Primitive Church, none of the Fathers dissented. The Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of all Ages and Writers have been formerly given thee by such, as have thought good to handle this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more at large.</p>
               <p>Let me now speak to thee, O <hi>Sectary,</hi> if thou desirest to be cur'd. This is one of the greatest Affairs in the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> whether in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> be CHRIST himself, or only <hi>Bread,</hi> which is the Figure of CHRIST's Body: In so great a matter, and in which to err, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45225:12"/>
Destruction; consider, whether side is supported by the safest Arguments. As to the Scriptures, 'twould be Impudence to affirm, that there are clearer, or even as clear Words for you, as these are for us: <hi>This is my Body, this is my Blood: The Bread, which I will give, is my Flesh.</hi> Some places therefore are plain and clear of themselves; and others, which want Interpretation, we expound ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Sentiments of Men certainly great and numerous, whose Wisdom, Learning, and Piety were remarkable; and lastly, as is most agreeable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Now if you would understand, what the Sense of the Church was from the Apostles time, it can no way better be understood, than by that of the Fathers, who then liv'd. But there is not any one of the Fathers, that have written of the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,</hi> whom we approve not, or whom we refuse for our Judge. For though some of them may have sometimes us'd certain obscure Words, which you also have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to abuse for the support of your <hi>Heresies</hi>; yet is there none of them that have spoken thus dubiously, who has not also other Words extant, which are plain and clear for us. Nay, most of them have so written, that asserting our Opinion, they cannot be so much as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd to have the least Word or Expression, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours your <hi>Heresy.</hi> Then, if you have regard to the Consent of <hi>Christians,</hi> it must be confess'd, that not only the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, but all Christians through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole World unanimously agree in our Opinion. So that which way soever you seek for Arguments, there are still more for us: If the Learning of the Persons be respected, we have far the greater part of Men, famous for Knowledge; if Ages, we have unquestionably more; if the number of Men, you may well be asham'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with us.</p>
               <p>Thus being every way inferior to us, you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remaining but your Obstinacy, and vain Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45225:12"/>
which with you is call'd Prudence, or Wisdom, wholly consisting in such kind of <hi>Philosophy</hi> as this: Can GOD do this; or is it likely, that he would; what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies hence arise; how unworthy is this of the Divine Majesty? After the same manner did the <hi>Heathens</hi> put up Queries against CHRIST, and the <hi>Arians</hi> against the Trinity. Away with this vain Solicitude: You may possibly sometimes know, why GOD's Works are done; but never how. Give me leave to use the Words of St. <hi>Ambrose, Who</hi> (says he, 11 Hexam. Chap. 1.) <hi>seeing these things, can with his weak understanding search out a possibility of the Reason? All which the Divine Power, not to be comprehended by humane Minds, nor express'd by our Discourses, has knit together by the Authority of his own Will.</hi>

               <p>But if thou, O <hi>Sectary,</hi> art not mov'd by our Agreement, let the blind Contention, that is among your selves, startle thee: Since divided into <hi>Sects,</hi> you with great bitterness contend about the Opinion, you ought to have of this <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> Would to GOD thou knewest, how pleasant it is to prostrate thy self before the Altar, <hi>Where the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> (says St. <hi>Chrysosthm</hi> in his third Homily on the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians) with Trembling Reverence the Host</hi>: How sweet it is there to Adore our Lord, <hi>Who</hi> (to use St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s words in his Commentary on the 98 <hi>Psalm) walk'd here in the Flesh, and gave the same Flesh to be eaten by us for our Salvation:</hi> How far lastly it excells all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Delights to reject vain Circumstances, and believe only the Word of GOD, to which so many foregoing Ages have Assented; to acknowledge that to be our <hi>Lords Body</hi> which our Lord himself has affirm'd to be his <hi>Body</hi>; and with a Mouth of <hi>Flesh</hi> to receive in all due Humility the <hi>Flesh</hi> of our Lord, that he may nourish our Souls with the effect of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and the Spirit <hi>which quickneth.</hi> None shall before the Tyranny of <hi>Antichrist</hi> deprive the <hi>Faithful</hi> of these Joyes, nor can any one, but he, who has experienc'd them, comprehend them.</p>
