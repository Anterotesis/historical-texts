            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Church hath stood, with the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> since the Reformation,
and how well it hath acquitted it self in
the matters disputed betwixt us, is very
well known to the World. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the power of Truth, and the success that hath afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
attended the endeavours of such as have amongst us
maintained it, we have found by experience, that we have
of late gained little upon them by all our diligence. What
Political Reasons there are for it besides becomes not me
to enquire; but that our Divisions amongst our selves have
been a principal one, and given our Adversaries both the
confidence to set upon us afresh, and also an opportunity
<pb facs="tcp:62600:3"/>
of so doing with greater security, is what no one can be
ignorant of. This is one evident Cause of our present
danger, and what we can therefore never hope to avoid,
without uniting upon some common Principle and Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It is this that I have endeavoured to point and make
out in the ensuing Discourse, with what success I must

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of this Chapter the
Apostle doth exhort the <hi>Ephesians</hi> to
the Christian duty of Charity; and
that he may come upon them with
the greater advantage, doth make
use of several Arguments to inforce it, v. 4, 5, 6.
taken from the state they are in, and the profession
they are of; that there is <hi>one Body</hi> of which they are
members, <hi>one Spirit</hi> by which they are quickned,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62600:4"/>
               <hi>one Hope</hi> of Eternal Life by which they are excited,
<hi>one Lord</hi> whom they profess to obey, <hi>one Faith</hi> and
Form of belief that they imbrace, <hi>one Baptism</hi> by
which they are initiated into the Church, and <hi>one
God</hi> whom they do depend upon, and from whom
they do receive all Temporal and Spiritual gifts
and blessings. And whereas it may be thought that
the variety of Gifts and Officers in the Church should
minister to contention, he adds, that however
they may be abused, and the persons in those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
may happen to pervert them, yet as they
were primarily intended by Christ the dispenser
and disposer of all for the order, the safety, and
the Edification of the Church, so they do make
much for it, v. 11, 12, 13, 14. For it is <hi>from him
that the whole body fitly joyned together and compacted,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>maketh increase of the body,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In which words there is a comparison implyed
betwixt the Natural body, and the Christian Church,
called the <hi>body of Christ,</hi> v. 12. that as the Natural
body doth consist of several parts, and those parts
have a dependence upon the head, and are so fitly
compacted and united among themselves, that there
is a distribution of nourishment to all of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their measure and capacity: So there is
in the Church (1.) a Supream power in Christ the
Head, (2.) a due subordination of the several parts
to the Head, (3.) a strict relation betwixt these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts to the Head and to each other, (4.) a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62600:4"/>
derivation of all necessary supply from the Head;
and from each communicated to the other accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their measure, proportion and relation.</p>
            <p>All that I shall at present take notice of from
hence, is,</p>
            <p>1. The firmness of the union that is to be amongst
Christians, they are <hi>joyned and compacted together;</hi>
not only as they are at large members of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, called here <hi>the whole Body;</hi> but also
as they are more strictly combined, according to
the places of their residence, in particular Societies
and Churches; having Officers to guide and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
unto them, and Laws by which they regulate
themselves in such Combinations. This I take to
be signified in this verse, (1) in the phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>every joynt,</hi> which I conceive hath respect to
the Officers of the Church, whether extraordinary,
as Apostles, Prophets and Evangelists; or ordinary,
as Pastors and Teachers, v. 11. which the Apostle
saith, v. 12. were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>for the perfecting</hi>
and compacting <hi>of the Saints,</hi> and upon whom the
gifts did primarily descend <hi>for the edifying of the body
of Christ,</hi> v. 12. These are as Ligaments and Joynts
to the body, that do move, strengthen, preserve, and
secure it, (2.) It's further signified in the phrase
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>every part,</hi> by which I conceive is to be
understood, with respect to the limbs of a Natural
body, the particular Churches which Christians
according to their convenience of abode and affairs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62600:5"/>
were cast and distributed into. And this I the rather
think, because I find particular Christians called of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in Scripture <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>members of Christ, 1 Cor. xii.</hi>
26, 27. But this word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>part,</hi> is never so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to any particular person; and when on other
occasions it is made use of, it constantly hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to number and multitude, as, <hi>Acts xxiii. 6.
one part were Jews,</hi> &amp;c. And this may further be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
from what the Apostle saith, Chap. ii. 19, 20.
where after he had spoken of the Catholick Church,
of which all Christians are <hi>fellow-Citizens,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to their particular union as a Christian
Church in that place, v. 22. <hi>In whom ye also are built
together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Here is the advantage of such an union, <hi>it
maketh increase of the body;</hi> and is for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, as ver. 14. doth imply, <hi>that we henceforth be
no more children tossed to and fro, and carried about with
every wind of doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. which was to be prevented
by the compacting the Saints together, ver. 12.</p>
            <p>From what hath been hitherto said I observe,</p>
            <p>1. That a constitution or fixed order in the
Church doth make much for the increase and safety
of it, and is necessary towards the propagating and
securing of Religion.</p>
            <p>2. That a constitution which takes in these ends
is to be regarded. I shall at this time chiefly apply
my self to the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> the securing of Religion,
and I shall do it in this following order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62600:5"/>
1. By shewing that the preservation of a Church
and Religion, is mainly depending upon a setled
Order and Constitution.</p>
            <p>2. By considering what that Constitution is,
particularly with respect to our selves, in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and our present circumstances.</p>
            <p>3. By shewing what regard is to be given to such
a Constitution, and how far it's the interest of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true Protestant to comply with it.</p>
            <p>First, I shall shew that <hi>the preservation of a Church
and Religion is mainly depending upon a setled Order and
Constitution.</hi> When I speak of the great security of
the Church, the respect which it hath therein pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
to God the great Patron of it, is to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
who can and will protect it against the most
formidable powers which may threaten and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
it: And when I speak of other security, I
am to be understood of Prudential and Rational
means, and what is to be done in that way on our
part in order thereunto: And of this sort I take a
Constitution to be. Without this there cannot be a
Church, <hi>i.e.</hi> without Laws and Officers for directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
without having the work of those Officers set
forth and described; and without a people that bear
such a respect to those Officers, and to each other as
the Laws agreed upon do require. For if every
person be at liberty to be what he will and do as
he please; either to rule or to be ruled, to teach or
to be taught, to act or forbear, the Church would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62600:6"/>
be none, and from being like <hi>a City that is compact
together,</hi> it would be no better than a field of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and confusion.</p>
            <p>And what particular persons are with respect to
a Church, such are particular Churches with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the whole; and therefore as every Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is to look upon himself as a member of the
Church, and to bear a due respect to the body of
which he is: So are particular Churches as parts of
a greater body to have a regard to it. It's for the
safety and edification of every particular Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
not to stand alone, but to be united to a body;
and it's for the security and advantage of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Churches to draw into more general Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that so they may upon all Emergencies receive
mutual advice and assistance. And this is to be done
according to the Nations they are of, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they are under, the times they are in; which
kind of combination is usually known by the
name of a <hi>National Church,</hi> that is, when there is an
union of particular Churches under one Common
Form. This is in it self a thing most decent, and
what, as it doth unite the hearts of a People or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
more firmly to one another, so doth also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for their security: for as all good order doth
contribute to safety; so the more general that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is, the greater security must redound from it.
And therefore however some may in speculation
please themselves with particular Churches altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62600:6"/>
independent upon others; yet whenever it
comes to practice, they are forced to take other
measures, and to enter into larger Combinations,
as it happened in <hi>New England.</hi> And from hence
it is that the <hi>Quakers</hi> themselves how much soever
they pretend to be against all Forms, are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such a kind of Order, and have several Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves, which become binding to the
rest, and are more or less as extensive as their party
is. Which is therefore in Print complained of by
several amongst them, as Usurpation and Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Imposition<note n="*" place="margin">Spirit of the Hat. Hidden things brought to light. <hi>Bullocks</hi> Tracts. <hi>Q.</hi> Spiritual Court.</note>. The usefulness of
Order to the purposes spoken of is
what Nature and Reason do dictate,
and what in all other Cases no man
doth dispute; it's that which brought
men into Societies, and is the great preserver of
them. It's that which is the safety of Nations, and
Armies, Cities, and Families; and it would be the
opinion of all men in the present case, were but
their own Religion and Constitution to be the
measure prescribed. No man can deny, but if the
Nation was all in one way, and the people all of
one mind in matters of Religion, it would be as
much for our Peace and mutual Satisfaction, our
Welfare and Security, as it is lovely in it self. And
then methinks no man should deny but that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of one sort or another, which may reach
the general part of the Nation, and most sute the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62600:7"/>
Government of it, doth in its degree tend the same
way, and that it's more for our safety to have that
which is a National Constitution than to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.</p>
            <p>And this is the more necessary in regard of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Enemy that we have to encounter, against
whom all the force that we can raise, and the care
that we can take will be little enough to secure us.
For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is so strongly compacted,
and so well provided of whatever may support it
at home, or enlarge its Conquests abroad, that it
will vie with any Constitution in the World. There
is first an Universal Head who challengeth the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
power over all Churches in the World,
and whom all in their Communion are bound
to acknowledg as such. It's he that hath the
power of calling Councils, arbitrating Differences,
passing Decrees, granting Dispensations, issuing
out Indulgences, making Expositions, and of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things to a certainty and determination in
their Church. It's he whom all the Bishops and
Priests amongst them do swear particular obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to, and which they hold so Sacred and Invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
that it shall cancel all Obligations to, and
defend them against all Impositions of any Secular
Prince whatsoever. It's his Commands all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Orders of Monks and Friers do observe, and
his pleasure they attend; and by their vast numbers
spread through the Christian World, and the intire
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62600:7"/>
dependence which they have upon him, he hath both
an opportunity of gaining Intelligence, and of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
ordinarily what he designs with greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
and success than any Prince by his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
Agents and Correspondents whatsoever. For
these are the constant Emissaries of the Church, and
by whose Generals residing at <hi>Rome</hi> all Orders that
may be for the Common Good, are immediately
dispersed, and so Religiously received, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
these persons are sent they immediately go,
whatever they are commanded they out of hand
do, which they do with the greater resolution bend
themselves to, as they have cast off all Relations,
and have no expectations from them; have no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
to take care of, or that have any dependence
upon them, and so if they miscarry, the mischief of
it lights wholly upon themselves. And these that
are chosen out for that purpose, being persons of
inquisitive and active tempers, capable of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into affairs, considering circumstances, and
finding out the interests, designs and inclinations of
others, and supplied with all things that may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for such an undertaking, have a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
over any people that are without such Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
(2.) There are besides great preferments
and hopes of gaining them, to whet their Industry
and encourage their endeavours: for those of all
kinds that Church doth abound in, and flows with
that wealth gathered from First Fruits, Tenths, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62600:8"/>
Dispensations, Pardons, Jubilees, Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
and other innumerable ways of advantage,
as that no design shall fail for want of succour in that
kind. (3.) There is a setled Conformity throughout
that Church, and all agree in their Service as it's
now establisht, that whatever differences there are
among them, yet They seem to be One to others,
and are really so in what makes for their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and security. (4.) They have a great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over the Laity in the interests they make among
them for the reasons abovesaid; and by obliging
them to Auricular Confession, by which their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
are poured into the Priests bosom; and so as
they are under a tye not to do any thing which they
would not trust him with the knowledg of; so if
they have committed a secret to him, dare not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige
him for fear he should disclose it. By which
means men dare not own their doubt, or so much
as entertain a thought of doing otherwise than the
Church will allow. Lastly, there are such permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and allowances in their Church, that for the
service and good of it men may shape their course
as they please, take up any Garb, and fashion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to any temper of men or state of people
whatsoever, for such an end.</p>
            <p>So that from a Church thus Constituted, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
with Power and Policy, there needs all
the industry, consideration, and unity, that can be
to preserve those that are threatned by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:62600:8"/>
And this without a setled general and National
Constitution I see not how it may be. We may as
well think to go out against a veterane and well
disciplined Host, and hope to overcome them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any known Orders to be observed, or Officers to
Lead and Command, as to defend our selves against
the invasion of so powerful and formed a Church as
that is. For had we no Form at all, or were there
different petty Forms without submission to one as
Supream, there would, it's likely, be as many Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as Forms, and those so furiously contending with
each other, that the very approach of the Enemy
would hardly be able to curb the violence with w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
each would bear upon the other: or however there
could not be that good understanding, that necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Intelligence, that sober advice, that mutual care
for each others safety, and that ability to advance it
as when there is but one. The Adversary would
have an opportunity of sowing dissensions, of wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
differences, and of infecting the multitude with
such Principles as should make them a fit prey, for
his own power, when there is a fit season for it.</p>
            <p>From all which the necessity of having a General
and National Constitution doth appear where it is
not, and of maintaining one where it is.</p>
            <p>2. I shall consider <hi>what that Constitution is that may
best preserve a Church,</hi> and a Church whose welfare
is maligned by such an Adversary as I have before
described. And that I shall do by laying down some
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62600:9"/>
Characters which may belong to such a Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and then by searching for such a Church as may
have a Correspondence to these Characters.</p>
            <p>1. That Constitution which is agreeable to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and the practice of the Primitive and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church, is most likely to maintain it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all opposition. For then it is able to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an Adversary with great advantage, and beat
him from his strongest holds, so far as Authority is
admitted to the decision of the Case. If we have
the Scripture on our side, none can ever warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
throw us out of possession, or make good any
charge against us: since whatever we hold or do by
vertue of its Authority will remain firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken,
and which none can touch upon but they
must strike at the Foundation of Truth and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And if we have the Primitive Church, and
the Records of the first Ages to stand by us, as we
have thereby the best Expositors of Scripture, so
the best Authority next to it; and which none can
wholly reject without great rashness and arrogance.</p>
            <p>2. That's to be supposed a Constitution of this
Nature, which the Adversaries do most of all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and seek the downfal of. If we see an Enemy
bending all his force against a particular place, and
passing by others with all hast and diligence imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
seeks to surprize it by Stratagem, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
it by violence, we may well suppose it to be
of great importance, and what he is most of all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62600:9"/>
apprehensive of danger from. And if we find the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> always undermining and assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some particular Establishment amongst us, or
some one Church more than others in the world,
we have good cause to think such a Church and
Constitution to be considerable in it self, and what
is also a great affliction and obstruction to them.</p>
            <p>3. That is likely to be a Constitution of this kind
which best sutes the Civil Government, that hath
such a dependence upon it, and is so complicated
with it, that it cannot cannot carry on a different
interest from, or seek the trouble and ruin of the
State, but it must also trouble and ruin it self. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if these two are divided, or have several Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to respect, there will be a continual contention,
which can end in nothing but destruction.</p>
            <p>4. That is likely to be a Constitution for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
which is most generally suted to the temper of
the people, and which even the greatest part of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
will choose to dwell under, rather than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
There cannot be a Constitution which all will
equally like, approve of, and agree in; and since a
National Constitution is necessary for our preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that which will come nearest to this is most
eligible.</p>
            <p>5. That Constitution may be presumed to be fit for
this end which we have had good Experience of and
know what it's able to do and is sufficient for. For
whatever semblance another may have of great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62600:10"/>
and sufficiency, yet nothing can be positively
concluded, because that which hath not been at all,
or not fully tried, is very uncertain, and so unsafe,
especially in a dangerous Season. It may then be
what people may as much slight as they did before
desire it, and as soon grow weary of it as before
they were forward to embrace it. It may come for
ought we know to yield the cause instead of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
it, and be so far from resisting Popery, that
it may be swallowed up by it.</p>
            <p>6. That Constitution seems most fitted to this
end, which is capable of the best consultation and
most vigorous prosecution; where the persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in preserving it, neither want Education,
nor Experience to know what may be for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the Church; and have also a sufficient
Power and Authority to provide it. For without
these advantages of training them up in the ways
of Knowledg and Experience, those to whom the
care of the Church is committed would rather ruin
than preserve it, rather betray than rescue it, by
their weakness or their ignorance.</p>
            <p>7. I may add to this, That which hath encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for learning and industry, and ways to bring
them up in the one, and quicken them to the other.
Without these, Learning would be scarce, and the
spirits of men sluggish and he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>: and without
these a Church that is eminent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>rein, as <hi>Rome</hi> is,
would quickly espy and make their advantage; as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62600:10"/>
she hath already done in the Eastern Churches,
which in little more than an Age are almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
by her: And that though they had a setled and
Ancient Constitution, and were generally suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
prejudiced against the <hi>Romish</hi> Usurpation; yet
what from their poverty, and their ignorance
(which follows from the former.) The Supremacy
of the Pope is now there in very many parts their
avowed principle. And if at that distance they
have thus far prevailed, they must necessarily meet
with the like success in a Church when nearer to
them, if Learning be not encouraged by an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
maintenance.</p>
            <p>8. That Constitution is likely to answer this end
which By-standers, and so the most Impartial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
have given their verdict for, and which they
promise themselves greater security by, if they
could obtain it.</p>
            <p>9. That is best for us which in such a time of
fear, as this, is most likely to create least distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
and expose us to the least danger. For the
particular Case, now, is to give us a Rule, and that
is best to us which will best secure us against the
publick mischief.</p>
            <p>Having gon thus far to shew that a setl'd National
and General Constitution is necessary towards our
preservation, and to find out such Characters as in
the opinion of all unbyassed and considering persons
may fit such a Constitution as is best for us. I have
nothing else to do but to find out a Constitution
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62600:11"/>
which may fit those Characters. But by this time
you will prevent me in your thoughts, and perceive
how these things do agree with our present Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and what reason we have to maintain it.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to draw the parallel, and
set it before you, I shall premise</p>
            <p>First, that we are to take the several Characters
before laid down together, for that is the best, which
all agree in.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That these Characters are not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to any single part of the Constitution, but to
the whole. For we are not obliged to maintain that
every particular thing in our Church is the best, and
that nothing in it can be mended. For it's freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
otherwise, as particularly in <hi>the Comminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be used the first day of Lent.</hi> It is sufficient
that the Constitution is in the whole agreeable to
those Characters.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, much less do I think my self obliged to
defend the miscarriages that may be in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of what belongs to the Constitution, when
they flow not from the Constitution it self. For
they are the faults of the persons, not the faults of
the Constitution. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I say that the present Constitution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, best sutes those Characters, and as it's in
it self the best Constitution that I know of upon the
face of the Earth, so it's most fit for us, and is to be
best thought of by us. And this will appear by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
our Constitution with the Characters before
laid down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62600:11"/>
1. Our Constitution is agreeable to Scripture and
the practice of the Primitive and Universal Church.
It's agreeable to Scripture: For it owns nothing for
Canonical, but what is divinely inspired, and makes
nothing necessary, but what is thereby made necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Whatever things indifferent, and of a middle
nature are taken in, are only used as indifferent, and
what are therefore alterable in themselves, and <hi>upon
just causes may be altered and changed, and therefore are not
to be esteemed equal with God's Law,</hi> as
our Church declares<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rubr.</hi> Of Ceremonies, why some abolished, &amp;c.</note>. And those
that are in use are what she hath the ancient Church
for her pattern in. Her Government in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and essential parts of it, is, what was unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
and universally the Government in the
Church, according to the most ancient and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Records that we have in Being.</p>
            <p>2. This constitution of ours is the more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
as it is what our Adversaries of <hi>Rome</hi> do most
inveigh against, and labour to overthrow. It is the
weakness of some to accuse us of Popery, because
of Episcopacy and a Liturgy, and other things in
which we do agree. For although they have Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy
and a Liturgy in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet
our Episcopacy and Liturgy is what they bear an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
hatred unto, neither owning the former, nor
suffering their people to be present at the latter. For
as long as <hi>Episcopacy</hi> doth not acknowledge the <hi>Pope</hi>'s
Supremacy; and as long as our Liturgy is discharged
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62600:12"/>
of the fopperies and Idolatry that theirs is stuffed
with, it's to their reproach. This of ours is not only
an established, but also a very regular Constitution,
and bears in it so great a Conformity to the ancient
order of the Church, that there is none in the world
which they so much try their skill and their practices
upon. And therefore whereas they let the writings
of other Parties amongst us, lye by with such a kind
of contempt, that I remember not above Two that
for this Twenty years they have vouchsafed to take
notice of, and to reply to (and for which I could give
a particular reason;) in the mean time they have run
upon the Church with all their might, and picked out
the <hi>Goliahs</hi> of their Party to encounter the Writers
amongst us: As well knowing if they could make
them to give ground and retreat, the day was like to
be their own. This I observe, not to disparage the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of our dissenting Brethren in that kind, but to
shew wherein the strength of the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is thought, even by our Adversaries, to consist.</p>
            <p>3. Our Constitution doth best sute the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as it doth maintain the King in his Just
Rights, and doth not invade the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
The case in these Nations formerly was, that
the Church-constitution rendred the condition of
Princes and People unsafe and perplexed; for having
a dependance upon, and giving themselves over to a
blind obedience to a Foreign power, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope,
there were always Jealousies of each other, and very
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62600:12"/>
turbulent Factions maintained to the great prejudice
of the Kingdom; as in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the I.
by <hi>Anselm,</hi> and in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the II. by <hi>Becket</hi>
Arch-bishops of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> But now the Supremacy
being setled upon the King, and maintained by the
Church, there is but one Interest, and the Peace of
the Publick is thereby provided
for<note n="*" place="margin">Of this, <hi>v.</hi> Dr. <hi>Puller</hi>'s Moderation of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> c. 12.</note>. For the Church hath now
Laws made for the Clergy, as well
as others, by the Supreme Council of the Nation, and
is as much obliged to submit to them when made.
But it is evident how little these things are consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and respected by any other Parties, in comparison
of ours, and what I choose rather to refer
you to others for satisfaction in<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Puller</hi> ut supra. <hi>p.</hi> 339.</note>.</p>
            <p>4. Our present constitution doth best sute the
temper of the Nation, and which the greatest part
even of Dissenters would choose to dwell under, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than another. That which pretends mostly to a
competition with ours is the Presbyterian, as it is a
National form. But if we should come to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the inclinations of those that pass under that name,
I dare be confident that there are very few of them
(if any) that are satisfied with the frame that is laid
down, and the orders and rules that have been obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the Churches, where that way of government
hath been established: or if they are, it is that at
which the people are generally prejudiced and which
the rest of Dissenters do unanimously complain of,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62600:13"/>
and protest against: Should we come to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational
way, then the Churches must be consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such persons as are gathered out of Churches,
and who are presumed from some good grounds to
be in a state of grace, and that must oblige themselves
by a particular Covenant at their first admission. By
which means all that scruple these terms, or that are
not really converted, or not so thought by them, will
have no relation to the Church, and they and their
children be no members of it. And how this would
relish with the Nation in general, or other dissenters,
may be well conceived. So that either we must have
no Constitution, or the present, if we will gratifie the
greatest part of the Nation, and even that of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
themselves. For whatever other Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is uppermost will have more adversaries than
ours, as it will have, besides the other dissenters, the
present Church and the members of it to be against
it, who are more in number than any other party, and
I think I may say, than all others put together.</p>
            <p>5. Ours is a constitution which we have had good
experience of, and have seen how it hath kept its
ground, and bid such constant defiance to the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they of that Church have not been able
to run it down with all their prowess: and over
whom, were it not for our divisions at home, which
take up the thoughts of those that are the Guardians
of it, we should have had such advantage, as might
have made them weary of attempting us. There
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62600:13"/>
was no reformation in the world that was more order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begun, more regularly pursued, and more stedfastly
maintained than ours. It was that which was water'd
with the Blood of the Reformers, and hath for above
this Hundred Years been still upheld by the unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
endeavours of those that were in place amongst
us. And notwithstanding all the Popery that hath
been charged upon us, I dare challenge any to shew
such Monuments of Learning and Industry; such
clear detections of the Apostasie, and such solid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutations
of the arguments of that Church, as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
and have been writ by the Bishops, the Clergy,
and even the Laity of ours.</p>
            <p>6. In our constitution there is a capacity of the
best consultation and most vigorous prosecution. In
respect of the Church it self, as there is a due subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
in it, where the Inferiour are under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
and command of their Superiours. And
where the Superiours are often present at Debates
in Councils, have an hand in making and passing
Laws, are conversant in affairs of the Nation; and
so are in a better capacity of espying out and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
against the attempts of the Enemy, than if they
were to reside upon particular Cures, and to attend
the business of them. For then for want of such
we should be an easie prey to those that had a will
and power to seize us.</p>
            <p>7. I might insist upon the encouragements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us for Learning and Industry, both in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62600:14"/>
for the service of the Church in the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and after they are admitted to it, in Livings, and
Dignities; by which means the Clergy may be in a
capacity to furnish themselves with Books, and all
necessary accomplishments. And then again upon
the care that is taken, or might be, that none but such
as are competently learned be received and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>8. Our constitution hath the good opinion of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
persons, such as Learned Protestants abroad,
many of whom it hath courteously received, cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and maintained. Indeed our Church is looked
upon as the top of the Reformation, and to which
in difficult cases others have made their appeals. It
hath been honoured by our Friends, feared by our
Enemies, and contemned by none but our selves at
home: And how much that hath been, and is to the
damage and hazard of the Protestant Religion, both
at home and abroad, might easily be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>9. Our constitution at this juncture and season is
our great security, and what will expose us to the least
disturbance and danger: For whilst this stands we
cannot be worse than we are, but if this be thrown
down, God knows into what confusions we may be
cast, or whether ever we may come to a settlement
again. I am sensible that there are some that do
with all their might endeavour the total subversion
of it, and whom nothing less will content, than with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62600:14"/>
               <hi>Edom,</hi> to say, Ps. 137. 7. <hi>rase it, rase it, even to the foundation
thereof.</hi> But I would fain know what is hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
whether such would bring us to confusion
or settlement? If the former, I hope all good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
of what Perswasion soever, will look upon
them as their mortal Enemies; since nothing then
can be the issue but destruction, both to Religion
and our selves: For whatever they may pretend,
they are far from the temper and spirit of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
where we are told, 1 Cor. 14. 33. that <hi>God is
not the Author of confusion, but of Peace in all the Churches
of the Saints.</hi> If a settlement be intended, I would
as willingly know where they will fix? For it's a
most wretched imprudence to pull down the old
Mound, before they are provided of another, and
to expose us to <hi>the Boar out of the Wood, and the wild
Beast of the Field</hi> to enter in, and to make havock of
the Church of God, for want of a fence and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
If they are come to any issue, and are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of a constitution to set up, Are they secure
that this project of theirs shall without delay be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into consideration, and considered without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality?
Will there no controversies arise about the
terms of Communion, or the nature and parts of
that Government, which they would substitute in
the room of what they now quarrel at? Can they
secure us, that the frame which they have laid will
be better than that which they seek to overthrow,
and that upon Experience, and in the current of as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62600:15"/>
many Years it shall not prove as faulty as what falls
under their present censure? Can they secure us,
that their Model will take, and that all Parties that
now joyn against ours, will center in theirs? or that
those that dissent from them shall meet with better
quarter, or fairer usage, when theirs is advanced to
the Supremacy, than they do under ours? If this
cannot be assured, or so much as made probable, we
had as good be where we are.</p>
            <p>But suppose there could be a better constitution
than what we have, and that matters might be better
regulated; yet we must consider our present cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
in which without doubt it is better to
bear with an inconvenience than a mischief, and to
be content to be secure with what we have, than to
venture all for somewhat that we have not. For a
dissolution cannot be at this time without greater
mischiefs, than what can be conceived to be in the
constitution. It being as in a Fort, where perhaps
the Fortifications may be made more regular, and
contrived to the greater security of it; but though
this might be done in a time of peace and leisure, yet
to pull down the old for this purpose, whilst the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
is before it, would be to throw it into his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
and he that should advise to it, and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon it, though with a good intention, would
do as great a mischief, as if he conspired with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
We are now in the midst of danger, and
have an Enemy that is deeply concerned to let no
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62600:15"/>
opportunity slip that may be to our damage; and
if we now pull down our constitution, which is
the bulwark of our Religion, we expose our selves
to his mercy, and he that should attempt it is in these
circumstances to be looked upon as no less dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
an Enemy, than if he were of the Party, and
equally concerned in the plotting our ruine. For
my part, I had rather continue in a Town that is
defensible, though not fortified altogether to my
mind, than neglect the present use of that, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
my self to great consultation to amend it, and
in the midst of all my curiosity be with <hi>Archimedes</hi>
knockt o'th' head by the Enemy.</p>
            <p>So that the preservation of the present Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
how irregular soever it may seem to some, will
less expose us than the dissolution of it. But yet
how far it is from being really so, I have before
shewed. And now I shall proceed to the</p>
            <p>3. Third general, to shew <hi>what regard is to be had
to such a constitution.</hi> If what I have said be true,
that the present constitution be the best qualified for
making resistence to, and defending us against the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> if it be the common Bulwark of
the Protestant Religion amongst us, and the great
security of it abroad, it becomes every one that is
a true lover of our Religion, to seek and promote
the welfare of our constitution.</p>
            <p>I know this will be a great piece of self-denial in
those that do dissent from it, and that perhaps in so
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62600:16"/>
doing they may not increase or derive any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
power to themselves: But if it be really the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of our Religion, I hope they will see it to be
their duty, and make it their endeavour. When
the <hi>Jews</hi> were carried captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> they were
required to <hi>seek the peace of the City, whither they were
carried captive, and to pray unto the Lord for it: For,</hi>
saith the Text, <hi>in the peace thereof shall ye have peace:</hi>
Jerem. 29. 7. When in a state of captivity, and
amongst Heathens, they were thus obliged to have
a respect to the welfare of the place and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And then much more should we, when
our Religion is the same in its fundamentals, and
the Civil liberties are, what all are alike partakers
of. We all agree in the vital parts of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we agree that Popery is a common Enemy,
we agree that it is our Interest to joyn against it.
And where shall we meet, if it be not in some settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and in what shall we agree, if the present
Constitution will not so far unite us?</p>
            <p>I am sensible that there are many that will not
understand this; that are like those, Lament. 4. 12.
<hi>that would not have believed that the adversary and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem;</hi> that
do the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> what it can, it can never
make its way, and set up its standard amongst us.
They think if they can clear themselves of our
Church at home, that they are sufficiently provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against danger from abroad. They are ready
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62600:16"/>
to say, as <hi>Tyrus</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Ezek, 26. 2. <hi>Aha she
is broken, that was the gates of the People, she is turned
unto me, I shall be replenished now she is laid wast:</hi>
And each Party is apt to promise much to it self
upon such a victory and change.</p>
            <p>Such as these do watch to <hi>break down the carved
work thereof with Axes and Hammers.</hi> These labour
<hi>to cast Fire into the Sanctuary,</hi> and attempt all ways
to alienate the affections of the People from the
present establishment, and to raise slanders upon
any that appear in its defence. They are these
that load the present Ministry with contempt, and
are continually in their Pamphlets exposing them,
as well knowing that if they can remove the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
or make the People to believe them to be
Wolves, they have done their business, and the
whole Flock is likely to lye at their Mercy.</p>
            <p>These are they that make way for Popery to
enter in. For is it not the Ministry of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> that appears in the Breach upon all
occasions, that either flings down or takes up the
Gantlet, and that hath hitherto so far prevailed,
that the <hi>Romish</hi> Party hath at last almost quitted
the way of Argument, and hath attempted the
Conquest of us by Blood and Violence, when
they could not do it by Learning and Reason?</p>
            <p>If we had nothing but a Worldly interest to
move us, if that were the Compass we steer by,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62600:17"/>
(as some do basely insinuate) if there were nothing
of duty in the Contention, we might be as quiet
as others, and make our terms upon as good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
with a Church that hath store of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to reward us, and where the Clergy hath
a reverence paid to them beyond what we do
meet with, or may expect in ours. If we would
shew quarter to them, we are sensible enough
that they would shew it to us. But when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all our Industry and Care, all our
Pains and Hazard we shall be Papists, there can
no security be given that any are not such, and
much less those Gentlemen that take the liberty
thus to asperse us.</p>
            <p>But it is not with us the boldness of these Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
hath stopped, but they will bring others into
the same Condemnation:</p>
            <p>If the mischief had staid with us we might be
silent, or if the State and Religion may be secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and we be ruined alone, it might not be so
material. Let them proceed in their calumnies
and mischievous Designs: If that were all, I hope
God will give us patience to bear whatever they
may throw or inflict upon us. But when the
Government it self is assaulted, and things are
come to this pass, that any one that will not strike
in with them in all points shall be a Papist, and
what not, when a Man must not speak for the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62600:17"/>
Church of <hi>England,</hi> but he must be hoysing up
Sails for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it's time to refel
such a Calumny, and to expose the Design.</p>
            <p>O what a pleasant sight is this to the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> to see the Storm diverting from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and that the work which hath cost them
such Consultation, Expence and Labour, shall be
done to their hands; and instead of the sore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment,
which they did Hourly expect, have
no more to do but to stand still, and see the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of their greatest Enemy. To see us by
such an artifice made so jealous one of another,
that we know not whom to trust, and each Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ready to turn the Plot upon the other.</p>
            <p>It is fit that Mens eyes should be opened, and
be made to see whither they are driving. It's
fit to put a stop to the Danger which is coming
upon us.</p>
            <p>I do not charge this upon all Dissenters; I know
there are many of them that are so wise to observe
it, and so sincere as to abhor it, as well as we;
such that see into the mischievous consequences of
these Proceedings. I may well say, is not the
hand of the Jesuit in all this? what either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from them, or Men of their temper.</p>
            <p>It's high time then for all sober Persons to look
about them, and rather to think of what is fit
and necessary to be done for our common safety,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62600:18"/>
than for a private satisfaction. Let them lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
all little grudges and animosities, and their
present dissatisfactions, till it is a time to find relief
for them.</p>
            <p>It would be an happy time to find the Nation
of the temper that it was generally in, in the time
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to have all conspiring and serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God in the same way. But since this is not
likely to be; let all however be over-ruled by a
Principle of common safety and interest, and do
what may best serve to promote it; which is, in
defending what is the Bulwark of our Religion,
by commending what we like in it, by joyning
with it in what we can, and by dissenting with
modesty where we cannot. For next to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one mind in Religion, there would nothing
more daunt and strike a greater terrour into our
Adversaries, than to see us stand up for one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and unanimously resolved to maintain
that which is the general Mound and Security.
Hereby our dissenting Brethren will give satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Government they live under, they
will shew that they are Christians and Protestants
indeed. They will then shew themselves worthy
of favour, and will prompt Authority to find out
a way to extend it to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We shall then begin to be One, and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
tossed to and fro, <hi>we shall be growing towards
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62600:18"/>
the temper and state of the Text, when</hi> the whole
Body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that which
every Joynt supplieth, according to the effectual working
in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the Body,
unto the edifying of it self in love.</p>
            <p>O Lord, we beseech thee, let thy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Pity cleanse and defend thy Church;
and because it cannot continue in Safety
without thy Succour, Preserve it ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
by thy Help and Goodness, through
Jesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
