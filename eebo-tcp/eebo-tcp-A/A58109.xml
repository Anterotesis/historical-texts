            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>I'th' latter Age, ere Criticks dar'd to Damn,</l>
            <l>Or Censure rashly, what deserv'd a Name;</l>
            <l>When Bully <hi>Ben</hi> lugg'd out in <hi>Cat'line's</hi> Cause,</l>
            <l>And huff'd his duller Audience to Applause,</l>
            <l>Then if the Poet swore 'twas good, each Guest</l>
            <l>Believ'd the Author, and approv'd the Feast:</l>
            <l>But now in humble Prologue, the poor Muse</l>
            <l>Implores your favour, and for mercy sues.</l>
            <l>To day the ty'rd Satyr takes his rest,</l>
            <l>And has at last himself a Fool confest:</l>
            <l>In vain is all his Malice, or his Art,</l>
            <l>He jerks, you grin, and damn him when you smart.</l>
            <l>This Ag's Crimes are past good Satyrs Cure,</l>
            <l>He scarce can lash you more than you'll endure.</l>
            <l>The busie States-man, can in a well-writ Scene</l>
            <l>See Treason punish'd, and yet Plots again:</l>
            <l>Young Gaming Heirs, who see poor Cully trickt,</l>
            <l>Laugh at the Jest, and the same Night are nickt.</l>
            <l>The <hi>London</hi> Cuckold sees his Brother Horn'd,</l>
            <l>Yet is not by the Stage-Example warn'd.</l>
            <l>The high kept Miss can see poor Jiltals fate,</l>
            <l>Yet Cuckolds her kind Keeper for a Treat:</l>
            <l>Since Headlong Folly then uncheck'd will reign,</l>
            <l>Successful Satyr but Rebels in vain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>Our harmless Author therefore bid me say,</l>
            <l>That ev'n Fopp'ry goes untouch'd to day;</l>
            <l>There's scarce a knotted Fringe in all his Play.</l>
            <l>The stately Side-Box Beau may cock his Nose,</l>
            <l>And Mob'd up <hi>Phillis</hi> take a Morning Dose</l>
            <l>Of fifty Dishes at the Choc'late-House.</l>
            <l>And when the Consort's done, the Ladies may</l>
            <l>There entertain the Beaux till break of day,</l>
            <l>And still pretend they for their Coaches stay.</l>
            <l>Men of no bus'ness to the Court may come,</l>
            <l>And Essenc'd Wigs Perfume the Drawing Room;</l>
            <l>Where, on the Window, Fops, their Wit to prove,</l>
            <l>Write Petty-Treason to the God of Love.</l>
            <l>In short, whatever Crimes o'r run the Town,</l>
            <l>Here's none to day that are with Malice shown:</l>
            <l>We've Plot and Humour too, but as for Wit,</l>
            <l>Let that be judg'd by the discerning Pit.</l>

            </opener>
            <p>IT has long been a Custom with Authors to trouble their best Friends; for, who but friends will excuse so many Impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as are generally found in Dedications, and have their Names set as a Skreen betwixt our faults and the censures of the Criticks, who in this Age are so unmerciful, that they never spare the Poet for sake of the Patron, be he never so eminent or well qualify'd?</p>
            <p>A second pretence, is a grateful acknowledment of favours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd; but there Self-Interest advances under the Mask of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and good Manners, for our thanks seem rather invitations to new Benefits. To say truth, Poets choose Patrons for their Plays, with the same design that crafty Parents do able Godfathers for their Children.</p>
            <p>The Reasons, Sir, why I shelter this under your Name, are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause your Affability, and singular good Disposition to all Mankind, enclines you not only to pardon Errors, but to confer Obligations, which you perform with that cheerfulness and courtesie, that whom you oblige you charm. Next, Sir, from the long acquaintance and vicinity of our Families and Relations, who ever held a fair and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Correspondence till the vicissitudes of time gave Interruption. Then let this tender of my respects and service to you, with this small trifle, receive and establish me in your Memory and Friendship, which is the aim and ambition of, Sir,</p>

                  <p>'Tis the great care and love I have for you, makes me solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to see you well disposed of: There ends a Father's care, for when he gives a Daughter in marriage, 'tis suppos'd he gives her to more than a Father; for such is a Husband. Husband and Wife are one.</p>

                  <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, Uncle, ne'r put on your Considering-Cap for an Answer; what I say is true, and I'll give you a farther demonstration that Man and Wife are not one: For in this Age they are seldom or never to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Man's in one place and the Wife in another; as far asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as ever they can get: And you know 'tis impossible for one and the same thing, to be at the same time in several places.</p>

                  <p>She has a very unhappy Wit; I am glad, Daughter, that you are going from her, for she's enough to spoil all the young Women she meets with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I hope she'll have a Husband will meet with her.</p>

                  <p>I am apt enough to believe, one House will be too hot to hold you long: I doubt not but your Husband (whoever shall have the ill fortune to be so) will in a short time be as weary of you as I am.</p>

                  <p>Atheists in Love, like Zealots in Religion, are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by Argument, yet now and then are converted by some lucky accident, you may one day see a beauty, that like a burning glass shall draw all thy loose flames within a narrow compass.</p>

                  <p>We'll stand him bare fac'd.</p>

                  <p>Now, which is she that I am in Love with?</p>

                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>He's at a stand.</p>

                  <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                  <p>He'd fain know me again; but prithee take up a brisk humour, and let's try to puzle him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>No, prithee let's go in.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>What are you upon the Wing, or do you come out a grazing like Rabbits, just at the Burrow's mouth; that as soon as any body comes, you may pop into your holes again.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                  <p>We had need be watchful, when such pochers as you are abroad.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>Your Watchfulness signifies little; I come now like a Ferret to creep into your holes, and scare you out of your Burrows.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>But if instead of a Burrow, you should run into a Warren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's trap.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                  <p>And that you may easily do, for we are no out-lying Conies, we keep within heart of the Warren.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, but I know your Musees, your inlets and outlets, and wherever the Rabbits pass, the Ferret or Weesel may venter. You see
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96625:10"/>
I come just to the same place; 'twas here you popt in from me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; But now I am got between you and the hedge.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>But how do you know, that we are the same pair?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                  <p>And which of us is it, that was too nimble for you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>You had best have a care on which you venter, for in such cases, you ought not to spoyl your friend's game.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis one of you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                  <p>I see you are no good hound; you can't follow the scent well.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>Many a good nos'd Dog is at a loss, when the scent is cross'd; but if I catch one, and my friend the other; if we are mistaken, let him say which is his, and we'l make a change.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>But which of us two do you think would fall to your share?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>Y'Gad I don't know.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                  <p>Don't you know a Woman's Face, when you see't a second time?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>She show'd it with such a Legerde-main — her Mask was no sooner of, then on again, and she was gone.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>Observe us well.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>Let me see— Faith not I,—if you had your Masks on, I should know her from a Thousand, at the very sight of her Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, my Heart would go pit—a—pat.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                  <p>If you are so in Love with the complexion of Velvet, you should have a Negro for your Mistress.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>There is beauty in black, why else do Ladies put on patches, and some love black Hair better than light, and why not black Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as well.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>But you'd be for a white one at this time, if you knew which was under the Vizard you like so well.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hil,</speaker>
                  <p>I am glad he does not, for than he'd pretend Love to one of us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>Gad but I wou'd not to you, nor e'er a Woman in the World.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>I dare swear you wou'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>Perhaps I might make you believe I was in Love with you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>No, that you cou'd ne'er do.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, don't you think your selves handsome enough to be lov'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jac.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; but we think you have more Wit.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>What, than to Love one of you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, or any body else, that is ne'er like to Love again.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>Are you an Enemy to me, or to Love?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                  <p>To Love; I think it a very foolish thing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>But 'tis Marriage makes it so, give me Love as nature made it, free and unconfin'd— observe but Mistriss and Gallant, how brisk, how gay, how fierce they are in their Amours! whilst Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Love comes like a Slave, loaden with Fetters, dull and out of humour.</p>

                  <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                  <p>For my part, I am rather for a Gallant, than a Husband.</p>

                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis well dissembled on one side; one of you I am sure speaks against her Conscience; but if you are as you say, y'are Girls for me.</p>

                  <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                  <p>Hold, one's enough, and if you'll be a Gallant to one of us, we expect you shou'd be constant.</p>

                  <speaker>Carl.</speaker>
                  <p>That circumstance makes it too like Marriage.</p>

                  <speaker>Hil.</speaker>
                  <p>The constancy is while you pretend; not but that either Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses or Gallant may choose elsewhere, but they must love but one at once</p>

First, as to my Person, you see it well enough, there's nothing to be disliked; nature has been sufficiently bountiful to me, I am <hi>As strait as an Arrow; as plump as a Patridge; —and as sound as a Roach.</hi> But it may be said, I am of a full Age; —the better for you. <hi>Better be an Old Man's darling, than a Young Man's warling. And he that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries e'er he be wise, shall Die e'er he thrive.</hi> Now I found in my self an inclination to like you, the first and only time I saw you — which was last Year, when you were with your Uncle in our Country, at the Sheriffs Feast. I don't say you took notice of me.</p>

                  <p>Why, these Towns are such places, that a man can't tell where he is, tho' both his Eyes are open. I can walk so all about my Frigat, Fore and Aft, in my sleep, between Decks, or above Deck, and return into my Cabin without waking, but here I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to have a Pilot to steer me broad awake.</p>

                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>
                  <p>A brave Sea-Captain—Stout and Blunt—he was Born in a Ship, and scarce knows any thing of Land Affairs.</p>

                  <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                  <p>Three very snug Frigats, well Rigg'd; 'twere pity too but they were as well Man'd.</p>

                  <p>'Tis a Storehouse for the Body, you must lay by this Sea habit for a Land Dress, the Ladies won't like the smell of Pitch and Tar.</p>

                  <p>If what you say be true; why do most Husbands in this Age, (which I take to be wiser than any that's past,) turn away their Wives, and keep Wenches? at least, those that are so civil to live with a Wise, maintain a Mistriss beside.</p>

                  <p>And if it be not true, why do the great Debauchées at last, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake all their Mistresses for a Wife? we find most of 'em Marry at the long run; nay generally they prove the best Husbands. The Reason is, they have experimented the folly of that lewd course of Life.</p>

                  <p>Gemminy Sir, how you are garnish'd out, as if you were to be serv'd up for a standing Dish — more for ornament, than use —let me help you off with your Cloak. Some body has pin'd a dish clout to your back.</p>

                  <p>Sir. Mr. Alderman sent me to acquaint you, that a Lord, and a Coach full of Ladies—of his acquaintance, Just now are come into bait, whom he could not but invite to dine with him—therefore makes bold with you as his special good friend, the Table being but little to have a a Cloath laid in another Room.</p>

Your Worship may for once dispence with your Magistracy, and sit with me and the waiting Gentlewoman; I don't like Dineing amongst great Gentry, 'tis not mannerly to fill one's belly before 'em.</p>

                  <p>Sir <hi>Barnaby,</hi> two words ere you go; 'tis not convenient you shou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part under the scandal of a Licentious Bastard-getter, therefore that you may go with as clear a reputation as you came, I declare these two here were set on by some that I know, to bring you in disrepute with Mr. Alderman and his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.— Farther they confess, that the old Justice shifted them out of his Room in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to yours this morning by accident.

                  <p>Look you Sir, these are the Clothes you found in my Cozens Chamber, which we borrow'd of those two young Youths that came down with us yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the other Stage-Coach, and are going into <hi>France</hi> with their Governor to Travel; these we put on out of a frolick. I undress'd in her Chamber; and I was that little Fornicator that so kiss'd and caress'd her in her bed.
