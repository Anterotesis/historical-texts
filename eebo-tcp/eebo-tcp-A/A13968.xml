            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Laſtly, if through humaine frailtie, any faults haue eſcaped (as who is it that erres not?) remember that leſſon which nature teacheth; That of all liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures man doth moſt often twinckle with his eyes, to teach him not to be a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous cenſurer of his brethren. Ponder wiſely, iudge charitable, pardon cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and if thou be ſicke of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, repent ſpeedily. For God ſhakes his rodde ouer thy head euen now, and the day of the Lord draweth nigh.</p>

               <p>Secondly, I ioine depopulation of towns, and this new kind of Incloſure together: becauſe the one of them doth follow the other commonly, euen as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilie as the ſhadow doth the body: for although in ſome places where this Incloſure is put in practiſe (as our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſers can cunningly affirme) that all the houſes remaine that haue been: yet there be not ſo many people in them as hath beene: becauſe that tillage, by meanes of their Incloſure is decaied, which required many moe ſeruants to

accompliſh it, then their paſtures will doe to looke to them.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, whereas Incloſers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, and ſay, that it is not Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but the couetous minds of men, that pulleth downe townes.

God plagues our contempt of tillage, with penurie and ſcarcitie. Gentlemen now a daies, thinke ſcorne of the Plough.</p>
               <p>Tillage was the firſt worke, that was impoſed vpon man, after that he was baniſhed out of <hi>Paradiſe. And God</hi>

ſome ſtumbling blockes: for theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſers perchaunce will flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and ſay, that it is but a ſmall vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage that they haue diſpeopled, or a ſmall farme or cottage that they haue decaied or pulled downe; and what doe you make ſo much to doe thereof?

Would any of vs willingly haue the little finger of his hand cut off? no more no doubt, will Jeſus Chriſt ſuffer one poore cottage, (which is as it were his little finger) to bée cut off, vnpuniſhed without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

               <p>Another ſtumbling blocke is, that ſome will ſay they muſt néedes main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their ſtates.

                  <hi>humbled himſelfe, and became as a ſeruant.

<pb facs="tcp:20120:19"/>
great eſtate: and how did they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themſelues? They did not in the Popes darke kingdome depopulate townes, and ſhall we in the light of the Goſpell?

               <p>They which ſtand ſo much on this point, that they muſt maintaine their eſtates, know not what humilitie is. All Chriſts diſciples <hi>muſt be humble.</hi>

in euery Towne to pay it, now thoſe townes incloſed being diſpeopled, and thoſe rich farmers which were wont to pay it, being fled away, the payments thereof are impoſed on poore men: who being but tenants, and hauing but a ſmall flocke of cattell (and perchance a great familie to maintaine) are enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be three pound men in the Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die booke; whereas the Lord of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or Frée-holder; being their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, liuing in other places, hauing fiue hundred or a thouſand ſhéepe, in the ſaid Lordſhip (which they haue incloſed and improued) and perchance fiftie or a hundred cattell, will pay nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the payment of the ſame.

As the body cannot conſiſt without legges &amp; armes, ſo neither the Common-wealth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Huſbandmen, Labourers, &amp; Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Surely, they which will not maintaine theſe armes and legs, which muſt fight and runne for them, are euill members of this Common-wealth. If the legges of our bodies be weake, how will we complaine? or if our armes be out of ioint, what ſpeed will we make to haue them put into the ioint again? and ſhall we not nouriſh bountifully theſe legges? ſhall we ſuffer theſe armes to be out of ioint? And here as Gods word


<pb facs="tcp:20120:42"/>
may ſéeme to be the moſt ſtrong liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo in ſome ſort theſe Commons <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 3.</note> may ſeeme to bee the ſinewes of the Common-wealth: For, as our armes are ioyned to our bodies by ſinewes and ligaments, ſo no doubt theſe armes were tied in the beginning to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth by their Commons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon them. For benefits are the ſtrongeſt bonds to binde men withall, as the Heathen haue taught.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may ſeeme they were ordained for common workes: For ſo haue Churches béen repaired, and brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges built, and high waies made &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. They would lay a péece of their Common, to be ſo wen, or for meadow, and with the profit thereof being ſolde, performe any common worke; and by that meanes, ſuch like workes coſt the poore of the Towne very little. And hereof (as appeares nowe) comes the ridges and furrowes in ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which proueth that for ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes they haue béene ſowne. And the like good would come to the Common-wealth, if that they were vſed ſo ſtill.


<pb facs="tcp:20120:42"/>
Whereas now in many places, where theſe Commons are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure, euery penie comes out of the poore mans purſe; and hauing no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtocke, hardly any common worke can be brought to paſſe, as in times paſt hath beene.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, a part of theſe Commons were the Kings high waies; which name plainely argues, that Kings were the authors of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as of all other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. <hi>And thoſe which are leading from one Market towne to another, ought to be two hundred foote broade,</hi> (as appeareth by a Statute of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> 13. made in 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 5.) which were large and ſafe, that your Maieſtie might paſſe the countrey in progreſſe with your traine; and your Subiects trauell without danger. But now Incloſers haue ſo pinched them in, by their ditches and hedges, allowing but 24. for the way, that your Maieſtie cannot paſſe in their waies and lanes, vnleſſe they throwe open their hedges againe for that time, as experience lately hath proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Neither can your poore Subiects


<pb facs="tcp:20120:43"/>
trauel with their weake beaſts without danger, the waies being thereby made ſtraite and narrow, and therefore deepe and dangerous; neither without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their liues, both by foreſtalling of théeues, and alſo by opening the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous gates. The poore Cottager had his Common allowed him alſo (as ſhould ſéeme) for his paines taken in mending of theſe high waies, which now Incloſers haue quite ſpoyled, by pinching them in: but the burthen doth remaine on poore mens backs ſtill; and they are forced to doe their common daies, as before, and yet their Common is taken from them.</p>
               <p>But Lords of Mannours, and Frée-holders, who haue their Commons, and ſhould alſo worke their common daies, and for euery plow-land they holde, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Tillage, or Paſture, ſhould find one Cart or draught, to leade ſtones and rubbiſh towards the repairing of high waies; doe now of late, in many places (where Tillage is conuerted to Paſture) where heretofore, there hath beene thirtie draughts or Carts in a


<pb facs="tcp:20120:43"/>
towne, which did performe their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon daies, ſkant finde tenne: and he that hath decayed fower or fiue draughts, ſkant ſends one to kéepe his common daies. And hereof it comes, that high waies in many places, are not ſo well maintained, as heretofore they haue béene.</p>
               <p>Nay, if theſe Commons had béene appointed by the Lords of Mannors, then as mens natures in all ages haue béene diuers, ſo theſe Commons would alſo, in ſome places haue béene better, and in other ſome worſe: but in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according to the proportion of the towne, they are very liberall and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful: declaring themſelues to be beames comming from the ſame Sunne; I meane from the rich liberalitie of the Kings maieſtie.</p>
               <p>There was a tenure in <hi>England</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Baſſa tenura,</hi> now called Copie hold: and theſe had their fréedomes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of the Mannor. There was another tenure called Tenure of villenage, and theſe had neither libertie of Commons, nor of


<pb facs="tcp:20120:44"/>
their very bodies, and ſeede. And this may bee an euident argument, that Kings gaue theſe Commons: for thoſe which had offended his Maieſtie moſt greeuouſly, he made them villens, and depriued them of the auncient liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which all his other people enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that as this villenage, was by the King inflicted vpon ſome: So no doubt the former liberties and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges alſo, were by Kings giuen and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. But Incloſers now, for no cauſe of diſobedience, but for their owne priuate lucres, take from their tenants, that which Kings did not, but vpon great offences committed againſt their perſon.</p>
               <p>There is an auncient law, (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde <note place="margin">20. Hen. 3. 4. 13 Edw. 4. 6.</note> that tenants complained of the Lords of Mannors for incloſing as ſhould ſéeme of their Commons) by which it was enacted that Lords ſhould leaue ſufficient Common for their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, with ſufficient egreſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe: And, that being performed, they might (as ſhould ſéeme) make their commoditie of the reſt. But if that their


<pb facs="tcp:20120:44"/>
egreſſe and regreſſe were any thing hindred by the deforceors, or that they had not ſufficient paſture; that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhould recouer their ſeiſon by the view of Jewrors; ſo that by their diſcretions and othes, they ſhall haue ſufficient Common and paſture with egreſſe and regreſſe, and the diſſeſors ſhould bée amerced and render damages. This auncient ſtatute plainely proues, that Lords in euery towne, ſhould leaue to their tenants ſufficient Common. And therefore doe they not breake the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this law, which incloſe, leauing no Common at all?</p>
               <p>Theſe Incloſers take vpon them, as though they were, not Lords of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, but rather kings; and doe make, as it were, a new Commonwealth, and a new forme of gouernment in townes wherein they are Lords. They will haue no Common left at all. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there hath béene common Leas and Meadow (which hath béen without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of man yéerly letten, and the profit thereof hath béen imployed towards the repaire of the Church, and ſuch other


<pb facs="tcp:20120:45"/>

For, in what parts of your Realme growes finer wooll, and therefore of better price, there Noblemen and Gentlemen, yea and ſome Abbots (holy men I aſſure you) not being content with the yearely rents and commodities, which were wont to be payed out of farmes vnto their anceſtors; and not content, themſelues to liue idlely and pleaſantly, and to doe no good


<pb facs="tcp:20120:47"/>
to the common wealth, vnleſſe alſo that they ſhould hinder and hurt it; that they may leaue nothing but reape all commodities into their owne hands: They incloſe all their paſtures, they pull downe houſes, they ouerthrow townes, leauing the Church onely for to croowe vp their ſheepe in. And as though your forreſts and parkes had not ſpoyled ground enough amongst you, theſe holy men turne into a wildernes all dwelling houſes, and whatſoeuer heretofore hath beene tilled. And therefore one inſatiable glutton and most pestilent plague to his Countrey, ioyneth fields together, that he may incloſe within one hedge ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand acres. The husbandmen are either thrust out of their inheritances, or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by craft beguiled, or by force oppreſſed, or depriued of them, or elſe wearied with iniuries and compelled to ſell them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore howſoeuer theſe wretches doe flit, men, women, husbands, wiues, blinde men, and widowes, fathers with their young children, with a greater, than a rich family (for husbandrie ſtands in neede of many) they flit I ſay from their knowne and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed dwellings, and they can finde no


<pb facs="tcp:20120:48"/>
place where to put in their heades; They ſell all their ſtuffe when as they muſt needes be thruſt out, (which is not worth much if that they could tarry and get a good chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for it) they ſell it I ſay almoſt for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And when as by wandring a while they haue ſpent that, what muſt they needs doe then, but either ſteale, and iuſtly be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their labours, or elſe wander vp and downe and begge, and then alſo are caſt into priſon as vagrant perſons, ſeeing no man will ſet them a worke, when as they doe moſt willingly offer their ſeruices? For now there is nothing to be done about husbandrie, wherein they haue beene brought vp all their liues, when as there is nothing ſowen. For now one Sheepeheard, and one Neat-heard is ſufficient to looke to that ground with cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, to the tillage whereof, that it might beare corne, many mens hands and labours were required.

<pb facs="tcp:20120:48"/>
ſhall not we condemne it in the light of the Goſpell? Secondly, he affirmes that it makes beggers, and that it makes théeues, and cauſeth a dearth of corne in our land, nay, it pulleth downe Townes.
