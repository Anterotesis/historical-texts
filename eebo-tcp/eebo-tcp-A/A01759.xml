            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

yeeres afterwards, and was a man of great knowledge and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but in respect this Island had beene long corrupted with Heretickes, and now oppressed with Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, it is likely that the Church in <hi>Britaine</hi> (by reason of the tumults of such rebellious and outragious enemies) wanting her due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence, could not as yet display the banner of this reformed Bible, but marched under the

nor yet the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the chaire of <hi>Moses,</hi> was any whit diminished, although <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> for a time possessed the same, but that the <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> who were clensed were sent to the Priests (although unworthy of their Primacy) and <hi>Caiphas</hi> himselfe (albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it he was the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied, because he was high Priest of that yeere; all which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse against the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes

to be more vertuous and exemplar; and yet would I have you to know, that these were defects not of Religion but of life, such as those offences of the Priests, Scribes, and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, so often in the word of God recited, whose sins (although too foulely they soiled their owne soules) yet could they never staine the immaculate Church of God, committed unto their charge: Neither yet did <hi>Gildas</hi> as another <hi>Elias</hi> complaine that there was not one left but himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone who worthily served God, since in sundry places he sheweth how many were yet here in this land whose holy lives deserved most

high commendation, even as our Lord spake to the same <hi>Elias</hi> saying. There remained seven thousand in <hi>Israel,</hi> who never bowed their knees to <hi>Baal.</hi> But suppose <hi>Britaine</hi> had beene wholly drowned in the deepe Seas of offences, yet did <hi>Italy, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Gall.</hi> with many other mighty Provinces of the Christian world, flourish at the selfe same time, both in vertuous Life, and true Religion, not unlike the Kingdome of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> which in that season, when <hi>Elias</hi> so complained of <hi>Israel,</hi> did notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding openly maintaine the true worshipping of God; but this insueing Treatise telleth us that in the field of

disobedience of the Church in withstanding the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> the first Arch-bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> although within a while afterwards, it pleased God of his singular mercy to recall them backe into his Catholike fold againe: Neither let any man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine I have Translated this worke to disclose the faults of Pastors, and Superiours; For I had rather with <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi> conceale, then with <hi>Cham</hi> reveale the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of spirituall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

unto me saying: O Sonne of man, speake to the children of my people, and thou shalt say unto them: The land whereupon I shall bring my sword, and the people of the land shall take some one man among them, and ordaine him to be a watchman over them, and hee shall espie the sword comming upon the land, and sound with his trumpet, and signifie unto the people, who so truely shall then heare the sound of the trumpet, and yet hearing shall not beware: and the sword shal come and catch him, his blood shall light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne head, because when hee heard the sound of the trumpet, hee was not watchfull, his blood shall be upon him, and this man, for

that hee hath preserved his owne soule, hath delivered himselfe. But the watchman if he shall see the sword com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and not give notice with his trumpet, and the people shall not beware; and the sword comming shall take away a soule from among them, both the soule it selfe is caught a captive for her i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities, and I will also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire her blood at the hand of the watchman.

now let us also behold what the trumpet of the Gospell, sounding to the whole world, speaketh like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to disordered Priests; for as wee have often said, this our discourse tendeth not to treate of them, who obtaine lawfully the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall seate, and such as rightly and skilfully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how to dispose their spirituall foode (in time convenient) unto their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low servants (if yet at this time there remaine any great number of these in this our Country) but wee onely talke of ignorant and unexpert Shepherds, who leave their flock, &amp; feed on vaine matters, for learned and good Pastours are free
