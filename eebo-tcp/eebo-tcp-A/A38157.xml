         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt, I warn you, that you under the pretence of bearing a Law to execute puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on all thoſe that offend, as you call it, that you do not form your Weapons againſt the Work of this the day of my God, in which he is over-turning Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon the Great, the Mother of Harlots, even the Myſtery of Iniquity, under which you have committed all your Spiritual Whoredoms, under the Name of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and ſo <hi>Lucifer</hi> which was a Morning-Star, but was caſt off, and droven into Darkneſs, is become your Head and Law-giver; from whence did come all your Church-Forms and Powers, ſeeking to make all the Earth to worſhip the Beaſt and the Dragon, and they have had power to ſlay the two Witneſſes and have cauſed their dead bodies to lie in the ſtreets, not being buried, becauſe they were not to rot, but to be dryed up by the heat of their Perſecution; for Darkneſs hath been ſpread over all Nations, by reaſon of the abominations which they have been made fat withall, having drunk the bloud of the Innocent, as an Ox drinketh the water, and yet have they not enough; therefore <hi>Cain's</hi> Spirit is not ſatisfied with bloud, till he hath bloud to drink; and then will he cry out enough, which the Lord will aſſuredly do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he ceaſe not to ſhed bloud: Therefore, before the day of Reward come upon you, ceaſe, ceaſe perſecuting any for matter of Conſcience, for the Lord is breaking the Clouds, and the Vail is a rending, and the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall be redeemed from the Earth, in which they have been in bondage.
