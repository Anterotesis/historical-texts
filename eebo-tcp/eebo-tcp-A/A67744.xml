            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Again, how admirably did the <hi>Lord</hi> turn the <hi>malice</hi> of <hi>Iosephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren when they <hi>sold</hi> him into <hi>Egypt!</hi> And that devillish <hi>plot</hi> of <hi>Haman</hi> against <hi>Mordecai</hi> and his people to the <hi>good</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> and of <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mordecai</hi> in particular? <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.8, 11. <hi>Hester</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. Their <hi>plots</hi> to <hi>overthrow Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> were turned by a divine <hi>Providence</hi> to the only means of <hi>advantaging</hi> them. And herein was that of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> verified, <hi>Surely the rage of man shall turn to thy praise, Psal.</hi> 76.10. He who can do all things, will do that which shall be most for his own <hi>honour:</hi> And it is not so much <hi>glory</hi> to <hi>God</hi> to <hi>take away</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, as to <hi>use their evill</hi> to his <hi>own holy purposes</hi>; how soon could the Commander of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> rid the <hi>World</hi> of bad <hi>members?</hi> But so should he lose the praise of working <hi>good</hi> by <hi>evil instruments:</hi> it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth that the <hi>Angels</hi> of God resist their <hi>actions,</hi> while their <hi>persons</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
                     <p>Yea, as in the <hi>Creation,</hi> out of that confused <hi>Chaos,</hi> he drew forth this orderly and adorned <hi>World</hi>: so still out of <hi>Satans Tragedies</hi> and <hi>Hurli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burlies,</hi> he brings forth <hi>sweet order</hi> and <hi>comeliness:</hi> for God (many times) works by contrary means: as Christ restored the <hi>blinde man</hi> to his <hi>sight,</hi> with <hi>clay</hi> and <hi>spittle</hi>; he caused the <hi>Israelites</hi> to <hi>grow</hi> with <hi>depression,</hi> with <hi>persecution</hi> to <hi>multiply, Exod.</hi> 1.12. The blood of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> is the <hi>seed</hi> of the <hi>Church: Persecution</hi> enlargeth the <hi>bounds</hi> of it; like as <hi>Palms</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and <hi>Camamile</hi> trod upon, <hi>mount</hi> the <hi>more, grow</hi> the faster.</p>
                     <p>Yea, it is admirable to consider, how the <hi>Gospel grew, maugre</hi> all the adverse <hi>blasts,</hi> and <hi>floods</hi> which the <hi>billows</hi> of <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>bellows</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> could <hi>blow</hi> or <hi>poure out</hi> against it in those <hi>sanguinary Persecutions:</hi> The more we are cut down by the sword of <hi>Persecution</hi>; the more still we are, sayes <hi>Tertullian,</hi> of the <hi>Christians</hi> in his time: Yea, the sufferings of one, begat many to the love of the truth: we read that <hi>Cicilia</hi> a poor Virgin, by her gracious behaviour in her Martyrdom; was the means of converting four hundred to <hi>Christ.</hi> The <hi>spectators</hi> made contrary constructions, to what their <hi>Persecutors</hi> intended: witness <hi>Iustine Martyr,</hi> Who when he saw the <hi>Christians</hi> suffer such great things so cheerfully, said; Surely these men have more in them then the men of the World: they have other principles: and thereupon enquired what manner of people they were, and so came to embrace the truth. Whence Master <hi>Iohn Lindsey,</hi> a friend to <hi>Bishop Bettoune,</hi> upon the burning of Master <hi>Patrick Hamilton</hi>; said to him: My <hi>Lord,</hi> if you burn any more; let them be burnt in hollow Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: for the smoak of Master <hi>Hamilton</hi> hath infected as many as it blew upon (Master <hi>Knox</hi> in his <hi>History of Scotland.</hi>) And as touching <hi>Iulians</hi>

                     <p n="8">8 EIghtly, that we may have an humble conceit of our selves, and wholly depend upon God. <hi>We received the sentence of death in our selves</hi> (saith the <hi>Apostle</hi>) <hi>because we should not trust in our selves,</hi> but in God, <hi>who raiseth us up from the dead,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.9.

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so it fares with <hi>Gods children,</hi> till <hi>afflictions</hi> come. The <hi>Prodigall</hi> never thought of his <hi>Father,</hi> till he wanted <hi>husks:</hi> The <hi>hemorrhoisse</hi> never made out to Christ, till all her money was <hi>gone.</hi> The <hi>widow that is left alone trusteth in God,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.5. who while she had an <hi>husband, leaned</hi> too much upon him. The <hi>poor man</hi> depends not upon the relief of <hi>others,</hi> untill he findes nothing at <hi>home.</hi> Till our <hi>means is spent,</hi> we are apt to trust in uncertain <hi>riches</hi>; but after, in the Name of <hi>the Lord, Zeph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>As a</hi> bore himself bold upon his <hi>forces,</hi> as being <hi>five hundred and fourscore thousand strong:</hi> till he was over-matcht with an <hi>Army of a thousand thousand Ethiopians:</hi> this made him cry, <hi>Help us O Lord our God, for we rest on thee,</hi> 2 Chron. 14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God crosses</hi> many times <hi>our likeliest projects,</hi> and makes the <hi>sinews</hi> of the arme of <hi>flesh</hi> to <hi>crack</hi>; that being unbottomed of the <hi>creature</hi>; we may trust in the living God, who giveth us <hi>richly</hi> all things to <hi>enjoy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.</p>
                     <p>The people of <hi>Laish,</hi> because they wanted <hi>nothing,</hi> would have busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with no man, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 18.7.

                     <p>When a <hi>stubborn Delinquent,</hi> being <hi>committed,</hi> was no whit mollified with his durance, but grew more perverse then he was before; one of the <hi>Senators</hi> said to the rest, Let us <hi>forget him a while,</hi> and then he will <hi>remember himself:</hi> Loving <hi>Spaniels,</hi> the more they are <hi>beaten</hi>; the more <hi>tractable,</hi> and <hi>gentle</hi> do they appear, and apply themselves more <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently</hi> to their <hi>Masters call.</hi>

                     <p>It is a wonder to see, how the <hi>best men</hi> may be <hi>mistaken</hi> in their own <hi>powers:</hi> When our <hi>Saviour</hi> propounds to <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> Are ye able to <hi>drink of the cup</hi> that I shall <hi>drink of?</hi> And to be <hi>baptized</hi> with the <hi>Baptism</hi> that I shall be baptized with? Out of an eager desire of the honour, they are apt to <hi>undertake</hi> the <hi>condition:</hi> and answer according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>We are able, Matth.</hi> 20.22. But, alas <hi>poor men!</hi> no thanks to them that they were able to run away, (as they did) when their <hi>Master</hi> was apprehended. For, God must give us his <hi>daily bread</hi> to <hi>feed us,</hi> and his <hi>daily breath to quicken us,</hi> or we quickly perish: yet how common is it for men to brag and crack of what they can do! yea, one that hath but a <hi>wooden head,</hi> and a <hi>leaden heart:</hi> how will he help it out with a brazen face, and a golden hand! for, being as <hi>great in pride,</hi> as he is <hi>small in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert:</hi> he will keep a do in an audacious <hi>masterliness,</hi> as if with <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> he would bear down all with <hi>large proffers.</hi> But this cannot be so pleasing to <hi>nature,</hi> as it is hateful to <hi>God.</hi> Neither can there be a <hi>worse sign</hi> of ensuing <hi>evil,</hi> then for a man in a carnal <hi>presumption</hi> to vaunt of his own abilities.

                     <p>Again, it makes us <hi>pitiful, and compassionate to others:</hi> They (said <hi>Sophocles</hi>) are usually the most <hi>compassionate</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> who have suffered miseries <hi>themselves.</hi> And what saith that <hi>Tyrian Queen?

                     </p>
                     <p>And lastly, the <hi>Devil</hi> hereby is cheated, who if he cannot <hi>beat</hi> us down to <hi>sin</hi>; will <hi>blow us</hi> up with <hi>pride:</hi> he will undermine us; if he cannot <hi>overthrow</hi> us: like a most cunning <hi>Wrestler,</hi> who, if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>crush</hi> a man to the ground with plain <hi>strength</hi>; he will <hi>lift</hi> him <hi>up,</hi> that he may give him the <hi>greater fall.</hi>

                     <p>And nothing doth more <hi>advantage Satan</hi> then <hi>Pride:</hi> for first, a man shall never be a <hi>Proficient,</hi> that thinks himself already <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</hi> Secondly, when he can <hi>poison</hi> our <hi>good works</hi> with <hi>Pharisaism</hi>; he makes us by <hi>over-valuing them</hi>; to <hi>lose them,</hi>

                     <p>So that we cannot put too much trust in <hi>him,</hi> not <hi>too little</hi> in our <hi>selves.</hi> O God, let me ever be <hi>humbly</hi> dejected in the sense of mine own <hi>insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency:</hi> let me <hi>give</hi> all the <hi>glory</hi> to <hi>thee,</hi> and <hi>take nothing</hi> to my <hi>self,</hi> but my <hi>infirmities</hi>; lest it fare with me, as it did with that <hi>Armenian, Tigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> by name, who being <hi>encamped</hi> upon a <hi>Hill,</hi> with <hi>four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men,</hi> and discovering the <hi>Army</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> being not above <hi>fourteen thousand</hi> marching towards him: made himself <hi>merry</hi> with

                     <p>By this time we see, that there is danger in being without <hi>dangers:</hi> that self-confidence is <hi>pride</hi> without wit: that the <hi>best mindes</hi> troubled yield <hi>inconsiderate motions:</hi> that as <hi>water</hi> violently <hi>stirred</hi> sends up <hi>bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>; so the vanities of our hearts, and our most secret and hidden <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> (as <hi>dregs</hi> in a <hi>glasse</hi>) shew themselves when shaken by an <hi>injury,</hi> though they lay hid before.

So proud are we by <hi>nature,</hi> that before we come to the trial, we think that we can repel the <hi>strongest assault,</hi> and overcome all <hi>enemies</hi> by our own <hi>power</hi>; but when we feel our selves <hi>vanquished</hi> and <hi>foiled</hi> by every small <hi>temptation,</hi> we learn to have a more <hi>humble</hi> conceit of our own <hi>ability,</hi> and to depend wholly on the <hi>Lord:</hi> as is set down, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13.3. to the end.

Diogenes</hi> was wont to say when the people <hi>mockt</hi> him, They <hi>deride</hi> me, yet I am not <hi>derided</hi>; I am not <hi>the man</hi> they take me for. This <hi>reason</hi> is of more <hi>force</hi> from the mouth of an <hi>innocent Christian.</hi> If a <hi>rich</hi> man be called <hi>poor,</hi> or a sound <hi>Christian,</hi> an <hi>hypocrite</hi>; he <hi>slights</hi> it, he <hi>laughs</hi> at it, because he knoweth the same to be <hi>false,</hi> and that his <hi>Accuser</hi> is <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken</hi>; whereas, if a <hi>Begger</hi> be called <hi>bankrupt</hi>; or a <hi>dissembler, hypocrite</hi>; he will <hi>wince</hi> and <hi>kick,</hi> and be most grievously <hi>offended</hi> at it. Yea, as <hi>soares</hi> and <hi>ulcers</hi> are <hi>grieved,</hi> not only at a light <hi>touch,</hi> but even with <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition</hi> of being <hi>touched</hi>; so will an <hi>exulcerate minde,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca.</hi> And as <hi>small letters</hi> offend <hi>bad eyes</hi>; so least <hi>appearances</hi> of contradiction will <hi>grieve</hi> the <hi>ill affected ears</hi> of <hi>guilty persons,</hi> saith <hi>Plutarch.</hi> For, let mens <hi>tongues,</hi> like <hi>Bells,</hi> give but an <hi>indefinite,</hi> and not a <hi>significant sound,</hi> they imagin them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When like <hi>Caius the humanist,</hi> one thinks every <hi>word</hi> spoken, tends to his <hi>disgrace</hi>; and is as unwilling to <hi>bear,</hi> as <hi>forbear</hi> reproaehes. But where the <hi>conscience</hi> is <hi>clear,</hi> the <hi>case is altered. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> was never offended with any <hi>report</hi> that went of him, because if it were <hi>true,</hi> it would sound to his <hi>praise</hi>; if <hi>false,</hi> his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>manners</hi> should prove it <hi>contrary.</hi> And indeed, the best <hi>confutation</hi> of their <hi>slanders,</hi> is not by our <hi>great words,</hi> but by our <hi>good works. Sophocles</hi> being accused by his own <hi>children,</hi> that he grew <hi>Dotard,</hi> and spent their <hi>Patrimonies</hi> idly; when he was summoned, did not personally appear before the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> but sent one of his new <hi>Tragedies</hi> to their perusall, which being read, made them confesse, This is not the <hi>work</hi> of a man that <hi>dotes.</hi> So against all <hi>clamours</hi> and swelling <hi>opprobries,</hi> set but thine <hi>innocency</hi> and <hi>good life,</hi> thou needest do no more. 'That <hi>body</hi> which is in good <hi>health,</hi> is <hi>strong,</hi> and able to bear the <hi>great storms</hi> and <hi>bitter cold</hi> of <hi>Winter,</hi> and likewise the excessive and <hi>intemperate heat</hi> of the <hi>Summer</hi>; but with a crazie and <hi>distempered body,</hi> it is far otherwise: Even so, a <hi>sound heart,</hi> and <hi>cleer conscience,</hi> will abide <hi>all tryals:</hi> in <hi>prosperity</hi> it will not be <hi>lifted up</hi> in <hi>adversity,</hi> it will not be utterly <hi>cast down:</hi> whereas, the <hi>corrupt heart</hi> and <hi>festered conscience,</hi>
                           <pb n="67" facs="tcp:102698:36"/>
can endure nothing; even a <hi>word,</hi> if it be pleasing, <hi>puffs him up with pride</hi>; if not, it <hi>swels him with passion.</hi> A <hi>guilty conscience</hi> (like <hi>Glasse,</hi>) will <hi>sweat</hi> with the least <hi>breath,</hi> and like a <hi>windy iustrument,</hi> be put out of <hi>tune</hi> with the very distemper of the <hi>aire:</hi> but when the <hi>soul is steeled with goodnesse,</hi> no assaults of <hi>evil</hi> can <hi>daunt it.</hi> I more fear what is within me (sayes <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>) then what comes from without: The storms and wind without, do never move the <hi>Earth</hi>; only Vapours within, cause <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> Jam. 4.1. No greater sign of <hi>innocency</hi> when we are <hi>accused,</hi> than <hi>mildnesse,</hi> as we see in <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who being both <hi>accused</hi> and <hi>committed</hi> for forcing his <hi>Mistresse,</hi> answered just nothing that we can read of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.17, 18. And <hi>Susanna,</hi> who being <hi>accused</hi> by the two <hi>Elders</hi> of an haynous crime (which they alone were guilty of,) <hi>never contended</hi> by laying the fault upon them, but <hi>appeals</hi> unto <hi>God</hi> whether she were <hi>innocent</hi> or no.

And <hi>Hannah,</hi> whose reply to <hi>Ely</hi> (when he falsly accused her of <hi>druukennesse</hi>) was no other, but, <hi>Nay my Lord, count not thine Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid for a wicked woman,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.15, 16.

Again, when the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> sent a mighty <hi>Host</hi> to take <hi>Elisha,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> had <hi>smote</hi> them all with <hi>blindnesse,</hi> and shut them into <hi>Samaria</hi>; what doth the Prophet? <hi>slay</hi> them?

Even in like manner it is with the truly gracious; they being wronged, do not suffer rage to transport them, as it doth <hi>beasts</hi> to set <hi>upon the stone</hi> or weapon that hath hurt them, like <hi>little Children,</hi> who if they fall, will have the ground beaten: their <hi>false grief</hi> is satisfied with feigned <hi>revenge.</hi> But, they look higher, even to God that occasioned it. Or if they be <hi>angry,</hi> they turn their malice from the person <hi>which punisheth them,</hi> to the <hi>sinne by which and for which he came to have leave and power to punish them</hi>; and to themselves, for committing such <hi>sins.</hi> The cause of their <hi>suffering</hi> doth more vex them, than the things which they <hi>suffer:</hi> and they grieve more for the displeasure of <hi>God,</hi> than for the stripes of his <hi>displeasure.</hi> It is not the punishment, but the <hi>cause</hi> of it, makes them <hi>sorrowfull:</hi> And indeed, to speak home to every mans <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> why are we patient or impatient? it is worth the noting, when <hi>sinne</hi> lyes light, then <hi>reproaches</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> lye heavy, whereas if we truly feel the weight of <hi>sinne</hi>; all <hi>indignities</hi> will be as nothing. Or thirdly, In case they do return an answer, it is after the manner of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> who would not deny the <hi>sins</hi> his <hi>enemy</hi> taxed him with; but reproves his <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> rather in that being unacquainted with the <hi>infinity</hi> of his <hi>crimes,</hi> he layes only two or three to his <hi>charge,</hi> whereas indeed he was guilty of a <hi>million.</hi> Or as <hi>Latymer</hi> was wont; who rejoyced when any objected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion against him in his Sermons: saying he knew by that, that they could not object against the matter it self. Or according to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> his example, who would not punish <hi>Nicanor,</hi> although he <hi>openly spake evill</hi> of him; saying, when he heard thereof, I suppose <hi>Nicanor</hi> is a good man, it were better to <hi>search</hi> whether the <hi>fault</hi> be in us, or no: so no sooner shall an holy mans enemy accuse him of <hi>hypocrisie, pride, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, covetousnesse,</hi> &amp;c. but he will go to <hi>God,</hi> and accuse himself, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, I am so indeed; yea with <hi>Paul,</hi> I am the <hi>chief of all sinners,</hi> I am more vile than his termes can make me, and I much marvell my <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no greater then to hear a few ill and bitter words.</hi> And indeed one would think whatsoever is not pain nor sufferance (or admit it be pain and sufferance,) so long as it is not a curse but a <hi>crosse,</hi> may well be born without <hi>grumbling.</hi> What said that <hi>Gentleman</hi> in <hi>Athens</hi> to his friends? when <hi>Ashuerus</hi> came and took away <hi>half his plate,</hi> as he was at dinner with him, they admiring that he was <hi>not a whit moved</hi> thereat; <hi>I thank God,</hi> quoth he, that his Highnesse hath <hi>left me any thing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yea, suppose we lose all we have; our goods are <hi>furthest</hi> off us: and if but in these we <hi>smart,</hi> we must confesse to finde favour.</p>
                        <p>Or admit, they hurt our bodies, or <hi>kill us,</hi> which they may soon do if God but give leave; for our life (even the best of us) is but like a <hi>bubble,</hi>

                        <p>That all <hi>crosses</hi> and <hi>curses, temporall, spirituall</hi> and <hi>eternall,</hi> even from the <hi>pains of the damned,</hi> to the very <hi>Itch,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> sets down, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.27. are <hi>deserved,</hi> and come not upon us against <hi>equity</hi> (<hi>equity</hi> I say in respect of God, not in respect of men; they come from a just <hi>Author,</hi> though from an unjust instrument,) And that <hi>sinne</hi> is the ground of all our griefs, the <hi>source of all our sufferings, wickednesse</hi> the root of our <hi>wretchednesse:</hi> that we are <hi>disciplin'd,</hi> is from our <hi>defects</hi>; is a truth undeniable appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for, first <hi>God affirms it,</hi> Deut. 28. Isa. 57.17. Hos. 13.9. Jer. 30.15. and 4.18.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, His servants <hi>confirm it,</hi> 1 Chron. 21.17. Isa. 64.5. Dan. 9.7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lam. 1.5, 8. and 3.39, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ezra 9.13. Luk. 23.41.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Good <hi>reason makes for it,</hi> sinfull <hi>men smite</hi> not their <hi>dogs,</hi> much lesse their <hi>children,</hi> without a <hi>cause:</hi> and shall we think the just God will smite without just <hi>cause?</hi> his <hi>judgements</hi> (saith a <hi>Father</hi>) are <hi>sometimes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, alwayes just.</hi> No misery had ever <hi>afflicted us,</hi> if <hi>sinne</hi> had not first <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What's the reason we all <hi>die?</hi> it could not be in justice if we had not all <hi>sinned</hi>; and so, of all other evils: even <hi>sicknesse</hi> originally proceeds from <hi>sinne,</hi> and all <hi>weaknesse</hi> from <hi>wickednesse</hi>: one man languisheth of a <hi>Consumption,</hi> another laboureth of a <hi>Feaver,</hi> a third is rackt with the <hi>Gout,</hi> a fourth swoln with the <hi>Dropsie,</hi> a fift hath his <hi>soul let out with a sword</hi>; every one hath a severall way to bring him to the common end, <hi>death:</hi> but, <hi>sinne</hi> is the universall <hi>disease, Death passed upon all, for all have sinned, Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Iames</hi> 3.2. Yea as we brought a world of <hi>sinne</hi> into the <hi>world with us</hi>; so since, each man hath broken every one of Gods <hi>ten Laws,</hi> ten thousand times, and ten thousand wayes: which is far from a <hi>privative ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,</hi> in reforming that which is <hi>evill,</hi> and a <hi>positive holinesse,</hi> in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is good, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22, 23. and every <hi>sin</hi> helps: for as <hi>originall sin</hi> is the <hi>originall cause</hi> of death, so actuall <hi>sins</hi> hasten it.</p>
                        <p>But to conclude in <hi>generall,</hi> that <hi>sin</hi> is the cause we <hi>suffer,</hi> is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: for commonly no <hi>judgement</hi> comes from God, but, some particular <hi>provocation</hi> of <hi>man</hi> went before it: the <hi>hand</hi> of Divine <hi>Iustice</hi> seldom makes us <hi>smart,</hi> without some eminent cause foregoing: therefore, <hi>David</hi> seeing a <hi>famine</hi> in the Land, inquires for the particular provoking <hi>sin,</hi> 2 Sam. 21.1. so when we suffer, our question should be, What have we done? yea, what have we done in the same kinde? for, oftentimes we may read our <hi>sin</hi> in our <hi>punishment,</hi> as it fared with <hi>Adonibezeck,</hi> Judg. 1.7. and many other mentioned in Scripture. <hi>Sodom</hi> was <hi>burnt</hi> with <hi>fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall,</hi> as they <hi>burned</hi> with <hi>lust unnaturall.

So when thou <hi>receivest</hi> an injury, remember what injuries thou hast <hi>offered:</hi> look not to be exempt from the same <hi>wrongs</hi> which thou hast done; for he that doth wrong, may well receive it: we may well <hi>suffer patiently,</hi> when we know we <hi>suffer</hi> justly. To <hi>look for good,</hi> and to do <hi>bad,</hi> is against the Law of <hi>retaliation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Or secondly; Is any one wronged in his <hi>good name,</hi> without giving the least cause of scandall, either at present or heretofore, which troubles him above measure? let him neverthelesse <hi>reflect</hi> upon <hi>himself,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he shall finde the cause lie lurking in his own bosome: as thus it may be, thou hast not defamed thy neighbour; but hast thou not <hi>delighted</hi> to hear others <hi>speak</hi> evil of him? Hast thou been tender of his <hi>reputation,</hi> and as much as thou couldest <hi>vindicated his good name?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Or thirdly, Doth not a <hi>proud heart</hi> make thee over-<hi>apprehensive</hi> of the wrong?

                        <p>Or fourthly, Hath not <hi>self-conceitednesse</hi> broken thy credit? probably, if thou wouldest think <hi>worse of thy self,</hi> thou shouldest be better thought of: But commonly <hi>all is well</hi> while we are <hi>well esteemed</hi>; yea, with many, <hi>their reputation</hi> is more cared for, than their <hi>God.</hi> Neither would he be censured for <hi>sin,</hi> that fears not to be <hi>damned for it.</hi> If this hath been thy case; henceforward, let it trouble thee more to <hi>do a fault,</hi> than to <hi>hear of

                        <p>Or lastly, Admit men <hi>charge thee wrongfully,</hi> and thou canst not finde out thy sin by thy <hi>punishment</hi>; yet know, that what thou sufferest is most <hi>just</hi> in respect of <hi>God</hi> who is the <hi>Author</hi>; and who does not alwayes <hi>punish sin in kinde:</hi> As for example, how many Murthers have been punished in a <hi>mutinous word?</hi> the tongue in some <hi>rash language,</hi> hath scourged the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity of the <hi>hand.</hi> One hath done many <hi>robberies,</hi> scap't many <hi>searches,</hi> at last when all hath been forgotten, he hath been <hi>hanged</hi> for accessary to a <hi>Theft</hi> he never knew: <hi>Suspected felony</hi> hath often paid the price of an <hi>unknown Rape.</hi> And they that have gone away with <hi>unnaturall filthinesse,</hi> have yet clipt oft their dayes with their <hi>own Coyn:</hi> so that still <hi>Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are just,</hi> even when mans <hi>may be unjust:</hi> which in all cases would be acknowledged, as the <hi>godly</hi> ever do. <hi>Mauricius</hi> that good <hi>Emperour,</hi> when <hi>he,</hi> his <hi>wife</hi> and his <hi>five sons</hi> were taken, his <hi>wife</hi> and <hi>sons</hi> put to death, and himself waiting for the like <hi>fatall stroke,</hi> could conclude thus; <hi>Iust art thou, O Lord, in all thy wayes, and holy in all thy works,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Psalms.</hi> And a <hi>Martyr,</hi> when he was burning at a stake; Welcome <hi>flames,</hi> my sin hath deserved more than here I can be able to suffer. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are <hi>angry with Heaven for justice,</hi> that are <hi>angry with them for inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi> Wherefore, if thou hast been heretofore so simple as to return <hi>like for like</hi>; henceforward, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and say with <hi>Iob, Once have I spoken, but I will answer no more; yea twice, but I will proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Job 40.4, 5 I will not so much consider how <hi>unjust</hi> man is that gives the wrong, as <hi>how just God is,</hi> that guideth it. And this would be our meditation in all other cases; namely, to think whose <hi>hand</hi> strikes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a <hi>Plurisie,</hi> or a <hi>Feaver,</hi> or a <hi>Sword,</hi> or whatever the Instrument be; and to conclude the blow is <hi>Gods,</hi> whatsoever, or whosoever is used as the <hi>weapon.</hi> Yea it comes not without our desert, for <hi>God is just:</hi> nor shall be without our profit, for <hi>God is mercifull.</hi> And he that doth not argue thus, comes short of the very Heathen. For <hi>Socrates</hi> could tell the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> when they condemned him to die, that they could do nothing but what the <hi>gods permitted,</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> had before <hi>ordained.</hi> And in common reason; can a <hi>Clock</hi> go without a <hi>weight</hi> to move it? or a <hi>Keeper</hi> to set it? No.</p>
                        <p>Now this being premised, namely, that we endure nothing <hi>from our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> but that we have justly deserved <hi>from God:</hi> Yea, that we are more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to our greatest enemies, touching the <hi>knowledge of our selves,</hi> than the best friends we have; how should we not with <hi>David,</hi> refuse to revenge our selves, in case any wicked <hi>Shemei, rayl, curse,</hi> or cast <hi>stones</hi> at us, have we never so much <hi>power</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> to do it? Yea, admit some <hi>Abishai</hi> would do it for us, how should we not say, <hi>Let him alone, suffer him to curse, for the Lord hath bidden him,</hi> 2 Sam. 16.11.</p>

Wherefore saith one, He shall be no <hi>friend to me,</hi> that is a <hi>friend</hi> to my <hi>faults,</hi> and I am no <hi>friend</hi> to my self, if I think him my <hi>enemy</hi> that tells me of them.</p>

                        <p>But behold yet a greater <hi>priviledge</hi>; These comforts do not only <hi>support</hi> and refresh us, and so supply our losses in common <hi>calamities</hi>; but even in the midst of tortures and torments, which otherwise were intollerable: The <hi>naturall mans stomack</hi> cannot (of all enemies) endure hunger: yea a <hi>prison,</hi> where he must alwayes lie under <hi>hatches,</hi> makes him all <hi>amort:</hi> but worthy <hi>Hawkes</hi> could clap his hands for joy in the midst of the <hi>flames.</hi> And <hi>Vincentius</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> reports) made a sport of his torments, and gloried, when they made him go upon hot <hi>burning coales,</hi> as if they had been <hi>Roses.</hi> And another that I read of, say; My good friends, I now finde it true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he that <hi>leaveth all to follow Christ,</hi> shall have in this world <hi>centuplum,</hi> a hundred fold more; I have it in that <hi>centuplum peace of conscience</hi> with me at parting. And this made <hi>Ignatius</hi> say, he had rather be a <hi>Martyr</hi> then a <hi>Monark:</hi> Nor did he ever like himself, before he was thus tryed: for when he heard his bones crush between the wild beasts teeth, he said, now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be a Christian. And <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> being laid along in a <hi>Trough of stone,</hi> and smitten with <hi>Iron sledges</hi> by the appointment of <hi>Nicocreon</hi> the <hi>Tyrant</hi> of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> ceased not to cry out, <hi>strike smite</hi> and <hi>beat</hi>; it is not <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus,</hi> but his <hi>vail</hi> you <hi>martyr</hi> so. And a <hi>Child</hi> in <hi>Iosephus,</hi> being all rent to death with <hi>biting snippers</hi> at the commandment of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> could cry with a <hi>loud, assured,</hi> and <hi>undaunted voice; Tyrant,</hi> thou losest time, loe I am still at mine <hi>ease:</hi> what is that <hi>smarting pain?</hi> where are those <hi>torments</hi> which whilome thou didst so <hi>threaten</hi> me withall? my <hi>constancy</hi> more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles thee, than thy <hi>cruelty me.</hi> And how many more of those <hi>Martyrs</hi> in Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> Raign, were even <hi>ravished,</hi> before they could be permitted to <hi>die?</hi> so <hi>great,</hi> and so <hi>passing</hi> all <hi>expressing,</hi> is the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> of a <hi>good conscience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now as the <hi>Priests</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> when they eat their <hi>figgs</hi> and <hi>honey,</hi> cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>O how sweet is truth!</hi> so if the worst of a Beleevers <hi>life</hi> in this <hi>world,</hi> be so <hi>sweet</hi>; how sweet shall his life be in <hi>Heaven!</hi> but Ile hold you no longer in this.</p>
                        <p>A man that hath his <hi>sins pardoned,</hi> is never compleatly miserable, till <hi>conscience</hi> again turns his <hi>enemy:</hi> whereas on the contrary; take the most happy <hi>worldling</hi> that ever was, if he have not his <hi>sins pardoned,</hi> he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly wretched (though he sees it not:) suppose him <hi>Emperour</hi> of the whole <hi>world,</hi> as <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and <hi>Lord of all</hi>; what did it avail him so long as he had a <hi>tormentor</hi> within, a self-condemning <hi>conscience?</hi> which told him, that God was his <hi>enemy,</hi> and knew no other
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102698:44"/>
then that hell should be <hi>his everlasting portion</hi>? Certainly this like a damp, could not chuse but put out all the lights of his <hi>pleasure,</hi> so that <hi>Paradise</hi> it self was not <hi>Paradise</hi> to him: which is the case of all <hi>wicked men,</hi> be they never so <hi>great,</hi> never so seemingly <hi>happy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>True; <hi>wicked men</hi> think the <hi>godly</hi> lesse merry, and more <hi>miserable</hi> than themselves: yea some, that <hi>mirth</hi> and <hi>mischief</hi> are only <hi>sworn brothers,</hi> but this is a <hi>foundationlesse</hi> opinion. For first, no man is <hi>miserable,</hi> because an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other so thinks him. Secondly, <hi>Gods word</hi> teacheth, and a <hi>good conscience</hi> findeth, that no man can be so <hi>joyfull</hi> as the <hi>faithfull,</hi> though they want many things which others may have. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Austin</hi> before his conversion, could not tell how he should want those delights, he then found so much contentment in: but after, when his nature was changed, when he had another spirit put into him; then he sayes, O how sweet is it to be without those former sweet delights! Indeed, <hi>carnall men</hi> laugh more, but that laughter is only the <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> of mirth: they <hi>rejoyce in the face only, and not in the heart,</hi> as the Apostle witnesseth 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. or as another hath it,
<q>
                              <l>Where O God there wants thy grace,</l>
                              <l>Mirth is onely in the face.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yea, their own <hi>consciences</hi> bear me witnesse, as that <hi>Spanish Iudge</hi> well considered; who when a <hi>murther</hi> was committed in a tumultuous crowd of people, bared all their <hi>bosomes,</hi> and feeling upon their brests, discovered the <hi>guilty</hi> Author by the <hi>panting</hi> of his <hi>heart.</hi> And <hi>Tully</hi> who makes it an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Roscius Amerinus Innocency,</hi> that he killed not his <hi>Father,</hi> because he so securely slept. Yea, as in <hi>prophane joy,</hi> even in laughter the <hi>heart is sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull</hi>; so in godly sorrow, even in <hi>weeping, the heart is light and cheerfull.</hi> The tears of those that <hi>pray,</hi> are sweeter than the joyes of the <hi>Theatre,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Augustin</hi>; for our cheeks may run down with <hi>tears,</hi> and yet our mouthes sing forth praises; the face may be <hi>pale,</hi> yet the heart may be quiet and <hi>cheerfull:</hi> so S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Paul, as sorrowing, and yet alwayes rejoycing,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. Neither can it be solid comfort, except it hath his issue from a <hi>good conscience.</hi> Indeed we therefore are not <hi>merry enough,</hi> because we are not <hi>Christians enough.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now if all our sufferings are thus <hi>counterpoysed,</hi> and exceeded <hi>with bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi>; have we any cause to be angry and impatient? What saith <hi>Iob? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and not evill?</hi> He was content to eat the crust with the crumme. Indeed his <hi>wife</hi> (like the <hi>wicked,</hi>) would only have fair weather, all <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>plenty,</hi> no touch of trouble: but it is not so with the <hi>godly,</hi> who have learnt better things. Who will not suffer a few stripes from a Father, by whom he receiveth so much good, even all that he hath? <hi>Diogenes</hi> would have no nay, but <hi>Antisthenes</hi> must entertain him his <hi>Scholer,</hi> insomuch that <hi>Antisthenes,</hi> to have him gone, was forc't to cudgell him: yet all would not do, he stirs not, but takes the <hi>blowes</hi> very <hi>patiently</hi>; saying, Use me how you will, so I may be your <hi>Scholer</hi> and hear your daily <hi>discourses,</hi> I care not. Much more may a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> say unto God, Let me enjoy the sweet <hi>fruition of thy presence</hi>; speak thou <hi>peace unto my conscience,</hi> and say unto my <hi>soul,</hi> I am thy <hi>salvation,</hi> and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102698:45"/>
then <hi>afflict</hi> me how thou pleasest, I am content<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, very willing to bear it. Yea, if we well consider the <hi>commodity</hi> it brings, we shall rather <hi>wish</hi> for <hi>affliction,</hi> than be displeased when it comes, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. For, it even bringeth with it the <hi>company of God</hi> himself: <hi>I will be with you in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> saith God to the disconsolate <hi>soul,</hi> Psal. 91.15. When <hi>Sidrack, Mishack,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> were cast into the <hi>fiery furnace,</hi> there was presently a fourth came to bear them company, and that was God himself, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.23, to 27. And his presence makes any condition <hi>comfortable,</hi> were a man even in <hi>hell</hi> it self. Yea, as when S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Paul</hi> was rapt up to the third <hi>Heaven</hi>; he was so <hi>ravished</hi> with the joy thereof, that he knew not whether he had his <hi>body</hi> about him or not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Whether in the body, or out of the body I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, God knoweth.</hi> So <hi>Gods presence</hi> so <hi>ravisheth</hi> the <hi>soul,</hi> that while a man <hi>suffers</hi> the greatest pain, he knows not whether he be in <hi>pain</hi> or no. Yea God is not only <hi>with them,</hi> to comfort them in all their tribulation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4. but in them: for at the same time when the <hi>Disciples</hi> were <hi>persecuted,</hi> they are said to be <hi>filled with joy,</hi> and with the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 13.52. And <hi>as our sufferings in Christ do abound, so our consolation also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth through Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.5. And lastly, he doth comfort us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dayes we are <hi>afflicted,</hi> and according to the years we have seen evil, <hi>Psal</hi> 90.15. So that a <hi>Christian</hi> gains more by his losses and crosses, than the happiest worldling by all his immunities: as it was said of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> that he <hi>got more by holding his peace, than other Lawyers did by their pleading.</hi>

                        <p>And if so; our <hi>sufferings</hi> require <hi>patience</hi> with thankfulnesse: as it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Iob.</hi>

We cannot <hi>communicate</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but we make our selves <hi>guilty of Christs blood,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.24.

Secondly, As <hi>patience</hi> in suffering brings an eternall <hi>reward</hi> with it in <hi>Heaven,</hi> so it procureth a <hi>reward here</hi> also: Suffer him to curse, saith <hi>David</hi> touching <hi>Shemei</hi> (here was patience for a <hi>King,</hi> to suffer his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent <hi>subject,</hi> even in the <hi>heat of blood,</hi> and <hi>midst of warre to speak swords,</hi> and <hi>cast stones</hi> at his Soveraign, and that with a purpose to encrease the <hi>rebellion,</hi> and strengthen the adverse part,) but mark his reason: <hi>It may be the Lord will look upon mine affliction, and do me good:</hi> Why? <hi>even for his cursing this day,</hi> 2 Sam. 16.12. And well might he expect it, for he knew this was Gods manner of dealing: as when he turned <hi>Balaams curse</hi> into a <hi>blessing</hi> upon the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> Numb. 23. And their malice who sold <hi>Ioseph,</hi> to his great advantage. Indeed these <hi>Shemois</hi> and <hi>Balaams,</hi> whose hearts and tongues are so ready to curse and rail upon the people of God, are not seldom the very <hi>means</hi> to procure a contrary blessing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; so that if there were no <hi>offence to God</hi> in it, nor <hi>hurt to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>; we might wish and call for their <hi>contempt, cruelty</hi> and <hi>curses:</hi> for, so many <hi>curses,</hi> so many <hi>blessings.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I could add many examples to the former, as how the malice of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> turned to the good of the <hi>Iews:</hi> the malice of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> to the good of <hi>David,</hi> when his counsell was turned by God into foolishnesse: the malice of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> to him that was born <hi>blinde,</hi> when Christ, upon their casting him out of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> admitted him into the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints,</hi> Joh. 9.34.

                        </p>
                        <p>And thus you see how patient suffering is rewarded, both here and hereafter; that we <hi>lose</hi> what ever we <hi>do lose</hi> by our <hi>enemies,</hi> no otherwise than the <hi>husbandman loseth his seed:</hi> for whatever we part withall, is but as <hi>seed cast into the ground,</hi> which shall even in this life, according to our <hi>Saviours</hi> promise, return unto us the <hi>increase of an hundred fold,</hi> and in the <hi>world to come, life everlasting,</hi> Mark. 10.29, 30. But admit patience should neither be <hi>rewarded</hi> here, not hereafter; yet it is a sufficient reward to it self: for, <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> are two soveraign and <hi>universall remedies</hi> for all diseases. <hi>Patience</hi> is a <hi>counterpoyson</hi> or <hi>antipoyson</hi> for all <hi>grief.</hi> It is like the Tree which <hi>Moses</hi> cast into the waters, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.25. for as that Tree made the <hi>waters sweet,</hi> so <hi>Patience</hi> sweetens <hi>affliction.</hi> It is as <hi>Larde</hi> to the <hi>lean meat</hi> of adversity. It makes the poor beggar rich, teacheth the <hi>bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in a narrow prison to enjoy all <hi>liberty</hi> and society: for, the patient <hi>beleever,</hi> though he be alone, yet he never wants <hi>company:</hi> though his <hi>diet</hi> be <hi>penury,</hi> his <hi>sawce</hi> is <hi>content:</hi> all his <hi>miseries</hi> cannot make him <hi>sick,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are <hi>digested</hi> by <hi>patience.</hi> And indeed, It is not so much the <hi>greatnesse</hi> of their <hi>pain,</hi> as the <hi>smalnesse</hi> of their <hi>patience,</hi> that makes many miserable; whence some have (and not unfitly), resembled our <hi>fancies,</hi> to those <hi>multiplying glasses</hi> made at <hi>Venice,</hi> which being put to the <hi>eye,</hi> make <hi>twenty men</hi> in <hi>Arms</hi> shew like a <hi>terrible Army.</hi> And every man is truly <hi>calamitous,</hi> that supposeth himself so: as oftentimes we <hi>die in conceit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we be <hi>truly sick:</hi> we give the <hi>battell</hi> for lost, when as yet we see not the <hi>enemy. Now</hi> crosses are either <hi>ponderous</hi> or <hi>light,</hi> as the <hi>Disciples</hi> or <hi>Scholers</hi> esteem them: every man is so <hi>wretched,</hi> as he <hi>beleeveth himself</hi> to be. The tast of goods or <hi>evils</hi> doth greatly depend on the <hi>opinion</hi> we have of them; and <hi>contentation,</hi> like an old mans <hi>spectacles,</hi> make those <hi>Characters</hi> easie and familiar, that otherwise would puzzle him shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Afflictions</hi> are as we use them; there is nothing <hi>grievous,</hi> if the thought: make it not so: even <hi>pain</hi> it self (saith the <hi>Philosopher</hi>) is in our power, if not to be <hi>disanulled,</hi> yet at least to be <hi>diminished</hi> through <hi>patience:</hi> very <hi>Gally slaves,</hi> setting light by their <hi>captivity,</hi> finde freedom in <hi>bondage. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> is like a <hi>golden shield</hi> in the <hi>hand,</hi> to break the <hi>stroak</hi> of every crosse, and save the <hi>heart</hi> though the body suffer. <hi>A sound spirit,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, will hear his infirmity,</hi> Prov. 18.14. <hi>Patience</hi> to the soul, is as the lid to the eye; for as the lid being shut, when occasion requires, saves it exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; so <hi>Patience</hi> intervening between the <hi>soul</hi> and that which it suffers, saves the <hi>heart whole,</hi> and <hi>cheers</hi> the <hi>body</hi> again. And therefore, if you mark it, when you can passe by an <hi>offence,</hi> and take it patiently and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, you have a kind of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> in your heart, as if you had gotten a <hi>victory,</hi> and the <hi>more</hi> your <hi>patience</hi> is, still the <hi>lesse</hi> your <hi>pain</hi> is: for as a

light burthen at the <hi>arms end</hi> weigheth <hi>heavier</hi> by much, than a <hi>burthen</hi> of treble weight, if it be born on the <hi>shoulders</hi> which are made to bear; so if a man set <hi>patience</hi> to bear his <hi>crosse,</hi> the weight is nothing to what it would be if that were <hi>wanting:</hi> In a word, <hi>Patience</hi> is so soveraign a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,</hi> that it cures and overcomes all: it keeps the heart from <hi>envy,</hi> the hand from <hi>revenge,</hi> the tongue from <hi>contumely,</hi> the whole body from <hi>smart</hi>; it overcomes our <hi>enemies</hi> without <hi>weapons:</hi> finally, it is such a vertue, that it makes <hi>calamities</hi> no <hi>calamities.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But, what needs all this? men commonly say in necessitated <hi>sufferings,</hi> what <hi>remedy</hi> but <hi>patience?</hi> therefore <hi>patience</hi> is a confessed <hi>remedy.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, saith one; Being <hi>unable to direct events, I govern my self</hi>; and if they <hi>apply not themselves</hi> to me, <hi>I apply my self</hi> to them; if I <hi>cannot fling</hi> what I would, yet I will somewhat <hi>mend</hi> it, <hi>by playing the cast</hi> as well as I can.</p>
                        <p>O that all implacable persons, who <hi>double their sufferings</hi> through long study of <hi>revenge,</hi> would learn this <hi>lesson,</hi> and <hi>bear</hi> what they must <hi>bear</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently: then would they finde that <hi>patience</hi> can no lesse <hi>mitigate evils,</hi> than <hi>impatience exasperates them.</hi> A <hi>profitable prescription</hi> indeed (may some say) but of an hard <hi>execution!</hi> Hard indeed to an <hi>impenitent sinner,</hi> that hath <hi>two burthens</hi> on his <hi>back</hi> at once (<hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>affliction,</hi> and his <hi>sin,</hi> which adds weight to his <hi>affliction,</hi>) to carry them so easily, as he that hath but one, namely his <hi>affliction.</hi> Yea, it is altogether impossible to flesh and blood: for our <hi>hearts</hi> are like the <hi>Isle Pathmos,</hi> in which nothing will <hi>grow,</hi> but on <hi>earth</hi> which is <hi>brought from other places:</hi> If the <hi>will be ours,</hi> the <hi>good will is Gods.</hi> Wherefore if thou art only beholding to <hi>nature,</hi> and hast nought but what thou broughtest into the world with thee, well mayest thou envy at it, but thou canst never <hi>imitate</hi> it; for to speak the truth, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> are two <hi>miracles</hi> in a Christian. A <hi>Protestant Martyr</hi> being at the stake, in the midst of furious and outragious flames, cried out, Behold ye <hi>Papists,</hi> whom nothing will convince but <hi>Miracles</hi>; here see one indeed, for in this fire I feel no more pain, than if I were in a <hi>bed of Down,</hi> yea it is to me like a <hi>bed of Roses:</hi> and <hi>Cassianus</hi> reporteth, that when a <hi>Martyr</hi> was tormented by the <hi>Infidels,</hi> and asked by way of reproach, What <hi>Miracle</hi> his CHRIST had done; he answered, He hath done what you now behold; enabled me so to bear your <hi>contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies,</hi> and undergo all these tortures so <hi>patiently,</hi> that I am not once mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and is not this a <hi>miracle</hi> worthy your taking notice of?

he put a <hi>Traytor</hi> into the <hi>Rabricke,</hi> he is presently a <hi>Saint in Heaven</hi>; if he curse, or excommunicate a Christian, he must needs be <hi>inrolled in hell:</hi> but we know their words, meer Idols, which as the Apostle witnesseth, <hi>are nothing in the world</hi>; and therefore trouble not thy self about them. What need had <hi>David</hi> to load himself with an unnecessary <hi>weapon?</hi> one <hi>sword</hi> can serve both his enemy and him; <hi>Goliahs</hi> own weapon shall serve to behead the Master: so this mans own <hi>tongue</hi> shall serve to accuse himself, and acquit thee.

                        <p>Wherefore in these cases it hath been usuall for <hi>Gods people,</hi> to behave themselves like <hi>dead Images,</hi> which though they be rayled on, and reviled by their <hi>enemies,</hi> yet <hi>have ears, and hear not; mouthes, and speak not; hands, and revenge not; neither have they breath in their nostrils</hi> to make reply: <hi>Psal.</hi> 115.5, 6, 7.

                        <p>And as their words are to be contemned by us, so are their challenges to fight.

                        <p>Besides, what is scarce thought a <hi>fault in other men,</hi> is held in us a <hi>hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crime:</hi> When they could not accuse <hi>Christ</hi> of <hi>sinne,</hi> they accused him for companying with <hi>sinners,</hi> and doing good on the <hi>Sabboth day.</hi> When the <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> could finde no fault in <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning the Kingdom, he was so faithfull, they alledged his <hi>praying to God,</hi> and brought that within compasse of a <hi>Premunire,</hi> Dan. 6.4.13.</p>

                           <item>2 Because it Is the <hi>greatest praise</hi> to be <hi>dispraised</hi> of them.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>THese <hi>two Reasons</hi> being neer of kin, in speaking of them, I will cast <hi>both</hi> into the similitude of a Y, which is <hi>joyned</hi> together at one <hi>end, brancht</hi> in the <hi>middle.</hi> And first to joyn them both together.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>condemnation</hi> and <hi>approbation</hi> of <hi>wicked men,</hi> is equally <hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> to <hi>good men:</hi> for every word they speak of the consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is a <hi>slander,</hi> whether it be good or evill: whether in <hi>praise</hi> or <hi>dispraise,</hi> his very <hi>Name</hi> is <hi>defiled</hi> by coming into their <hi>mouthes</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or if this do not hold in all cases, yet (as a <hi>Reverend Divine</hi> saith) it is a <hi>praise to the godly,</hi> to be <hi>dispraised of the wicked</hi>; and a dispraise to be praised of them: their <hi>dispraise is a mans honour,</hi> their praise <hi>his dishonour:</hi> so that when <hi>deboished persons</hi> speak ill of a man, especially their <hi>Minister, the worse the better</hi>; for to be well spoken of by the <hi>vicious, and evill by the vertuous</hi>; to have the <hi>praise of the good,</hi> and the <hi>dispraise of the bad,</hi> is all one in effect, as <hi>Salomon</hi> sheweth; <hi>They that forsake the Law</hi> (saith he) <hi>praise the wicked; but they that keep the Law, set themselves against them,</hi> Prov. 28.4.</p>
                        <p>Thus much of both <hi>Reasons joyntly,</hi> now of each <hi>severally</hi>; and first, That it is a <hi>disparagement to a godly man to be well spoken of by the wicked.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When it was told <hi>Antisthenes,</hi> that such an one who was a <hi>vicious</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, spake <hi>good words of him,</hi> he answered, <hi>What evill have I done, that this man speaks well of mee?</hi> To be praised of <hi>evill</hi> men (saith <hi>Bion</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher) is as <hi>evill,</hi> as to be praised for <hi>evill doing:</hi> For such like <hi>Garlick,</hi> suck only the <hi>ill vapours</hi> from all they come neer. Out of which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> rejected the <hi>evill spirits testimony,</hi> which though it were <hi>truth,</hi> yet he would not suffer the <hi>Devill</hi> to say, <hi>Thou art the Christ the Sonne of God,</hi> or <hi>that holy One</hi>; but rebuked him sharply, and enjoyned him to hold his peace, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.35. No he would not suffer the Devils at another time to say, That they knew him, <hi>Vers.</hi> 41. And good reason, for he knew that the <hi>Devils</hi> commendations would prove <hi>the greatest slander</hi> of all. Neither would S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Paul</hi> suffer that maid which had a <hi>spirit of Divination,</hi> to say, he was <hi>the servant of the most high God, which shewed them the way of Salvation,</hi> Acts 16.17, 18. well knowing that <hi>Satan</hi> did it to this end, that by his <hi>testimony</hi> and <hi>approbation,</hi> he might cause them (which formerly beleeved his doctrine) to <hi>suspect him</hi> for an <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> and <hi>deceiver,</hi> and that he did his <hi>miracles</hi> by the help of some <hi>Familiar spirit.</hi> And indeed, if the <hi>good report of wicked men,</hi> who are set on work by <hi>Satan,</hi> did not derogate from the godly, or from the <hi>glory of God, Satan</hi>
                           <pb n="100" facs="tcp:102698:53"/>
should be divided against himself: <hi>and if Satan be divided against himself,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>how shall his Kingdom stand?</hi> Now we know he seeketh to <hi>advance his Kingdom</hi> by all possible means, and consequently in this.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore if we enjoy any wicked mans love, and have his <hi>good word,</hi> we may justly <hi>suspect our selves</hi> are faulty in one kinde or other; for it's sure he could not do so, except he saw <hi>something in us like himself.</hi> If every thing were <hi>unlike him,</hi> how is it possible he should love us? <hi>Difference breeds disunion,</hi> and sweet congruity is <hi>the Mother of love.</hi> This made <hi>Aristotle</hi> when a <hi>Rakeshame</hi> told him, he would rather be <hi>hanged by the neck,</hi> than be <hi>so hated of all men as he was,</hi> reply, And I would be <hi>hanged by the neck,</hi> ere I would be <hi>beloved of all, as thou art:</hi> And <hi>Phocion,</hi> to ask, <hi>when the people praised him, What evill have I done?</hi> It was a <hi>just doubt in him,</hi> and not an unjust in any that are vertuous like him; which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned <hi>Luther</hi> to say, I would not have the glory and fame of <hi>Erasmus</hi>; my greatest fear is the praises of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea, their reproaches and evill speeches are to me, matter of great joy. And another, <hi>Their hatred I fear not,</hi> neither do I <hi>regard their good will.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>A wicked mans tongue,</hi> is so farre from being a slander, that it makes <hi>for our credit, to be evill spoken of</hi> by them. <hi>To be evill spoken of by wicked men,</hi> saith <hi>Terence, is a glorious and laudable thing:</hi> And another, <hi>It is no small credit; with the vile, to have a vile estimation.</hi> As a <hi>wicked</hi> mans <hi>glory is in his shame,</hi> so the <hi>godly</hi> mans <hi>shame</hi> (for doing good) <hi>is his glory:</hi> and to be <hi>evill spoken of for well-doing</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is <hi>peculiar to good men</hi>; as <hi>Alexander</hi> used to speak of <hi>Kings.</hi> Yea, saith <hi>Epictetus, It is the highest degree of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for a man to hear evill when be doth well.</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> is of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which makes him say, <hi>If mine adversary should write a book against me, would I not take it upon my shoulder, and binde it as a Crown unto me? Yes, I would,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iob</hi> 31.35, 36, 37. And who having the <hi>use of Reason</hi> (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially sanctified) will not conclude, that <hi>Religion and Holinesse must needs be an excellent thing, because in hath</hi> such enemies as <hi>wicked men,</hi> and wicked spirits? What saith that <hi>Ethnick</hi> in <hi>Seneca,</hi> in this behalf? <hi>Men speak evill of me, but evill men: It would grieve me if</hi> Marcus Cato, if <hi>wise</hi> Laelius, <hi>if the other</hi> Cato, <hi>or either of the</hi> Scipioes, <hi>should speak so of me,</hi> but this as much comforts me: for to be disliked of evill men, is to be praised for goodnesse.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Luther</hi> the like: I rejoyce, saith he, that Satan so rages and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes: It is likely I do him and his Kingdom the more mischief: whence <hi>Ierom</hi> told <hi>Austin,</hi> It was an evident sign of glory to him, that all <hi>Hereticks</hi> did hate and traduce him. Indeed, to hear that a good man speaks evil of us (as its possible (though rare) for him to credit a false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and so crediting it, to <hi>report it too</hi>) goes to the very <hi>heart,</hi> and fetcheth from thence tears into the <hi>eyes,</hi> and into the <hi>mouth, words of passion</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration:</hi> As when <hi>Caesar</hi> saw that <hi>Brutus</hi> was one of them that helped to <hi>stab</hi> him with bodkins in the <hi>Senate house,</hi> he cry'd out, And art thou there my <hi>Son!</hi> but if a hundred other men do the same, <hi>if wise, we value it not.</hi> Why? O happy art thou, saith <hi>Pious Mirandula,</hi> who liv'st well
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102698:53"/>
amongst the bad; for thou shalt either win them, or silence them, or exasperate them: if thou win them thou shalt save their souls, and add to thine own glory: if thou silence them, thou shalt diminish of their torment, and prevent the contagion of their sin: if thou exasperate them thereby to hate and traduce thee for thy goodnesse, then most happy; for thou shalt not only be rewarded according to the good which thou do'st, but much more according to the evill which thou suffer'st.

                        <p>Indeed, <hi>swinish men</hi> may beleeve their <hi>misreports,</hi> because they are <hi>Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> which for the most part will enquire no further, but beleeve at first: but the <hi>wise</hi> know their <hi>tongues</hi> to be no slander; yea, they will either smell out the <hi>Serpents enmity</hi> in the relator, or spy out in his lyes one <hi>lame leg</hi> or other; as lyes are rarely without. And indeed, if <hi>ill tongues</hi> could make men <hi>ill good men</hi> were in a <hi>bad taking.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now to make some <hi>use of this point:</hi> If the <hi>language</hi> of <hi>wicked men</hi> must be <hi>read like Hebrew, backward,</hi> and that all <hi>good men</hi> do so for the most part, it being a <hi>sure rule,</hi> that whosoever presently gives <hi>credit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations,</hi> is either <hi>wicked</hi> himself, or very <hi>childish</hi> in discretion; then let us count their <hi>slanders, scoffs</hi> and <hi>reproaches,</hi> the most noble and <hi>honourable badges and ensignes of honour and innocency</hi> that can be: And in case we are told that any such person doth <hi>rail</hi> on us; let our <hi>answer</hi> be, He is not <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed,</hi> nor his words <hi>credited</hi> of the meanest <hi>beleever,</hi> which understands any thing of <hi>Satans wiles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, Care not to have <hi>ill men to speak well of thee,</hi> for if thou w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Thirdly, Look not to have <hi>every mans good word,</hi> since some are as deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                        <p>Indeed, if a man were able, and willing to be at the charge; he might stop their <hi>mouthes with money:</hi> for <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> having given a great <hi>reward</hi> to one that <hi>spake evill</hi> of him, was after that <hi>highly praised</hi> by him; which made him conclude, that it <hi>lieth in our selves,</hi> and in our own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, either to be <hi>well,</hi> or <hi>ill spoken of</hi>; but this is not a <hi>remedy of Gods prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring:</hi> besides, a man had better endure <hi>the soar,</hi> than be at such <hi>cost</hi> for a <hi>plaister.</hi> And thus we see, that a man of a <hi>good life,</hi> needeth not fear any who hath an <hi>evill tongue,</hi> but rather <hi>rejoyce</hi> therein; for he shall be praised of <hi>Angels in Heaven,</hi> who hath, by renouncing the <hi>world,</hi> eschewed the praises of <hi>wicked men on earth.</hi>

IN the fourth place, one Reason why we bear <hi>injuries</hi> so patiently, is, That our <hi>enemies and others</hi> may learn and be won by our <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> which oft prevailes more than <hi>precept:</hi> As, how many <hi>Infidels</hi> were won to the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> by seeing <hi>Christians</hi> endure the flames so <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently</hi>? when their enemies were forc't to confesse, <hi>flain</hi> they are, but not <hi>conquered.</hi> Those whom <hi>precepts</hi> do not so effectually move, we see them sometimes induced by <hi>examples. Sozomen</hi> reports, that the <hi>devout life of a poor captive Christian woman,</hi> made a <hi>King</hi> and all his <hi>family,</hi> imbrace the <hi>Faith of Iesus Christ.

Under the generall of good works is included <hi>Patience</hi> as one main speciall. <hi>The servant of the Lord must not strive</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi>) <hi>but must be gentle towards all men, suffering the evill men patiently, instructing them with meeknesse that are contrary minded, proving if God at any time will give them repentance, that they may know the truth,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.24, 25.</p>
                        <p>And it stands to good reason, for first every <hi>Christian</hi> is, or ought to be a <hi>crucified man.</hi>

                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Love</hi> is Christs badge, the nature whereof is to <hi>cover offences</hi> with the <hi>mantle of peace.</hi>

When <hi>Iron</hi> meets with <hi>Iron,</hi> there is a harsh and <hi>stubborn jarre</hi>; but let <hi>wool</hi> meet that <hi>rougher mettle,</hi> this yeelding turns resistance into <hi>embracing</hi>: Yea, a man shall be in more <hi>estimation</hi> with his enemy (if ingenuous) having vanquisht him this way; then if he had never been his enemy at all. Thy greatest enemy shall if he have any spark of <hi>grace,</hi> yea, if he have either <hi>bowels</hi> or <hi>brains,</hi> confesse ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to thee (as <hi>Saul</hi> once to <hi>David</hi>) <hi>Thou art more righteous then I, for thou hast rendred me good, and I have rendred thee evil</hi>; as what heart of stone could have acknowledged lesse: <hi>Saul</hi> would have killed <hi>David,</hi> and could not, <hi>David</hi> could have killed <hi>Saul</hi> and would not: Besides the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of an enemy (as one saith) is more then the testimony of a whole Parish of friends or neuters.

                        <p>But this is not all, for happily it may (and not a little) further <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and make <hi>Satan</hi> a loser; as thus let us shake off their <hi>slanders,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did the <hi>Vip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For if <hi>Zopyrus</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> was content (and that <hi>voluntarily</hi>) to sustain the cutting off his <hi>nose, ears,</hi> and <hi>lips,</hi> to further the enterprise of his Lord <hi>Darius</hi> against proud <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>; what should a Christian be willing to suffer, what the Lord of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> and <hi>Earths</hi> Cause may be furthered against proud <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and all the powers of darknesse?

If the <hi>Lord</hi> see it meet that our <hi>wrongs</hi> should be <hi>revenged</hi> instantly, he will do it himself; as he revenged the <hi>Israelites</hi> upon the <hi>Aegyptians:</hi> and so that all standers by shall see their fault in their <hi>punishment,</hi> with admiration. <hi>Now I know,</hi> saith <hi>Iethro, that the Lord is greater than all the gods; for as they have dealt proudly with them, so are they recompensed,</hi> Exod. 18.11. And as once he revenged <hi>Davids</hi> cause upon <hi>Nabal</hi>; For <hi>about ten dayes after, the Lord smote Nabal that he died.</hi> saith the Text: and it followes, when <hi>David</hi> heard that <hi>Nabal</hi> was dead, he said, <hi>Blessed be the Lord, that hath judged the cause of my rebuke at the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evill; for the Lord hath recompenced the wickednesse of Nabal upon his own head,</hi> 1 Sam. 25.38, 39.

                        </p>
                        <p>Or if God do it not himself by some immediate <hi>judgement,</hi> nor by the hand of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> yet he will see that <hi>some other</hi> shall do it, though the wronged party be willing to put it up; as for example, <hi>Sampsons Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law,</hi> for taking away his <hi>Wife,</hi> and she for her <hi>falshood,</hi> though they were not punished by him that received the wrong, yet the <hi>Philistims burnt</hi> both <hi>her</hi> and <hi>her Father,</hi> Judg. 15.

From which examples we may draw this argument, If the <hi>Lord</hi> thus revenge the cause of mens particular and personall wrongs, much more will he revenge <hi>his own cause:</hi> for in this case I may say to every <hi>childe of God</hi> which suffereth for <hi>Religion sake,</hi> as <hi>Iehaziel</hi> by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God said unto all <hi>Iudah,</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and King <hi>Iehosaphat; The battell is not yours, but Gods, wherefore you shall not need to fight in this battell, stand still, move not, and behold the salvation of the Lord towards you,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.15, 17.

                        <p>Fourthly, There's no cause of thy <hi>answering</hi>; innocency needs not stand upon its own justification; for <hi>God</hi> hath undertaken to <hi>vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> it, either by <hi>friends,</hi> as when <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>Michol,</hi> both <hi>son</hi> and <hi>daughter,</hi> opposed their own <hi>Father</hi> in his evill intents to take <hi>Davids</hi> part, and vindicate his <hi>reputation,</hi> 1 Sam. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4, 5, 11, 12. Or by <hi>enemies,</hi> as when <hi>Pilate</hi> pronounced him <hi>innocent,</hi> whom he <hi>condemned</hi> to die: which shewes that innocency cannot want abetters: and when <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was forc't to <hi>approve</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Chair,</hi> whom he <hi>condemned</hi> on the <hi>Bench.</hi> And when <hi>Iulian</hi> was compelled to cry out, O <hi>Galilean,</hi> thou hast over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.

                        <p>When this good Christian <hi>Emperour</hi> saw the <hi>huge multitude</hi> that was coming against him; and that in the sight of man there was apparent <hi>overthrow</hi> at hand, he gets him up into a <hi>place eminent,</hi> and in the <hi>sight of all the Army, falls down prostrate upon the earth,</hi> beseeching God, if ever he would look upon a sinfull creature, to <hi>help</hi> him at this time of <hi>greatest need:</hi> whereupon there arose suddenly such a mighty <hi>wind,</hi> that it <hi>blow the Darts of the enemies back upon themselves,</hi> in such a wonderfull manner, that <hi>Eugenius</hi> with all his <hi>Host,</hi> was clean <hi>discomfited</hi>; and seeing the <hi>power of Christ</hi> so <hi>fight for his people,</hi> was forced in effect to cry out, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did, <hi>God is in the cloud, and he fighteth for them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>No <hi>forces</hi> are so <hi>strong</hi> as the <hi>spirituall</hi>; the <hi>prayers</hi> of an <hi>Eliah,</hi> are more <hi>powerfull</hi> than all the <hi>Armies of flesh:</hi> which made the Queen-mother of <hi>Scotland</hi> confesse, That she <hi>feared</hi> more the <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>fasting</hi> of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                        <p>Thus God either <hi>preventeth our enemies,</hi> as here he did; or <hi>delivereth his servants</hi> out of persecution, as he did <hi>Peter</hi>; or else, if he <hi>crowneth</hi> them with <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> as he did <hi>Stephen</hi>; he will in his <hi>Kingdom of glory,</hi> give them in stead of this <hi>bitter,</hi> a <hi>better</hi> inheritance; <hi>pro veritate morientes, cum veritate viventes.</hi>

Yea, a man may as well with a coal, paint out the <hi>Sunne</hi> in all his <hi>splendor,</hi> as with his pen, or tongue expresse; or with his heart (were it as deep as the Sea) conceive, the fullnesse of those joyes, and sweetnesse of those pleasures, which the Saints shall enjoy at Gods right hand for evermore, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>In thy presence is the sullnesse of joy, and at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.</hi> For quality they are <hi>pleasures</hi>; for quantity, <hi>fullnesse</hi>; for dignity, <hi>at Gods right hand</hi>; for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>for evermore:</hi> and <hi>millions</hi> of years <hi>multiplied</hi> by <hi>millions,</hi> make not up <hi>a minute</hi> to this <hi>eternity.</hi>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if the corn of our bodies be not cast into the earth by death, we can have none of this increase: which is the reason, first, that we celebrate the memory of the <hi>Saints,</hi> not upon their <hi>birth-dayes,</hi> but upon their <hi>death-dayes</hi>; to shew how <hi>the day of our death,</hi> is better than the day of our birth: And secondly, that many Holy men have wisht for death; as <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy, Iob, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. As, who can either marvell, or blame the desire of advantage? for the weary traveller to long for rest, the prisoner for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, the banished for home; it is so naturall, that the contrary disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were <hi>monstrous.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And indeed it is our ignorance and infidelity; at least our imprepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that makes <hi>death</hi> seem other than <hi>advantage.</hi> And look to it, for he hardly mourns for the <hi>sinnes of the time,</hi> who longs not to be freed from the time of sinne: he but <hi>little loves</hi> his Saviour, who is not willing to go unto him, and is too fond of himself, that would not go out of himself to God.</p>
                        <p>True, he that <hi>beleeveth</hi> will not make haste, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.16. that is, he will not go out by a back-door, seek redresse by <hi>unlawfull means:</hi> for though <hi>here</hi> he hath his pain, and in <hi>Heaven</hi> he looks for his <hi>payment,</hi> yet he will not make more haste than good speed. Though he <hi>desires</hi> to be <hi>dissolved, and to be with Christ, which is best of all,</hi> Phil. 1.23, 24. Yet he is <hi>content to live,</hi> yea, he <hi>lives patiently,</hi> though he <hi>dies joyfully:</hi> In his <hi>wisdome</hi> he could chuse the gain of death, but in his obedience he refuseth not the service of life: and it is to be feared, that God will refuse that soul, which leaves the body before himself calls for it; as <hi>Seneca</hi> speaks (like a Divine.)</p>

                           <hi>Paul,</hi>) <hi>knowing that tribulation bringeth forth patience, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience experience, and experience hope,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. Yea, he goeth yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and saith; <hi>I am filled with comfort, I am exceedingly joyfull in all our tribulation,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.4. which is to over-abound exceedingly with joy, such an <hi>exuberation</hi> of joy, as brake forth into <hi>thankefulnesse:</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                        <p>Gods people do not only acknowledge that they <hi>suffer justly frrm God,</hi> even when they suffer unjustly <hi>from men,</hi> as <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren did, who

Yea, when his own <hi>Disciple</hi> was determined to betray him; I see not a <hi>frown,</hi> I hear not a <hi>check</hi> from him again: but <hi>what thou doest, do quickly.</hi> O the admirable <hi>meeknesse</hi> of this <hi>Lamb of God!</hi> Why do we startle at our petty <hi>wrongs,</hi> and swell with anger, and break into <hi>furious revenges,</hi> upon every occasion, when the pattern of our <hi>patience</hi> lets not fall one harsh word, upon so foul and bloody a Traytor? When the Jews cried out, <hi>Crucifie him,</hi> as before they cried out, <hi>His blood be upon us and upon our Children</hi>; he out cries, <hi>Father, pardon them:</hi> being beaten with <hi>Rods,</hi> crowned with <hi>Thorns,</hi> pierced with <hi>Nayls,</hi> nayled to the <hi>Crosse,</hi> bathed all his body over in blood, filled with <hi>reproaches,</hi> &amp;c in the very pangs of death; as unmindfull of all his great griefs, he prayeth for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors, and that earnestly, <hi>Father forgive them: Pendebat, &amp; tamen petebat,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                        <p>Thus Christ upon the Crosse, as a <hi>Doctor</hi> in his chair, read to us all a <hi>Lecture</hi> of <hi>Patience,</hi> for his <hi>actions</hi> are our <hi>instructions:</hi> and the same that <hi>Gideon</hi> spake to <hi>Israel,</hi> he speaks still to us: <hi>as ye see me do, so do you:</hi> And no man be he never so cunning, or practised, can make a <hi>strait line,</hi> or <hi>perfect circle</hi> by steddinesse of hand, which may easily be done by the help of a <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Compasse:</hi> Besides, is Christ gone before us in the like <hi>sufferings?</hi> what greater incouragement?

Iacob</hi> saw him both asleep and awake, yet (saith hee) <hi>the Lord was in this place, and I was not aware of it, Gen.</hi> 28.16. at least wee are apt to thinke, that God is removed from us, when wee any way suffer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity; as the <hi>Israelites</hi> do but want water, and presently they cry, <hi>Is the Lord among us,</hi> or no? <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.7. as if God could nor bee with them, and they a thirst; either hee must humour carnall minds, or bee distrusted.</p>
                     <p>But both his presence and love, is the same in adversity, as it is in prosperity; our sence onely makes the <hi>difference,</hi> even as a <hi>Church, Castle,</hi> or <hi>Town,</hi> is unmoveable, and keepeth one place; though to us it may seem <hi>somtime on our right hand, other while on our left</hi>: as wee change our <hi>standing, sitting,</hi> or <hi>walking.</hi> Yet if some unusuall crosses disturb our <hi>peace</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> presently there breaks out a voice mix'd with murmuring, and despair, God hath forsaken us.

can this bee well taken? wee see <hi>our wretchedness,</hi> wee do not see <hi>our blessedness</hi>: No talk of his presence, of his absence wee complain. Our <hi>cowardly spirits</hi> give him for quite gone; yet <hi>hee is not far from every one of us, Act.</hi> 17.27. Yea, this confession could <hi>Seneca</hi> make, (but like a Divine) <hi>God is near unto thee, hee is with thee, hee is within thee</hi>: and surely if hee had not been with these <hi>Israelites,</hi> they had not lived; if hee had been <hi>in them,</hi> they had not <hi>murmured.</hi> Wee can think him <hi>absent in our want,</hi> and cannot see him <hi>absent in our sin</hi>; yet, <hi>wickedness,</hi> not <hi>affliction,</hi> argues him gone: yea, hee is then most <hi>present,</hi> when hee most <hi>chastiseth</hi>; for <hi>as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions abound through Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5.</p>
                     <p>Again, God may bee <hi>present</hi> with us, and yet wee not bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; as the <hi>Israelites</hi> repined for a <hi>King,</hi> when the Lord was their <hi>King:</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> may bee with us, and yet wee want somthing that wee desire. Christ was in the Ship, and yet (say the Apostles) <hi>wee have no bread Iesus</hi> was at the <hi>Marriage,</hi> yet saith his <hi>Mother, they have no wine, Ioh.</hi> 2.3. Wee may want <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and yet have <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi>: but if food fail, it is because <hi>Manna</hi> is to come; if <hi>Wine</hi> bee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, yet <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> is present: if God takes away <hi>flesh,</hi> and gives <hi>Manna</hi>; deny <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and gives himself, hee doth us no wrong.</p>
                     <p>Now why doth God by his <hi>promise</hi> tye himself to bee present with us more especially in <hi>affliction?</hi> but that hee may <hi>resist our enemies, sustain us</hi> when wee faint, and <hi>crown</hi> us when wee overcome; but that hee may bee exact in taking <hi>notice</hi> of our particular sufferings, and as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Count our wandrings, put our tears into his bottle,</hi> and enter all into his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister, <hi>Psal.</hi> 56.8.9.

                        <p>And when he hath <hi>leave from God,</hi> what can hee do? hee cannot go one hairs breadth beyond his <hi>commission</hi>: being <hi>permitted,</hi> hee could bring <hi>Christ</hi> himself, and set him on the <hi>Pinacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> but hee could not <hi>throw him down</hi>; which even a <hi>little child</hi> might have done with <hi>permission.</hi> As the <hi>Lyon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13, killed the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> but neither touched the <hi>Ass</hi> whereon hee road, nor yet the <hi>dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kas</hi> contrary to his nature.</p>
                        <p>True <hi>Satan</hi> could boast even to <hi>Christ</hi> himself, that all the world was his, and all the Kingdoms thereof, but when it came to the push, he could not enter into a very <hi>Hog,</hi> without asking him leave, and having leave given him, hee presently carryed the whole <hi>heard</hi> headlong into the <hi>Sea</hi>: Why did hee not so to the man <hi>possessed</hi>? no thanks to him, hee had leave for the one, not so for the other, and therefore a whole <hi>Legion</hi> of them were not able to <hi>destroy</hi> one poor <hi>simple man, Matth.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 31.32.</p>
                        <p>So that all our enemies are curbed and restrained by the divine <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of our heavenly Father: <hi>Satan</hi> may bee his <hi>Executioner,</hi> but God is the <hi>Iudge,</hi> and the <hi>Executioner</hi> cannot lay on a stroke more than the <hi>Iudge</hi> appoints,</p>
                        <p>I confess <hi>Satan</hi> is so strong comparatively, and withall so crafty and malicious, that wee may with reverence and love, wonder at the mercy of God in our delivery: But this is our comfort, first, that Spirit (as wee have shewn) can do nothing without the God of <hi>Spirits.</hi> Secondly, wee have the <hi>Angells aid,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> against that bloody <hi>King,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Lot</hi> against the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> Gen. 19.10. <hi>Iacob</hi> against the fear of <hi>Esau,</hi> Gen. 32. <hi>ver.</hi> 24.28. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> against <hi>Senacherib, Isa.</hi> 37.36. and <hi>England</hi> against that invicible Navie of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in Eighty eight.

And do but thou get spirituall eyes, whereby thou mai'st see, as with <hi>Moses,</hi> the invisible God, so the invisible <hi>Angels</hi>: do but pray as <hi>Elisha</hi> for his servant, that thine eyes may bee opened, and then thou shalt see more <hi>with thee,</hi> than <hi>against thee</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.</p>
                        <p>Yea, had wicked men their eyes opened, as <hi>Balaam</hi> once had, they would at every turn <hi>see an Angel</hi> stand in their way, ready to resist what they go about, as hee did: for this is one of the noble imploiments of those <hi>glorious spirits,</hi> to give a strong, though <hi>invisible</hi> opposition to lewd enterprises: Many a <hi>treacherous</hi> act have they hindred, without the knowledge of the <hi>Traytor.</hi> Yea, O!

                        <p>Again secondly, the very complaint of sin, springing from a <hi>displeasure against it,</hi> shews that there is somthing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

What is this but in effect, and at a distance to <hi>contradict the Lord,</hi> and give the lye to truth it self.</p>
                        <p>Indeed God says not, Beleeve thou <hi>Iohn, or Thomas,</hi> and thou shalt bee saved, but hee says, <hi>Whosoever beleeveth, and is baptized, shall bee saved,</hi> which is as good.

But you must know, that <hi>denials in some cases</hi> are better <hi>than grants</hi>: the Lord will not take away the body of sin from us upon our <hi>earnest praiers,</hi> yet he granteth us that which is equivalent; viz. <hi>Grace to subdue our corruptions</hi>; and withall takes away the occasion of <hi>pride,</hi> which is better: for certainly he is more supported of God, that hath grace given him to conquer a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as had the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> in being able to suffer those tortures; than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother who is <hi>excused to fight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, we must not <hi>measure God's hearing</hi> of our suit, by his <hi>present answer</hi>; or his <hi>present answer</hi> by our <hi>own sense:</hi> touching the first, <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> a long time failed of a <hi>Son</hi> for all his <hi>Praier</hi>; but when he had even for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that <hi>Praier,</hi> he had a <hi>Son</hi>; the <hi>Angel</hi> brings him good news, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Thy Praier is beard</hi>: When did he make this <hi>Praier?</hi> Nor lately; for then he was <hi>grown old,</hi> and had given over all <hi>hope of a child</hi>: so that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest was past over <hi>many years,</hi> and <hi>no answer</hi> given.</p>
                     <p>The like example we have in <hi>Hannah,</hi> who powring out her soul before the <hi>Lord,</hi> in the <hi>trouble of her spirit</hi>; God did not immediately tell her by revelation that she should conceive a Son, but he gave her for the present, faith; which did work in her joy, and peace of conscience: for (saith the text) she looked no more sad; and when shee had waited his leisure a certain time, <hi>The Lord remembred her with a Son,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing between God and thee, but time; prescribe not his wisdom, hasten not his mercie, now his grace is enough for you, his glory shall be more than enough hereafter.

                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore, let us never give over, but in our thoughts knit the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, progresse, and end together; and then shall we see our selves in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> out of the reach of all our <hi>enemies.</hi>

So <hi>Ionathan</hi> shot the arrows beyond <hi>David,</hi> when he meant them to him: So, <hi>Ioseph</hi> calls for <hi>Benjamin</hi> into bands, when his heart was bound to him in the strongest affection; so, the tender mother makes as if she would give away her crying child, whom she huges so much closer in her bosom.

                     <p>Yea give us repentance never to be repented of, and possess our souls with such a dreadfull awe of thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jesty, that we may fear as well to commit small sins as great ones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the least sin is mortall without our repentance, &amp; thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: as wel fear to sin-in secret as open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, since thereis nothing hid from thee: as well condemne our selves for evill thoughts as evill deeds, considering that the Law is spirituall, binding the heart no lesse then the hands; as well abstain from the occasions of sin, as sin it self; and consider that it is not enough, to abstain from evill, unlesse wee hate it also, and do the contrary good.</p>
                     <p>And now O Lord, since thou hast safely brought us to the beginning of this day, we beseech the to defend, and dierct us in the same: and as thou hast blest us in our lying down, and in our rising up, so protect &amp; prosper us in our going forth, &amp; in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home: shield and deliver us from the snares of the Hunter, who lieth in waite for our souls; and is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labouring our everlasting destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

                     <p>And in these our prayers wee are not mindfull of our selves alone, but forasmuch as thou hast commanded us to pray one for another; as being the members of one and the same mysticall body: wee beseech thee to blesse thy whole Church Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, wheresoever dispersed, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

For we confesse, O Lord, to the shame and confusion of our own faces, that—</p>

But whereas thou gavest us as large a portion, we suddenly lost it. We were created indeed by thee, after thine own image, in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, &amp; holiness, &amp; in knowledg of the Truth: But alas! now our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are so darkned and dulled, our judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts so blinded, our wils so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, our affections so corrupted, our reason so exiled our thoughts so surprised, our desires so entrapped, and all the faculties and suncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our souls so disordered, that we are not sufficient of our selves to think, much lesse to speak, least of all to do ought that is good. And yet usually like Bladders, we are not more empty of grace, than we are blown up with pride: whereby with <hi>Laodicea,</hi> we not once see our own spiritual misery and nakednesse; but think we are rich and good enough, as wanting nothing; when as scarce

any spark of grace yet appears in us. Yea, so far have we been from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and serving thee, that we have hated those that do it, and that for their so doing. And so far have we been from performing that vow which we made to Christ in our Baptism, when we took his presse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to be his Souldiers, and serve him in the field of this world, against his and our enemies; that we have renounced our vow made to him, and fled from his standard; yea, fought for Satan and the World, seeking to win all we could from Christ, by tempting to sin, and by persecuting such as were better then our selves; so that all our recompence of thy love unto us, hath been to do that which thou hatest, and to hate those whom thou lovest. Yea, we cannot deny but we have persecuted thee with <hi>Paul,</hi> denied thee with <hi>Peter,</hi> betraied thee with <hi>Iudas,</hi> and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified thee with those cruel Jews.</p>

                     <p>Yet most most merciful Father, being that thou hast given thy Son, and thy Son himself for the ransome of so many as shall truly repent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly believ in him, who hath for our sakes fulfilled all righteousness; yea, suffered on the Crosse, and there made full satisfaction for the sins of all thine Elect.</p>

Give us grace, to account all things in this world even as drosse, and dung, that we may win Christ Jesus; and Heaven and happinesse by means of him. Give us single hearts, and spirits without guile, that wee may love goodnesse for it self, and more seek the power of godlinesse, then the shew of it; and love the godly for thy sake: and because they are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Grant that in the whole course of our lives, we may doe unto all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as we would that they should doe unto us: considering, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do good or evill, unto any one of thy members, thou takest it as done unto thy self. Discover unto us all our own sins, that wee may not be so forward to censure others, as wee have been heretofore. Give us patience to beare thy Fatherly chastisements, which through thy grace sanctifying them to us, become both Medicines to cure us, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes to preserve us from the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sin: considering, that all the afflictions of this life, are not worthy those joyes which shall be revealed unto us.</p>

                     <p>As ask them these questions, How do you hope to be saved? They will answer, By my prayers and good endeavours.

                     </p>
                     <p>But see how unworthily they demeaned themselves, towards this their bountifull <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Benefactor</hi>! For whereas <hi>God</hi> placed them in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,</hi> and gave them free liberty to eat of the fruit of every <hi>tree</hi> in the <hi>Garden</hi>; save onely of the <hi>tree of knowledge of good and evil</hi>; prohibiting them that alone, even upon pain of eternal death to them and theirs; they most perfidiously contemned, and brake this Law; which (as sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry circumstances that do aggravate it shew) was a most execrable and damnable sin. As observe the several circumstances set down by <hi>Moses,</hi> to amplifie the foulnesse of their Fall: as,

So that thou hast yet to answer (and I pray mind it seriously) for all the sins, that ever thou hast committed, who art not able to answer for one of the least of them.

                     <p>VVhich <hi>salvation</hi> stands, in two things. First, in <hi>freeing</hi> and <hi>delivering us from Hell</hi>; Secondly, In the <hi>possession of Heaven, and eternal life. Christ by his death, merits</hi> the <hi>first for us</hi>: and by his <hi>obedience,</hi> fulfilling the law, <hi>merits</hi> the <hi>second.</hi> The parts of our <hi>justification</hi> are likewise two: the <hi>remission</hi> of our sins, and the <hi>imputation of Christs righteousnesse</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have freedom from <hi>all evill here,</hi> and the perfection of <hi>all good and happinesse in heaven.</hi> Insomuch that all those Millions of mercies that we have received, <hi>from, before,</hi> and <hi>since,</hi> we were born, either for <hi>soul</hi> or <hi>body</hi>; (even to the least <hi>bit of bread we eat</hi>) <hi>or shall enjoy to eternity:</hi> Christ of his free grace hath purchased for us, with the price of his own <hi>precious blood.</hi> For which see <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.19. and 145.15, 16. and 75.6, 7.</p>
                     <p>Hear this all you that care to be saved! God will pardon all your sins, he will give you an <hi>eternall crown of glory in heaven,</hi> if you unfainedly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and <hi>wholly rely upon Christ</hi> for your salvation by a <hi>lively faith</hi>; and that because he is just: for although the Lord cannot in justice let sin go unpunished; (for the <hi>wages of sin is</hi> eternal <hi>death, Rom.</hi> 6.23. death in the <hi>person,</hi> if not in the <hi>surety.</hi>) Yet <hi>Christ</hi> hath sufficiently satisfied for all the <hi>sins</hi> of the <hi>faithful,</hi> and paid their dept even to the utmost farthing; as is evident by <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.4, 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.7, 9. and sundry other places.

to us our <hi>salvation; will be an obligation under our own</hi> hand and seal against us; and so prove a seal of our greater condemnation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the main question is, VVhether thou art a <hi>believer</hi>? For although <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> hath made many large, and precious promises: there are none so general: which are not limited, with the condition of <hi>faith,</hi> and the <hi>fruit</hi> thereof unfained <hi>repentance</hi>; and each of them are so tied and entailed, that none can lay claim to them, but true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, which repent and turn from all their sins, to serve him in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, without which no man shall see the <hi>Lord, Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.20. As for instance, Our Saviour hath made publick Proclamation, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>That whosoever shall believe, and be baptised, shall be saved.</hi> but mark what withal is added; <hi>he that will not believe, shall be damned.</hi> Again, <hi>God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life,</hi> John 3.15, 16. And that none may deceive themselves, he addeth; <hi>He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> And this is the condemnation, <hi>that light is come into the world, and men lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed darkness rather then light,</hi> John 3.19, 20. And again, <hi>As many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, to them he gave power to become the sons of God: even to them that believe on his name,</hi> Joh. 1.12.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>He is said to be the Author of eternal salvation, unto all that obey him:</hi> not unto them which continue in their rebellious wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, and never submit themselves to be ruled by the scepter of his Word. <hi>Christs blood</hi> (saith <hi>Zanchie</hi>) was shed as well for <hi>ablution,</hi> as for <hi>absolution:</hi> as well to <hi>cleanse from the soil and filth of sin, as to clear and assoil from guilt of sin,</hi> Rom. 6.5, 6. <hi>God hath chosen us in Christ, before the foundation of the world; that we should be holy, and without blame before him in love,</hi> Ephes. 1.4. They therefore that never come to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were never chosen. He is said to have <hi>given himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purge us to be a peculiar people unto himself, zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.14. Luke 1.74, 75. Yea, the Lord binds it with an oath, that <hi>whomsoever he redeemeth out of the hands of their spiritual enemies, they shall worship him in holiness and righteousnesse all the dayes of their life,</hi> Luke 1.73, 74, 75. 1. Pet. 2.24. and Tit. 2. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth salvation, teacheth us, that we should deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness and worldly lusts, and that we should live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world,</hi> vers. 12.</p>
                     <p>By all which it is plain, that as <hi>Christs blood is a Charter of pardon</hi>; so withal it is a <hi>Covenant of direction</hi>; and he that refuseth to live as that covenant prescribes, may perish as a <hi>malefactor</hi> that is hanged with his pardon about his neck.</p>

have <hi>another shift</hi>; or rather the enemy of mankinde will furnish them with an <hi>evasion,</hi> telling them that they have <hi>a strong faith, good hearts, and mean well</hi>; they <hi>repent of their sins,</hi> have as <hi>good wishes and desires</hi> as can be, <hi>are elected, hope to go to heaven</hi> as well as the best, &amp;c. But to every of these, I answer,</p>
                     <p>First, true <hi>faith purifieth the heart, and worketh by love, consumeth our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and sanctifieth the whole man throughout, so that our faith to God,</hi> is seen in our <hi>faithfulnesse</hi> to men; our invisible belief, by our visible life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>holiness</hi> are as <hi>inseparable,</hi> as <hi>life</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>light, fire</hi> and <hi>heat, ice</hi> and <hi>coldnesse,</hi> the <hi>spring</hi> and <hi>greenness,</hi> the <hi>rose</hi> and <hi>sweetness, steel</hi> and <hi>hardness, crystal</hi> and <hi>clearness, pitch</hi> and <hi>foulness, honey</hi> and <hi>sweetness.</hi> Again, <hi>faith believeth</hi> the <hi>threats</hi> of the Word; together with the <hi>promises.</hi> Now thou who pretendest belief in the <hi>promises,</hi> shew me thy belief in the <hi>threatnings.</hi> For didst thou believe the truth of those menaces, which <hi>God</hi> hath denounced against <hi>unclean, covetous, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, unjust, envious, malitious persons,</hi> and such like sinners: how durst thou then so wallow in these sins, that if <hi>God</hi> instead of <hi>Hell,</hi> had promised <hi>Heaven</hi> as a reward unto them, thou couldest not do more then thou doest? Why shouldest thou deceive thy self with an opinion of faith? when indeed thou believest <hi>not so much as the Devil does</hi>; for he <hi>believes</hi> [namely the threatnings of the VVord] <hi>and trembles for horror, Iam.</hi> 2. but thou goest on in sin, even <hi>mocking at the menaces,</hi> and in the infidelity of thy heart, givest them the lye, saying, no such thing shall befall thee. But <hi>Invadunt urbem somno vinoque sepultam; when they shall say peace and safety, then comes on them sudden destruction,</hi> 1 Thes. 5.3.</p>
                     <p>Though those <hi>Persecutors of Christ,</hi> and <hi>murtherers of the Lord of life,</hi> were the <hi>Devils children</hi>; as they were plainly told by truth it self, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.44. yet they most confidently <hi>believed,</hi> and stiffly maintained, that <hi>God was their father,</hi> verse 41. And so will the worst of men in these dayes, such as do nothing but sin, and make others sin, such as glory in, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their sins.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>as faith is wrought by Gods spirit</hi>; so where it is wrought, it <hi>brings forth the fruits of the Spirit,</hi> mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. whereas <hi>presumption,</hi> as it is of the <hi>flesh,</hi> so it brings forth the fruits of the <hi>flesh,</hi> verse 19.20, 21.</p>
                     <p>But it is very easie to believe, thinks the sensualist; yes, but why? <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> troubles not such, for then he who begot this presumptuous faith in him, should be divided against himself. Nay, <hi>Satan</hi> confirms him in this his deceit. Besides, this is a sure rule, that that perswasion onely, which <hi>follows sound humiliation,</hi> is faith; that which goes before it is <hi>presumption.</hi> And as <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaks, no man can <hi>repent of sin,</hi> but he that believes <hi>the pardon of sin</hi>: nor none can <hi>believe his sins are pardoned,</hi> except he hath <hi>repented.</hi> Besides, how easie a matter soever thou thinkest it is to believe: he that goes about it, shall finde it as hard a work <hi>to believe the Gospel, as to keep the Law</hi>; and onely God must enable to both, and yet so far as we come short of either, so far forth we have just cause to be humbled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>Secondly, as for their <hi>good hearts and meanings,</hi> they may think what they will, but every wise man knows, that the <hi>outward actions</hi> declare the <hi>inward intentions. A good conversion</hi> is proved by <hi>a good conversation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is no heart made of flesh, which at some time or other relents not; even <hi>flint and marble will in some weather stand on drops. Men may flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God with their mouths, and with their tongues dissemble with him; when their hearts are not upright with him, Psal.</hi> 78.36, 37. and indeed they whose words and deeds are faulty and evil; and yet plead the gooodness of their hearts toward <hi>God</hi>; are like <hi>malefactors,</hi> who being convicted of theft, or the like naughtiness, by plain evidence to their faces, do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the testimony of such persons for their purgation, as they know cannot be found. And in case the hearts of such men could be seen of others, as their works and words are, their hearts would appear worst of all, as they do to <hi>God,</hi> who seeth them. Nor is any evil in the <hi>mouth</hi> or <hi>hand,</hi> which was not in the <hi>heart</hi> first of all, as the stream in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And let a vicious man boast never so much of his good heart; I will as soon believe him that saith he hath the <hi>Philosophers stone,</hi> and yet <hi>lives like a begger,</hi> which two hang together like a sick mans dream.</p>
                     <p>VVe have good hearts, and mean well; alas poor ignorant souls! <hi>for every drop of wickedness</hi> that appears <hi>in the life, there is an ocean in the heart.

                     <p>Thirdly, touching their repentance my answer is; True <hi>repentance for sin,</hi> is a <hi>turning from every sin</hi> to the contrary good. In all true <hi>repentance is a change,</hi> both in the <hi>judgement</hi> from error to truth, and in the <hi>will</hi> from evil to good, and in the affections from loving evil, and hating good; to love good and hate evil, in the <hi>whole man from darkness, to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> VVithout which change, no repentance, no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing saved: The two main and essential parts of repentance are <hi>contrition or humiliation, and conversion or reformation.</hi> It is not true repentance, except <hi>humiliation and reformation go both together</hi>: for either of these single make but a half, or halting repentance. An unreformed <hi>sorrow,</hi> is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102698:131"/>
but deformed: and <hi>a sorrowless reformation,</hi> is but a very sorry one. <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi> without <hi>reformation, is a foundation without a building; and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation without humiliation, is a building without a foundation. Iudas</hi> was grieved for murthering <hi>Christ,</hi> yet no change followed: he fell to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of himself. It is not possible a man should truly grieve, and be displeased for his sins; and yet continue in them without a change.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, as for their assurance of salvation, it is upon as good ground as all the rest: for they slumber, and suppose themselves good Christians; their <hi>faith</hi> is but a <hi>dream,</hi> their hope but a <hi>dream,</hi> their charity but a <hi>dream,</hi> their obedience but a <hi>dream,</hi> their whole religion but a <hi>dream</hi>; and so their assurance of salvation is but a <hi>dream</hi>; they have regeneration in conceit, repentance and righteousness in conceit, they <hi>serve God well in conceit,</hi> do <hi>the works of</hi> justice and piety in conceit, and they shall <hi>go to heaven onely in conceit, or in a dream, and never awake until they feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the flames of hell.</hi> Every drunken beast and blasphemer thinks to go to <hi>heaven</hi>; though none shall come there, nor once see <hi>God</hi> without <hi>holiness</hi>: which they abhor. One mindes nothing but his <hi>cups,</hi> another nothing but his <hi>coyn,</hi> a third onely his <hi>Curtizan</hi>; yet all these point to <hi>meet in heaven,</hi> but this is not the way thither. <hi>The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.16. is a broad way, but not to heaven. <hi>Micha</hi> when he had a <hi>Levite</hi> in his house, thought that <hi>God</hi> loved him, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17.13. It is usual with <hi>formalists,</hi> when they have the <hi>Sacrament in their belly,</hi> to think that all is well, as the <hi>Iews</hi> thought, we may put away our wives, we may swear, we may hate our enemies, we may kill the <hi>Prophets,</hi> subject the Word of <hi>God</hi> to our <hi>traditions,</hi> and follow our own wayes.

                     <p>But yet more to convince you, you go to heaven, when in sundry par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, you fall <hi>short of many wicked reprobates</hi> recorded in Scripture; as do but deal impartially with thy self, and tell me thou <hi>civil Iusticiary</hi> whether thou ever hadst the heart upon hearing the threatnings of the Word to relent and humble thy self with <hi>Ahab</hi>? to confess thy sins, and desire the people of <hi>God</hi> to pray for thee with <hi>Pharoah</hi>? to be affected with joy in hearing the Word, and practice many things, with <hi>Herod?</hi> to be zealous against sin, with <hi>Iehu?</hi> willingly to part with a good part of thy goods, with <hi>Ananias</hi>? to forsake the world and all thy hopes in it; to follow poor <hi>Christ,</hi> as <hi>Demas</hi> and others? to venture thy life with <hi>Alexander the Copper-smith,</hi> in cleaving to the truth? yea, it is said of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> himself that he repented, there is <hi>contrition</hi>; he saith I have sinned, there is confession, and he restored the money again, there is satisfaction; which is all the <hi>Papists repentance</hi>: and yet he is <hi>Iudas the son of perdition still.</hi> Now tell me? doest thou not come short of these, many such as these be wicked reprobates, and yet wilt thou please thy self in a false conceit, of thine own happiness, who comest further behind them, then they do behind true Christians? If some that have journied in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness to <hi>Kadesh-barnea,</hi> shall yet never enter into <hi>Gods rest</hi>; shall those that never left <hi>Egypt</hi>? Is the <hi>stony ground</hi> reprobate? and can the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ground</hi> be good? There are three sorts of ground mentioned, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.4, 5, 6, 7. and the very worst of them receives the seed, yet all damned, whither then shall the tempest of <hi>Gods</hi> wrath drive them, that would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet give the <hi>Gospel</hi> a religious ear?</p>
                     <p>But vicious men, think <hi>God</hi> is all mercy (as <hi>foggie air</hi> useth to <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent every object far bigger</hi> than it is) when the VVord tells us, that <hi>he is a consuming fire, and a jealous God, Deut.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29. and when we shall find in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>thrice as many curses as blessings.</hi> Doest thou expect to have him <hi>mercifull to thee,</hi> that art <hi>unmercifull, cruel, and bloody to him, to his,</hi> and <hi>thine own soul?</hi> none that have eyes in their heads and open, can be so sottish. But <hi>Sin</hi> is <hi>like the juice of poppie,</hi> called <hi>Opium</hi>; which if the quantity exceed, bringeth the <hi>patient</hi> into a <hi>deep sleep,</hi> that he <hi>never awaketh.</hi> Sinners <hi>dream</hi> they are <hi>awake,</hi> but indeed they are <hi>fast asleep</hi>; yea, with <hi>Sardis</hi> they are <hi>dead,</hi> while they <hi>think they are alive.</hi>

                     <p>And indeed this <hi>misprision</hi> or <hi>mistake,</hi> this very opinion of being in ease good enough, keeps a man out of all possibility of being bettered; for what we presume to have attained, we seek not after. Yea, this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited righteousnesse,</hi> is the onely <hi>cause of all unrighteousnesse</hi>; and many a man had been good, if he had not at present so thought himself.

                     <p>In the last place, touching their <hi>Election,</hi> this is an infallible truth; Whomsoever <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>appointed to salvation,</hi> to them he hath <hi>appointed the means also,</hi> which is <hi>holiness.</hi> Indeed a man may be so bold of his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination,</hi> as to forget his <hi>conversation</hi>; so he may dream himselfe in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and waken from that dream in <hi>Hell. Gods purpose touching the end, includes the means.</hi> Though <hi>God</hi> had promised <hi>Paul</hi> that his <hi>company</hi> should not <hi>be drowned,</hi> yet he told the <hi>Mariners,</hi> that unless they <hi>kept in the ship,</hi> they <hi>should be drowned, Acts</hi> 27.22, 23, 31. as if their safety should not be without means: <hi>Rebekah</hi> had <hi>Gods Oracle</hi> for <hi>Iacobs life,</hi> yet she sent him away out of <hi>Esaus</hi> reach. It was impossible for <hi>Herod</hi> to hurt the <hi>child Iesus,</hi> yet he must <hi>flie into Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And so I have shown in the last place, what are the <hi>conditions of the new Covenant, and to whom the promises belong</hi>; which is all that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took. Now if men will yet goe on, and perish in their impenitency; their blood be on their own heads, and not on mine, I have discharged my duty.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, least the single evidence that I bring from the Word of Truth, should not prove sufficient to gain your credence to what hath been spoken; And because <hi>examples give a quicker impression then arguments,</hi> I have one thing more to crave of thee, which is, that thou wilt also hear the confession of two parties (in the ensuing or second part of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) that were lately in thy very condition; though now by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodness of <hi>God</hi> they have their <hi>eyes opened,</hi> and their <hi>hearts chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to see and know,</hi> both what it is to be in the <hi>state of nature,</hi> and what to be brought into the <hi>glorious liberty of the sons of God</hi>; that so by a <hi>three fold cord,</hi> you may be drawn to <hi>accept of salvation upon Gods own terms</hi>; whereas otherwise you can no way escape his eternal wrath.</p>
                     <p>The ensuing, or <hi>second part,</hi> which I would request you to read and minde, is; <hi>A happy Conference, between a Formalist converted, and a loose Libertine,</hi> intituled, <hi>An experimental Index of the Heart.</hi>

I blesse <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> hath wrought in me such a change and strange alteration, that it hath <hi>opened</hi> mine <hi>eyes</hi> that were <hi>blind</hi> before, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined</hi> my <hi>will</hi> to <hi>obedience,</hi> which before was <hi>rebellious, softened</hi> my <hi>heart, sanctified</hi> and quite changed my <hi>affections:</hi> so that I now <hi>love</hi> that <hi>good</hi> which before I <hi>hated,</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> that <hi>evil</hi> which before I <hi>loved</hi>; and am <hi>delighted</hi> with those <hi>holy exercises</hi>

                     <p>And yet had it been so, as I imagined; admit I had never offended in the least all my life; either in thought, word, or deed: yet this were but one-half of what I owe to <hi>God</hi>; this were but to observe the <hi>negative part</hi> of his <hi>law,</hi> still the <hi>affirmative part</hi> thereof I had been so far from perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I had not so much as thought of it. And to be just in the sight of <hi>God,</hi> and graciously accepted of him, these two things are required: the <hi>satisfactory part to escape Hell,</hi> and the <hi>meritorious part to get Heaven.</hi> And the true method of grace is, <hi>Cease to do evil, Learn to do well,</hi> Isa. 1.16, 17. The <hi>Fig-tree</hi> was <hi>cursed,</hi> not for bearing <hi>evil fruit</hi>; but because it bare <hi>no good.</hi> The <hi>evil servant</hi> was not <hi>bound hand and foot, and cast into prison,</hi> for <hi>wasting</hi> his <hi>Masters goods</hi>; but for <hi>not gaining</hi> with them. And those <hi>Reprobates</hi> at the last day, shall be bid <hi>depart into everlasting fire</hi>; not for <hi>wronging</hi> or <hi>robbing</hi> of any, but for <hi>not giving,</hi> for <hi>not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Christs poor Members,</hi> Mat. 25. So that my case was most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. For though, with that <hi>Pharisee,</hi> Luk. 18.11. I was apt to thank <hi>God,</hi> and brag; that I was <hi>just, and paid every man his due:</hi> yet I never thought of being <hi>holy,</hi> and of <hi>paying God his dues</hi>; as his due of <hi>believing,</hi> or <hi>repenting,</hi> of new <hi>obedience,</hi> his due of <hi>praying, hearing, conferring, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating</hi> on his <hi>word and works, sanctifying</hi> his <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and <hi>instructing</hi> my <hi>Children and Servants</hi>; teaching them to fear the <hi>Lord.</hi> His due of <hi>Love, Fear, Thankefulnesse, Zeal</hi> for his <hi>Glory,</hi> charity and <hi>mercy</hi> to <hi>Christs poor Members,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>I should have served <hi>God</hi> in <hi>spirit,</hi> and according to <hi>Christs Gospel:</hi> as all that are <hi>wise hearted</hi> do <hi>live,</hi> and <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>invocate,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>worship God</hi> in such manner, as his <hi>word</hi> prescribes.

Neither let <hi>Satan</hi> perswade you to defer your repentance; no, not an hour; lest your <hi>resolution</hi> proves as a <hi>false conception,</hi> which never comes to <hi>bearing.</hi> Besides, death may be suddain: even the least of a thousand things can kill you, and give you no leasure to be sick.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If thou wilt be safe from <hi>evil works,</hi> avoid the <hi>occasions</hi>; have no fellowship with the workers of iniquity: neither fear their scoffs; for this be sure of, if your person and waies <hi>please God,</hi> the <hi>world will be displeased</hi> with both: If <hi>God</hi> be your <hi>friend, men</hi> will be your <hi>enemies:</hi> if they exercise their <hi>malice,</hi> it is where he shews <hi>mercy.</hi> But take heed of losing <hi>Gods</hi> favour to keep theirs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beda</hi> tels <hi>of a great man,</hi> that was admonished by his friends in his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to repent: who answered, He would not yet; for that if he should recover, his friends and companions would laugh at him: but growing sicker and sicker, they again prest him: but then his answer was, that it was now too late; for I am judged and condemned already.</p>
                     <p>A man cannot be a <hi>Nathaniel, in whose heart there is no guile</hi>; but the world counts him a <hi>fool.</hi> But <hi>Christ</hi> saies, Verily <hi>except ye be converted, and become as little children; ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 18.3.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Satan</hi> and your deceitfull heart will suggest unto you, that a <hi>Religious life,</hi> is <hi>a dumpish</hi> and <hi>melancholy life:</hi> but holy <hi>David</hi> will tell you, that <hi>light is sown to the righteous, and joy to the upright,</hi> Psal. 97.11. Isa. 65.14. And experience tells, that <hi>earthly</hi> and <hi>bodily joys</hi> are but the <hi>body,</hi> or rather the <hi>dregs</hi> of that <hi>joy,</hi> which <hi>Gods</hi> people feel and are ravished with. As O the calm, and quietnesse of a good conscience! the assurance of the pardon of sin, and joy of the Holy Ghost, the honesty of a virtuous and holy life how sweet they are. Yea even <hi>Plato an Heathen</hi> could say, That if wisdom and virtue could but represent it self to the eyes, it would set the heart on fire with the love of it. And the like of a sinners sadnesse, as hear what <hi>Seneca</hi> saies; if there were no <hi>God to punish him, no Devil to torment him, no Hell to burn him, no man to see him:</hi> yet would he not sin, for the uglinesse and filthinesse of sin, and the guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and sadnesse of his conscience. But experience is the best informer: wherefore take the counsell of holy <hi>David,</hi> Psalm. 34.8. <hi>O tast and see, that the Lord is good: blessed is the man, that trusteth in him.</hi> To which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth that of holy <hi>Bernard, Good</hi> art thou, O <hi>Lord,</hi> to the soul that <hi>seeks thee</hi>; what art thou then to the soul that <hi>finds thee?</hi> As I may appeal to any mans conscience, that hath been softned with the unction of grace; and truly tasted of the powers of the world to come; to him that hath the <hi>love of God shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost</hi>: whether his whole life be not a perpetual <hi>halellujah,</hi> in comparison of his natural condition. Whence they are able to sleight all such objections, as he did: you tell me
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102698:141"/>
that scrupling of small matters, is but stumbling at straws; that they be but trifles: When I know your tongue can tell nothing but truth, I will believe you.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Beg of <hi>God</hi> that he will give you a <hi>new heart,</hi> and when the <hi>heart</hi> is changed, all the <hi>members</hi> will <hi>follow</hi> after it, as the rest of the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> after the <hi>Sun,</hi> when it <hi>ariseth.</hi> But without a work upon the heart, wrought by the Spirit of God; it will follow its own inclination to that which it affecteth; whatsoever the judgment shall say to the contrary: That must be first <hi>reformed,</hi> which was first <hi>deformed.</hi> It is idle, and to no purpose to purge the <hi>channell,</hi> when the <hi>fountain</hi> is corrupt. Whence the <hi>Apostle</hi> orderly bids us, first be <hi>renewed in the spirit of our minds</hi>; and then <hi>let him that stole, steal no more,</hi> Eph. 4.23, 24. Yea it is <hi>Gods</hi> own counsell, to the men of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Jer. 4. <hi>Wash thine heart from wickedness: that thou maist be saved,</hi> ver. 14. It is most ridiculous to apply <hi>remedies</hi> to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, when the <hi>distemper</hi> lies in the stomach. To what purpose is it to <hi>crop</hi> off the top of <hi>weeds,</hi> or <hi>lop</hi> off the <hi>boughs</hi> of the <hi>tree,</hi> when the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>stalk</hi> remain in the earth: as cut off the <hi>sprig</hi> of a <hi>tree,</hi> it grows still; a <hi>bough,</hi> an <hi>arm,</hi> still it grows, lop of the <hi>top,</hi> yea saw it in the midst, yet it will grow again; stock it up by the <hi>roots,</hi> then (and not till then) it will grow no more. Whence it is that God saith, <hi>Give me thine heart,</hi> Prov. 23.26. <hi>Great Cities</hi> once expunged, the <hi>dorpes</hi> and <hi>Villages</hi> will soon come in of themselves: the <hi>heart</hi> is the treasury and <hi>store-house</hi> of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.34. such as the heart is, such are the actions of the body which proceed from it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.35. Therefore as <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>Make clean within, and all will be clean,</hi> otherwise not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.26. Therefore <hi>Davids</hi> prayer is, <hi>Create in me a new heart O Lord, and renew a right Spirit within me,</hi> Psal. 51.10. do thou the like, importune him for grace; that you may firmly <hi>resolve,</hi> speedily <hi>begin,</hi> and continually <hi>persevere,</hi> in doing and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his holy will: desire him to <hi>inform</hi> and <hi>reform</hi> you so, that you may neither <hi>misbelieve</hi> nor <hi>mislive</hi>; to change and purifie your <hi>naure, subdue</hi> your <hi>reason, rectifie</hi> your <hi>judgment, reform</hi> and strengthen your <hi>will, renew</hi> your <hi>affections,</hi> and beat down in you, whatsoever stands in opposition to the <hi>Scepter of Iesus Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly and lastly; If you receive any power against you former cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, forget not to be <hi>thankefull,</hi> yea study all possible thankfulness. For that you and I are not at this present <hi>frying in Hell flames,</hi> never to be freed; that we have the offer of <hi>grace here,</hi> and <hi>glory hereafter,</hi> it is his unspeakable goodness. And there is nothing more <hi>pleasing to God,</hi> nor <hi>profitable to us</hi>; both for the <hi>procuring of the good we want,</hi> or <hi>continuing the good we have</hi>; than thankfulness. He will <hi>sow</hi> there, and there onely <hi>plenty of his blessings</hi>; where he is sure to <hi>reap plenty of thanks and service:</hi> but who will <hi>sow</hi> those <hi>barren sands,</hi> where they are sure not only to be without all hope of a good <hi>harvest,</hi> but are sure to loose, both their <hi>seed and labour. Consider what hath been said, and the Lord give you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in all things.</hi> And so much for the <hi>Second Part.

                        <hi>LUcian</hi> tells of an <hi>Egyptian King,</hi> who had <hi>Apes</hi> taught (when they were young) to <hi>dance,</hi> and keep their postures with much <hi>art</hi>: these he would put into <hi>rich Coats,</hi> and have them in some <hi>great presence</hi> to exercise their <hi>skill</hi>; which was to the admiration of such as knew them not, what <hi>little</hi> sort of <hi>active, nimble</hi> men the <hi>King</hi> had got: And such as knew them, thought it no

less strange; that they should be trained up to so <hi>man-like,</hi> and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some a <hi>deportment.</hi> But a <hi>subtile Fellow</hi> that was once admitted to see them, brought and threw amongst them, a handful of <hi>Nuts</hi>: which they no sooner spied; but they presently <hi>left off</hi> their dance, <hi>fell a scrambling, tore</hi> one anothers <hi>rich Coats</hi>; and to the dirision of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders (who before admired them) they discovered themselves to be <hi>meer Apes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These ensuing <hi>Notions</hi> (which I have purposely taken, as a <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> out of the whole <hi>sack,</hi> to squander away amongst my <hi>acquaintance</hi>) are such <hi>Nuts,</hi> as will discover not a few (who are <hi>men</hi> in <hi>appearance,</hi> and their own <hi>opinion</hi>) to be as wise, and well affected as <hi>Aesops Cock</hi>; that preferred a <hi>barley Corn,</hi> before a <hi>Pearl</hi>: or <hi>Plinies Moal,</hi> that would <hi>dig under ground</hi> with great <hi>dexterity</hi>: but was <hi>blind,</hi> if brought <hi>into the Sun.</hi> Or <hi>Diaphontus,</hi> that refused his mothers blessing, to hear a song: Or the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who preferred <hi>Garlick</hi> and <hi>Onions,</hi> before <hi>Quails</hi> and <hi>manna.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Men</hi> no more differ from <hi>Beasts, Plants, Stones</hi>; in speech, reason, shape, than some differ from others, in <hi>heart,</hi> in <hi>brain,</hi> in <hi>life.</hi> Whence the very <hi>heathen Poets</hi> usually &amp; most fitly compare some men to <hi>stones,</hi> for their hardness, and insensibleness; others to <hi>plants,</hi> that only fill their veins; a third sort to <hi>beasts,</hi> that please their senses too; a fourth to <hi>evil Angels,</hi> that only sin, and cause others to sin; a fift to <hi>good Angels,</hi> that are still in motion, alwayes serving <hi>God</hi> and doing <hi>good,</hi> yet ever rest.</p>
                     <p>Again, Experience teaches, that mens <hi>judgements</hi> and <hi>censures</hi> are as various, as their <hi>pallats</hi>: For what one <hi>admires,</hi> another <hi>slights</hi>; as is evident by <hi>our Saviours Auditors</hi>; of which some <hi>admired,</hi> others <hi>censured,</hi> a third sort <hi>wept,</hi> a fourth <hi>scoft,</hi> a fift <hi>trembled,</hi> a sixt <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed</hi> when they heard him.

                     <p>Amidst such a world of variety, I have chosen to set forth, how one man differs from, and excels another in <hi>brain,</hi> and to prove, that to be <hi>wise indeed,</hi> is the <hi>portion</hi> but <hi>of a few,</hi> even amongst us.

                           </item>

                     </p>
                     <p>For if you observe it, some men like the <hi>Moon at Full,</hi> have all their light towards <hi>earth,</hi> none towards Heaven: Others like the <hi>Moon at VVaine,</hi> or Change, have all their light to <hi>Heaven</hi> wards, none to the earth: a third sort like to the <hi>Moon in eclipse,</hi> as having no light in it self, neither towards <hi>earth,</hi> nor towards <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching these <hi>three degrees of comparison,</hi> you shall find, that the one exceeds the other (in wisdom) as the <hi>stars exceed one another in glory.</hi> Of which particularly.</p>
                     <p>First, There is no less difference, between the <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>sensual,</hi> the <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>simple,</hi> the <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>unlearned,</hi> than there is between <hi>men</hi> and <hi>beasts</hi>; as <hi>Menander</hi> speaks. Or between the <hi>living</hi> and the <hi>dead,</hi> as another hath it. And yet the <hi>Rational,</hi> do not so far excel the <hi>sensual,</hi> as the <hi>spiritual</hi> excel the <hi>rational.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sensual men</hi> are so be-nighted, and puzled with blindness, that they know no other way than the <hi>flesh leads</hi> them. It is the <hi>weight</hi> that sets all their <hi>wheels</hi> a going; the <hi>horses</hi> that draw their <hi>chariot,</hi> the very <hi>life</hi> of their <hi>corruption,</hi> the <hi>corruption</hi> of their <hi>life,</hi> without which they do nothing.</p>
                     <p>The minds of brutish men, that have been ill bred, are so drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in sin, and sensuallity; and their spirits so frozen, and pitifully benumed with worldliness, and wicked customs, that they cannot judg aright, either of spiritual matters, or rectified reason. Yea, in matters experimental, they are of as deep a judgement as was <hi>Callico,</hi> who stuft his pillow (a brass pot) with straw, to make it soft. Or that <hi>Germain Clown,</hi> who under-took to be very ready in the <hi>ten Commandments</hi>: but being demanded by the <hi>Minister</hi> which was the first? made answer, <hi>Thou shall not eate.</hi> Or that simple Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who thought <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> must needs be a <hi>Saint,</hi> because his name was put into the <hi>Creed.</hi> They are like the <hi>Ostrich,</hi> Job <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They that are after the flesh, do minde the things of the flesh: The carnal minde is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be,</hi> Rom. 8.5. to 9. And which leaves them without all hope of being wiser, they had rather keep <hi>conscience blind,</hi> that it may <hi>slatter them,</hi> than <hi>inform</hi> it, that it may give a <hi>just verdict against them,</hi> counting it less trouble, to believe <hi>a favorable falshood,</hi> than to examine whether it be <hi>true.</hi> So that it is impossible for fleshly minded men, to believe what sots they are, touching the good of their souls. Wherefore when we see the <hi>folly,</hi> and <hi>misery</hi> of those that serve sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and how peevishly averse they are to their own eternal salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let us pity them, as being so much more worthy our commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they are more uncapable of their own misery.

A <hi>little gold</hi> (we know) is more worth than <hi>much dross</hi>: a little <hi>diamond,</hi> than a <hi>rocky mountain.</hi> So one drop of wisdom, guided by the fear of <hi>God</hi>; one spark of spiritual, experimental, and saving knowledge, is more worth than all humane wisdom and learning: yea, one <hi>scruple of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> one <hi>dram of faith,</hi> one <hi>grain of grace,</hi> is more worth than <hi>many pounds, of natural parts.</hi> And indeed Faith, and Holiness, are the nerves, and sinews; yea, the soul of saving knowledge.</p>
                     <p>What saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>? No more than the knowledge of goodness, maketh one to be named a good man; no more doth the knowledge of wisdom alone, cause any person properly to be called a wise man. Saving knowledge of the truth, works a love of the truth known: yea it is a uniform consent, of knowledge and action. He only is wise, that is wise for his own soul: he whose conscience pulleth all he hears, and reads to his heart, and his heart to <hi>God</hi>: who turneth his <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> to <hi>faith,</hi> his faith to <hi>feeling,</hi> and all to walk worthy of his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</hi> He that subdues his <hi>sensual desires</hi> and <hi>appetite,</hi> to the more <hi>noble faculties</hi> of <hi>reason,</hi> and <hi>understanding</hi>; and makes that understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his to serve him, by whom it is, and doth understand.

to <hi>faith</hi>; his faith, his reason, his will, himself to the <hi>will of God</hi>: this is practical, experimental, and saving knowledge; to which the other is but a bare name, or title. <hi>A competnet estate</hi> (we know) <hi>well husbanded,</hi> is better than <hi>a vast patrimony neglected.</hi> Never any meer man (since the first) knew so much as <hi>Solomon</hi>: many that have known less, have had more command of themselves.</p>
                     <p>Alas! they are <hi>not</hi> alwayes <hi>the wisest, that know most</hi>: For none more wise and learned in the worlds account, than the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi>: yet <hi>Christ</hi> calls them four times <hi>blind,</hi> and twice <hi>fools</hi> in one <hi>chapter, Matth.</hi> 23. And the like of <hi>Balaam,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. who had such a prophetical knowledge, that scarce any of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> had a cleerer revelation of the <hi>Messiah</hi> to come. And the same may be affirmed of <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Athitophel</hi>; for many that know a great deal less, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <hi>nothing worth.</hi> Rightly a man knows no more than he practiseth.

                     <p>I Grant that in some kind of skill they out-strip the best of <hi>Gods</hi> People, who, if they are put to it, may answer as <hi>Themistocles</hi> did when one invited him to <hi>touch a lute</hi>; for as he said, <hi>I cannot fiddle</hi>; but <hi>I can make a smal town a great state</hi>: So the godly may say, We cannot give a sollid reason in Nature, why <hi>Nilus</hi> should <hi>over-flow</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Sommer, when <hi>waters</hi> are at the <hi>lowest?</hi> Why the <hi>Loadstone</hi> should <hi>draw iron,</hi> or incline to the <hi>pole-star?</hi> How the <hi>heat of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> and the <hi>strength of the nether chap</hi> should be so great? Why <hi>a flash of lightening</hi> should <hi>melt the sword</hi> without making any <hi>impression in the scabbard? Kill the Child in the womb,</hi> and <hi>never hurt the Mother?</hi> How the <hi>waters</hi> should <hi>stand</hi> upon a heap, and yet <hi>not over-flow the earth</hi>? Why the <hi>clouds</hi> above being <hi>heavie</hi> with <hi>water,</hi> should not <hi>fall</hi> to the <hi>earth</hi> suddenly, seeing <hi>every beavy thing descendeth</hi>? Except the reason which <hi>God</hi> giveth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.6. &amp; <hi>Job</hi> 38 8.10 12. &amp; 26.8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.9. But we know the mystery of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and what it is to be <hi>born a new,</hi> and can give a sollid <hi>reason of our faith</hi>: we know that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>reconciled</hi> to us, the <hi>Law satisfied</hi> for us, our <hi>sins pardoned,</hi> our <hi>souls acquitted,</hi> and that we are in <hi>favour</hi> with <hi>God</hi>; which many of these with their <hi>great learning</hi> do <hi>not know.</hi> And thus the <hi>godly</hi> are proved <hi>wiser</hi> than the <hi>wisest humanist</hi> that wants grace. You have likewise <hi>the reasons</hi> why these <hi>great knowers, know nothing</hi> yet as they <hi>might</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to know: that is to say,

knowledg</hi> for <hi>soul wisdom</hi>; &amp; <hi>soul saving wisdom</hi> to be <hi>foolishness</hi> &amp; <hi>madness.</hi> Now if a man take his <hi>aim</hi> amiss, he may <hi>shoot</hi> long enough ere he <hi>hit</hi> the <hi>white</hi>: and these men are as one that is <hi>gone</hi> a good <hi>part</hi> of his <hi>journey,</hi> but must <hi>come back again</hi> because he hath <hi>mistaken</hi> his <hi>way.</hi>

                           </item>
                           <item>Thirdly, For that they <hi>seek</hi> not to <hi>God</hi> for it who is the <hi>giver</hi> thereof, and without whose <hi>spirit</hi> there is no attaining it.</item>
                           <item>Fourthly, Because they are <hi>proud,</hi> and so seek not after it, as <hi>supposing</hi> they <hi>have it</hi> already.</item>
                           <item>Fiftly, Because if they <hi>had</hi> never so <hi>much</hi> knowledge, they would be <hi>never the holier,</hi> or the <hi>better</hi> for it, but rather the <hi>worse</hi>; nor would they <hi>imploy</hi> it to the <hi>honour of</hi> God, or the <hi>good of others.</hi>

                           <item>Seventhly, Because they will not <hi>consult</hi> with the <hi>word</hi> about it, nor <hi>advise</hi> with <hi>others</hi> that have already attained to it. Or thus, They <hi>read</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> the Scriptures and mind not, (I mean the <hi>spirituallity of the word</hi>) or <hi>mind</hi> and understand not, or <hi>understand</hi> and remember not, or <hi>remember</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> not. No, this they intend not of all the rest; and they that are <hi>unwilling</hi> to <hi>obey, God</hi> thinks <hi>unvvorthy</hi> to <hi>know.</hi>

                     <p>When the <hi>Serpent</hi> taught knowledge, he said, <hi>If ye eare the forbidden fruit, your eyes shal be opened, and you shal know good and evil</hi>: But <hi>God</hi> teacheth another lesson, and saith, If ye will <hi>not eate the forbidden fruit,</hi> your eyes shall be opened, and you shall know good and evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. See <hi>Psa.</hi> 111.10. &amp; 119.97, 98, 99, 100. Or if you do eat it, you shall be like <hi>images that have ears and cannot hear,</hi> Rom. 11.8. Isa. 6.10. Matth. 13.14. Psal. 115.6.</p>
                     <p>From all which Reasons we may collect, That there are but a <hi>few</hi> amongst us, that are <hi>wise indeed,</hi> and to purpose; For these <hi>Seven Hinderances</hi> are applyable to seventy seven parts of men in the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Besides, if these <hi>great knowers know</hi> so <hi>little,</hi> how <hi>ignorant</hi> are the <hi>rude rabble,</hi> that despise all knowledge? Nor can it be denied but all impenitent persons, all <hi>unbelievers</hi> (who prefer their <hi>profits</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> before <hi>pleasing</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; as <hi>Herodias</hi> prefered <hi>John Baptists head</hi> before the one <hi>half of Herods kingdom,</hi>) are <hi>arrant fools</hi>; yea, fools in folio: For if they were wise, sayes <hi>Bernard,</hi> they would foresee the <hi>torments of Hell,</hi> and prevent them.</p>
                     <p>And so <hi>wise</hi> are the <hi>godly,</hi> for they prefer <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>Gods savour,</hi> before <hi>ten thousand worlds.</hi>

                           </gap>his spiritual</hi> and experimental knowledg? this divine and supernatural <hi>wisdom</hi>?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> By observing these <hi>Five Rules</hi>:</p>
                     <p>First, Let such a willing and ingenuous soul, resolve to <hi>practise</hi> what he <hi>does</hi> already <hi>know,</hi> or <hi>shall</hi> hereafter be acquainted with from the <hi>word of God</hi> and <hi>Christs faithful Messengers</hi>: For <hi>he that will do my Fathers will,</hi> sayes <hi>our Saviour, shall know the doctrine, whether it be of God or no,</hi> Joh. 7.17. <hi>A good understanding have all they that keep the commandments,</hi> (sayes <hi>holy</hi> David) Psal. 111.10. and proves it true by his own <hi>example</hi> and <hi>experience</hi>: I <hi>understood</hi> (sayes he) <hi>more than the Antient, and became wiser than my teachers, because</hi> I <hi>kept thy precepts,</hi> Psal. 119.97, 98, 99, 100. <hi>To a man that is good in his sight, God giveth knowledg and wisdom,</hi> Eccles. 2.26. <hi>The spiritual man understandeth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.15. <hi>VVicked men understand not judgment, but they that seek the Lord, understand all things,</hi> Prov. 28.5. <hi>Admirable incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements</hi> for men to become <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>consciencious</hi>; I mean <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, If thou wouldest get this precious grace of saving knowledge; the way is, to be <hi>frequeut in hearing the word</hi> preached, and to become <hi>studious in the Scriptures,</hi> for <hi>they</hi> and they alone <hi>make wise to Salvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. <hi>Ye err</hi> (saith <hi>our Saviour</hi>) <hi>not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> Matth. 22.29. Mark 12.24. We must not in the search of heavenly matters, either <hi>do as</hi> we see <hi>others do</hi>; neither must we follow the <hi>blind guide carnal reason,</hi> or the <hi>deceitful guide</hi> our corrupt <hi>hearts</hi>; but the <hi>undeceivable,</hi> and infallable <hi>guide</hi> of <hi>Gods word</hi> which is truth it self: and great need there is; for as we cannot perceive the <hi>foulness of our faces</hi> unless it be told us, or we take a <hi>glass</hi> and look our selves therein: so neither can we see the <hi>blemishes</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> which is a notable degree of spiritual Wisdom, but either <hi>God</hi> must make it known to us by his <hi>spirit,</hi> or we must collect the same out of the Scriptures, that <hi>coelestial glass</hi>; though this also must be done by the <hi>spirits help.</hi> Therefore</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If thou wilt be <hi>Soul-wise</hi> and truly profit by studying the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> be <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>fervent</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>God</hi> who is the only <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> of it, for the direction of his <hi>holy spirit</hi>: For first, humble and faithful <hi>Prayer,</hi> ushered in by <hi>meditation,</hi> is the <hi>cure of al obscurity.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially being accompanied with <hi>fervor</hi> and <hi>fervency</hi>; as you may see, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.22. <hi>If any lack wisdom,</hi> saith St. <hi>James, let him ask of God who giveth to al men liberally and reproacheth no man, and it shal be given him,</hi> Jam. 1.5. Mark the words, it is said <hi>if any</hi>; wherefore let no man deny his soul this comfort. Again, <hi>ask and have</hi>; It cannot come upon easier terms. Yea, <hi>God</hi> seems to like this sure so well in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> as if he were beholding to his Creature, for wishing well to it self. And in vain do we expect that <hi>alms of grace,</hi> for which we do not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102698:149"/>
so much as <hi>beg.</hi> But in praying for Wisdom, do not <hi>pray</hi> for it <hi>without putting difference</hi>; desire not so much <hi>brain-knowledg</hi> as to be <hi>Soul-wise,</hi> and then you will <hi>imploy</hi> your <hi>wisdom</hi> to the <hi>glory of the giver.</hi> Let thine hearts desire be <hi>to know God in Christ, Christ in Faith, Faith in good works</hi>; to <hi>know Gods vvill</hi> that thou mayest <hi>do it</hi>; and before the knowledg of all other things, desire to <hi>knovv thy self</hi>; &amp; in thy self, not so much thy <hi>strength,</hi> as thy <hi>vveakness</hi>: Pray that thine heart may serve thee insteed of <hi>a commentary,</hi> to help thee understand such <hi>points</hi> of Religion as are <hi>most needful</hi> and necessary, and that <hi>thy Life</hi> may be <hi>an Exposition</hi> of thy <hi>invvard man,</hi> that there may be a sweet <hi>harmony</hi> betwixt <hi>Gods VVord, thy judgment,</hi> and <hi>vvhole conversation,</hi> that what the <hi>natural man</hi> knoweth by <hi>roat,</hi> thou mayst <hi>double by feeling</hi> the same in thine <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>affections.</hi> As indeed <hi>experimental</hi> and <hi>saving knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> is no less <hi>felt</hi> than <hi>knovvn</hi>; and, I cannot tell how, comes rather <hi>out of the abundance of the heart,</hi> than by extreme <hi>study</hi>; or rather is <hi>sent by God unto good men,</hi> like the <hi>Ram</hi> that was brought to <hi>Abraham</hi> when he would have <hi>Sacrificed</hi> his son <hi>Isaak.</hi> When <hi>Christ taught in the Temple, they asked, Hovv knovveth this man the Scriptures, seeing he never learned them?</hi> So it is a wonder what <hi>learning</hi> some men have, that have <hi>no learning!</hi> Like <hi>Prisilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> poor <hi>Tent-makers,</hi> who were able to <hi>school Apollos</hi> that great Clerk, a man <hi>renovvned for</hi> his <hi>learning</hi>: What can we lay to it? For no other reason can be given but as <hi>Christ</hi> said, <hi>Father so it pleaseth thee</hi>: For as <hi>Jacob</hi> said of his <hi>venison,</hi> when his <hi>Father</hi> ask'd how he came by it so <hi>suddenly? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord thy God brought it suddenly to my hands.</hi> So holy and righteous men do more easily understand the words of <hi>God,</hi> than do the wicked, because <hi>God</hi> brings the meaning suddenly to their hearts; as we read, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. That <hi>Christ (standing in the midst of his Apostles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he vvas risen from the dead) opened their understandings, that they might understand clearly the Scriptures, and vvhat vvas vvritten of him in the Lavv of</hi> Moses, <hi>and in the</hi> Prophets, <hi>and in the</hi> Psalms, vers. 44.45. Lo how suddenly their knowledge came unto them! But see what <hi>a general promise</hi> (<hi>God</hi> in the Person of <hi>wisdom</hi>) hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h made <hi>to all that serve him,</hi> Prov. 1. <hi>Turn you at my reproof, and behold</hi> I <hi>will pour out my spirit unto you, and make known my words unto you,</hi> vers. 23. And Psal. 25. <hi>The secrets of the Lord are revealed to them that fear him, and his covenant is to give them understanding,</hi> vers 14. These <hi>secrets</hi> are <hi>hid</hi> from the wicked, neither hath he made any such covenant with them but the contrary: As see, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Unto you it is given to knovv the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to othres in Parrables, that they seeing should not see, and hearing they should not understand,</hi> Luke 8.10: Mark: 3:11: Matth: 13:13:</p>
                     <p>Again, It is not enough to <hi>pray,</hi> except also it be <hi>in Christs name,</hi> and <hi>accrding to his vvill, believing to be heard for his sake,</hi> and that it be the <hi>intercession of Gods ovvn spirit</hi> in you: And (being truly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102698:149"/>
sensible of your <hi>sins</hi> and <hi>wants</hi>) that you chiefly pray for the <hi>pardon of sinne,</hi> the <hi>effusion of grace,</hi> and for the <hi>assistance of Gods Spirit:</hi> that you may more <hi>firmly believe,</hi> more <hi>soundly repent,</hi> more <hi>zealously doe,</hi> more <hi>patiently suffer,</hi> and more <hi>constantly persevere</hi> in the <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of every duty.</p>
                     <p>But above all you must know, that as <hi>Sampsons companions,</hi> could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have found out his <hi>Riddle,</hi> if they had not <hi>plowed with his heifer:</hi> so <hi>no man can know the secrets of God, but by the revelation of his Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. Yea, suppose a man be not inferiour to <hi>Portius,</hi> or <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> who <hi>kept all</hi> things in memory, that ever they had <hi>read, heard,</hi> or <hi>seen:</hi> To <hi>Virgil,</hi> of whom it is reported, that if <hi>all Sciences</hi> were <hi>lost,</hi> they might be <hi>found</hi> again in him: To <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> of whom it was said, that <hi>if Knowledge had put out her candle,</hi> at <hi>his brain</hi> she might <hi>light it</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and that his <hi>head</hi> was <hi>a throne of wisdome:</hi> or <hi>Iosephus Scaliger,</hi> who was <hi>skilled in thirty Languages</hi>: Yet if he want the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> to be his teacher, he is a dunce to the meanest, and most illiterate <hi>believer.</hi> For one excellent, and necessary <hi>prerogative of the spirituall man</hi> is this; he hath <hi>God for his teacher</hi>; he <hi>learns</hi> the <hi>Counsels of God,</hi> of that <hi>spirit</hi> which onely knoweth <hi>Gods counsels, Luk.</hi> 21.15. which is no small pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge: for the <hi>scholar learns quickly,</hi> when the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is his <hi>teacher</hi>; the <hi>Eye sees distinctly,</hi> when the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> doth <hi>enlighten it.</hi> With the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits helpe,</hi> the <hi>meanes</hi> can never be <hi>too weake:</hi> without, never <hi>strong</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.44, 45. <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.23.</p>
                     <p n="51">§ 51. Fourthly, Thou must get <hi>an humble conceit of thine own wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> The <hi>first step to knowledge,</hi> is to know our <hi>own ignorance.</hi> We must <hi>become fools</hi> in our own opinion, before we can be <hi>truly wise,</hi> as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi> sets it down, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. And indeed, the <hi>opinion of our knowing enough,</hi> is one of the greatest <hi>causes of our knowing so little:</hi> For what we presume to have <hi>attained,</hi> we <hi>seeke not</hi> after. Yea, the very <hi>first lesson</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> is <hi>humility. He will teach the humble his way,</hi> Psalm. 25.9. Jam. 4.6. 1 Pet. 5.5. And he that hath not learned the <hi>first lesson,</hi> is not fit to <hi>take out a new. Pride</hi> is a <hi>great let to</hi> true <hi>wisdome</hi>: For <hi>God resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble,</hi> Jam. 4.6. 1 Pet. 5.5. Whence it comes to passe, that few proud wits are reformed, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.39. And for this cause also did <hi>our Saviour</hi> propound his <hi>woes</hi> to the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> his <hi>doctrines</hi> to the <hi>People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>heart</hi> full of <hi>pride,</hi> is like a <hi>vessell</hi> full of <hi>aire:</hi> This <hi>self-opinion</hi> must be <hi>blown out</hi> of us, before <hi>saving knowledge</hi> will be <hi>poured into us. Christ</hi> will <hi>know</hi> none but the <hi>humble,</hi> and none but humble <hi>souls</hi> truly <hi>know Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the way to become humble, is, by taking a serious <hi>view</hi> of <hi>our wants.</hi> The <hi>Peacocks pride</hi> is much abated, when she looks on the <hi>black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of her <hi>legs</hi> and <hi>feet.</hi> Now suppose we know never so much; yet <hi>that</hi> which <hi>we know,</hi> is <hi>far lesse</hi> then that which <hi>we are ignorant of:</hi> and the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102698:150"/>
                        <hi>more we know,</hi> the <hi>more we know we want, Pro.</hi> 1.5, 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.22. And the lesse sensible we are of our <hi>blindness, sicknesse, deformity,</hi> &amp;c. the more <hi>blinde, sick,</hi> and <hi>deformed</hi> we are.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Thou must labour to get a true and lively <hi>faith:</hi> For as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>faith</hi> we cannot <hi>please God:</hi> so without <hi>faith,</hi> no man can <hi>know God.</hi> Faith most cleerly beholds those things which are hid both from the <hi>eye of sense,</hi> and the <hi>eye of reason, Iohn</hi> 12.46. <hi>Vnregenerate men,</hi> that want faith, are like <hi>blinde Sampson</hi> without his <hi>guide:</hi> Or like <hi>Poliphemus,</hi> who never had but <hi>one eye,</hi> and that <hi>Vlysses put out.</hi> For so does the pleasure and custome of sinne blinde the Sensuallist.</p>
                     <p>We must have <hi>mindes</hi> lifted <hi>above nature,</hi> to see and love <hi>things above nature: heavenly wisdome,</hi> to see <hi>heavenly truth</hi>; or else that <hi>truth</hi> which is saving, will be to us <hi>a mystery,</hi> Mark. 4.11. If it seem not <hi>foolishnesse,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7, 8, 14. <hi>To them that are lost, the Gospel is hid,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Believer discerns all things, even the deep things of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10.12.15, 16. Yea, God <hi>Giveth him a mouth and wisdome, where against all his adversaries, shall not be able to speak or resist, Luk.</hi> 21.15. These are the <hi>five steps,</hi> which lead up to the <hi>palace of wisdome,</hi> which all must ascend by, that mean to enter. If you have once attained this precious grace of <hi>saving knowledge,</hi> you will as much as in you lies, <hi>employ the same to the glory of the giver,</hi> And so much to prove, that he is <hi>the wisest</hi> man, whose knowledge lies in <hi>the best</hi> things, (as the <hi>weaker vessel</hi> may hold the <hi>better liquor</hi>) and that if men be never so learned, except they have learned the <hi>Mystery of the Gospel,</hi> and <hi>what it</hi> is to be <hi>borne again</hi> by their own experience, (which few with their great learning do indeed know) they are in <hi>Gods account,</hi> no better then <hi>fooles.</hi> I come now to prove, that the <hi>greatest Politician</hi> is a <hi>verier fool</hi> then the <hi>former.</hi>

they arrant <hi>fools?</hi> I'le give you but one instance mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. and you will need no more. Turn to the place, and there you shall find, that those <hi>blockish Israelites made them a molten Calfe, and then said, This is thy god, that brought thee out of the land of Egypt,</hi> ver. 34. This is such a pregnant example, that there needs no more to prove it; that <hi>a Beast</hi> should be <hi>their god</hi>; yea, and a beast of their own making, and that this beast should have brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which could not <hi>move</hi> it selfe, but as it was moved, and that before it had any being. This is such a blockish absurdity, that as one would think, should never enter into the heart of him, who is endowed with <hi>a reasonable soule.</hi> But what can the <hi>Prince of darknesse</hi> propound? that <hi>a wicked heart,</hi> (blinded with the custome of sinne, and given up by <hi>God,</hi> to be further blinded by <hi>Satan</hi>) will not believe, as appears by our <hi>Ranters, Shakers,</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> at this day.</p>
                     <p>And such other fools are the <hi>Papists,</hi> though <hi>great Clerks,</hi> and <hi>wise men:</hi> who (if I could intend to aquaint you) maintain a thousand ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous tenents, stifly defending those things for <hi>truth,</hi> which the <hi>Holy Ghost calls</hi> in expresse words, <hi>The doctrine of devils,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. And most justly are they <hi>forsaken of their reason, who have abandoned God.</hi> Yea, most just it is, that they who <hi>want grace,</hi> should <hi>want wit</hi> too. If <hi>Idolaters</hi> will needs set up a <hi>false god</hi> for the <hi>true,</hi> is it not equal, that the <hi>true God</hi> should give them over to the <hi>false?</hi> Again,</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, how does <hi>lust blinde</hi> and besot men? when the <hi>Adulterer</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a <hi>filthy strumpet</hi> before his own <hi>chaste wife,</hi> though his own lawfull <hi>Consort</hi> is known to be more comely, and lovely then the <hi>strange woman.</hi> Yea, when they shall confesse the same (as it was the speech of one too great to name) That were she not his <hi>wife,</hi> he could love her above all women in the world; a word able to rot out the tongue that spake it. But take an instance of this nature, I'le give you one amongst many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable. We read, <hi>Iudges</hi> 16. that <hi>Sampson</hi> cared more for his <hi>pleasure</hi> in this kinde, then his <hi>life.</hi> O strange debauchednesse! his filthy <hi>lust</hi> of a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> leaves him scarce a man! He that might not <hi>drink wine,</hi> is <hi>drunk with the cup of fornication.</hi> How could hee other then thinke, if lust had not blinded and bewitched him? She whose body is mercenary to me, will easily sell me to others? she will be <hi>false,</hi> if shee will be an <hi>Harlot.</hi> Was there ever such a motion made to a reasonable man? <hi>Tell me, wherewith thou mayest be bound to do thee hurt?</hi> Who would not have spurned such a sutor out of doors? And when upon the tryal he saw such apparent treachery, he yet wilfully betrays his life, by her to his enemies. All sins, all passions have power to blinde, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate; but lust most of all. Never man that had <hi>dranke flagons of wine,</hi> had lesse reason left him, then this <hi>Nazarite.</hi> Many an one <hi>loses his life,</hi> but he <hi>casts it away</hi>; not in <hi>hatred</hi> to himself, but in <hi>love</hi> to a Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. He knew she aimed at nothing but his slavery, and death, yet had

not power to deny her. He had wit enough to <hi>deceive her</hi> thrice, not enough to keep himself from being <hi>deceived by her.</hi> Thrice had he seen the <hi>Philistims</hi> in her chamber, ready to surprise him upon her bands; and yet will needs be <hi>a slave</hi> to his <hi>Traitor.</hi> Yea, in effect, bids her <hi>bind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what greater folly?

                     </p>
                     <p>Nor is this all, for they run upon <hi>Gods judgements,</hi> as <hi>Balaam</hi> did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>swords point</hi> in the <hi>Angels hand,</hi> and yet are so farre from being afraid, that they applaud their own wisdome, for giving such liberty to their lusts; thinking no men in the world enjoy the like <hi>freedome.</hi> When indeed their <hi>bondage</hi> is much worse then the cruel and tyrannical <hi>bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> and slavery of <hi>Egypt.</hi> For first, that <hi>bondage</hi> was of the <hi>body onely,</hi> but the service of sinne is of the <hi>whole man, body and soul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, in the bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they <hi>served men</hi>; but in this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, <hi>service</hi> is done <hi>to sinne &amp; Satan,</hi> most <hi>vile Lords,</hi> which command most <hi>base,</hi> and <hi>filthy works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in the bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the most harm was <hi>temporall,</hi> losse of <hi>liberty,</hi> smart and <hi>pain of body,</hi> in this service of sinne, the losse is <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> even destruction in <hi>Hell</hi> for ever (without the inifinite goodnesse of God.) Fourthly, in this bondage under <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> they had a sense of their <hi>thraldome,</hi> and desired <hi>liberty</hi>; in this of sin, men do not so much as <hi>suspect</hi> themselves to be bound, but think themselves free, and <hi>des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise liberty.</hi> Lastly, in all outward bondage, they which are bound may possibly help themselves; as by running away, or by intreaty, or by ransome: In this bondage we lie still, as it were, bound hand and foot (till <hi>God</hi> by his mercy deliver us) not having so much as the least thought of relieving our selves. By all which it appears, that such who take the <hi>most liberty</hi> to sin, are the <hi>most perfect slaves</hi> in the world; because
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102698:154"/>
most voluntary slaves: and that <hi>Christs service</hi> is <hi>the onely</hi> true <hi>freedome; his yoke an easie yoke</hi>; his burthen but as the <hi>burthen of wings to a bird</hi>; which makes her <hi>flye</hi> the higher. Wherefore, as we <hi>serve the lawes,</hi> that we may <hi>be free:</hi> so let us <hi>serve Christ,</hi> and we shall be the <hi>freest people</hi> alive.</p>
                     <p>A godly man being demanded, what he thought was the <hi>strangest, and foolishest thing in the world,</hi> answered, <hi>an impenitent sinner,</hi> or <hi>an Vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever:</hi> For, said he, that a man should provoke <hi>God,</hi> so gracious and mighty, that he should believe <hi>Satan</hi> the father of lies and cruelty, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his own death so imminent and in-evitable; obey the command of his Flesh, a Drudge so ignoble, admire the world so fickle and dangerous, prefer it before <hi>Heaven</hi> so blessed &amp; glorious; wilfully cast himself into <hi>hell,</hi> a place so woful and dolorous, and all for vanity, such a wretched emptinesse; that he should <hi>feare the blasts of mens breath,</hi> and not the <hi>fire of Gods wrath</hi>; weep for the losse of <hi>friends,</hi> &amp; not for his <hi>soul:</hi> And lastly, that <hi>Christ</hi> should <hi>stand at the door of his heart,</hi> craving for entrance, that he may remedy all, and make him everlastingly happy; and <hi>God</hi> call him every day, either by his <hi>Word</hi> in the mouthes of his <hi>Messengers,</hi> or by strange <hi>judgements,</hi> or extraordinary <hi>mercies</hi> upon <hi>himselfe,</hi> or <hi>others,</hi> and all in vain Such an one, sayes he, is the <hi>most foolish and degenerate</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alive:</p>
                     <p>Thus I might go on to <hi>Traytors, Murtherers, Back-byters, Seducers, Drunkards, Blasphemers, Persecutors</hi> of the godly, <hi>proud</hi> persons, <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, Thieves, Atheists,</hi> and what other sinners you can name: and prove them <hi>all fools alike.</hi> But I have already (upon one occasion or other) done it in some other Tract.

To imitate the <hi>Common Protestants</hi> in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> time, who laughed the <hi>Martyrs</hi> to scorn, and esteemed them superstitious fools, to lose their lives and fortunes, for matters of Religion, accounting faith, holinesse, immortality of the soul, &amp;c. meer fopperies and illusions.

Mar. 16.23. &amp; 22.29. 1 Cor. 2.8. Isa. 5.20. But I will give you other instances. Was it not an argument that <hi>Haman</hi> was <hi>blinde?</hi> who thought <hi>Mordecaies not bowing the knee to him,</hi> a more hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence, then <hi>his own murthering of thousands?</hi> Were not the <hi>Iews, Scribes</hi> &amp; <hi>Pharisees blind,</hi> who could see more unlawfulness in <hi>the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples plucking a few ears of Corn on the sabbath-day?</hi> and the <hi>Palsie man</hi>'s <hi>carrying his bed</hi>; then in their <hi>own devouring of Widows houses?</hi> who thought they might better <hi>murther Christ,</hi> then others <hi>believe in him?</hi> and be themselves <hi>the greatest of sinners,</hi> then <hi>our Saviour to be in company with sinners?</hi> Was not <hi>Ahab blinde?</hi> who thought <hi>Elijah</hi> more troubled <hi>Israel,</hi> in doing the will of the <hi>Lord,</hi> then himself in <hi>provoking the Lord above all the Kings of Israel</hi> that were before him. And the like in our dayes. Is it not the manner of thousands with us? not only of <hi>Clownes, and ill-bred people, who walk after the flesh, in the lusts of uncleanness</hi> (whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> cals <hi>bruit beasts, led with sensuality, and made to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and destroyed.</hi>) But of <hi>proud wits,</hi> who one would think should have more brains, and know something, to <hi>speak evill of the things which they understand not,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.12.

                     <p>So that it's <hi>no disparagement</hi> to us, seem they never so learned: As what but their ignorance makes them so censure us.

Nor think the worse of our selves, if such shall reproach us never so: The <hi>Corinthians</hi> exceedingly slighted <hi>Paul,</hi> he was this, and he was that; But what says <hi>Paul?

VVe know <hi>little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> will often <hi>laugh at wise men,</hi> when they are about serious and necessary affairs: which notwithstanding is not an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the unworthiness of the things they la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Will the <hi>Merchant</hi> be discouraged because <hi>his wine</hi> pleaseth not a <hi>sicke mans palate?</hi> Much lesse cause have we to be discouraged by their distaste, or dislike of us and our actions, as having more certainty to rely upon; they perhaps have <hi>sense, reason,</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> to rely upon, but we have them with the advantage of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Faith, three infallible witnesses.</hi> Yea, we have great cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, that they revile, and speak evil of us. For this <hi>is</hi> both <hi>a token of perdition to them, and to us of salvation, and that of God,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> phraseth it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.28.</p>
                     <p>True, they may raise any slander upon the best of us, as the <hi>Chief Priests</hi> did upon <hi>our Saviour,</hi> Math. 28.13, 14. and that slander may be believed time out of minde, (as <hi>the Iewes to this day believe that his Disciples stole him out of the Sepulchre</hi>) <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.15. to the hardning of many in their <hi>Atheism,</hi> and <hi>Unbelief</hi>: For what should hinder? When <hi>Naboth</hi> was proved to be <hi>a blasphemer of God,</hi> and <hi>Susanna</hi> a whore upon oath; and the same recorded to posterity; when <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was reported to be <hi>an enemy to the State? Paul a polluter of the Temple? Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a destroyer of the Law?</hi> All <hi>the Disciples deceivers,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe <hi>a wine-bibber, a Sabbath-breaker, a seducer of

the people, a Belzebub,</hi> &amp;c. So we may perhaps under-goe the like, in one kind or other (as the <hi>Devils servants,</hi> want neither <hi>wit</hi> nor <hi>malice</hi> to devise;) But what need it trouble us, so long as it shall <hi>add waight to our Crowns?</hi> For if we any way <hi>suffer for Christ,</hi> be it but <hi>rebuke</hi> for his sake, <hi>happy are we here, and great shall our reward be in heaven, Mat.</hi> 5.11, 12.</p>
                     <p>VVherefore let us <hi>never</hi> be <hi>ashamed of our Masters service,</hi> nor of their censures: No matter what <hi>Iudas</hi> saith touching <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ointment,</hi> so long as <hi>Christ</hi> approves of it. Did <hi>our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ</hi> forbear to <hi>heal on the Sabbath day,</hi> because the <hi>Scribes and Pharisees</hi> took it ill? no, but rather did it the more, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.7 to 12. and <hi>Luke</hi> 13.31, 32. VVhen <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn were charged to speak no more in the name of Iesus</hi>; their answer was, <hi>We cannot but speak that which we have heard and seen,</hi> Acts 4.20. VVhen <hi>Michol</hi> scoft <hi>David, and called him fool for</hi> his <hi>dancing before the Arke</hi>; His answer was, <hi>I will be yet more vile, and more lowly in mine own eyes.</hi> He knew that nothing could be more <hi>heroical,</hi> then this very <hi>abasement.</hi> And it is our very case. Every <hi>scoffing Michol,</hi> (for none else will do it) every <hi>drunken sot,</hi> derides our holy profession: but with <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>gracious,</hi> we shall be had in honour. Yea, our very malicious, and scoffing adversaries shall <hi>honour us, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding us.

And take our <hi>Saviours</hi> counsel; seek to justifie our judgements, to <hi>the children of wisdome, of whom she is justified</hi>; and not to fools, by whom she is daily crucified.

True it is, none can <hi>know</hi> the spiritual <hi>joy</hi> and comfort of a <hi>Christian,</hi> but he that <hi>lives the life of a Christian,</hi> Joh. 7.17. As <hi>none could learn the Virgins Song, but they that sang it,</hi> Rev. 14 3. No man can <hi>know the peace of a good conscience,</hi> but he that <hi>keeps a good conscience</hi>: no man <hi>knows</hi> the <hi>hid Manna,</hi> and <hi>white Stone, with a new name written in it, but they that receive the same,</hi> Rev. 2.17.</p>
                     <p>The world can see a <hi>Christians</hi> outside: but the raptures of his soul, the ravishing delights of the inward man, and joy of his spirit for the remission of his sins, and the infusion of grace, with such like spiritual Priviledges, more glorious than the <hi>States of Kingdoms</hi>; are as a covered messe to men of the world.</p>
                     <p>But I may appeal to any mans conscience, that hath been softned with the unction of grace, and truly tasted <hi>the powers of the world to come</hi>; To him that hath <hi>the love of God shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost</hi>; in whose soul the light of grace shines; whether his whole life be not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> in comparison of his natural condition? Whether he finds not his joy to be <hi>like the joy of harvest?</hi> or <hi>as men rejoyce when they divide a spoil?</hi> Isa. 9.3. Whether he finds not more joy in goodness, than worldlings can do, <hi>when their wheat, wine, and oyl aboundeth?</hi> Psal. 4.7 &amp; 53.17. Yea, he can speak it out of experience, that as in prophane joy, <hi>even in laughter the heart is sorrowfull</hi>: so in godly sorrow, even in weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart is light and cheerfull.

Wherefore no longer continue it, but repent of it, and forsake it, lest <hi>the Lord</hi> should deal by you as he hath threatned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.58, 59. <hi>That if we do not fear and dread his glorious and fearfull Name, the Lord our God, he will make our plagues wonderfull, and of long continuance, and the plagues of our posterity.</hi> Besides, how frequently doest thou pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and prophane Gods Name, and thy Saviours? The Jews grievously sinned in crucifying the Lord of Life but once, and that of ignorance; but the times are innumerable that thou doest it, every day in the year, every hour in the day, although thy Conscience and the Holy Spirit of Grace hath checkt thee for it a thousand and a thousand times. Doest thou expect to have <hi>Christ</hi> thy Redeemer and Advocate, when thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science tells thee that thou hast seldome remembred Him but to blaspheme Him? and more often named Him in thy Oaths and Curses, than in thy Prayers?</p>
                        <p>True, thou takest so little notice of the number of thy Oaths and Curses, that thou wilt not acknowledge thou didst Swear or Curse at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea, though thou beest taken in the manner, and told of it, thou wilt not believe it: But <hi>all</hi> that are <hi>present</hi> can witness the same, and <hi>Satan</hi> also; as also <hi>the searcher of hearts,</hi> who himself will one day be <hi>a swift witness against swearers,</hi> Mal. 3.5. For of all other sinners, <hi>the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his Name in vain,</hi> as the third Commandement tells you, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.7.</p>
                        <p>But wo is me, it fares with common Swearers as with persons desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diseased, whose excrements and filth comes from them at unawares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For as by much labour the hand is so hardened that it hath no sense of labour; so their much swearing causeth such a brawny skin of senslesness to overspread the heart, memory and conscience, that the Swearer sweareth unwittingly; and having sworn, hath no remembrance of his Oath, much less repentance for his sin.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Wherefore I beseech you by the mercies of God</hi> (who hath removed so many evils, and conferred so many good things upon you, that they are beyond thought or imagination) to leave it; especially after this warning, which in case you do not, will be a sore witness, and rise up in judgement against you another day.</p>
                        <p>Or if you regard not your self, nor your own souls good; yet for the <hi>Nations</hi> good, leave your Swearing and Banning: For <hi>the Lord hath a great controversie with the Inhabitants of the Land, because of swearing,</hi> Hos. 4 1, 2.

                        <p>If the matter be light and vain, we must not swear at all; if so weighty, that we may lawfully swear, as before a Magistrate, being called to it, then we must onely use the glorious Name of our God in a holy and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious manner, as you may see, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.23. &amp; 65.16. <hi>Iosh.</hi> 23.7. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.7. And the reasons of it are weighty, if we look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; for in swearing by <hi>Faith, Our Lady, The Light,</hi> or any other creature, you ascribe that unto the said creature, which is onely proper to God, namely to know your heart, and to be a discerner of secret things; Why else should you call that Creature as a witness unto your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that you speak the truth and lye not, which onely belongeth to God? And therefore the Lord calls it a forsaking of him; as mark well what he saith, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.7. <hi>How shall I spare thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods?</hi> And do you make it a small matter to forsake God, and make a God of the creature? Will you believe the Prophet <hi>Amos?</hi> If you will, he saith, (speaking of them that swore by the sin of <hi>Samaria,</hi>) <hi>That they shall fall, and never rise again,</hi> Amos 8.14 A terrible place to vain Swearers.</p>
                        <p>Yea, in swearing by any Creature whatsoever, we do invocate that Creature, and ascribe to it divine worship; a lawfull Oath being a kind of Invocation, and a part of Gods worship: Yea, whatsoever we swear by, that we invocate both as our witness, surety and Judg, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. and by consqeuence deifie it, by ascribing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating unto it Gods incommunicable Attributes, as his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence, and Omnisciency of being every where present, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the secret thoughts and intentions of the heart: and likewise an Omnipotency, as being Almighty in Patronizing, Protecting, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending and Rewarding us for speaking the truth, or punishing us if we speak falsly: all which are so peculiar to God, as that they can no way be communicated or ascribed to another. So that in swearing by any of these things, thou committest an high degree of gross Idolatry, thou spoilest and robbest God of his glory (the most impious kind of these) and in a manner dethronest Him, and placest an Idol in his room.</p>
                        <p>Neither are we to joyn any other with God in our Oaths, for in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we make base Idols, and filthy Creatures, Corrivals in honour, and Competitors in the Throne of Justice with the Lord, who is the Creator of Heaven and earth, and the supream Judg and solo Monarch of all the world.</p>

Secondly, because the retribution of his obedience, may in some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, answer his offence; as was that of <hi>Pauls, who as he had done more evil to the Saints, then all the rest of the Apostles: so he laboured more then they all, in adding to the Church such as should be saved, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>15.10.</hi> Act. <hi>9.16.</hi> Thirdly, for that as exemplary offendors, leave their inventions and evil practises to posterity; whereby they <hi>cease not to sin,</hi> though they <hi>cease to live,</hi> (for when dead they are still tempting, and still sin so long as they cause sin; yea how should not every <hi>Turke</hi> that perisheth by <hi>Mahomets</hi> jugling, add to the pil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Everend Sir, when (by a providence) you heard me <hi>swear and curse</hi>; you gave me a printed Paper to convince me of that <hi>fowle, audacious, provoking,</hi> and yet <hi>unprofitable sin,</hi> and withall intreated me to read three larger <hi>Tracts, viz. A short and sure way to grace and salvation. The hearts Index.</hi> with <hi>A serious and pathetical description of Heaven and Hell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This to me (whom you had never before seen) seemed no less <hi>absurd</hi> then <hi>strange</hi>; and having a darke heart, in stead of great love and thanks, I returned you a most churlish and uncivil answer, and accordingly when I met with my <hi>drunken consorts,</hi> I read it with <hi>no less scorn then ignorance</hi>; but before I had done, it made me tremble! nor could I rest, until I had perused <hi>the other three Books,</hi> which have so represented the very thoughts, secrets, and deceitfulness of my heart unto my conscience: that I could not but say of them, as the <hi>woman of Samaria</hi> once spake of <hi>our Saviour; They have told me all things that ever I did,</hi> John 4.29. Which made me conclude <hi>with that Vnbeliever,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.24.25. That <hi>the hand of God</hi> was

in the contriving of them; Nor could they ever have so done, if they were not of God, as the <hi>young man in the Gospel, reasoned with the Pharisees touching Iesus, when he had opened his eyes, that had been blind from his birth,</hi> John 9.32.33. Which is such a mercy, that no tongue is able to express! for till then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I went on <hi>in the broad way,</hi> and worlds road <hi>to destruction, without any mistrust.</hi> What change they have wrought in me, (with <hi>Gods blessing upon the means</hi>) and how greatly I have longed to see you again, I forbear to mention: Onely this, when I had read them, <hi>in reference to</hi> Levit. 19.17. and in <hi>compassion to their pretious soules,</hi> who are neither <hi>able</hi> nor <hi>willing</hi> to help themselves, I have (and not without some comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table success) taken up your <hi>trade,</hi> in giving the <hi>Papers</hi> and mentioning the <hi>Books</hi> to all that I hear <hi>blaspheme my Maker,</hi> or <hi>belch out their spleen against goodness</hi>: As well considering, that one soule is of more worth then the Indies.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, whose heart would it not make to bleed to see what multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes there are that go blindfold to destruction! and no man offer to stop or check them, before they arrive there, from whence there is no redemption, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.13.14. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.19. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.8. and 13 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.27. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.1 to 4. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.44.</p>
                     <p>And certainly it more then behoves me, (as being my self <hi>snatcht out of the fire,</hi> Jude 23.) to do what I can to draw others of my brethren after me, in imitation of <hi>Andrew,</hi> John 1.41 and Philip v. 45. and <hi>the women of Samaria,</hi> John 4.28 to 41. and <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 22.32. Acts 2.41. &amp; 4.4 &amp;c. 3. and of <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 32.32. and <hi>Paul.</hi> Rom. 9.3. Neither are we of the <hi>communion of Saints,</hi> if we <hi>desire not the salvation of others.</hi> Yea how could I be thankful to my <hi>Redeemer</hi>? that hath <hi>done</hi> and <hi>suffered</hi> so much for me! or in the least <hi>love God</hi> and <hi>my Neighbour</hi>? if I should not thus resolve; as by my sins and <hi>bad example,</hi> I have <hi>drawn others from God</hi>; so now I will all I can, <hi>draw others</hi> with my self <hi>to God</hi>; yea what a shame were it? If I should not be <hi>as faithful a servant to my Saviour? As</hi> I have formerly been <hi>to Sathan. Saul converted,</hi> will <hi>build up</hi> as fast as ever he <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down,</hi> and <hi>preach as zealously, as ever he persecuted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Onely there is <hi>a great rub in the way,</hi> which makes me fear I shall not be able to hold out, for I am so <hi>scoft and scorned</hi> where ever I come, both by <hi>Parents, Friends, and Enemies,</hi> for giving these Papers, that they <hi>make me even weary of my life, as the daughters of Heth did Rebecca.</hi> Gen. 27 46. And yet I dare not leave off, since <hi>our Saviour</hi> saith expressly, <hi>that he will be ashamed of such at the latter day, who are now ashamed for his sake, to bear a few scoffs and reproaches from the World,</hi> Marke 8.38. Nevertheless, I am in <hi>a wonderful strait</hi>! for if I seek to <hi>please God,</hi> and <hi>discharge my conscience, I displease the world,</hi> and that will <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>vex</hi> me; if I seek to <hi>please the world,</hi> I <hi>displease God,</hi> and he will <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> me.</p>
                     <p>Now though the case be plain enough, for <hi>better</hi> it is to <hi>have all the world mine enemies, then my Maker, my Redeemer, and my Conscience,</hi> Acts 5.29.

Neither will he confer the same upon any, but the <hi>stoutest and most valiant</hi>: So even <hi>bearing the Crosse with Christ,</hi> is as great a <hi>preferment</hi> in the <hi>Court of Heaven,</hi> as it is in an <hi>earthly Court,</hi> for the <hi>Prince</hi> to take off his <hi>owne Robe,</hi> and put it on the back of his <hi>servant,</hi> as you may perceive by the <hi>Lords speech to</hi> Paul, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15, 16. &amp; 23.11. And <hi>our Saviours</hi> words to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> Acts 1.8. Yea, sayes Father <hi>Latimer, to suffer for Christ,</hi> is <hi>the greatest priviledge</hi> that <hi>God</hi> gives in this world. And the story of <hi>Iob</hi> is a book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case to prove it. Yea, the same <hi>Iob</hi> professes, <hi>that if his adversary should write a Booke against him, he would esteem it his crowne,</hi> Job 31.35, 36, 37.</p>
                     <p>Whence <hi>Moses esteemed the rebuke of Christ greater riches then all the treasures of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> Heb. 11.26. Whence <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn, when they were beaten and imprisoned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Councell, rejoycing, that they were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for Christs Name,</hi> Acts 5.41. They esteemed it <hi>a grace to be disgraced</hi> for him. And so it hath been accounted by the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>wisest</hi> ever since. They that reproach me, saith St. <hi>Austine,</hi> do against their wills increase my <hi>honour,</hi> both <hi>with God and good men.</hi> And another of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> It is the highest degree of reputation to be <hi>evill spoken of for well doing.</hi> It is no small credit <hi>with the vile,</hi> to have <hi>a vile estimation. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> thought much the better of <hi>Christianity, because</hi> Nero <hi>persecuted it. Calvin</hi> made the reproaches, and evill speeches of his enemies a matter of great joy to him. To be disliked of evill men, sayes <hi>Picus Mirandula,</hi> is to be praysed for goodnesse; their <hi>dispraise</hi> is a mans <hi>honour,</hi> their praise <hi>his dishonour.</hi>

His enemies by <hi>their evill tongues</hi> shall <hi>beget in him a good and holy life.</hi> For happily they shall <hi>bring to his remembrance sins forgotten, wean him from the love of the world, discover whether he be sincere or no, make him humble, exercise and improve his patience, and all his other graces,</hi> and <hi>augment his glory.</hi> Yea, his <hi>patient suffering shall be rewarded here,</hi> as well as <hi>hereafter,</hi> Deut. 23.5. 2 Sam. 16.12.</p>

Or as <hi>Christ</hi> dealt with the <hi>Priests, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> Luke 20. <hi>v.</hi> 1, to 20. The case is this.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 ¶ <hi>God</hi> in great love sent <hi>Sampson</hi> to deliver the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> from the slavish thraldom of their enemies; but they in requital binde him (in whom all their hope of deliverance lay) and deliver him up to those enemies that kept them under; to the end they might <hi>slay him,</hi> and still <hi>make slaves of them, Iudg.</hi> 15. Again after this, <hi>God</hi> sent unto their successors the <hi>Iews, his onely Son</hi>; to the end he might <hi>heal</hi> their <hi>diseases, feed</hi> their <hi>bodies, inlighten</hi> their <hi>mindes,</hi> and <hi>save</hi> their <hi>souls:</hi> And they in requiral of all, hate, revile, scourge and crucifie him; though in killing him, they did their utmost to <hi>split</hi> or <hi>sink</hi> the onely <hi>ship</hi> that could save them.

                     <p>Now tell me what you think of these blockish <hi>Iews:</hi> Were they more <hi>wicked,</hi> or <hi>witless,</hi> or <hi>ingrateful?</hi> I know you will answer me, You <hi>cannot tell</hi>; as the <hi>Priests, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> did <hi>our Saviour,</hi> when the conscience of their own guiltiness had stopt their mouths, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.1, to 8.

For it is your very Case, if you had but eyes, or the wit to see it. I mean all you, who any way misuse, or are ingrateful to your <hi>Ministers</hi>; whom <hi>God</hi> out of his infinite love hath sent to be your <hi>Deliverers</hi> from the grievous slavery and <hi>thraldom</hi> you are in, under <hi>Sin, Satan</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> I know you think your selves <hi>wise men,</hi> and <hi>Christians good enough</hi>; yea, what but your high thoughts and good opinion of your selves, hath brought you to become <hi>scorners of your Teachers</hi> and <hi>Instructors,</hi> and more of their <hi>godly instruction?</hi> As <hi>proud men</hi> are wont to admire their own actions, but to abate the value and derogate from the esteem of others; every whit as basely to <hi>vilifie other mens</hi> doings, as they over-highly <hi>prise their own,</hi> as <hi>Iulian</hi> observes.</p>

And do you, instead of <hi>honoring, respecting</hi> and <hi>rewarding</hi> them, <hi>hate, traduce</hi> and <hi>persecute</hi> them? This is not for want of ignorance: For you shew just as much reason in it, as if those <hi>blinde, deaf, diseased, possessed, distracted</hi> or <hi>dead</hi> persons spoken of in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> should have railed upon <hi>our Saviour</hi> for offering to <hi>cure, restore, dispossess, recover</hi> and <hi>raise</hi> them again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And had not they great reason so to do?

                     </p>
                     <p>But this most plainly shews, that you are so far from knowing the <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>worth of the Word of life,</hi> that you do not know you have <hi>souls</hi>; which makes you as little care for them, as you know them. Otherwise, how could you make such a mighty difference between your <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>souls?</hi> As had any of you but <hi>a leg</hi> or <hi>an arm</hi> putrified and <hi>corrupt,</hi> you would even <hi>give money,</hi> and think your selves <hi>beholding</hi> too, to have them <hi>cut off</hi>; Because it is the onely way and means <hi>to preserve the whole body.</hi> And if so, what love and thanks can be too much, that is exprest to them, who would (would we give them leave) <hi>pluck our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Souls out of Satans clutches,</hi> and bring us to eternal life?

same. And indeed, who ever knew what <hi>Conversion</hi> and <hi>Regeneration</hi> was; who hath <hi>tasted of the powers of the world to come,</hi> and <hi>enjoyed the joy of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and that <hi>peace of conscience which passeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing?</hi> but would rather have their <hi>bodies</hi> want <hi>food,</hi> and the <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> want <hi>light,</hi> then that their <hi>souls</hi> should want that <hi>light</hi> and <hi>spiritual food of the Gospel,</hi> by which they are nourished and do live? For, far better be <hi>unborn,</hi> then <hi>untaught,</hi> as <hi>Alexander</hi> a meer Heathen could say.</p>
                     <p>That this is <hi>the one onely thing necessary,</hi> and which <hi>Believers</hi> prize above all, you may see by what holy <hi>David</hi> says of it, <hi>Ps.</hi> 27.4. &amp; 84.1, to 11. &amp; 119.103. <hi>One thing have I desired, &amp;c. Oh how sweet is thy word unto me, &amp;c.</hi> As turn but to the places, and see how he expresseth himself; for I may but touch upon things. And the like of <hi>wise Solomon Pro.</hi> 8.10. True, to you that are <hi>strangers to,</hi> and utterly <hi>unacquainted with</hi> these <hi>soul-ravishing enjoyments,</hi> these things will appear impossible; as the like did to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> touching <hi>Regeneration, Ioh.</hi> 3.4. and to that <hi>multitude of Iews</hi> touching <hi>Stephens vision,</hi> when he told them how he <hi>saw the heavens opened, and Iesus standing at the right hand of God in glory:</hi> Which they were so far from believing, that it made <hi>their hearts brast</hi> for madness, to <hi>gnash their teeth, stop their ears, cast him out of the city, and stone him to death, Acts</hi> 7.54, to 60. They could not possibly believe, that <hi>he</hi> should <hi>see</hi> what was <hi>hid</hi> to every one of <hi>them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this I can assure you, (even you my friends) beyond all excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; That if ever the <hi>mask of prejudice</hi> be taken from before your sight, or if your <hi>eyes</hi> shall be <hi>opened</hi> before you <hi>drop</hi> into <hi>Hell,</hi> you will have other thoughts of these things, and so of the Publishers of them, and be clean of another minde, yea, you will <hi>loath what you</hi> now <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>love what you</hi> now <hi>loath.</hi> Yea, I dare refer my self in this case to the very <hi>damned in hell:</hi> For what else made <hi>Dives,</hi> being in those <hi>torments,</hi> desire <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>one might be sent unto his brethren from the dead, to give them warning,</hi> and to acquaint them with his success, but the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his judgment? And you, know how that Reprobate <hi>Balaam</hi> wish'd to <hi>die the death of the righteous</hi>; though for the present he <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred</hi> and loved <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>honor</hi> before and <hi>above his soul.</hi> But,</p>
                     <p n="5">5 ¶ Secondly, see <hi>precepts</hi> and <hi>testimonies</hi> to confirm it. Are we not commanded by the <hi>Holy Ghost to have them in singular love, and count them worthy of double honor for their works sake?</hi> 1 Thes. 5.13. 1 Tim. 5.17. Yea, the Apostles words are not only, <hi>Let them that labour in the word and doctrine be accounted worthy of double honor</hi>; but he adds, <hi>He who preacheth the Gospel, should live of the Gospel,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7, to 15. saying also, <hi>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth in all his goods, Gal.</hi> 6.6. Yea, if any man (saith he) does not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and communicate in all his goods, <hi>God is not mocked,</hi> v. 7. So it falls, and I fear it <hi>falls heavy on many</hi> amongst us. Again says the same Apostle, <hi>If we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Again, does he not say, that <hi>our debt and duty</hi> (he terms it not <hi>benevolence</hi>) to our <hi>Spiritual Pastors</hi> is such, as that <hi>we owe unto them even our own selves, Phil.</hi> 19. with a great deal more of the like, that he may meet with mens carnal reasonings in this case, which are not a few, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. All which is <hi>New Testament</hi> too, if obstinacy would permit men to take notice of it.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see how you ought to esteem and reward your <hi>Ministers</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how <hi>Believers</hi> do, and <hi>have done.</hi> Whereas you, (as if you were <hi>Antipathites</hi> to all <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi>) <hi>hate, revile, slight, rob</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute</hi> them.

                     <p>But you will say (for want of acquaintance with the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and your <hi>own hearts</hi>; as every Natural man is as great a stranger to his own heart, as <hi>Hazael</hi> was, who could not be perswaded by the <hi>Prophet</hi> that he should commit such abominable wickedness, as a while after it fell out;) <hi>That you neither hate, nor persecute any one of them.</hi>

                     <p n="4">§ 4. And indeed for want of this fore-wit, the wisest worldlings, as <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the <hi>rich man</hi> in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and all <hi>Atheists,</hi> are in Scripture-language stiled <hi>fools,</hi> and the <hi>wisdome</hi> of the world called <hi>foolishnesse,</hi> twelve times in one Chapter.

                     <p n="5">§ 5. Men of the world believe the things of the world, they believe what they see, and feel, and know; they believe the Lawes of the Land, that there are places and kindes of punishment here below, and that they have bodies to suffer temporal smart, if they transgresse, and this makes them abstain from murther, felonie, and the like; but they believe not things invisible and to come; for if they did, they would as well, yea much more, <hi>fear him that hath power to cast both body and soul into hell,</hi> as they do the <hi>Temporall Magistrate that hath onely power to kill the body</hi>; they would think it <hi>a very hard bargain to win the whole world, and lose their own souls.</hi> But if <hi>visible powers</hi> were not more feared then the <hi>invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God,</hi> and the <hi>Halter</hi> more then <hi>Hell</hi> (natural men being like <hi>beasts,</hi> that are more sensible of the <hi>flash of powder,</hi> then of the <hi>bullet,</hi>) the world would be over-run without rage.

Death as a license to sin, his Crosse as a <hi>Letters Pattent</hi> to do mischief; So turning the grace of <hi>God</hi> into wantonnesse: As if a <hi>condemned person</hi> should head his <hi>Drum</hi> of <hi>Rebellion</hi> with his <hi>Pardon,</hi> resolving therefore to be <hi>evill,</hi> because he is <hi>good:</hi> which is to sin with an high hand, or with a witnesse, and to make themselves uncapable of forgiveneesse.

                     <p n="7">§ 7. The <hi>Devil</hi> makes large promises to his; but ever disappoints them of their hopes, as he did <hi>our first Parents: You shall die</hi> saith God; <hi>You shall not die at all,</hi> saith Satan: Yea, <hi>you shall be as Gods,</hi> saith he, when his drift was to make them <hi>Devils.</hi> Yet the <hi>Devil</hi> was <hi>believed,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> could not be <hi>credited.

                     <p n="8">§ 8. Well may these men think they believe the Gospel, as the Jews (who persecuted <hi>Iesus,</hi> and sought to slay him) thought they believed <hi>Moses writings, Ioh.</hi> 5.38, 39, 46, 47. But it's altogether impossible, as <hi>Christ</hi> (who knew their hearts better then themselves) affirmes of them: for certainly they would never speak as they speak, think as they think, do as they do; if they thought their thoughts, words, and deeds should ever come to judgement.</p>
                     <p>Did men believe, that <hi>neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Swearers, nor Railers, nor the Fearfull, nor Vnbelieving, nor Murtherers, nor Sorcerers, nor Liars, nor no unrighteous persons, shall inherit the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> (as the Scripture expresly speaks,) <hi>but shall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, which is the second death:</hi> They durst not continue in the practice of these sins, without fear, or remorse or care of amendment. As for instance, If <hi>Lots sons</hi>-in-Law had believed their <hi>Father,</hi> when he told them from <hi>God</hi> that the <hi>City</hi> should suddenly be destroyed with <hi>fire</hi> &amp; <hi>brimstone,</hi> and that by flying they might escape it, they would have obeyed his counsel.

For will a <hi>Leper</hi> take pleasure, in the searching of his <hi>sores</hi>; and <hi>Satan</hi> the like: for if they could clearly see, the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse of their impieties: it were not possible not to <hi>abbor them</hi>; not

thoughts, words, and actions; had I not already done it. But because I would not present my other <hi>Readers,</hi> with <hi>Cole-worts</hi> twice sod: be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to take view of them, in my other small Tract, entituled, <hi>The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, despicable, and dreadful condition of a Drunkard, drawn to the Life:</hi> though indeed, even a tithe of these are sufficient evidences, to prove thee one of those ignorant, unbelieving, ingrateful, and notorious wicked wretches before spoken of: and to make thee confess that thou art in a most damnable condition. But stand thou by, and let the <hi>Civil Iusticiary,</hi> and <hi>formal Hypocrite</hi> hold up their hands, and hear their Charge.</p>
                     <p>And so much for the first <hi>Division</hi> allotted for such as are notoriously wicked. For though I determined to have made of all but one Volume; yet now new thoughts have taken place, and caused me to melt the whole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and cast it into several <hi>Divisions:</hi> whereby being <hi>sold single,</hi> every man may have his proper portion apart. My reasons are these, &amp; the like.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 It is because many (be they never so short-breath'd, in well doing) will read a few leaves: that will not once look upon a large Volume.</item>
                        <item>2 Divers will be at the cost of a few pence, that would rather perish then lay out a pound.</item>
                        <item>3 Some, as they have but little money; so they have less time to spare, (as they use the matter) for the good of their souls.</item>
                        <item>4 Admonitions, and instructions if they exceed: are wont as <hi>nails,</hi> to drive out one another.</item>
                        <item>5 Should the <hi>Civil Iusticiary</hi> read the <hi>prophane mans Character</hi>; or the <hi>open-handed Prodigal,</hi> the <hi>close-fisted,</hi> and <hi>griping Oppressors:</hi> this would rather encourage, and strengthen them in their wickedness, then fright them from it.</item>
                        <item>6 Some have such <hi>queasie stomacks,</hi> that if they see their <hi>potion big,</hi> as well as <hi>bitter</hi>; they will choose to die, rather then take it.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>And because I have found by ample experience, that many have a minde to read good <hi>Books</hi> yea, a zeal (such as it is) to reclaim others from evil, so it may cost them nothing: who otherwise have no stomack to either. (For when the like was to be given about, <hi>swearing and cursing:</hi> even the better sort of men and women could fetch them by a thousand a week from all parts of the Kingdome. But since they have (for some reasons) been sold, for eight a penny: not one of an hundred could finde in their hearts to give that peny, were it to save eight of their friends souls: which shews both how they <hi>love money</hi>; and what <hi>hollow-hearted</hi> devotion they have. The <hi>Lord</hi> discover the same unto them.) There is (over against the High Constables short of <hi>Shoreditch</hi> Church) of this first part, or division to be given freely, together with the <hi>cure of cursing and swearing:</hi> provided, they that desire them can <hi>read very well:</hi> for otherwise they will so <hi>nick-name</hi> words, and make it such <hi>non-sense,</hi> that one would rather his lines should never be read, then so brokenly.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102698:220"/>
And I could wish that men would not fetch them for <hi>base ends,</hi> as one did formerly fetch many hundreds of that against <hi>Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Cursing:</hi> onely to save the buying of waste Paper (though he had many fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of sending them to <hi>Graves-end, Canterbury, Dover,</hi> and all other places, where <hi>Sea-men</hi> resorted:) which being found out, made the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> with-draw his gift until now.</p>
                     <p>It was, I think, a most wicked act, for which he deserves to be <hi>stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> and made an example to others. And let men take heed of abusing things <hi>Dedicated</hi> to holy uses; for they are the sharpest kinde of <hi>edged tools,</hi> and therefore are not to be jefted with: Neither will <hi>God so be mocked.</hi>

                     <p>But for all that, a wise man will not be scoft out of his Money, nor a just man flowted out of his Faith. The taunts of an <hi>Ishmael</hi> shall never make an <hi>Isaac</hi> out of love with his <hi>inheritance.</hi> Yea for a man to be scoft out of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by those which are lewd, is all one, as if a man that seeth should blindfold himself, or put out his eyes, because some blinde wretches rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or as if one that is found of limbs, should limp or maim himself to please the criple, and avoid his taunts; And know this, That if the <hi>barking</hi> of these <hi>currs,</hi> shall hinder us from walking on our way to <hi>Heaven,</hi> it is a sign we are most impotent cowards: Yea if our love be so cold to <hi>Christ,</hi> that we are ashamed for his sake, to bear a few scoffs and reproaches from the world, it is evident we are but counterfeits, such as <hi>Christ will be ashamed of before his Father and his holy Angels at the latter day,</hi> Mark. 8 38. For, for the comfort of all that are single and honest-hearted, notwithstanding all the scoffs and scorns of <hi>Atheists</hi> and careless worldlings, all their perswasions and persecutions, they shall both lose their labours, and themselves too in the end.

                        <hi>Minister.</hi> By well observing what the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in this case hold forth for the encouragement of all that thus suffer. I will commend to your serious consideration only six things, and I pray minde them well; for <hi>Virgil</hi> most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently and profundly, couples the <hi>knowledge of cause,</hi> and the <hi>conquest of all fears</hi> together.</p>
                     <p>First observe, that grievous temptations and persecutions, do always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the remission of sins. That all men, as <hi>Austin</hi> speaks, are necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to miseries, who bend their course towards the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can <hi>Gods love</hi> be enjoyed without <hi>Satans</hi> disturbance. Yea the <hi>world</hi> and the <hi>devill</hi> therefore <hi>hate us, because God hath chosen us.</hi> If a convert comes home, the <hi>Angels</hi> welcome him with songs, the <hi>devils</hi> follow him with uprore and fury, his old acquaintance with scorns and obloquie, as you suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently finde. Godly men are thorns in wicked mens eyes, as <hi>Iob</hi> was in the <hi>devils,</hi> because they are good, or for that they are dearly beloved of <hi>God.</hi> If a mans person and ways please <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>world</hi> will be displeased with both: whence we are so often foretold and forewarned of it, that we may be the better forearmed and prepared to entertain it: <hi>All that will love godly in Christ Iesus, shall suffer persecution,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.12. <hi>Ye shall be hated of all men and nations for my Names sake,</hi> Matth. 10.22. and 24.9. <hi>Behold I send you forth, as sheep in the midst of wolves,</hi> Matth. 10.16. and many the like.

                     <p>THirdly, No hope it should be otherwise, since God from the beginning of the Creation, hath proclaimed a War, enmity and strife, between the wicked and the godly: Did you never read that Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. where <hi>God</hi> himself saith to the <hi>Serpent, I will put enmity between thee and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and between thy seed and her seed; he,</hi> or it, <hi>shall bruise thine head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</hi> Where by the <hi>serpentts seed</hi> are meant the whole generation of wicked men; and by the <hi>womans seed, Christ</hi> and all his <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> as all Interpreters conclude, and other Scriptures make cleer, where <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men</hi> are called <hi>serpents, a generation of vipers,</hi> and <hi>children of the Devil,</hi> Matth. 23.33.

                     <p>For proof whereof I could produce testimonies and examples innumerable, there being scarce a page in the Bible, which doth not express or imply some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what touching this enmity.

                     <p>First, to begin with the <hi>first Age,</hi> viz. the <hi>old World</hi> before the flood. We read of this mortal enmity and strife between <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> 1 John 3.12. Secondly, after the Flood, before the Law between <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> first in the womb, the more plainly to shadow out this enmity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.22, 23. and after they were born, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.41. Thirdly, <hi>After the Law,</hi> before <hi>Christ,</hi> between <hi>Doeg</hi> and the 85. Priests which he <hi>slew with the edge of the sword,</hi> 1 Sam. 22.18, 19. Fourthly, Since the <hi>Gospel,</hi> in the time of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi>; this enmity so manifested it self not only in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but in the <hi>Iews,</hi> Gods own people, who first raised those persecutions against Christ and his members; that having beheaded <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> his harbinger, and crucified himself the <hi>Lord of life</hi>: We read that of all the twelve, none died a natural death save only S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and he also was banished by <hi>Domitian</hi> to <hi>Patmos,</hi> and at another time thrust into a <hi>Tun of seething oyl</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> and S. <hi>Hierome</hi> do report: See <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51, to 60. and 12. 1. to 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36. <hi>Iohn</hi> 21.18, 19. Fifthly, After the <hi>Apostles,</hi> if we consider the residue of the <hi>ten Persecutions</hi> raised by the <hi>Romans</hi> against the <hi>Christians,</hi> which was for three hundred years till the coming of godly <hi>Constantine,</hi> we finde that under <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> seventeen thousand <hi>Christians,</hi> were slain in one moneth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom was <hi>Serena</hi> the Empress also.

Thirdly, To rejoyce at their supposed evill estate, as the <hi>Princes of the Philistins</hi> did at <hi>Sampsons blindness and bondage,</hi> Judg. 16.25. Fourthly, To hate them, as all carnal men hate the <hi>members of Christ,</hi> Matth. 10.22.

                     <p>Thou that art <hi>Openly profane</hi>; dost so manifestly prove, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess thy self to be one of those ignorant, <hi>unbelieving, ingrateful,</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi> wretches herein concern'd: yea, to be one of the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>disobedience whom</hi> Satan hath <hi>blinded</hi>: that in respect of others, I should think it needlesse to spend time in further proof thereof: yet I would gladly say something to shame thee out of thy self: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore briefly thus: Thou art <hi>kept by the Devil in a snare, and taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of him at his will: he ruleth, and worketh his pleasure in thee,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>thy</hi> God <hi>and father,</hi> and <hi>Prince, and Master,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.26, Joh. 8.44. and 14.30. 2 Cor. 4.4. Thy odious qualities are these and the like: thou doest banish all <hi>civility,</hi> and give thy self over to <hi>sensuality</hi>: and art neither afraid nor ashamed; to let thy wickedest thoughts break forth into actions. Yea, thou thinkest thy self the honester man for it: and boastest thou art none of those dissembling Hypocrites that seem to be what they are not. Thou art a common <hi>Drunkard</hi>: in stead of quenching thy thirst, thou drownest thy senses.</p>

Yea, who more needy, and who run more in debt than those, that have hundreds and thousands a year? whereas others that have very little, but small means, and yet maintain themselves and their families well, yea, and help their poor friends and neighbours also.

                     <p>FIrst, How many are there, that by an intolerable <hi>care,</hi> and <hi>pains,</hi> and <hi>greif,</hi> and <hi>sting of conscience,</hi> and <hi>losse of credit,</hi> and undergoing many <hi>perils,</hi> get great estates, and when they have obtained all that heart can wish, by a just judgement of <hi>God,</hi> they have not power to partake of what they have, or be a farthing the better for all. As observe but what wise <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks <hi>Eccles.</hi> 6. <hi>There is an evill which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men, a man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth; yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof,</hi> ver. 1, 2. And again, <hi>There is one alone, and there is not a second, yea, he hath neither child nor brother, yet is there no end of all his labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches, neither saith he, for whom do I labour and bereave my soul of good: this is also vanity, yea, this is a sore travell,</hi> Eccles. 4.8.</p>
                     <p>Yea, how many such could I nominate, that are <hi>baser</hi> by being <hi>wealthier,</hi> that are no other than <hi>rich beggers,</hi> or <hi>beggers in the midst of their riches</hi> (as <hi>Cain</hi> was a vagabond upon his own land) upon whose estates there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>It is <hi>the misers curse,</hi> want in the midst of abundance, hunger in the midst of plenty, he <hi>freezes by the fires side,</hi> and is like an <hi>unhappy boy,</hi> that hath a <hi>great trusse ef points to play with,</hi> and but <hi>one at his breeches</hi> to tye them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or rather he resembles <hi>a dog in a wheel,</hi> that toyles all day to <hi>rost meat for others eating,</hi> as the <hi>wise man</hi> shews, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 6.1.2.</p>
                     <p>The covetous Miser <hi>covets without end,</hi> but all <hi>to no end</hi>; he onely <hi>feeds his eyes with that which should feed his belly,</hi> and cloth his back. Like him that <hi>Horace</hi> tells of in <hi>Room,</hi> called <hi>Oxide,</hi> who was so rich, that he might measure his gold by the bushell, and yet went almost stark naked, and never would fill himself half full of meat. They are like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> who stands up to the chin in water, and hath all kinds of fruits hanging over his head, but is not suffered to tast of the one, nor drink of the other: Or like an <hi>Asse,</hi> that is <hi>laden with gold,</hi> or dainty cates, but <hi>feeds upon thistles</hi>: Or like the <hi>Indians,</hi> who though they have all the <hi>gold</hi> amongst them, yet are the <hi>most beggerly</hi> and naked people alive.</p>
                     <p>For as if they were such <hi>fooles,</hi> as not to know that their money will buy them all necessaries of meat, drink, apparel, and the like, they scarce wear a good garment, or eat a liberal meal, or take a quiet sleep, but are ever tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting themselves to get that, for getting whereof they shall be tormente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. Like a true <hi>Chymist,</hi> he <hi>turnes every thing into gold,</hi> both <hi>what he should eat,</hi> and what he should wear. He is like <hi>a man rob'd, hurt</hi> and <hi>bound,</hi> who though he hath meanes to relieve himself, yet hath not liberty to go where he may be releived.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>a proud man</hi> is <hi>ignorant in the midst of his knowledge,</hi> so is the <hi>covetous man poor,</hi> and needy, <hi>in the midst of his wealth</hi>: Yea, <hi>a poor beggar</hi> is in <hi>better</hi> estate than <hi>a rich miser,</hi> for whereas the poor begger <hi>wants many things,</hi> the rich miser <hi>wants every thing.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Riches,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca,</hi> are the <hi>wise mans servant,</hi> but the <hi>fooles master</hi>: and the miser makes himself a slave to his servant. Riches are good when the party that possesseth them can tell how to use them; but as <hi>instruments</hi> are of no use unto them that are ignorant of <hi>musick,</hi> so are riches of no use to the covetous. So that in my judgement, that <hi>rich fool</hi> in the <hi>Gospel</hi> was far wiser than these blocks, for he having attained his purpose, got a great estate, could after all afford himself the comfort of it; for these are his words to himself, <hi>Thou hast much goods laid up for many yeares, live at ease, eat, drink and take thy pastime,</hi> Luke 12.19.</p>
                     <p>Nay, to abound with all things, and to be never the better for them, not to partake of them, what <hi>fool or mad man</hi> hath been known so senseless? yea, not to flatter his pretended prudence, no beast will <hi>starve in a fat pasture</hi>; if then a man shall pinch his guts when <hi>God</hi> hath afforded him affluence; the <hi>Asse is not so very an Asse</hi> as he. Nor do I know any beast like him, save <hi>Pharaohs seven lean and evill favoured kine,</hi> and to them he is very like: For when his large and greedy conscience hath devoured or eaten up many Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomers or Clients estates, as they did the <hi>seven fat and well favoured kine,</hi> yet it cannot be known by any reall amen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ment, that he hath eaten them, but in his food, raiment, satisfaction of his mind, &amp;c. he is as ill favoured as at the beginning. He doth not more lock up his goods from the <hi>

                           </gap>heif</hi> than from <hi>himself</hi>: So that I cannot more fitly compare him to any thing, than to an <hi>Idoll,</hi> for as an <hi>Idoll</hi> hath <hi>eyes but sees not,</hi> so he hath <hi>a reasonable soul, but understands not</hi> And most just it is, that he who is <hi>unjust to all others,</hi> should be <hi>most unjust to himself.</hi> And as a covetous man is good to no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, so he is worst of all to himself.</p>
                     <p>It is the depth of misery to fall under the <hi>curse of Cham, a servant of servants, divitis servi, maxime servi,</hi> no thraldom to the inward and outward bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage too. So that if there be any creature miserable, it is the miserable miserly muck-worm; and yet he is least to be pitied, because he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thus miserable.</p>
                     <p>Now this may move wonder to astonishment! that they should take such care and paines, and cast away their soules to heap up riches, and when they have done, to be never a penny the better for them. Yea, what can any wise man think of them, are they not <hi>stark mad</hi>? are they not <hi>fooles in folio?</hi> What, take so much <hi>care</hi> and <hi>paines,</hi> indure so much <hi>greif, sting of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, losse of credit, deprive themselves of heaven, damn their own soules,</hi> to get wealth, and when they have got it, not to be the better for it: yea, they are lesse satisfied and contented than before, meanlier accommodated than
<pb facs="tcp:102698:248"/>
mean men; and could this possible be so, if <hi>God</hi> did not give them their riches in wrath? nor would be otherwise deny them the use of their own; for the <hi>wise man</hi> hath given it as a rule, That <hi>to whom God hath given riches as a blessing, he also giveth him to eat, and drink, and to take pleasure, and delight his soul with the profit of his labours, wherein he travelleth under the sun</hi>: for which see <hi>Ecces.</hi> 2.24. and 3.12, 13. and 5.17, 18, 19. and 8.15. And so you have one particular to prove what I promised. But</p>

The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants <hi>desires</hi> are rather <hi>sharpened by injoying,</hi> and <hi>augmented by posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>

                     <p>To shew that covetous men belong to <hi>hell after they dye,</hi> they are <hi>like hell while they live: Hell is never filled,</hi> and <hi>they are never satisfied,</hi> covetous men <hi>drink brine,</hi> which increaseth <hi>thirst</hi> rather than quenches it.

                        </gap>en granted in the first, he would have required more, and then more to that, never ceasing to ask, never having enough, nor being the better when he had it: so it fares with the covetous man, his <hi>abundance</hi> no more <hi>quencheth</hi> his <hi>lust,</hi> than <hi>fuell does the flame.</hi> For as <hi>oyle kindleth the fire,</hi> which it seemes to quench, so riches come as though they would make him contented, but they make him more covetous. And is not this thy very case that art covetous? No man more happy, in respect of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, then thy self, couldest thou but see it; thou hast all things that heart can wish, and shouldest thou but come to want what thou now injoyest, and thinkest not worth thanks; when it were past thou wouldest say, thou wast most happy, and after a little misse, wish withall thine heart, thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the same again: yea, a world for such a condition and content withall Onely the <hi>devill</hi> (by <hi>Gods</hi> just permission) bewitches thee to think, that thou hast not enough, when thou hast too much, and more than thou needest, or knowest what to do withall.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it possible for a worldling to be contented: for whereas <hi>naturall desires</hi> are <hi>soon satisfied,</hi> those that are <hi>unnaturall are infinite.

                     <p>Men in this case, are like <hi>poysoned Rats,</hi> which when they have <hi>tasted</hi> of their <hi>bane,</hi> cannot rest untill they <hi>drink,</hi> and then can much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A moderate water</hi> makes the <hi>Mill goe</hi> merrily, but <hi>too much</hi> will not suffer it to go at all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, another reason is, Nothing can <hi>fill the heart</hi> of man, but he that <hi>made it:</hi> The heart shall be satisfied <hi>with gold,</hi> when the body shall be contented <hi>with winde.</hi> The whole <hi>world is circular,</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> of man is <hi>triangular</hi>; and we know a <hi>circle</hi> cannot fill a <hi>triangle.</hi> Yea if it be not <hi>filled</hi> with the <hi>three persons in Trinity,</hi> it will be <hi>filled with the world,</hi> the <hi>flesh,</hi> and the <hi>devil.</hi> The heart is the seat or receptacle of <hi>spiritual</hi> things; and the things of the world are <hi>corporal</hi> and carnal: Now carnal and corporal things, can no more fill our <hi>hearts,</hi> then spiritual things can fill our <hi>Coffers. Visible light</hi> will not cleer the <hi>invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble understanding</hi>; nor will corporal food feed the soul. <hi>Blessed are they, sayes our Saviour, who thirst after righteousness, for they shall be satisfied,</hi> Mat. 5.6. not they that thirst after riches, or honor, or pleasure; for instead of being satisfied, they thirst more. Yea these <hi>Mammonists</hi> are so <hi>infinite in desiring,</hi> that could such a one swallow the <hi>whole earth</hi> that swallows all, and will swallow him ere long, it might choak him, but not satisfie him, as abundance of examples that I could give you, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prove: namely <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Crassus,</hi> and <hi>Lie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>SIxthly, another sore judgement which God inflicts upon the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless mnckworm, for his monstrous unthankfulness, is, he injoyes not a merry day, no not a pleasant hour in seven yeers, ye if you observe it, he resembles <hi>Agelaustus,</hi> Grandfather to <hi>Crassus,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laughed in all his life, save once when he saw <hi>a mare eating of thistles</hi>: or rather <hi>Anaxagoras Clazoenius,</hi> who was never seen to laugh or smile from the day of his birth. Joyes never so much as look in at the door of his heart; <hi>worldly delights</hi> to him, are but like <hi>delicate meates</hi> to him that hath <hi>lost his tast.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But O the <hi>cares, fears, anxieties, sighs, sorrows, suspitions, sad thoughts, restless desires,</hi> the <hi>horrors, troubles, tortures, torments, vexations, distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, griefs, girdes, gripes, grudgings, repinings, doubts, dolors, despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that are the ordinary companions of the covetous. How is he hurried with <hi>desires</hi> to get, distracted with getting, vexed for what he cannot get, tortured for what he loseth, or another gaineth, troubled with fear of losing what he hath already gained? yea his labor to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riches is <hi>restless,</hi> his care to keep them <hi>boundless,</hi> his <hi>sorrow</hi> if he chance to lose them <hi>endless,</hi> and his fear lest he should hereafter lack <hi>cureless.</hi>

                     <p>Of all <hi>plagues</hi> sent into <hi>Egypt,</hi> that of the <hi>Flies</hi> was one of the most troublesome, for they <hi>never suffered men to rest,</hi> for the more they were beaten off, the more they came upon them: so of all miseries and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations that <hi>God</hi> layes upon worldlings; this is not the least, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vexed and tormented with cares, which they neither can (nor indeed would) beat off by any means they are able to devise; for they rush in upon them in the <hi>morning</hi> so soon as they <hi>awake,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them in the <hi>day,</hi> forsake them not at <hi>night,</hi> they follow them to <hi>bed,</hi> and will not suffer them to <hi>sleep</hi>: their thonghts will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to sleep, nor their sleep permit them to <hi>rest.</hi> They afflict them in their <hi>dreams,</hi> as giving them no quiet either by day, or night, as <hi>God</hi> threatneth to wicked men by the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> Jer. 6. I could give you a large bill of particulars; but fear of cloying is alwayes at hand to curb me: wherefore take these few for a taste. Want does not break so many sleeps for provision the next day, as <hi>abundance</hi> does for increase. His <hi>nights</hi> are as troublesome and uniquiet as his <hi>dayes</hi>; and his <hi>dayes</hi> as the <hi>dayes of Babylons downfall.</hi> Never is more <hi>watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> then where is most purpose of wickedness: see <hi>Micha</hi> 2.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.4. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.12.

Or like <hi>Dinarcus Phidon,</hi> who at a certain loss, cut his own throat, to save the charge of a cord. At least he feels more <hi>sorrow in losing</hi> his mony, then ever he found <hi>pleasure in getting it</hi>: nor will any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition content him; for the <hi>lightness of his purse,</hi> gives him an <hi>heavy heart,</hi> which yet filled, doth fill him with more care. His <hi>medicin</hi> is his <hi>malady.</hi> These rich men, are no less troubled with that they possess (lest they should lose it) then poor men are for that they want. In the day time, he dares not go abroad for fear of robbing; nor stay at home for fear of killing. His thoughts are so troubled with <hi>fear of thieves,</hi> that he cannot, that he dares not <hi>sleep</hi>: yea he fears a <hi>thief</hi> worse then the <hi>devil,</hi> therefore will he be <hi>beholding to the devil</hi> for a <hi>spell</hi> to save him from the <hi>thief</hi>; which once obtained, a little <hi>Opium</hi> may <hi>rock his cares asleep,</hi> and help him to a golden dream; for all his minde and heart is to get mony; if waking, he <hi>talks</hi> of nothing but earth, if <hi>sleeping,</hi> he dreams of it. Lastly, as if all his delight were to vex himself, he pines himself away with distrustful fear of want, and projecting how he shall live hereafter, and when he is old: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling <hi>Ventidius</hi> the <hi>Poet,</hi> who would not be perswaded but he should dye a begger.

                     <p>SEventhly, To the former miseries which a cruel Miser is justly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued withall, this may be added; the <hi>dolefulness of his conscience</hi>; for the sin of <hi>oppression</hi> lyes upon the soul <hi>as heavy as lead</hi>; yea as the <hi>shaddow</hi> does ever follow the <hi>body,</hi> so fear and desperation in all places, and at all times, do wait upon an <hi>evil conscience.</hi> Sin armes a man against himself, &amp; our peace ever ends with our innocency. A <hi>Pithagorean</hi> bought a pair of shoos upon trust, the <hi>Shoomaker</hi> dyes, he is glad, thinks them gained, but a while after his conscience twitches him, and becomes a continual chider; he hereupon repairs to the house of the dead, casts in his money with these words, There take thy due, thou <hi>livest to me,</hi> though <hi>dead to all beside. Micha</hi> stole from his mother <hi>eleven hundred
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102698:251"/>
shekels of silver,</hi> but his complaining <hi>conscience</hi> made him to accuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and <hi>restore</hi> it again, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17. <hi>Il gotten goods</hi> lye upon the <hi>conscience,</hi> as <hi>raw meat upon a sick stomack,</hi> which will never let a man be well, or at ease, untill he hath <hi>cast it up again</hi> by restitution.</p>
                     <p>Means ill gotten, is to the getter, as the <hi>Angels book</hi> was to Saint <hi>Iohn, When he eat it, it was in his mouth as sweet as hony, but when he had eaten it, it became in his stomack as bitter as gall,</hi> Rev. 10.10. The which is notably illustrated <hi>Iob</hi> 20.12. to 20. which together with the whole Chapter, is marvellous good for cruel and unmerciful men to read; for I may not stand here to repeat it. <hi>Sweetness</hi> is <hi>promised</hi> in the <hi>bread of deceit,</hi> but men finde it as <hi>gravel, crashing between their teeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor will his troubled conscience suffer him to steal a sound sleep: yea he sleeps as unquietly, as it his <hi>pillow</hi> were <hi>stuft with Lawyers per-knives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I may give ye a hint of these things from the word, but onely <hi>God</hi> and he can tell, how the remembrance of his forepast cozenages and oppression, occasions his guilty conscience many secret wrings and pinches, and gives his heart many a sore lash, to increase the fear and horror of his soul every time he calls the same to remembrance, which is not seldom: As, O <hi>poor wretches</hi>! what do they indure? how are they immerged in the horrors of a vulned conscience? there is more <hi>ease</hi> in a <hi>nest of Hornets,</hi> then under the sting of such a <hi>tormenting conscience.</hi> He that hath this plague, is like <hi>a man in debt,</hi> who suspecteth that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>bush</hi> he sees, is a <hi>Sergant</hi> to <hi>arest and carry him away to prison.</hi> It was <hi>Gods</hi> curse upon <hi>Cain,</hi> when he had slain his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> to suspect and fear, <hi>that every one he met would kill him:</hi> yea it makes him so afraid of every thing, that a very <hi>Maulking frights him,</hi> and it is much, that he dares trust his <hi>Barber to shave him. Dionysius</hi> was so troubled with fear and horror of conscience, that not daring to trust his best friends with a <hi>razor,</hi> he used to <hi>findge his beard with burning coals,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. He is much like a <hi>Malefactor in prison,</hi> who though he fare well, yet is tormented with the thought of ensuing judgement. It is the <hi>hand-writing on the wall,</hi> that prints bloody characters in <hi>Belshazzars heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that if any should deem a man <hi>the better,</hi> or happier, for being the <hi>richer,</hi> he is very shallow; as many looking on the outer face of things, or see but the one side (as they used to paint <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that they might conceal his deformity on the other side) see not how they smart in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, how their consciences gripe them. Nor does any one know, how the <hi>shoowrings the foot,</hi> but he that wears the same.</p>
                     <p>Or admit the best that can come, as suppose they <hi>can stop consciences mouth</hi> for a time, or <hi>with the musick of their mony play it asleep</hi> for the present; yet when they lye upon their death-beds, it will sting them to the quick. For when <hi>death besiegeth the body, Satan</hi> will not fail to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagure the soul</hi>; yea then he will be sure to lay on load; for as <hi>all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102698:251"/>
humors, run to the diseased and bruised part of the body</hi>; so when conscience is once awakened, all former sins, and present crosses joyn together to make the bruise or sore more <hi>painful.</hi> As every <hi>Creditor</hi> falls upon the poor man, when he is once <hi>arested.</hi> Or let it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that his con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>This is part of <hi>sins wages,</hi> and <hi>Satans reward: We have sinned, therefore our hearts are heavy,</hi> Isa. 59.11, 12. <hi>The sorrows of them that offer to another God</hi> (as do the covetous) <hi>shall be multiplyed says holy David,</hi> Psal. 16.4. Yea <hi>Seneca</hi> an <hi>heathen</hi> could say, that an evil life causeth an unquiet minde; so that <hi>Satans</hi> government, is rather a bondage then a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, unto which <hi>Christ</hi> giveth up those that shake off his own.</p>
                     <p>What his government is, you may partly guess at by the servile sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries he puts his subjects upon. As O the many <hi>hard services</hi> which <hi>Satan</hi> puts his servants upon, and what a <hi>bad Master</hi> is he: when we read that <hi>Origen</hi> at his onely appointment, made himself an <hi>Eunuch.

Wicked men <hi>think they do God good service in putting his children to death</hi>: but where do we finde any Religious <hi>Israelite,</hi> or servant of <hi>God,</hi> at such cost? or when did <hi>God</hi> require this of his servants? The <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> never <hi>whipt</hi> nor <hi>lanced</hi> themselves, but <hi>Baals Priests</hi> did this and more. And so of the <hi>Papists,</hi> those <hi>hypocrites</hi> of late yeers, and the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old. How many sleepless nights, and restless dayes, and wretched shifts, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and bloody plots and practises, does covetousness and ambition cost men? which the humble and contented <hi>Christian</hi> is unacquainted with. How does the covetous mans <hi>heart droop wish his Mammon</hi>? How does he turmoile and vex his spirit, torment his conscience, and make himself a very <hi>map of misery,</hi> and a <hi>sink of calamity</hi>? it is nothing so with Christs servants.</p>

                     <p>I Have much more to enlarge of the miseries of unmerciful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull Misers, but before I speak of them, I will give you the <hi>reasons</hi> and <hi>uses</hi> of these already dispatcht, wherein I will be as brief as may be.</p>
                     <p>You see that God may give men <hi>riches in wrath</hi>; and so as they shall
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102698:252"/>
be never the better for them, but the worse. Now that you may not think it any strange thing, observe the reasons why, and how justly they are so served.</p>
                     <p>The first Reason is, the unmerciful Misers monstrous unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for those millions of mercies he hath received from God (of which I shall give you an account in the second part) this causes God either not at all to give him, or in giving him riches, to add this you have heard as a curse withall. He is unthankful for what he hath, therefore have he never so much, it shall not be worth thanks. He is cruel to the poor, therefore he shall be as cruel to himself. The poor shall have no comfort of what he hath, therefore himself shall have as little.</p>
                     <p>The covetous are cozen Germans to the <hi>nine leapers,</hi> thankless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. They are so much for receiving, that they never mind what they have received. <hi>He deals with God, as a dog doth with his master, who as</hi> Austine <hi>observes, devoureth by and by whatever he can catch, and gapeth continually for more.</hi> Nor hath covetousness any thing so proper to it, as to be ingrateful. A greedy man is never but shamefully unthankful; for unless he have all, he hath nothing. He must have his will, or <hi>God</hi> shall not have a good look from him; yea, as the <hi>Mill,</hi> if it <hi>go empty,</hi> makes an <hi>unpleasant</hi> and <hi>odious noise,</hi> so the covetous man, if the Lord does not satisfie his desires in every thing, he will most wickedly murmur and blaspheme his providence; and if ever he sustaines losse, he will never forget it. He <hi>writes benefits received in water,</hi> but what he accounts <hi>injuries in marble.</hi> And for this his great ingratitude, <hi>God</hi> gives him riches, but withdraws his blessing. For as <hi>Iacob</hi> gave <hi>Ruben</hi> a <hi>blessing,</hi> but added, thou shalt <hi>not be excellent, Gen.</hi> 49.4. so God gives the worldling riches, but sayes, thou shalt not be satisfied. <hi>He that loveth silver, shall not be satisfied with silver,</hi> Eccl. 5.10. Yea no man more unsatisfied; for let him have what his heart can wish, he is not yet pleased, like the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who <hi>murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od</hi> asmuch when they had <hi>Mannah,</hi> as when they had none.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the merciless Miser, never sued or sought to <hi>God</hi> for his riches; neither does he acknowledge them as sent of God, but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes the increase of his means to his <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>industry.</hi> Nay he <hi>dares not pray the Lords prayer, forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,</hi> lest he call for a curse upon himself. Nay if he be (as probably he is) an <hi>Vsuerer,</hi> then in respect of other men, he hath no need to pray at all, for as one observes,
<q>
                           <l>Each man to heaven his hands for blessing reares;</l>
                           <l>Onely the Vs'rer needs not say his prayers.</l>
                           <l>Blow the winde East or West, plenty or dearth,</l>
                           <l>Sickness or health, sit on the face of earth,</l>
                           <l>He cares not, time will bring his money in,</l>
                           <l>Each day augments his treasure, and his sin.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or admit he ever calls upon God, his prayer is that some one may <hi>dye,</hi> that he may have his <hi>office,</hi> or break his day, that the beloved

                     <p>And as touching hereafter, if he shall finde in his heart to pray, <hi>God</hi> will not hear him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. <hi>The sacrifice of the wicked, is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 21.27. <hi>What hope hath the hypocrite saith</hi> Job, <hi>when he hath heaped up riches; will God hear his cry when trouble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon him?</hi> Job 27.8, 9. <hi>When you shall stretch out your hands, saith God to such, I will hide mine eyes from you, and though you make many prayers, I will not hear,</hi> Isa. 1.15. <hi>God</hi> will turn him off to his gold and silver for help, as he did <hi>Iehoram to the Prophets of his Father, and the Prophets of his Mother,</hi> 2 Kings 3.13. And it is but just and equal, that those which we have made the comfort and stay of our peace, should be the relief and comfort of our extremity.

                     <p>Now, if he <hi>neither prayes to God</hi> for what he would have, <hi>nor gives him thanks</hi> for what he gives, <hi>nor desires a blessing</hi> upon what he <hi>receives, viz.</hi> that he may be content, and satisfied therewith, How should <hi>God</hi> bestow this great blessing of contentation upon him, and a true use of his riches?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he cares not for <hi>grace</hi> but for <hi>gold,</hi> therefore <hi>God</hi> gives him <hi>gold</hi> without <hi>grace.</hi> He longs not after <hi>righteousness,</hi> but <hi>riches,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he shall neither be <hi>satisfied</hi> nor <hi>blessed</hi>; whereas both are their portion that thirst after the former, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6.

                     <p>Again he loves his children better then the <hi>Lord,</hi> oppressing Gods children to inrich his own, for so his young ones be warm in their nest, let Christs members shake with cold, he cares not.

He will walk with <hi>God,</hi> so long as <hi>plenty,</hi> or the like does walk with him, but no longer; he will <hi>leave Gods</hi> service rather <hi>then lose</hi> by it.</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>Mammonist</hi> loves not <hi>God,</hi> is evident; for <hi>if any man love the world, the love of God is not in him,</hi> 1 John 2.15. yea the <hi>two poles</hi> shall sooner meet, then the love of God and the love of money.</p>

                     <p>Covetousness is flat <hi>idolatry,</hi> which makes it out of measure sinful, and more hanious then any other sin, as appears, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Iob</hi> 31.24, 28. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Fornication</hi> is a foul sin; but nothing to this, that pollutes the body, but covetousness defileth the

                     <p>It is a sound Conclusion in Divinity, That is our <hi>God,</hi> which we love best and esteem most; as <hi>gold</hi> is the covetous mans <hi>god,</hi> and <hi>

For in outward appearance they are as happy as the world can make them, they have large possessions, goodly houses, beautiful spouses, hopeful children, full purses; yet their life is never the sweeter, nor their hearts ever the lighter, nor their meales the heartier, nor their nights the quieter, nor their cares the fewer; yea none more full of complaints among men.

                     <p>ANd of these but a word. First for Information; let the premisses teach us this lesson, That whatsoever is given to any one, if <hi>Christ</hi> and a sanctified use thereof be not given withall, it can be no good thing to him. Did the <hi>stalled Ox</hi> know that his Master <hi>fatted</hi> him <hi>for the slaughter,</hi> he would not think his great plenty an argument of his masters greater love to him. The <hi>Physician</hi> letteth that <hi>sick person</hi> have what he will, of whose <hi>recovery</hi> he despaireth; but he restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him of many things, of whom he hath hope. We use to clip, and <hi>cut shorter the feathers</hi> of <hi>Birds</hi> or other fowle, when they begin to <hi>flye too high,</hi> or <hi>too far:</hi> So does God diminish the riches and honors of his children, and makes our condition so various, that we may not pass our bounds, or glory too much in these transitory things. As if we well observe it.</p>
                     <p>First, some have the world and not <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Nabal,</hi> who possessed a world of wealth, not a dram of grace or comfort.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, some have God and not the world, as <hi>Lazarus</hi>: his heart was full of grace, and divine comfort, whiles his body lacked crumbes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:102698:254"/>Thirdly, some have <hi>neither God nor the world,</hi> nothing but misery here, nothing but torment hereafter; for the <hi>poorest</hi> are not seldom <hi>the wickedest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, some have <hi>both God and the world,</hi> as <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was rich while he lived on earth, and dying was glorious in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Yea often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they that are deerest to <hi>God,</hi> do with great difficulty work out those blessings, which even fall into the mouthes of the careless.</p>
                     <p>That wise disposer of all things, knows it fit many times, to hold us short of those favors which we sue for, and would not benefit, but hurt us. Unlovely features, have more libertty to be good, because freer from Solicitors; and though it be not a curse, yet tis many times an unhappiness to be fair (aswell as to be strong and witty) <hi>Helena,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Leda,</hi> for her excellent beauty, was ravished at the age of nine yeers, by <hi>Theseus</hi>; and once again by <hi>Paris,</hi> which caused the wars, and utter ruine of <hi>Troy.</hi>

                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> observes, that <hi>Lisander</hi> did more hurt the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> in sending them store of riches and precious movables, then <hi>Sylla</hi> did the <hi>Romans</hi> in consuming the reveneues of their treasure. And as <hi>Sylvius</hi> relates, the liberallity of Princes, and especially of <hi>Metilda</hi> a <hi>Dutches of</hi> Italy, who at her death made the Pope her heir, begat ambition in the <hi>Bishops of Rome,</hi> and ambition destroyed Religion.

                        </q>
For even <hi>evil things</hi> work together for <hi>the good of the good</hi>; and even <hi>good things</hi> work together <hi>to the evil of the evil.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Lucian</hi> seigneth, that riches being sent by <hi>Iupiter</hi> from heaven, come softly and slowly, but from the <hi>infernal god</hi> comes flying apace. And the other Poets feign <hi>Pluto</hi> to be the <hi>god of riches</hi> and of <hi>hell,</hi> as if hell and riches had both one master. And indeed he that resolves to be evil, making no conscience how he comes by it, may soon be rich, but the blessings of <hi>God</hi> in our ill getting, or unworthy carriage in their use, prove but the aggravations of sin, and additions to judgement. And let this serve for the first use.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Let what hath been delivered touching the miseries of an unmerciful, miserly, muckworme, serve to make us take heed and beware of all sin, but especially of the sin of covetousness; yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is a second use.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this, if we seriously consider it, may serve for a use of great comfort to the godly and conscientious: For if worldlings are so many wayes perplexed and distracted with cares and fears, about getting, and keeping, and lofing their riches and grace estates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how happy are the servants of <hi>God,</hi> that are not acquainted with any of them? <hi>No

They cast their care upon <hi>God,</hi> and he careth for them, who will see that they shall never want what is good and fit for them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.25, 30. But <hi>in the transgression of an evil man is his snare,</hi> sayes wise <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 29 6.</p>

                     <p>Yea <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>shame</hi> is so inseparable; and God is so severe in this case, that though a man hath repented him of the sin, yet some blemish sticks to his name, even as a <hi>scar</hi> still <hi>remaineth</hi> after the <hi>wound</hi> is <hi>healed.

                     <p>SEcondly, another reason is, if a covetous man do repent, he must restore what he hath wrongfully gotten, which perhaps may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to half, or it may be three parts of his Estate at a clap: which to him is as hard, and harsh an injunction, as that of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22.2. <hi>Sacrifise thy son, thine only son Isaac.</hi> Or as that of <hi>our Saviours to the young man,</hi> Luk. 18.22. <hi>Sell all that ever thou hast, and distribute unto the poor:</hi> And is there any hope of his yeelding? No, <hi>Covetousness is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> Eph. 5.5. Col. 3.5.</p>
                     <p>And Gold is the covetous mans god, and will he part with his God, a certainty for an uncertainty? No, a godly man is content to be poor in outward things, because his purchase is all inward; but nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the assurance of heavenly things, can make us willing to part with earthly things; neither can he contemn this life, that knows not the other, and so long as he <hi>keeps</hi> the weapon (evil-gotten goods) <hi>in his wound,</hi> and resolves <hi>not to pluck it out</hi> by restoring) how is it possible he should be cured?</p>

                     <p>Nor do the godly wise, desire more then they can wield, in which they resemble <hi>Aristippus,</hi> who when a <hi>servant</hi> in journeying with him, was <hi>

                     <p>Secondly, the poor and mean, have a deeper sense of <hi>Gods fatherly care</hi> and providence, in replenishing them, at all times of need, (even beyond imagination or expression) then others have, that know no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea, all temporall blessings that can be named, are promised to the godly, and their seed; and to them only as both the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament</hi> does plainly and plentifully prove. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> the 28th. <hi>God</hi> hath promised; that if we will <hi>hearken diligently unto his voice, observe and do all his Commandements, and walk in his wayes, we shall be blessed in the city, and blessed in the field, blessed in our going forth, and in our comming home, blessed in the fruit of our bodies, and in the fruit of our ground, and in the fruit of our cattel, the increase of our kine, and the flocks of our sheep.</hi> That <hi>he will bless us in our store-houses, and in all that we set our hands unto; and make us plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in all good things:</hi> and that <hi>we shall have wherewith to lend unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and not borrow,</hi> Verse 1, to 15th. and Chap. 7.11, to 19th. To which may be added many the like places; As, <hi>Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, and delighteth greatly in his commandements: wealth and riches shall be in his house,</hi> Psal. 112. Verse 1, to 4th. <hi>Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he will exalt thee to inherit the land,</hi> Psal. 37.34. <hi>The Lord will with-hold no good thing from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Psal. 84.11. <hi>Delight thy self in the Lord, and he shall give thee thine hearts desire, &amp;c.</hi> Psal. 37. 3, to 7. <hi>Fear ye the Lord, ye his Saints: for nothing wanteth to them that fear him.

Nor is all this, that <hi>God</hi> hath promised to those that serve him, so great a matter comparatively; as that we need wonder at it, or once question the same: For <hi>If he spared not his own Son, but delivered him to death for us; how shall he not with him freely, give us all things also?</hi> Rom. 8.31, 32. It is the <hi>Apostles</hi> argument. Great, yea, too great things are they for us to receive; but not too great, for the great and good <hi>God of Heaven and earth</hi> to give: all the fear is on our part, whether we be such to whom the promise is made. For all <hi>Gods promises are conditional.</hi> And though of these outward good things, he hath promised abundance: yet it is upon the condition of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>obedience:</hi> as appears by all the fore-mentioned places; so that if we be not wanting in out duty, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to <hi>God; God</hi> will not be wanting in any good thing to us: Nor can we look that <hi>God</hi> should make good his promises, if we make them void, by not observing the condition, as that we may do by our distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. If we will not dare to trust <hi>God</hi> upon his promise so confidently as we would a friend, or some great man that is able and honest.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:102698:270"/>Besides, the <hi>Lord</hi> hath promised, that <hi>there shall be no want to them that fear him; and that no good thing will he with-hold, from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Psal. 34.9. &amp; 84.11. Where observe two things, there shall be no want to such, and such shall want no good thing: so that he must be such an one, to whom the promise is made; and he must also be sure, that it is good for him, which is promised. But oftentimes it is not good, for a man to abound with earthly blessings: as <hi>strong drinke</hi> is not good for <hi>weake brains.</hi> Yea, if any thing be wantiug to a good man, he may be sure it is not good for him: and then better that he doth want it, then that he did enjoy it, and what wise man will complain of the want of that, which if he had, would prove more hurtful then gainful to him? as <hi>a sword</hi> to a <hi>mad man,</hi> a <hi>knife</hi> to a <hi>childe, drinke</hi> to them that have a <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> or the <hi>Dropsie. No good thing will God with-hold, &amp;c.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not wants themselves, which to many are also good, yea, very good things, as I could reckon up many: want sanctified, is a notable means to <hi>bring to repentance,</hi> to <hi>work</hi> in us <hi>amendment of life, it stirs up to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it weans from the love of the world, it keeps us always prepared for the spiritual combate, discovers whether we be true believers or hypocrites, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents greater evils of sin and punishment to come; It makes us humble, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Christ our head, increaseth our faith, our joy and thankfulnesse, our spiritual wisdom,</hi> and likewise <hi>our patience,</hi> as I have largely shewen in <hi>The Benefit of Affliction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To coonclude, All <hi>good things</hi> were created for the <hi>good,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they called <hi>goods</hi>; because the <hi>good God</hi> created them for <hi>good men to do good withal.</hi> Therefore as Jacob <hi>got the blessing,</hi> so he gat the <hi>inheritance</hi> also: to shew that as the faithful have the <hi>inward blessing,</hi> so they have the <hi>outward blessing</hi> too; when they will do them good, and cause them to do good. Yea, in this case, even as the <hi>sheaffs</hi> fell before <hi>Ruth</hi>: so riches shall fall in our way, as they did to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> upon whom riches were cast they knew not how; but as if <hi>God</hi> had onely said, Be rich; and they were rich straight. But that this is the true and only way to wealth and happiness, needs no more proof then that which is recorded of <hi>Solomon</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. where the <hi>Lord appearing to him in a dream,</hi> said, <hi>Ask what I shall give thee.</hi> And he asking only <hi>an understanding heart, to discern between good and evil; that he might the better discharge that great place, whereunto God had called him</hi>; wherein <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and the <hi>peoples good,</hi> was his <hi>principal aime</hi> and end: Heare what the <hi>Lords</hi> answer is, <hi>Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life, but hast asked wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge for thy self, that thou mightest judge my people, over whom I have made thee King: Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, &amp; wealth and honour, such as none of the

                     <p>And so much to prove, that the way to become <hi>rich,</hi> is first to become <hi>godly.</hi> If any shall ask why the godly are not alwayes, nor oft rich, notwithstanding these promises? I answer, that <hi>God</hi> not seldom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds these outward blessings, from his own people in great love, only affording them all things that they have need of. <hi>Our heavenly Father,</hi> who <hi>knows us</hi> better then we <hi>know our selves,</hi> and what is good and fit for us, (even as the <hi>Nurse</hi> knows better then the <hi>childe,</hi> and the <hi>Physician</hi> better then the <hi>Patient</hi>;) knows too well, how apt we are to abuse these his mercies; and that we cannot <hi>abound</hi> with earthly blessings, but we <hi>grow proud and surfeit</hi> of them: as we see <hi>Solomon</hi> himself did, who was the <hi>wisest</hi> (<hi>next to</hi> Adam in his innocency) that ever lived: and like wise how happy it is for them, to be kept short. And when the <hi>All-wise God</hi> does fore-see, that men will serve him as the <hi>Prodigal son</hi> served his <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> who only <hi>prayed untill he had got his patrimony,</hi> and <hi>then forsook him,</hi> and spent the same in riot to the givers dishonour; even as the <hi>cloud</hi> that is lifted up, and <hi>advanced by the Sun obscures the Sun.</hi> In this case he either denies them riches in mercy, as he denied Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his suit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9. And our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. Or grants them their <hi>riches in wrath,</hi> Hosea 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11.

And the like in the <hi>Psalms, Wealth and riches shall be in the house of him, that hath compassion of, and giveth to the poor,</hi> Psal. 112.3, to 10. See here how <hi>bounty</hi> is the best and surest way to <hi>plenty.</hi> But notable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.27. <hi>He that giveth to the poor, shall not lack.</hi> A rare and incomparable priviledge never to want. And yet this is a <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of Gods own making. Plenty shall furnish the table,</hi> where <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity takes away, and gives to the poor. He hath sparsed abroad,</hi> (sayes the <hi>Psalmist</hi>) <hi>and given to the poor, his benevolence remaineth for ever,</hi> Psal. 112.9. He hath alwayes to give, that hath a free and bountiful heart to give, sayes Saint <hi>Bernard.</hi> And of this the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> does assure us, <hi>The liberal man</hi> (sayes he) <hi>deviseth liberal things; and by liberality he shall stand,</hi> Isaiah 32.8. A man would think, he should rather <hi>fall</hi> by being so liberal &amp; bountiful: but this is the right course to <hi>thrive, and hold out.</hi> Nor was it ever known, that <hi>God</hi> suffered a merciful and bountiful man to want; <hi>ordering his affairs with discretion,</hi> Psal. 112.5. But you have not heard a tithe of these promises: for the <hi>Scriptures</hi> no lesse <hi>abound</hi> in them, then <hi>silver</hi> did <hi>in the dayes of Solomon:</hi> of which only a few more, for I had rather <hi>press you with weight,</hi> then <hi>oppresse you with number</hi> of arguments. What saith the <hi>wiseman?</hi> Prov. 3. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with abundance, and thy presses shall burst with new wine,</hi> Verse 9, 10. In which regard, whhat is this way expended, may be likened to <hi>gold the best of metals:</hi> of which experience teacheth, that the <hi>third part of a grain, will gild a wyre of</hi> 134 <hi>foot long</hi>; Or rather to those <hi>loaves and fishes in the Gospel:</hi> for as they did <hi>increase and multiply,</hi> even while they were <hi>distributing:</hi> so do our riches (and indeed all other gifts.) Even out of that which the <hi>hand reacheth to the mouth,</hi> it self is <hi>nourished.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus you see, that (if either <hi>Old or New Testament</hi> be true) <hi>not getting,</hi> but <hi>giving</hi> is the true and ready <hi>way to abundance.</hi> That <hi>to give</hi> in this case, is <hi>the way to have</hi>; that <hi>parsimony,</hi> is <hi>no good husbandry:</hi> &amp; that we are the <hi>richer for disbursing</hi>: Which makes <hi>Chrysostome</hi> say, that <hi>the gainfullest Art is Almsgiving.</hi> And hence it is, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> compares <hi>Almsgiving, to sowing of seed,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.6. <hi>he that soweth spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, shall reap sparingly: but he that soweth bountifully, shall also reap bountifully.</hi> The <hi>Apostle compares giving to sowing,</hi> to note
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102698:272"/>
unto us the great gain, and advantage that commeth thereby, for who knoweth not what gain <hi>a good husbandman,</hi> hath by his <hi>sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> He <hi>casteth his seed into the ground,</hi> and only <hi>forbeareth</hi> it a few moneths, and when the season comes, he <hi>reaps a harvest of thirty, fourty</hi> or <hi>an hundred for one</hi> increase.

nothing seems to them more absurd and ridiculous: what? perswade them that giving away their goods, is the way to increase them? You must make me a fool (will such an one say) before I can believe it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he speaks truer then he is aware of: for these are the very words of St. <hi>Paul</hi>; He <hi>that will be wise, let him become a fool that he may be wise,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.18. <hi>The wisdom of God is foolishness with the world: and so is the wisdom of the world foolishness with God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. &amp; 3.19.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>carnal, reason</hi> it is as unlikely a thing, as that which <hi>Elisha</hi> told to the <hi>King of Israel,</hi> 2 Kings 7. that whereas the <hi>Famine</hi> was so great in <hi>Samaria one day</hi> that <hi>mothers act their own children:</hi> yet <hi>the next day</hi> there should be <hi>such plenty,</hi> that a <hi>measure of fine flower should be sold for a sheckle, and two measures of barley for a sheckle.</hi> As improbable, as that <hi>Abraham</hi> should have <hi>a son, being almost an hundred years old; and</hi> Sarah <hi>past child-bearing.</hi> As impossible, as that <hi>Lazarus</hi> should again <hi>live,</hi> after he was <hi>stark dead, buried,</hi> and <hi>stanke</hi> again. Yet as unlikely, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and impossible as they seemed to be: yet they came to pass, and <hi>God</hi> did not <hi>break his promise,</hi> nor <hi>disappoint the hopes</hi> of such as had the wit, and grace <hi>to confide in him:</hi> no more will he in this case, which is by fat the easier to be performed. And what though carnall mindes (like that <hi>Noble-man, who was trodden to death in the gate of</hi> Samaria, <hi>for his incredulity</hi>) will not believe, yet <hi>truth is truth,</hi> as well <hi>when it is not acknowledged,</hi> as when it is.</p>
                     <p>And I wish men would take heed of <hi>unbelief</hi> and <hi>giving God the lie:</hi> for, as there is nothing he so abhors, as that <hi>his own</hi> houshold ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants should <hi>not dare to trust him,</hi> as we may see in that example of the <hi>Noble man,</hi> 2 Kings 7.17, 2. &amp; likewise in those <hi>Israelites,</hi> Psal. 78. when they said, <hi>Can God furnish a table in the Wilderness?</hi> He <hi>smote the Rock that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; but can he give bread also? Can he provide flesh for his people? Yes, he could and did it,</hi> to their small comfort that made the exception. For <hi>because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation, the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed them. He gave them flesh, even quailes in his wrath, until they were choaked,</hi> Psal. 78.10, to 38. and, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.33, 34. But admit <hi>God</hi> should not answer thy greedy desire, in multiplying thy estate: yet if he do that which is better for thee, <hi>viz.</hi> give thee <hi>a competency</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>with a more contented minde</hi> then now thou hast, or ever wouldst have, wert thou as rich as <hi>Crassus</hi>: would it be ever the worse, or hadst thou any cause to complain? no, but greatly to rejoyce, as I have shewn in the foregoing part.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore trust <hi>God</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> who <hi>above hope believed under hope,</hi> Rom. 4.18, to 22.

                        <hi>Thankfulness and humility</hi> are the only means to <hi>enrich us</hi> with <hi>Gods</hi> blessings: but <hi>pride and unthankfulness,</hi> is the only way to <hi>make God withdraw,</hi> and take from us both <hi>himself, and his blessings. Because the King of</hi> Assyria <hi>said, By the power if mine arme have I done it, and by my wisdom, for I am prudent: therefore, saith the Lord, I have removed the borders of the people, and have spoiled their treasures, and have pulled down the Inhabitants like a valiant man,</hi> Isay 10.13. <hi>Aesops Crow</hi> not content with her own likenesse, <hi>borrowed a feather of every bird</hi>; and she became so <hi>proud,</hi> that she <hi>scorned</hi> them all: which the birds observing, they came and <hi>pluckt each one their feather back,</hi> and so left her <hi>naked:</hi> even so does <hi>God</hi> deal with all proud and ingrateful persons.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ingratitude forfeits mercies, as Merchants do all to the King, by not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of custome. Because</hi> Pharaoh <hi>saith, The River is mine own, therefore God saith, I will dry up the River,</hi> Ezek. 29.3, to 13. Isaiah 19.5, 6.

mark the difference: <hi>even from this very day will I bless you, saith God,</hi> Hag. 1.4. to 12 &amp; 2, 18, 19. He that is unthankful for a <hi>little,</hi> is worthy of <hi>nothing:</hi> whereas thanks for one good turn, is the best introduction to another. Holy <hi>David</hi> was a <hi>man after Gods own heart,</hi> and therefore he ever mixeth with his <hi>prayers praises.

                     <p>Wherefore be not like the <hi>Swine,</hi> that <hi>feeds</hi> upon the <hi>Acorns,</hi> without ever <hi>looking</hi> to the <hi>Oake</hi>; from whence they fall.

                     <p>And the like of <hi>Humility, Blessed are the meek</hi> (saith our <hi>Saviour</hi>) <hi>for they shall inherit the earth,</hi> Matth. 5.5. <hi>The reward of humility, and the fear of God, is riches, and honour, and life,</hi> Prov. 22, 4. If there <hi>be a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in a valley lower</hi> then another, thither the <hi>waters gather</hi>; And the <hi>more lowly</hi> we are in <hi>our own eyes,</hi> the more lovely we are in <hi>Gods: the more despicable in our selves, the more acceptable in him,</hi> as is seen in the example of the <hi>Publican,</hi> Luke 18.13, 14. And the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> Luke 15.18, 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor can any thing make us more acceptable to <hi>God,</hi> then the conscience of our own unworthiness: when with <hi>Iacob</hi> we can say, <hi>O Lord, I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant: For with my staff I passed over this Iordane, and now I am become two bands,</hi> Gen. 32.10. When with the <hi>Publican</hi> we can confesse, <hi>I am not worthy to lift up mine eyes to heaven,</hi> Luke 18.13, 14. And with the <hi>Prodigal, I am not worthy to be called thy son,</hi> Luke 15. And with the <hi>Centurion, I am not worthy thou shouldest come under my roof,</hi> Luke 7.6. And with <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the like, <hi>I am not worthy, I am not worthy.</hi> This is the way to obtein what we would have at the hands of <hi>God: who resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble,</hi> Jam, 4.6, 10. Prov. 29.23. &amp; 15.33. &amp; 18.12. <hi>unto him will I look,</hi> saith the <hi>Lord, even to him that is: poor, and of a contrite spirit; and that trembleth at my words,</hi> Isaiah 57.15. <hi>He hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the hungry with good things, but the rich he hath sent empty away,</hi> Luke 1.52, 53.</p>
                     <p>So that if thou expectest to have <hi>God</hi> bless and prosper thee, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware thou forgettest not, at whose cost thou livest; <hi>Beware, lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply,

                     <p>Many are the examples I might give you, of such as have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by their pride. <hi>While</hi> Saul <hi>was little in his own eyes, God made him head over the twelve Tribes of Israel, and gave him abundance; but when out of his greatness, be abused his place and gifts, God took them all away again.</hi> And so it had like to have fared with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be puffed up with the wealth, and precious things that <hi>God</hi> had given him, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.12, to 19. But most remarkable is the example of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>; who when he ascribed all to himself, saying, <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babel <hi>which I have built, with the might of my power, and for the glory of my majesty?</hi> was presently deprived of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and all that he had, and sent <hi>to graze with the beasts:</hi> but when he was humbled to the very ground, acknowledged the Author, and ascribed all to the <hi>God of heaven,</hi> he had his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and all else <hi>restored unto him,</hi> Dan. 4. The way to obtein any benefit, is to acknowledge the Authour, and devote it in our hearts to the glory of that <hi>God,</hi> of whom we receive all: For by this means shall <hi>God</hi> both <hi>pleasure his servants, and honour himself.</hi> And indeed, that he may be honoured by our <hi>wisdom, riches, graces</hi>; is the only end, for which he gives us to be <hi>wise, rich, gracious.</hi> And who hath more <hi>interest in the grape,</hi> then he <hi>that planted the Vine?</hi> Who more <hi>right to the crop,</hi> then he that <hi>oweth the ground, and soweth the seed?</hi> Therefore, <hi>Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, nor the strong man in his strength; nor the rich man in his riches,</hi> Jer. 9.23. For we have not only <hi>received our talents from God,</hi> but the <hi>improvement also</hi> is his meer bounty. <hi>Of him, and through him, and for him, are all things: to whom be glory, for ever,</hi> Amen. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35, 36.</p>

That <hi>plentifulness</hi> follows <hi>painfulness,</hi> and that <hi>all things</hi> are made <hi>servants to care, and industry. Caius Furius,</hi> by his painful dexterity, and unwearied labour, got more means out of <hi>one small field,</hi> then his <hi>neigbours</hi> out of <hi>many great ones:</hi> whereupon he was accused to the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> as if by <hi>witchcraft,</hi> he had conveyed the <hi>corn of other mens ground,</hi> into <hi>his own</hi>; but he came with all his goodly <hi>rustical instruments,</hi> with his <hi>strong and lusty daughter,</hi> and his <hi>well fed Oxen,</hi> and spake thus to the <hi>Iudges:</hi> See, my <hi>Lords,</hi> these be <hi>my witchcrafts and sorceries</hi>; but I cannot shew you my <hi>watchings and sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>; which being done and spoken, he was presently <hi>absolved</hi> by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>all.</hi> Whence the <hi>Apostle</hi> exhorts the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> to <hi>labour</hi> in their several <hi>callings,</hi> if they would have sufficient for themselves, and wherewith to help others. And this makes <hi>Solomon,</hi> in praising the <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous woman for her bounty,</hi> note that <hi>she works willingly with her hands, and that her candle was not put out by night,</hi> Prov. 31.10, to 31. And Saint <hi>Luke</hi> the like of Dorcas, <hi>her pains and industry in making coats and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Acts 9.36, 39.</p>
                     <p>And what but <hi>Idleness</hi> makes so many <hi>beggers,</hi> and base persons? It is the <hi>most corrupting Fly,</hi> that <hi>can blow in any humane minde:</hi> We learn to do <hi>ill,</hi> by doing what is <hi>next it, nothing.</hi> Whence it is that <hi>vice</hi> so fructifies, in our <hi>Gentry and Servingmen:</hi> who have nothing to employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in, for they only <hi>sit to eat and drink, lie down to sleep, and rise up to play</hi>; this is all their business, and this brings thousands of them to beggery or worse.</p>

As it fared with <hi>that Captain in</hi> Tully; who was not a peny the richer, for <hi>that huge summe of money given him,</hi> because he had done with it, as <hi>a naked man</hi> would do with the <hi>Nuts</hi> that he <hi>gathers; carry them all</hi> away <hi>in his belly,</hi> for lack of <hi>pockets.</hi> And this the <hi>Poets</hi> insinuate, by their lusty <hi>Giant Briarius:</hi> who had nothing to shew, of all his comings in; because his <hi>fifty bellies</hi> did <hi>consume the gettings of his hundred hands.

But that <hi>Prodigality</hi> hath brought many <hi>rich men</hi> to poverty, and <hi>poor men</hi> to <hi>beggery,</hi> I have sufficiently shewn in the 17th. Chapter. And so much of the means, whereby of <hi>poor</hi> a man may become rich: I come in the last place to shew you, how you may be <hi>happy, as well as rich,</hi> and <hi>cured of</hi> all your <hi>care, misery,</hi> and <hi>melancholy</hi>: which is the principal thing I desire to pleasure you withall.

The <hi>Merchant</hi> thinks it a good course, first to try with a little, how vendible his <hi>commodity</hi> will be, and after he replenisheth the <hi>Market,</hi> according to the esteem it findes with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. Nor is he held wise, that will venter all his estate in one bottom. Such were my thoughts, in publishing the first part of this Tracte: intending (like <hi>Phidias</hi> touching his <hi>portrayture</hi>) that if it were liked, did abide the <hi>touch,</hi> passe the <hi>standard</hi> of the judicious Readers approbation: I would publish the residue, otherwise not: resolving whether allowed of, they should <hi>incourage me</hi>; or disliked, they should <hi>amend me.</hi> And now having found that acceptance, which in modesty I could not expect, I have sent abroad the second Part.</p>
                     <p>In the former Part of this Discourse, I have declared <hi>what it is,</hi> and <hi>what it is not</hi> to be Rich: and withall chalked out the way in six Particulars, how men that are poor, may become Rich, and rid of poverty. In this which follows, I shall declare how they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Happy,</hi> and rid of discontent or <hi>Melancholy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for the effecting of this, there needs no more be done, than to cure men of their covetousnesse: for if that be once done, all is done; otherwise nothing, or nothing to purpose. For let a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man become never so rich, he is never the happier; his <hi>care, misery,</hi> and <hi>melancholy</hi> still remaines: but let his <hi>covetousnesse</hi> cease, and then comes <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>content,</hi> have he never so little: as I shall shew when I come unto it. Yea, let men but leave, or be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave this one sinne, and they shall depart from this discourse, (like <hi>Naaman</hi> out of <hi>Iordan</hi>) as if they had been washt, and all their sinnes taken away, like the <hi>scales</hi> from <hi>Pauls eyes,</hi> Act. 9.18. For what hath brought <hi>Vsury,</hi> and <hi>Simony,</hi> and <hi>non-residency,</hi> and <hi>bribery,</hi> and <hi>perjury,</hi> and <hi>felony,</hi> and <hi>cruelty,</hi> and <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> and <hi>subtilty,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> and <hi>strife,</hi> and <hi>debate</hi> into the <hi>City,</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> and made every <hi>house</hi> an <hi>Inne,</hi> and every <hi>shopa Market</hi> of <hi>oathes,</hi> and <hi>lyes,</hi> and <hi>equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>fraude,</hi> and indeed of what not? but the superfluous and excessive love of money?

For I thirst to pleasure these unworthy men, with that which is more worth beyond compare, than all their wealth multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as many times, as there are sands on the sea-shore. For let me tell you, <hi>you worshippers of the golden Calf:</hi> that the <hi>cure</hi> which <hi>Erasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus</hi> did upon <hi>Antiochus,</hi> for which he had fourteen thousand three hundred and seventy five pounds; was nothing to this cure of covetousnesse, in him that is therewith infected, or thereto inslaved: as you will confesse if you but consider, what the difficulty of this cure is, of which I have largely spoken in <hi>Chapter</hi> 19, to <hi>Chapter</hi> 23. of the fore-going part.</p>

                     <p>Now there is no way to remove this let, or to rescue them from this <hi>Remora:</hi> except I can insure them, that they shall be gainers by the bargain, and receive by way of exchange, that which shall more than countervail what they part withall: which I doubt not, by the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of <hi>God</hi> to do, if they will but vouchsafe or be willing to hear, either reason or Divine Authority. And 1. I will prescribe or give them some rare Receits, acquaint them with some soveraign Remedies, against this desperate evil: and therein shew them, how they shall or may, of the most miserable men alive, become the most Blessed and Happy. And who knows whether <hi>God</hi> hath not put me upon this work, and will accordingly blesse the meanes that shall be used? though by a most unworthy and insufficient Instrument? Neither is the strength or weaknesse of meanes, either spur or bridle to <hi>Gods</hi> choice, who sometimes does <hi>greatest acts, by weakest Agents</hi>; and gives the <hi>greater successe,</hi> to the <hi>weaker meanes.</hi> However, an <hi>Emperick</hi> or <hi>Quacksalver,</hi> hath now and then, had the hap to cure a <hi>Patient,</hi> whom a <hi>learned Artist</hi> could not do.

                     <p>Now if you would relinquish this sinne, and so be everlastingly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; If you prefer true content, and <hi>the peace of God which passeth all understanding</hi>; before your own misery and vexation: And rather desire to go to <hi>Heaven</hi> with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> than with <hi>Dives</hi> to those <hi>scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flames</hi>; observe these few things in order.</p>
                     <p>In the first place, lay to heart the things formerly delivered; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that a competency of earthly things with content, is the best e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state in the world. Yea that a poor and mean condition, (in case <hi>God</hi> be pleased to give grace, and his blessing with that little he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes:) is far better and happier, than to swimme in great wealth and aboundance.

                     <p>The godly man hath sufficient, though he have no wealth: even as man in innocency was warm, and comely, though without cloathing. <hi>A small thing unto the just man, is better than great riches to the wicked and mighty,</hi> Psal. 37.16. The reason is, the one hath his sight to see clearly his happinesse, in having what is best for him, and is content to be poor in outward things, because his wealth and purchase, is all inward. The other by a just judgment of God, is so blind, that he cannot see when he is well; but thirsts so after other mens goods, that he takes no pleasure in his own. His heart is glewed to the world, or rather to his wealth: and an object too near the eye, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be seen: yea be it but the breadth of a penny, it will hide from the sight, the whole half heaven at once.

Hast thou not all outward comforts, presenting themselves and their service to thee in great aboundance? Yet they are to thee, and in thy account but <hi>miserable comforters.</hi> For though thy <hi>house</hi> be <hi>full,</hi> and thy <hi>shop full,</hi> and thy <hi>coffers full,</hi> and thy <hi>purse full,</hi> and thy <hi>pastures full,</hi> yet thy <hi>heart</hi> is still <hi>lanke</hi> and <hi>empty,</hi> through an excessive desire of more: as if thy heart were without a bottom. Whereas, if thou wouldst but admit <hi>Christ</hi> into thy heart, (who now <hi>stands at the door and knocks,</hi> Revel. 3.20.) thou wouldst then need no more, who now needest every thing: (even what thou hast in possession.) For he alone that fills <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> can fill the <hi>soul.</hi> Nothing but the <hi>Trinity of Persons</hi> in that one <hi>Deity</hi>; can fill the <hi>triangular concave of mans heart.

When <hi>Christ</hi> brought salvation to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> his minde was strangely altered: before he was all for getting, now he is all for giving. This was not the first day that he seemed <hi>rich to others,</hi> but this was the first day he seemed <hi>rich to himself.</hi> Riches bring conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Godlinesse brings contentation. Gain hath often hurt the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, piety and Godlinesse is profitable to all men, and for all things: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. Godlinesse is the most profitable thing in the world, because it maketh all things else profitable; And it is for want of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Godlinesse, that the covetous mans riches no whit profit him. Godlinesse setteth such a glass before the eyes of them, that possesse the same: that it will make a <hi>shilling</hi> seem as great as a <hi>pound,</hi> a <hi>Cottage</hi> thought as sumptuons as a <hi>Palace,</hi> a <hi>Plow</hi> seem as goodly as a <hi>Scepter</hi>; so that he which hath but <hi>twenty pounds,</hi> shall be as merry as he who hath <hi>an hundred,</hi> and he who hath an <hi>hundred,</hi> shall be as jocond, as he who hath a <hi>thousand,</hi> and he who hath a <hi>thousand,</hi> shall be as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and think himself as rich, as he who hath a <hi>million.</hi> Even as <hi>Daniel did thrive with water and pulse, as well as the rest did with their wine and iunkets.

                     <p>Sixthly, Wouldest thou have <hi>God</hi> to prosper all that thou hast, or doest: then get grace to serve him, so shalt thou be blessed, in all places, and delivered from all temporal evils, as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. Nor can it be other in reason. For, if when the <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> (which was a sign of <hi>Gods</hi> presence) was in the <hi>house of Obed Edom,</hi> then <hi>the Lord blessed him, and all his house:</hi> how much more shall that man be blessed? in whose heart even <hi>God</hi> himself, by his <hi>Spirit</hi> dwels; and by his grace, which is a more sure, and infallible sign of his presence then was the <hi>Ark.</hi> So that if thou beest wise, thou wilt more esteem of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>Gods blessing</hi> accompanying it; than thou wouldest of <hi>Iasons Golden Fleece</hi>: or the <hi>great Chams Tree-full of Pearles, hanging by clusters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Wouldest thou with all these, have all peace and joy? than get Grace and Holinesse. For as the <hi>Vnicornes horn</hi> dipped in the <hi>fountain,</hi> makes the waters which before were corrupt and noysome, clear and wholesome upon the suddain: so whatsoever estate grace and godlinesse comes unto, it saith like the <hi>Apostles, Peace be to this house,</hi> peace and happinesse be to this heart, to this man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That <hi>Regeneration</hi> is the only best <hi>Physick</hi> for <hi>melancholy,</hi> I can sufficiently evidence, out of fifty years experience. I most gladly acknowledge, that when I was in my natural condition, without the pardon of sin, and some assurance of <hi>Gods</hi> favour: I seldome wakened in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but my heart was as heavy as lead; as fearing an hell, after that purgatory: which since my heart was changed, I have not, I blesse <hi>God,</hi> been acquainted with. <hi>An old Disciple of Christ,</hi> being asked the cause why he was ever such a merry man, answered: when I was a young man, I studied how to <hi>live well</hi>; and when I became an old man, I studied how to <hi>dye well</hi>; and so desiring to seek <hi>God</hi> in this his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of grace,</hi> and hoping to see him in his <hi>Kingdom of glory,</hi> one day to me was better, than a thousand unto those, who weary themselves in the waies of wickednesse, and destruction.</p>
                     <p>Now if grace and <hi>Gods</hi> favour, brings such peace and joy: what fools are sinners? to deprive themselves of it. What <hi>mad men</hi> are <hi>Misers?</hi> As how do their <hi>hearts droop</hi> with their <hi>mammon?</hi> How do they <hi>weary</hi> and <hi>turmoyl themselves, vex their spirits, torment their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> making themselves a very map of misery, and a sinke of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Whereas it is nothing so with the servants of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Perhaps at their first conversion, they are much troubled in mind, (though it fares not so with all) and conscience; for their long and grievous offending, so good a <hi>God</hi>; but that <hi>sorrow is</hi> soon <hi>turned into joy,</hi> and abundantly recompenced. When the <hi>Angel</hi> had <hi>troubled the waters,</hi> in the <hi>Fool of Bethesda:</hi> then stept in those that were <hi>diseased, and infirm</hi>; and were <hi>healed.</hi> It is <hi>Christs</hi> manner, to <hi>trouble our souls</hi> first, and then to come with <hi>healing in his wings.</hi> Yea the very teares of repentance are sweet: whereas the covetous mans heart, <hi>even in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102698:284"/>
laughing is sorrowfull, and the end of that mirth is heaviness,</hi> Prov. 14.13.</p>
                     <p>An evil life, sales <hi>Seneca,</hi> causeth an unquiet mind: for as the least <hi>moat in the eye,</hi> hinders the <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>sight</hi> of it; or as the least <hi>gravell in the shooe,</hi> hinders the <hi>traveller</hi> in his comfortable <hi>going</hi>; or as the least <hi>bone in the throat,</hi> hinders our <hi>eating,</hi> and threatens to <hi>choake</hi> us: So the least <hi>sinne in the soul</hi> unrepented of, hinders the <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> thereof. But least (which is not likely) I should glut you with joy, observe with me</p>
                     <p>In the eighth place, That there is nothing can be wanting to a man, but grace and <hi>Gods</hi> favour will more than supply it. When reverend <hi>Calvin</hi> was upbraided by the <hi>Papists,</hi> with the <hi>want of Children in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> he could answer; That is nothing, for <hi>God</hi> hath instead of such children, given me <hi>many thousand children, of far more excellent kind,</hi> and of nobler breed through the whole <hi>world.</hi> And surely a man shall see, the <hi>Noblest works and Foundations,</hi> have proceeded from <hi>childlesse men</hi>: which have sought to expresse the <hi>Images of their minds,</hi> where those of their <hi>bodies</hi> have failed.</p>

                     <p>Ninthly, <hi>Godlinesse hath the Promises</hi> not only <hi>of this life, but</hi> also <hi>of that which is to come.</hi> The quintessence whereof consists in these two things; <hi>freedom from all pain, fruition of all pleasure,</hi> which is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of <hi>Christ</hi> for his followers. For when he sits upon his <hi>Throne,</hi> he shall say unto them, and only to them: <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from before the foundation of the world: where are such joyes, as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,</hi> &amp;c. And are there any <hi>pleasures,</hi> like those <hi>at the right hand of God for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more?</hi> Whereas to those, that have not had the <hi>grace,</hi> nor the <hi>wit</hi> to serve him; he shall say, <hi>Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> And is there any pain, like the separation from <hi>Christ,</hi> into everlasting and ever-flaming fire? <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. Think of this, you that prefer the service of <hi>sinne</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> before that of our <hi>Saviours. Heaven</hi> you will confesse to be <hi>best of all</hi>; yet for <hi>Heaven</hi> you will use labour <hi>least of all.</hi> For I may boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, your <hi>covetous man, takes more paines to goe to hell; than do the godly to get to Heaven: he riseth early,</hi> and resteth late, and <hi>eates the</hi> course <hi>bread of sorrow</hi>; and after a great deal of tedious and odious misery, goes to the <hi>Devil</hi> for his labour. But look to it, this will one day cost men dear: For it will be the very <hi>hell of hell,</hi> when they shall call to mind, that they have <hi>loved their sinnes, more than their Saviour, or their own souls.</hi> When they shall remember, what love and mercy, hath been almost enforced upon them; and yet they would by all meanes, and that of free choice perish.</p>
                     <p>Now I might go on to other Particulars, yea I might almost be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in these things: but having said <hi>enough,</hi> to be thought <hi>too much:</hi> I will mention no more, only let me a little apply it. Wee see that the <hi>shadow,</hi> does not more inseparably follow the <hi>body</hi>: than all <hi>blessings</hi> follow <hi>grace. Bodily exercise profiteth little, but godlinesse
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102698:284"/>
it profitable unto all things,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. as having <hi>the Promises of the life present,</hi> and <hi>of that which is to come.</hi> Men talk much of <hi>the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers stone,</hi> that it turneth <hi>copper into gold:</hi> of <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> that it had all things necessary for food in it: of the <hi>Herb Panace,</hi> that it is instead of <hi>all purges,</hi> and cureth <hi>all diseases:</hi> of the <hi>Herb Nepenthes,</hi> that it procureth <hi>all delights:</hi> of <hi>Vulcans Armour,</hi> that it was of proof against <hi>all thrusts and blows.</hi> Yea, <hi>Pliny</hi> speaks of no lesse, than <hi>three hundred and sixty benefits,</hi> that may be made of <hi>the Palme tree,</hi> if we will believe him. But whether these things be so or not, it much matters not: this I am sure of, that what they did vainly attribute to these rarities, for <hi>bodily</hi> and <hi>transitory good</hi>; we may with full measure, and without any hyperbole, justly ascribe to <hi>grace and Gods favour, for spiritual.</hi> So that <hi>Religion, Piety,</hi> and <hi>Holinesse,</hi> are <hi>Mistresses</hi> worthy your <hi>service.</hi> Yea, all other <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Fools may contemn them, who cannot judge of true intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al beauty: but if they had our eyes, they culd not but be ravished with admiration of the same.

                     <p>All which being so apparant, and undeniable: mens wisest and surest way were, as one would think, to become the Servants of <hi>God,</hi> and be as industrious after <hi>grace,</hi> as they have been after <hi>gold.</hi> For in common reason, who would eat <hi>huskes</hi> with the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> when if he will but <hi>return home,</hi> he shall be honourably entertained, by his <hi>heavenly Father?</hi> have so good cheer and banqueting, hear so great melody, joy and triumph?

                        <hi>Objection:</hi> But will some say, How shall we obtain this happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? It is not so easie a matter to become gracious, and to gain the favour of <hi>God,</hi> as you seem to make it.</p>
                     <p>I Answer Yes, this may easily be helped, if thou hast a mind to it. For as when a man would have <hi>those things</hi> to be <hi>on his right hand,</hi> which are now <hi>on his left</hi>: it is but <hi>turning himself,</hi> and the work is done: so do but <hi>turn your affections from earthly things, to things celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and heavenly</hi>; the case will be so altered, that you will think your self, as a <hi>blind</hi> man <hi>restored to sight,</hi> a <hi>mad man</hi> to his <hi>senses,</hi> a <hi>prisoner set at liberty,</hi> a <hi>begger advanced</hi> to a vast estate, and as one <hi>vexed with an evil spirit,</hi> or troubled with a <hi>tormenting conscience,</hi> to such a blessed <hi>peace, as the world can neither give nor take away,</hi> John 14.27. As thus:</p>
                     <p>Would you quiet your clamorous conscience, that will not be friends with you, unlesse you be friends with <hi>God?</hi> The <hi>ayer</hi> is not so <hi>cleer,</hi> when the <hi>clowde</hi> is <hi>dissolved</hi> by <hi>rain,</hi> as the <hi>mind</hi> is, when the <hi>clowdes</hi> of our <hi>iniquities</hi> are dissolved by the rain, or <hi>tears of</hi> true <hi>repentance.</hi> These <hi>waters,</hi> are the <hi>red sea,</hi> wherein the whole <hi>Arm</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:102698:285"/>
of our <hi>sinnes</hi> is <hi>drowned.</hi> As O the calm spirit of a godly man! his very dreams are divine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When Ptolomy King of Aegypt,</hi> had posed the <hi>Seaventy Interpreters</hi> in order, and asked the <hi>nineteenth</hi> man, what would make one <hi>sleep quietly in the night:</hi> he told him the best way was, to have divine and celestial Meditations, and to use honest actions and recreations <hi>in the day time.</hi> The godly man enjoyes <hi>Heaven</hi> upon <hi>earth, peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and <hi>joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> 1 Thes. 1.6. Nor is <hi>joy</hi> lesse, when it is least expressed, (as it fares with <hi>grief</hi>) but as <hi>the windowes of the Temple</hi> were <hi>narrow</hi> without, but <hi>broad</hi> within; so is the joy of our hearts, greater than it does outwardly appear to the world.</p>
                     <p>Again, It is as false a slander as common, that when once a man imbraceth <hi>Religion,</hi> farewell all joy and delight. For virtue hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so crabbed a face, nor so stern a look, as men make her. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is not gone, when sinne is gone. It is not <hi>Isaac</hi> that is <hi>sacrificed,</hi> that is our <hi>laughter</hi> and <hi>mirth</hi>; but the <hi>Ramme,</hi> that is the bruitishnesse of it. <hi>The soul of joy,</hi> lies in the <hi>souls joy.</hi> What saies <hi>holy David? Be glad ye righteous, and rejoyce in the Lord; and be joyfull all ye that are upright in heart,</hi> Psal. 32.11. It was not the <hi>Eunuchs riches,</hi> nor <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> but his <hi>faith,</hi> which set him on his <hi>way rejoycing,</hi> Act. 8.39. <hi>In this rejoyce not,</hi> (saith <hi>our Saviour,</hi>) <hi>that the spirits are subdued unto you: but rather rejoyce, that your names are written in Heaven,</hi> Luke 10.20. Yea, there is even <hi>joy in grief,</hi> where the <hi>sorrow</hi> is <hi>for sinne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides, how can men partake of that fountain of joy, and rejoyce not? He is no good <hi>Christian,</hi> that is not taken with the glory he shall have, and <hi>rejoyce that his name is written in the Book of life.</hi> The world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man hath <hi>joy in prosperity,</hi> the Child of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>adversity.</hi> The believing <hi>Hebrews suffered with joy, the spoyling of their goods, knowing that they had in Heaven, a better and more enduring substance,</hi> Heb. 10.34. Yea, let the worst that can come, they are still merry and joyfull: as hath been observed in sundry of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who clapt their hands for joy, even in the midst of the flames. And reason good, when <hi>all things shall work to their good, that are good</hi>: and when the very draught, and <hi>abridgment of Heaven,</hi> is in every <hi>sanctified heart upon earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then <hi>live religiously,</hi> and thou shalt both <hi>live and die comfortably:</hi> For <hi>live in grace,</hi> and <hi>die in peace,</hi> is a rule that never fails. Only this hinders our joy, our <hi>love to spiritual things</hi> is <hi>too defective; of worldly things too excessive. Earthly goods</hi> are earnestly and <hi>eagerly</hi> sought after; <hi>Heavenly not</hi> once <hi>thought upon. Much travell</hi> taken for the <hi>body, little</hi> or no care used <hi>for the soul.</hi> It would be otherwise, if with <hi>Paul</hi> at his conversion, they had those <hi>scales</hi> taken away <hi>from their eyes,</hi> by some <hi>godly Ananias,</hi> some faithfull <hi>Minister of the Gospel</hi>: which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their natural condition, covers their eyes from seeing things spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. It is a sad thing to see, what <hi>fools</hi> men are, that <hi>walk according to the flesh</hi>; and how they are gulled by the <hi>God of this world,</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102698:285"/>
their own <hi>deceitfull hearts.</hi> The <hi>covetous man</hi> is like <hi>a mad man,</hi> that loves and is unmeasurably delighted, with the sight and <hi>gingling</hi> of those <hi>chains,</hi> wherewith he is <hi>fettered</hi> and tormented. He hugs them, (I mean his money) and adores them; and even makes them his <hi>god,</hi> that occasion him all his grief. But had he once <hi>tasted how good, and bountifull the Lord is,</hi> to those that set their delight on him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. If he did <hi>grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Iesus Christ,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18. If the Lord, would once <hi>incline</hi> his <hi>heart, unto his testimonies, and not to covetousnesse,</hi> Psal. 119.36. he should soon know and find, that <hi>things</hi> themselves are in the <hi>invisible world</hi>; in the <hi>world visible,</hi> but their <hi>shaddows</hi> only. That wicked men injoy whatsoever they have, <hi>viz. wealth, honour, wisdome, pleasure,</hi> &amp;c. but as it were in a dream. They <hi>dream</hi> they are <hi>rich, wise, happy,</hi> and the like; as a <hi>begger</hi> may <hi>dream he is a King:</hi> Or one that is ready to <hi>starve,</hi> that he is richly furnished with all manner <hi>of meats and drinkes</hi>: but when once he is awake, he findes himself grossely mistaken.

The <hi>sweetnesse of sinne,</hi> is but as the <hi>sweetnesse of poyson: sweet</hi> only <hi>in the mouth,</hi> in the <hi>belly bitter</hi> and <hi>deadly. Stolen bread is sweet; sweet</hi> in the obtaining, bitter in the account and reckoning. Yea, this <hi>last dish,</hi> will <hi>spoyl</hi> all <hi>the feast</hi>; and make it but like a <hi>drop of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> before a <hi>river of sorrow</hi> and displeasure: Whereas whatsoever the godly feel, is but as <hi>a drop of misery,</hi> before <hi>a river of mercy</hi> and glory.</p>

                     <p>But how unlike to these, are natural men?

But pittifully do they erre in every thing, that are not instructed by the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit. The natural man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foollishnesse unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned But he that is spiritual, discerneth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14, 15. which is a text or lesson worthy to be learned, of all that are in their natural estate. O that they would but seriously ponder the words! For then they would see, that simple or <hi>shallow honesty,</hi> will prove more profitable in the end, than the <hi>profound quick-sands of craft and policy</hi>: Then their <hi>neglect</hi> would not be <hi>most</hi> in that, wherein their <hi>care</hi> should be the <hi>greatest.</hi> But the <hi>world</hi> hath alwaies had a mean and base e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, and therefore no marvell, if they esteem so little of his grace and Spirit.

                     <p>But hear another reason why miserable muckworms are so tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported with earthly trash, which the godly so little regard. A main cause is this; Men of the world, as they know not what the riches of the mind means, so they have no hope of a better life after this. This is <hi>all their Heaven,</hi> and here they have <hi>all their portion,</hi> they are like to have, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.12. <hi>Deliver my soul from the wicked,</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>from men of the world, who have their portion in this life: whose bellyes thou fillest with thy hid treasure; their children have enough, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes,</hi> Psal. 17.14. But my teeth shall not water after their dainties. <hi>Wo be to you that are rich,</hi> (saith our <hi>Saviour</hi>) <hi>for ye have received your consolation,</hi> Luke 6.24. <hi>All here, none hereafter:</hi> and hereupon they covet riches, and honours, and pleasures so excessively, and insatiably. Nor can it be otherwise in reason; for nothing but the assurance of <hi>heavenly things,</hi> makes us wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with <hi>earthly things.</hi> Neither can he contemn this life, that knows not the other. But this is the priviledge of Piety; The <hi>rich man,</hi> hath not so much advantage of the <hi>poor</hi> in <hi>injoying,</hi> as the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>poor</hi> hath of the <hi>rich</hi> in <hi>leaving.</hi> Neither is the poor man, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pounds behind the rich for <hi>this world,</hi> as he may be talents before him for the <hi>world to come.</hi> So that there is no learning this art, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being religious: For you will be <hi>covetous, untill</hi> you be <hi>gracious.</hi> And during the time of your greedinesse, you shall never be satisfied; because happinesse is tied to goodnesse, by the chain of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</p>

                     <p>As in <hi>generation,</hi> so in <hi>regeneration: Cor primum vivit</hi>: life begins at the heart.

Yea out of the abundance of the heart, the <hi>head deviseth,</hi> the <hi>eye seeth,</hi> the <hi>ear heareth,</hi> the <hi>hand worketh,</hi> the <hi>foot walketh.</hi> A man may apply his <hi>ears,</hi> and his <hi>eyes,</hi> (as many blockheads do) to his <hi>Book,</hi> and yet never prove <hi>Scholar:</hi> but from that day, which a man begins to apply his <hi>heart unto wisdome,</hi> he learneth more in <hi>a moment after,</hi> than he did in <hi>a year before</hi>; nay, than ever he did in all his life. As you see the wicked, because they apply their hearts to wickednesse, how fast they proceed? how easily, and how quickly they become perfect <hi>Swearers,</hi> perfect <hi>Drunkards,</hi> cunning <hi>Deceivers,</hi> &amp;c.?</p>
                     <p>The heart is like <hi>the fire, which kindleth the sacrifice,</hi> 1 Kings 18.38. And indeed, if the <hi>tongue,</hi> or the <hi>hand,</hi> or the <hi>ear,</hi> think to serve <hi>God</hi> without the <hi>heart,</hi> it is the irksomest occupation in the world. But as the <hi>Sunne riseth</hi> first, and then the <hi>beasts</hi> arise from their <hi>dens,</hi> the <hi>fowles</hi> from their <hi>nests,</hi> and <hi>men</hi> from their <hi>beds:</hi> so when the heart sets forward to serve <hi>God,</hi> all the members will follow after it; the <hi>tongue</hi> will <hi>praise</hi> him, the <hi>foot</hi> will <hi>follow</hi> him, the <hi>ear</hi> will <hi>attend</hi> him, the <hi>eye</hi> will <hi>watch</hi> him, the <hi>hand</hi> will <hi>serve</hi> him, nothing will stay after the <hi>heart,</hi> but every one goes like <hi>Handmaids</hi> after their <hi>Mistresse.</hi> Such as the <hi>heart</hi> is, such are the <hi>actions</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> which

                        <hi>bringeth forth good things: and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth evil things,</hi> Matth. 12.25. Therefore as <hi>Christ saith, Make clean within, and all will be clean,</hi> Matth, 35.25, 26. So see your <hi>hearts</hi> be <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>single,</hi> and then all your <hi>actions</hi> will be <hi>holy to the Lord.</hi> If we would be rid of <hi>noysome fowles,</hi> the only way is to destroy <hi>their nests</hi> in every place. A vain and lost labour it is, to stop the <hi>current</hi> of a <hi>stream,</hi> if you go not to the <hi>fountain.</hi> Whence it is that <hi>God</hi> saith, <hi>Give me thine heart,</hi> Prov. 23.26.

As let but the heart be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we shall attend the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and perform all <hi>duties</hi> with delight, cheerfulnesse and alacrity. Whereas to <hi>a carnal heart, holy duties,</hi> as <hi>fasting, praying, hearing,</hi> is so tedious and irksome, that it thinks <hi>one Sabboth,</hi> or <hi>Fast-day,</hi> more tedious and burdensome, than <hi>ten holy daies,</hi> as their consciences will bear me witnesse. Whereas the gracious soul, is more delighted therewith, than his <hi>body</hi> with a well relished <hi>meal.</hi> Touch but the first <hi>linke of a chain,</hi> and all the rest will follow: so set but the <hi>heart</hi> a going, and it is like the <hi>poyse of a clock,</hi> which turns all the <hi>wheels</hi> one way: such an <hi>oyl</hi> is upon the heart, that it makes all <hi>nimble</hi> and current about it: but without the heart, all is mute and dumb. As the <hi>tongue</hi> will not <hi>praise,</hi> because the <hi>heart</hi> doth not <hi>love</hi>; the <hi>ear</hi> doth not <hi>hear,</hi> because the <hi>heart</hi> does not <hi>mind</hi>; the <hi>hand</hi> does not <hi>give,</hi> because the <hi>heart</hi> does not <hi>pitty</hi>; the <hi>foot</hi> will not <hi>go,</hi> because the <hi>heart</hi> hath no <hi>affection.</hi> All stay upon the <hi>heart,</hi> like the <hi>Captain</hi> that should give the <hi>onset.</hi> Nor is any service we can do accepted, without the <hi>heart and affections flowing thence.</hi> Therefore <hi>Davids</hi> prayer is, <hi>Create in me a new heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new a right spirit within me,</hi> Psal. 51.10. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> did <hi>fast,</hi> and <hi>watch,</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>read,</hi> and <hi>give,</hi> and <hi>do</hi> all that we can do: and yet <hi>Christ rewarded</hi> all their works with a <hi>wo,</hi> because they wanted a good heart, and true affections flowing thence. They <hi>honoured God with their lips, but their hearts were far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him.</hi> Whence he also calls them <hi>hypocrites,</hi> Mark. 7.6.

Yet when he speaks of his doing, or suffering, he sheweth that it was <hi>because the love of God, was shed abroad in his heart, by the holy Ghost, which was given him,</hi> Rom. 5.5.

Wherefore as when <hi>David</hi> came to fight with <hi>Goliah,</hi> he cast away <hi>Sauls armour:</hi> so let us in this case, cast away all trust and confidence in our selves, and only set forward in the Name of the <hi>Lord God of Israel.</hi> If we trust to our own resistance, <hi>we cannot stand: we cannot miscarry,</hi> if we trust to his.</p>
                     <p>Yet this is to be considered, that <hi>God</hi> does not work upon us as upon <hi>blocks,</hi> and <hi>stones,</hi> in all and every respect <hi>passive</hi>: but <hi>converts our wils, to will our own conversion.</hi> He that <hi>made</hi> thee without thy self, will not <hi>justifie,</hi> nor <hi>save</hi> thee without thy self: Without thy merit indeed, not without thine endeavour. When those <hi>deadly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> were <hi>healed</hi> by the <hi>Prophet,</hi> the outward act must be his, the power <hi>Gods:</hi> he cast the <hi>salt into the spring,</hi> and said, <hi>Yhus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters, there shall not be from thence, any more death or barrennesse. Elisha</hi> was the <hi>Instrument,</hi> but far was he from challenging ought to himself.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore be sure to use that power, which <hi>Christ</hi> shall give thee, and then my soul for thine, he will not be wanting on his part.

                     <p>Or more particularly thus: In the first place, He <hi>gave us our selves,</hi> and all the <hi>creatures</hi> to be <hi>our servants</hi>; yea, he <hi>created us after his own Image, in righteousnesse and holinesse, and in perfect knowledge of the truth,</hi> with a power to stand, and for ever to continue in a most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and happy condition; and this deserves all possible thankfulnesse. But this was nothing in comparison. For when we were in a sad condition; when we had forfeited all this, and our selves: when by sinne we had turned that <hi>Image of God,</hi> into the <hi>Image of Satan,</hi> and wilfully plunged our souls and bodies into eternal torments; when we were become his enemies, mortally hating him, and to our utmost fighting against him, and taking part with his only enemies, (<hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi>) not having the least thought or desire of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement, but a perverse and obstinate will to resist all means tending thereunto; He did redeem us, not only without asking, but even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our wils: so making of us (his cursed enemies) servants, of servants <hi>sons,</hi> of sons <hi>heirs,</hi> and <hi>coheirs with Christ,</hi> Gal 4.7.

besides <hi>Christ</hi> that could have satisfied <hi>Gods</hi> justice, and merited <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> for us, then, O then! <hi>God,</hi> in his infinite wisdom and goodnesse, did not only find out a way to satisfie his Justice and the Law, but <hi>gave us his Sonne, his only begotten Son,</hi> his only beloved Son out of his bosome: And his Son gave himself to die, even the most shamefull, painfull, and cursed death of the Crosse <hi>to redeem us; That whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life,</hi> John 3.16. The very thought of which death, before he come to it, together with the weight and burthen of our sinnes, put him into such an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony in the Garden, that it made him to <hi>sweat, even drops of blood.</hi> A mercy bestowed, and a way found out, that may astonish all the sonnes of <hi>men</hi> on <hi>earth,</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi>! Wherefore, O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this, you that wonder at nothing! That the Lord should come with such a price to redeem our worse than lost souls, and to bring salvation to us, even against our wils. The <hi>Lord Iesus Christ being rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9. Even the eternal <hi>God</hi> would die, that we might not die eternally; O the deepnesse of <hi>Gods</hi> love! O the unmeasurable measure of his bounty! O Son of <hi>God</hi>! who can sufficiently expresse thy love? Or, commend thy pity? Or, extol thy praise? It was a wonder, that thou madest us for thy self, more that thou madest thy self man for us; but most of all, that thou shouldest unmake thy self, that thou shouldest die to save us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And which is further considerable, It cost <hi>God</hi> more to redeem the world, than to make it. In the <hi>Creation</hi> he gave thee <hi>thy self</hi>; but in the <hi>Redemption</hi> he gave thee himself. The <hi>Creation</hi> of all things <hi>cost</hi> him but <hi>six daies</hi> to finish it; the <hi>Redemption</hi> of man cost him <hi>three and thirty years.</hi> In the <hi>Creation of the world.</hi> he did but only <hi>speak</hi> the word; in the <hi>Redemption of man,</hi> he both <hi>spake</hi> and <hi>wept,</hi> and <hi>sweat,</hi> and <hi>bled,</hi> and <hi>died,</hi> and did <hi>many</hi> wonderfull <hi>things</hi> to do it: Yea, the <hi>saving of one soul</hi> single, is more and greater than the <hi>making</hi> of the <hi>whole world.</hi> In every new <hi>creature</hi> are a number of <hi>Miracles,</hi> a <hi>blinde</hi> man is <hi>restored</hi> to <hi>sight,</hi> a <hi>deaf</hi> man to <hi>hearing,</hi> a man <hi>possest</hi> with many Devils <hi>dis-possest</hi>; yea, a <hi>dead</hi> man raised from the <hi>dead,</hi> and in every one a <hi>stone</hi> turned into <hi>flesh,</hi> in all which God <hi>meets</hi> with nothing but <hi>opposition,</hi> which in the <hi>Creation</hi> he met not with.</p>
                     <p>What shall I say? <hi>God</hi> of his goodnesse hath bestowed so many and so great mercies upon us, that it is not possible to expresse his bounty therein; for if we look <hi>inward,</hi> we find our <hi>Creators</hi> mercies; if we look <hi>upward,</hi> his mercy reacheth unto the <hi>Heavens</hi>; if <hi>downwards,</hi> the <hi>earth</hi> is full of his goodnesse, and so is the broad Sea; if we look <hi>about us,</hi> what is it that he hath not given us? <hi>Air</hi> to breathe in, <hi>fire</hi> to warm us, <hi>water</hi> to cool and cleanse us, <hi>cloathes</hi> to cover us, <hi>food</hi> to nourish us, <hi>fruits</hi> to refresh us; yea, <hi>Delicates</hi> to please us, <hi>Beasts</hi> to serve us, <hi>Angels</hi> to attend us, <hi>Heaven</hi> to receive us; And which is above all, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     <p>But the better to illustrate, and set out this Love; it will be good to branch it out into some more Particulars. As</p>
                     <p>First, Call to mind all these <hi>external, inferiour, earthly</hi> and <hi>temporal benefits</hi>; as that your <hi>being, breathing, life, motion, reason,</hi> is from <hi>God.</hi> That he hath given you a more <hi>noble nature,</hi> than the rest of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; excellent <hi>faculties of mind, perfection of senses, soundnesse of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, competency of estate, seemlyness of condition, fitnesse of calling, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation from dangers, rescue out of miseries, kindnesse of friends, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of education, honesty of reputation, liberty of recreations, quietnesse of life, opportunity of well-doing, protection of Angels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then rise higher to his <hi>Spiritual favours,</hi> though here on earth; and strive to raise your affections with your thoughts. Blesse <hi>God,</hi> that you were <hi>born in the light of the Gospel,</hi> for your <hi>profession of the truth,</hi> for the <hi>honour of your vocation,</hi> for your <hi>incorporating into the Church,</hi> for the <hi>priviledge of the Sacraments,</hi> the <hi>free use of the Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints,</hi> the <hi>benefit of their prayers,</hi> the <hi>aid of their counsels,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102698:290"/>
foot-steps of Faith, Hope, Love, Zeal, Patience, Peace, Ioy, conscionable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> for any desire of more.</p>
                     <p>Then let your soul mount highest of all, into her <hi>Heaven,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge those <hi>Celestial Graces</hi>; of her <hi>Election to Glory, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Shame, Death, and Hell,</hi> of the <hi>Intercession of her Saviour,</hi> of the <hi>Preparation of her Place</hi>; And there let her stay a while, upon the meditation of her <hi>future Ioyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This or the like do, and it will teach you <hi>where</hi> to <hi>beg blessings when you want them,</hi> and <hi>whom</hi> to <hi>thank when you have them.</hi> For as the <hi>Sea</hi> is that <hi>great Cistern,</hi> to recieve the confluence of all <hi>waters</hi>: as first from that large and vast <hi>pond, water</hi> is derived into all parts of the <hi>earth,</hi> by <hi>veines</hi> and <hi>springs,</hi> those <hi>springs</hi> run into <hi>rivers,</hi> and those <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> empty themselves again into the <hi>Sea</hi>: so all <hi>blessings</hi> come <hi>from God,</hi> and all <hi>praises</hi> must be returned <hi>to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we <hi>have</hi> any thing that is <hi>good, God</hi> is the <hi>giver</hi> of it. If we do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing <hi>well,</hi> he is the <hi>Authour</hi> of it. <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Alpha,</hi> the <hi>fountain</hi> from which all <hi>grace springs</hi>; and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>sea</hi> to which all <hi>glory</hi> runnes. All <hi>blessings</hi> come from him, like so many <hi>lines</hi> from the <hi>center</hi> to the <hi>circumference:</hi> therefore we must return all <hi>praises</hi> to him, like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>lines</hi> from the <hi>circumference</hi> to the <hi>center, Rom.</hi> 11.36. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. His <hi>wisdom</hi> he communicates, and his <hi>justice</hi> he distributes; and his <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse</hi> he imparts, and his <hi>mercy</hi> he bestowes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30, 31. but his <hi>glory he will not give to another,</hi> Isai. 42.8.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all; yea, what can we think of, that can be thought sufficient, to render unto <hi>the Lord our God, so good and gracious,</hi> in way of thankfulnesse for all these his mercies? For in reason hath he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived so many waies to <hi>save us</hi>; and should not we take all occasions to <hi>glorifie him?</hi> Hath he done so much <hi>for us,</hi> and shall we deny him any thing that he requireth of us, though it were our <hi>lives,</hi> yea our <hi>souls</hi>; much more our <hi>lusts?</hi> We have exceeding <hi>hard hearts,</hi> if the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>Lamb</hi> cannot soften them: <hi>stony bowels,</hi> if so many mercies cannot melt them. Was <hi>Christ</hi> crucified for our sins? and should we by our sins crucifie him again?</p>
                     <p>Now the meditation of what God and Christ hath done for thee, will wonderfully inflame thee with the love of <hi>God,</hi> and thy <hi>Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>; and withall make thee abhor thy self, for thy former unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse. It will make thee break out into some such expression as this, <hi>Praised be the Lord, even the God of our salvation, who loadeth us daily with benefits, Selah,</hi> Psal. 68.19. <hi>The eyes of all wait upon thee, and thou givest them their meat, in due season; thou openest thine hand, and fillest all things living of thy good pleasure,</hi> Psal. 145.15, 16. <hi>To come to promotion, is neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south: but God is the Iudge, he maketh low, and he maketh high,</hi> Psal. 75.6, 7. And so of all other mercies and deliverances.</p>
                     <p>He that confers a Benefit, upon a gratefull nature, robs him of his liberty, and self also: and in one and the same act makes him a vassal,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102698:290"/>
will make us to direct all our <hi>thoughts, speeches,</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> to his <hi>glory,</hi> as he hath directed our <hi>eternal salvation</hi> thereunto.</p>
                     <p>But to help and further you herein, if you be willing so to do, take these few Directions.</p>
                     <p>First, Let these things be never out of the <hi>minds, memories,</hi> and <hi>mouthes</hi> of those whom <hi>Christ hath done thus for.</hi> O let us (I say) <hi>remember,</hi> as we should <hi>never forget! Si totum me debeo pro me facto, quid jam reddam pro me refecto,</hi> saith holy <hi>Bernard.</hi> If I owed my whole self unto thee, for giving me <hi>my self</hi> in my <hi>creation:</hi> what have I left to pay for giving <hi>thy self</hi> for me to so cruel a death, to procure my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> which was not so cheap as my Creation? Great was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that thou wouldst <hi>create me of nothing</hi>; but what tongue can sufficiently expresse the greatnesse of this grace, that thou didst <hi>redeem</hi> me with so dear a price, <hi>when</hi> I was <hi>worse than nothing?</hi> We are full of thy goodnesse: O let our hearts run over with thankfulnesse! Yea, let so many of us, as have either <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>brain,</hi> in the next place say, <hi>O Lord, What is man that thou art so mindfull of him?</hi> Psal. 8.4. And <hi>O man,</hi> what is God that thou art so <hi>unmindfull</hi> of him? And then conclude with, <hi>What shall I render unto thee, O Lord, for all these thy benefits?</hi> but <hi>love</hi> thee my <hi>Creatour,</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and become a <hi>new creature.</hi> I will serve thee, <hi>O Lord,</hi> by the assistance of thy grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast given me <hi>my self:</hi> but much more honour thee, because thou hast given me <hi>thy Son Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor can any man in common reason meditate so unbottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a love, and not study and strive for an answerably thankfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanure. If a <hi>friend</hi> had given us but a thousand part of what <hi>God</hi> hath, we should heartily love him all our lives, and think no thanks sufficient, but to him that hath given me all things, I have scarce given so much as thanks. Yea, I have striven to multiply offences against him, and to make them as infinite in number as his blessings.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The continual meditation of what <hi>God</hi> hath done for thee, will make thee do, what thou art able for him again. For did <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> do all this for us? and shall we do nothing for him again? Like favours, require like gratitude.</p>
                     <p>This then, should at least make us part with our <hi>nearest, dearest,</hi> and <hi>sweetest darling sins,</hi> to serve him in <hi>righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>holinesse</hi> every <hi>day,</hi> every <hi>hour,</hi> all the <hi>daies</hi> of our <hi>lives.</hi> Even every sin; for what sin should be so dear to us, as <hi>Gods</hi> only Son was to him? Do we then for <hi>Gods sake</hi> not spare our <hi>dearest sin</hi>; when <hi>God</hi> for <hi>our sakes,</hi> did not spare his <hi>dearest Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, what a bruitish and barbarous unthankfulnesse, and shame were it, that <hi>God</hi> should part with his Son, and his Son with his own precious blood for us, and we not part with our sinfull lusts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights for him?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Hath <hi>Christ</hi> done all this for us, his servants, so much, and so many waies obliged unto him? let us do what we are able for him again. 1. Let us be zealous for his glory, and take his part when we
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102698:291"/>
see or hear him dishonoured. Nor can there be any love, where there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> no zeal, saith <hi>Augustine.</hi> Well-born Children are touched to the quick, with the injuries of their Parents. And it is a base, vile, and unjust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude in those men, that can endure the disgrace of them, under whose shelter they live. 2. Let us seek to draw others after us, from <hi>Satan</hi> to Him. 3. Do we all we can, to promote his worship and service. 4. Take we all good occasions to publish to others, how good <hi>God</hi> is; and what he hath done for us. 5. Let us wholly ascribe all the good we have, or do to free grace; and give him the glory of his gifts, imploying them to our Masters best advantage, 6. Let us (that we may expresse our thankfulnesse to him) shew kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to his Children, and poor <hi>members, who are bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh,</hi> Ephes. 5 30. 7. Abhor we our selves for our former unthankfulnesse, and our wonderfull provoking of him. 8. Hearken we unto <hi>Christs</hi> voice, in all that he saith unto us; and expresse our thankfulnesse by our obedience. Yea, all this let us do, if we do it but for our own sakes: For what should we have, if we did thus serve <hi>Christ,</hi> who hath done all these things for his enemies neglecting and dishonouring him?</p>

                  <div n="16" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. XVI.</head>
                     <p>But thou wilt say, What can we do for <hi>God,</hi> or for <hi>Christ?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Answer, We cannot properly benefit <hi>God,</hi> nor add to his fulnesse. They <hi>can add no good to him,</hi> that have <hi>all their good from him.</hi> The Ocean is never the fuller, though all the <hi>rivers</hi> of the world, <hi>flow into the</hi> same: So, What is <hi>God</hi> the better, for our praises or performances, to whom (in that he is infinite) nothing can be added? <hi>If we be righteous, our righteousnesse may profit the sonnes of men; but what can we give unto him? or what receiveth he at our hands?</hi> Can the <hi>Sun</hi> receive <hi>light</hi> from a <hi>candle?</hi> What profit does the <hi>Sunne</hi> receive, by our <hi>look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it?</hi> We are <hi>the better</hi> for its <hi>light,</hi> not it for <hi>our sight</hi>; or at all prejudiced by our neglect. <hi>A shower of rain</hi> that <hi>waters the earth,</hi> gets nothing to it self: the <hi>earth</hi> fares the better for it. <hi>Lord</hi> (saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>) <hi>our well-doing doth not at all extend unto thee; but to the Saints that are on the earth, and to the excellent ones in whom is all my delight,</hi> Psal. 16.2, 3. Yea, if we could give him our <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>souls,</hi> they should be saved by it, but he were never the better for them. It is for our good, that he would be served, and magnified of us.</p>
                     <p>True, as the <hi>Ocean</hi> daynes to take <hi>tribute</hi> of the <hi>small brooks,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that in token of thankfulnesse, which was its own before, it being the <hi>maintainer of the rivers streams:</hi> Or as <hi>Ioseph</hi> accepted of his <hi>Brethrens</hi> small <hi>gifts,</hi> albeit he had no need of them, <hi>Gen</hi> 43.15. So does <hi>God</hi> accept of our <hi>free-will offerings,</hi> and bountifully rewards them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.18. Yea, if in impolying our <hi>Talents,</hi> we aim at <hi>his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and the <hi>Churches good,</hi> he doubles them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.21, 22, 23.</p>
                     <p>Nor does <hi>God</hi> look for such <hi>glory,</hi> or <hi>service</hi> from us, as he is <hi>worthy to receive,</hi> but as we are <hi>able to give.</hi> Our praises and performances, are not sinnes; yet they are not without some touch of sin. Duties
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102698:291"/>
and infirmities, come from us together: but <hi>Christ</hi> parts them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving the infirmities, and receiving the praises and performances. They are full of weaknesses, yet does not he except against them for their imperfections. He takes them well in worth, though there be no worth in them: and vouchsafes them a reward, which had been sufficiently honoured with a pardon.</p>
                     <p>Neither can we hurt, or take away any thing from him: For <hi>if we be wicked, our wickednesse may hurt a man like our selves; but what is it to him,</hi> Job 35.7, 8. Yet neverthelesse, we may do many things, which he accounts and rewards, as done to himself; of which I will give you one in special, and I pray mind it.</p>
                     <p>Though we can do nothing for <hi>Christ himself,</hi> he being now in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>: yet we may do much for <hi>his poor members, those excellent ones whom David</hi> speakes of <hi>Psalm</hi> 16.2, 3. which <hi>Christ</hi> accounts all one, as if it were done to himself, as appears by many expresse testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. <hi>When I was an hungred, ye fed me; when I was naked, ye cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me; when sick and in prison, ye visited me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For in as much as ye did it unto one of these little ones, that believe in me, ye did it unto me,</hi> Matth. 25.34. to 41. <hi>He that giveth unto the poor, lendeth unto the Lord,</hi> Prov. 19.17. And many the like which I have formerly cited.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVII.</head>
                     <p>Now, do we love <hi>Christ?</hi> or would we indeed expresse our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse <hi>to him,</hi> for what we have received <hi>from him?</hi> Or do we desire to do something again for <hi>Christ,</hi> who hath done and suffered so much for us? here is a way chalked out unto us, which he <hi>prefers before all burnt-offerings and sacrifices,</hi> Mark. 12.33.

                     <p>But to drive home this duty to mens consciences, see further what cause we have to extend our liberality to the relief of Christs poore members; For here I shall take occasion to slide into a discourse, which in the <hi>Title page</hi> 1 durst not once mention, as well knowing how averse most men are, and how desperately most rich mens hearts are hardned against the poore; whereof ile onely give you an instance.</p>
                     <p>Some <hi>six years since,</hi> having taken no small paynes in composing the <hi>Poores Advocate in eight parts, I printed the first two of them</hi> with these words in the front; <hi>That it is an incomparable favour to the rich, that there are poore to accept of their Charity, had they the Wit to know it.</hi> This they no sooner read but their bloods would rise, saying; We must be beholding to the poore to accept of our charity, wee'l see them hanged first. An expression more sit for <hi>a Caniball,</hi> then <hi>a Christian</hi>: And certainly such men had need to look to it in time: for of all men in the world, <hi>they shall have judgement without mercy, that are so</hi> misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>unmercifull.</hi> And I would wish them, to take heed of turning the deaf ear to <hi>Christ,</hi> when in his members he cryes to them for mercy: lest <hi>Christ</hi> turnes the deaf ear to them, when they (being in far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er need) shall cry to him for mercy.</p>
                     <p>Again, (which is worth the observing) when the said two parts took so with the good, that provision was made, &amp; a way thought upon that to every rich man in the Nation, there should be one of them, freely given for the poores good, by the <hi>Clarkes of every Parish,</hi> they (I mean some of them) so abused their trust, that the donor was forced to withdraw his hand: whereby both <hi>Rich and Poore,</hi> might sustain no little loss, the one in <hi>their souls,</hi> the other in <hi>their purses.</hi> For it is well known that <hi>a person of quality</hi> upon the reading of it, sent in many hundred pounds to the our parishes, to be be bestowed by the <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> upon their poore. If any shall think I wrong <hi>Parish Clarkes,</hi> let them but ask <hi>the Clark of Lawrence Church,</hi> whether the then <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Pastour,</hi> did not deliver him <hi>five and fifty</hi> of those <hi>Bookes, with the names of five and fifty rich men in that parish,</hi> together with a great charge to deliver them into every of their hands. And whether he did not most <hi>perfidiously and sacrilegiously</hi> barter them away to the <hi>Booke Women</hi> for other <hi>Bookes,</hi> instead of giving them to the parties. And this (for ile mention no more) I acquaint the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ld with, as tendring the good of <hi>his soul,</hi> more then that of <hi>his honour,</hi> for I have done in private what lies in me, to make him sensible of the crime, but he is the more obstinate.</p>
                     <p>Now that I have taken occasion to shrowd the <hi>Remaines of the poores Advocate,</hi> under the notion of <hi>how to become happy here and hereafter,</hi> these are my reasons.</p>
                     <p>First, Bounty to the poore, is the most proper meanes, tending to happiness. And secondly, it is very probable, that many will read or hear thus far, under this notion (whether out of curiosity or self ends) and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102698:294"/>
having heard hitherto, will be willing also to hear me a few words in behalf of the poore, (which is of no less concernment) when other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they would have heard neither of both. Now such as have read the two first parts of The Poores Advocate, may remember, that I have dispatched <hi>these six heads.</hi> 1. <hi>The necessity of the duty.</hi> 2. <hi>The persons of whom it is required.</hi> 3. <hi>They to whom it must be performed.</hi> 4. <hi>VVhat.</hi> 5. <hi>How.</hi> 6. <hi>How much we are to give.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the other six parts, I intended to have treated, 1. <hi>Of the time when we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that because this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is not grounded upon the excellency and merit of the work, but upon <hi>Gods righteousness and truth,</hi> in fulfilling his promises, according to that <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. <hi>For God is not unrighteous, that he should forget your work and labour of love; which ye have shewed toward his name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that ye have minstred to the Saints, and do minister</hi>; Whereby he implyeth that it is no more possible, that those who in love and obedience, have exercised themselves in these works of mercy, should lose their reward, then that <hi>God</hi> himself should lose his righteousness. <hi>And the wise man</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, that <hi>he who hath pitty on the poore, lendeth unto the Lord, and that which he hath given, he will repay again, Prov.</hi> 19.17.

our selves, that we cannot faster (in a wise and discreet manner) emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty our selves of these waters of <hi>Gods</hi> blessings, for the satisfying and quenching of the poore mans thirst, and relieving of his wants: but we shall again be replenished from the fountain of all goodness; and if like <hi>kind Nurses,</hi> we let these deare <hi>Children of God suck the breasts of our bounty, for their comfort and nourishment</hi>: that which is thus spent will again be restored: whereas if we churlishly refuse to impart, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate this <hi>milk of Gods blessings,</hi> it is the readiest way to have it quite <hi>dried up.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither are we to imagine that if we be carefull in feeding <hi>Christ,</hi> that he will be carelesse in feeding us.

That he will suffer us to want <hi>earthly trifles,</hi> who hath provided for us <hi>heavenly riches.</hi> Let such more then heathenish diffidence, be farre from us, who professe our selves to be of the houshold of Faith.

                     <p>Secondly, we shall not onely receive our own again, but it shall be with great increase. Yea, if the <hi>Word of God</hi> be true, there is not a more compendious way to thrive and grow rich, then by being boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull to the poore: But that bounty is the best and surest way to plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that it is so far from weakning a mans estate, or bringing him to want and poverty, that it is the onely meanes to keep us from it, and to bring plenty and abundance. I have largely and plentifully proved (if you remember) in Chapter the 30. of <hi>The best and surest way to become rich:</hi> And I heartily wish, that the Reader would perule the same: For it is the most piercing and patheticall Chapter of all the parts, and should methinks exceedingly whet on those that are greedy of gaine, to put the same into practice, and make them bountifull in doing these workes of mercy, and not think themselves loosers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; but rather to conclude as a mercifull man once did; <hi>The more I give, the more I have.</hi> As what <hi>Husbandman</hi> does not reckon more of his <hi>seed in the ground,</hi> then of that <hi>in his Barn or Garner?</hi> And shall we be such <hi>Atheists,</hi> as to trust the ground, and not <hi>God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, let us be so far from grudging these Almes to the poor, when we have fit occasion, that we do them with joy and thankfulness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>God,</hi> that he hath given us so fit an opportunity of sowing our seed, that so we may reap a fruitfull harvest.

But thus <hi>God</hi> dealeth with us, when he giveth us op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of relieving the poor: Yea, in truth much better and more ability, for he gives us even the seed also we sow with; and whereas, if a man should freely receive of another, Land to sow his seed in, yet he were not sure of a fruitfull harvest: For many accidents usually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, which cut off the hopes of the most skilfull Husbandman, as <hi>Frosts,</hi> and <hi>Mildewes, wormes</hi> and <hi>locusts, tares</hi> and <hi>weeds,</hi> too much <hi>wet,</hi> or too much <hi>drought</hi> may <hi>destroy the corn,</hi> though the seed were never so good: or when it is <hi>ready for the sickle,</hi> the <hi>enemy</hi> may come and <hi>reap it</hi>; but if we sow these seeds of our beneficence, believing <hi>Gods</hi> promises, and hoping for a happy harvest: we shall never fail of our expectation, because <hi>God</hi> who is infinite in power and truth, having promised a fruitfull <hi>crop,</hi> no outward accident is able to hinder it.</p>
                     <p>But lest what hath been said should not be sufficient to prevail with men to be mercifull to the poore, let them hearken to, and mind well the many <hi>other reasons and inducements</hi> that propound themselves, and then I doubt not, but they will if wise, <hi>do good to others,</hi> if it be but <hi>to do a greater good to themselves.</hi> For of all other graces, the grace of <hi>charity and bounty, hath the most primest promises of reward, to us and ours, both here and hereafter,</hi> of which I will mention some.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, it testifies our unfeigned <hi>repentance,</hi> whereof it is that <hi>Daniel</hi> saith to <hi>Nebuchadnezer; Wherefore O King, break off thy sins by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and thine iniquities, by shewing mercy unto the poore, Dan.</hi> 4:27.

                     <p>Fifthly giving much, is an infallible signe that many sins are forgiven us: as <hi>our Saviour</hi> speaketh of <hi>the woman, Luke</hi> 7.47.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, by it we may know our selves to be the children of God 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14. Yea and others may also know it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.34, 35. And hereby <hi>we know the unmercifull to be none of Gods children:</hi>

                     <p>Seventhly, it is said that <hi>Obadia feared God greatly: for when Iesabel destroied the Prophets of the Lord, he took an hundred Prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave, and he fed them with bread and water,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.3.4.

True they will say they love <hi>God,</hi> and perhaps think so too: but let them say what they will, if unmercifull, I will never believe against Scripture, that they <hi>love God whom they have not seen: that love not their brother whom they have seen; if we love him, we will love one another,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.20, 21. <hi>If any man</hi> (saies the <hi>Apostle</hi>) <hi>have these worlds goods, and seeth his Brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.17. And as they are manifest signes of our love to <hi>God,</hi> so also of our love towards our Neighbours: when as we carry our selves in all Christian bounty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, as unto <hi>Children of the same Father, and members of the same body: suffering with them in their wants</hi>; through compassion and fellow-feeling, <hi>and rejoycing with them in their fulness</hi> and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Hereby we know that we love the brethren: because our hearts and hands are open to them,</hi> for love is bountifull. For otherwise it is but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, counterfeit, and hypocriticall love, to make shew of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and compassion in word, and to perform nothing in deed; as <hi>Saint Iames</hi> plainly affirmeth, <hi>Iames</hi>

For if we be <hi>bountiful in Almes,</hi> we are <hi>plentifull in love</hi>; if we be <hi>slack in giving,</hi> we are <hi>cold in loving:</hi> but if we be utterly defective, in bringing forth these excellent fruits, then it is a manifest sign that this grace of love is not rooted in us, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.17.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, It is an evident demonstration that we have <hi>saving knowledge</hi> and <hi>spiritual wisdom</hi>: for <hi>the wisdom that is from above, is full of mercy and good fruits, Iames</hi> 3.17.

O that this lesson would enter home into every one of our hearts, before we go out of our houses. For men may cry up this side, and cry down that; but of all the three, the <hi>Priest,</hi> the <hi>Levite,</hi> and the <hi>Samaritan</hi>; none but the <hi>Samaritan (that shewed mercy to him that was fallen into the hands of theeves, was wounded, and stript of his rayment,)</hi> was justified and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by our <hi>Saviour, Luke</hi> 10.36, 37.</p>
                     <p>And indeed <hi>God</hi> so highly prizeth, and esteemeth mercy and the works wherein it is exercised towards the poore: that he preferreth them before the outward acts of religious duties. <hi>Hosea</hi> 6.6. <hi>I desired mercy and not sacrifice</hi>: that is rather then sacrifice; This is the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he chiefly requireth, yea, if we but look <hi>Micha</hi> 6. we shall fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourteenthly, By the same meanes also, we give them and others <hi>occasion of praising, and glorifying God: whilest by the experiment of this ministration, they see our professed subjection to the Gospel of Christ,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaketh, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

actions in themselves, do even for the present fill their hearts with joy, who rightly perform them. But much more do they fill our hearts with joy, as they are evident signes to assure us, that we are indued with <hi>Gods</hi> saving graces, and as they do, being fruits of a lively faith, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine us of our future reward, and the fruition of <hi>Gods presence, where there is fulnesse of joy for ever more.</hi> Yea the godly man, gives with more joy and thankfulness of heart, then the other receives the same, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough can bear me witness; Yea <hi>Seneca</hi> an <hi>Heathen</hi> can testifie the same: for he defines a benefit, to be an action proceeding from love, yeilding joy both to him that receiveth it, and much more to him that yeildeth it.</p>
                     <p>Sixteenthly, The inward habit of goodnesse and mercy in our hearts, exercised in the outward actions of liberality &amp; bounty by our hands, makes us to resemble <hi>God</hi> himself; and that in such an attribute, as he delighteth above all others to stile himself withall. For howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is infinite in glory, power, and all perfections: yet most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the <hi>Scriptures, he is called a God of mercy and compassion,</hi> and hereby principally, he maketh himself known unto <hi>Moses,</hi> desiring to see him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. Nor can we in any thing resemble <hi>God</hi> more, then in this grace: and therefore it is our <hi>Saviours</hi> exhortation, that we be <hi>mercifull, as our heavenly Father is mercifull, Luke</hi> 6.36. Now <hi>God gives to all richly to injoy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. Yea, <hi>blessed be God, saies the Church, that daily ladeth us with benefits, that crowneth us with loving kindness, and compasseth us about with new songs of deliverance, Psalm</hi> 103. and 36</p>
                     <p>Therefore seeing mercy and goodness do make us above all other graces to resemble <hi>God,</hi> and then the creature attaineth to greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and blessednesse, when he is the likest, and cometh nearest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the excellency of the <hi>Creator.</hi> And seeing we professe our selves to be <hi>children of our</hi> gracious and glorious <hi>God</hi>: and we can no way grace our selves so much, as by resembling our heavenly Father, in those attributes wherein he most shineth and excelleth: and nothing maketh us more like him, then mercy and compassion: let us hearken unto our <hi>Saviours</hi> injunction, and <hi>imitate our Father in being bountifull as he is.</hi> These are some of the spirituall blessings and benefits which <hi>God</hi> hath promised for reward to the mercifull in this life: it would take up too much time to mention the many more that might be added; therefore I will leave them, and so proceed to those that are eternall, &amp; concern the life to come, which I would have you especially mind: yea if it be possible, pluck up all your senses into your Ears, that you may the more mind, and better remember; for it is enough to ravish any <hi>Christian soul,</hi> and to make him to stretch his estate upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And that not out of love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God,</hi> or the poor, but out of feare of approaching judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that dreadfull account which he must presently make before a just and terrible Judge: Or out of self-love, either that he may gaine the vain glory of the world, or that he may satisfie for his sins, and so es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape eternall condemnation. In which respect he giveth to the poor, and <hi>casts his bread upon the face of the waters, as the Merchant casts his goods into the sea in time of a storme, to preserve the ship from sinking, and himselfe from drowning.</hi> For were he not in danger to make ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of his soul, and of sincking into the gulfe of hell, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he would be no more liberall at his death, then he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been in the whole course of his life.</p>

As he that gives not till he dies, shewes that he would not give if he could help it; and so it appears by their not part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it, till they be plucked from it: For to give when they dye, and when they can keep it no longer, is not worth thanks, it is not in some sense their own to bestow, but rather to be liberall of that which is indeed none of their own, but other mens. <hi>Neither will God then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, or hereafter reward it</hi>; which proves the <hi>covetous man no less foolish, then wicked</hi>; for as <hi>one light carried before</hi> us, does us more good then <hi>many that are brought after:</hi> so does a ltitle given in a mans life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, more benefit him, then thousands at the hour of death.

                     <p>AND so much of the <hi>means</hi> enabling to this duty: Now of <hi>the ends</hi> we are to propound to our selves in the doing of it, wherein I wil bebrief.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, As our Alms or <hi>Works of mercy, should flow from faith, obedience, charity, mercy, unfeigned love; &amp;c.</hi> which are proper onely to true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and such as in <hi>Christ</hi> are first accepted; (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as <hi>a woman</hi> that abides <hi>without an Husband,</hi> all her fruit is but as <hi>an unlegitimate birth</hi>; So <hi>until we be marryed to Christ, all our best works are as bastards</hi>; and no better then <hi>shining sins,</hi> or <hi>beautiful abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> telleth us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23.) So our aim and end must be, <hi>the glory of God, the good of our brethren,</hi> who are refreshed with our Alms, the <hi>adorning of our Profession</hi> with these fruits of Piety, <hi>the edification of others</hi> by our good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>the stopping of the mouths of our Adversaries,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102698:310"/>
our own</hi> present <hi>good,</hi> both in respect of <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> benefits, and <hi>the furthering</hi> and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>our eternal salvation</hi>; all which shews that howsoever any man may give gifts out of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pity; yet onely the <hi>Christian</hi> and godly man, can rightly perform this duty of Alms-deeds; for it is a good work; and there are <hi>none do good, but those that are good</hi>; neither is it possible that there should be <hi>good fruit, unless it sprung from a good Tree</hi>: Charity and Pride do both feed the poor; the one to the praise and glory of God, the other to get praise and glory amongst men; in which Case <hi>God</hi> will not accept, but reject a mans bounty. As when one sent a Present to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> he sent it back again, saying, <hi>He sendeth these Gifts ambitiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly, and it is our ambition to refuse them.</hi> The <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite</hi> aimeth chiefly at his own glory and good, either the obtaining of some worldly benefit, or the avoiding of some temporal or everlasting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; or finally, that he may satisfie <hi>God</hi>'s ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for his sins, make him beholding unto him, and merit at his hands everlasting happiness.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Christian</hi> doth these works of mercy with great humility, remembling that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he giveth to the poor for <hi>Gods</hi> sake, he hath first received it from <hi>God,</hi> with all other blessings which he enjoyeth: In which respect when he doth the most, he acknowledgeth that he doth far less then his duty, and that with much infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and weakness; and therefore in this regard he humbly confesseth that his Almes are <hi>sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rewarded,</hi> if they be graciously <hi>pardoned</hi>; the which, as it maketh him to carry himself <hi>humbly before God,</hi> so also <hi>meekly and gently towards the poore.</hi>
                     </p>

We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so much as give him <hi>gratias,</hi> thanks; unless he first give us <hi>gratiam,</hi> the grace of thankfulness. <hi>God</hi> gives not onely <hi>grace asked,</hi> but <hi>grace to ask</hi>: We cannot be patient under his hand, except his hand give us patience. <hi>God must infuse, before we can effuse.</hi> The <hi>springs</hi> of our hearts must be <hi>filled from that ocean, before we can derive drink to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.</hi> For as the <hi>virtue</hi> attractive <hi>to draw Iron,</hi> is not in the Iron, but <hi>in the Adamant</hi>; so all our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is of <hi>God,</hi> and nothing as our own can we chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, save our defects and infirmities.</p>

The use whereof before we leave it, would be this: First hope we for, but challenge not a reward for our well-doing: yet not for it self, but for what <hi>Christ</hi> hath done for, and by us.</p>
                     <p>Let this be the temper of our spirits, when we do any duty; Do we the work, give <hi>God</hi> the praise, To us the use of his gifts; to him the thanks and glory for ever.

When <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> are friends, then <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Winter, Seed-time</hi> and <hi>Harvest,</hi> run on their race.

                     <p>Again, it is the only way to procure <hi>Gods Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> upon our endeavours: It happened that <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> one day made a curious and learned <hi>Sermon,</hi> for which he expected great applause, but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved none: The next time he made a plain whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Sermon, and it was wonderfully affected, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and commended.

Who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, In the one I preached <hi>Bernard,</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Christ</hi>; in the one I sought to win glory and praise to my self; in the other, the glory of <hi>God,</hi>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:102698:313"/>
and the <hi>salvation of souls,</hi> which received blessing from above, and that made the difference; yea, were there nothing good else in it, yet this were the way to gain true honor:</p>
                     <p>We cannot so much honour our selves, as by seeking to honour <hi>God: To seek a mans own glory,</hi> (says <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>is not glory, Prov.</hi> 25.25.27. but to seek <hi>Gods glory,</hi> is the greatest honour a man can do himself: For as <hi>Cicero</hi> said of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> That in extolling of dead <hi>Pompey,</hi> and erecting his <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> he set up his own: So who are more vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably esteemed and spoken of, then such as are most tender of <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and least seeke their own. They are the <hi>Lord</hi>'s own words to <hi>Saul, They that honour me, I will honour; but they that despise me, shall be lightly esteemed,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30: The way for a man to be esteemed <hi>the greatest,</hi> is to esteem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>the least.</hi> It is humility that makes us accepted both of <hi>God</hi> &amp; <hi>Man,</hi> whereas the contrary makes us hated and abhorred of both: The <hi>Centurion</hi> did many excellent things, but he never did a Work so acceptable in the sight of <hi>Christ,</hi> as was his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming his own Works. While <hi>Saul</hi> vvas little in his ovvn eyes, God made him Head over the <hi>twelve Tribes of Israel,</hi> and gave him his Spirit; but when out of his Greatness he abused his Place and Gifts, <hi>God</hi> took both from him, and gave them to <hi>David,</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> least respected of all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.17.28. &amp; 16.14. Other proofs of such as he will honor, for honoring him, you have <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.21. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3 19, 20. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.19. to 50. as when <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> sought his own honor, honor depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him, and he was made like a Beast; but when he sought God's honor, honor came to him
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102698:314"/>
again, and he was made a <hi>King, Dan.</hi> 4.34. to the end. <hi>Before honour, goeth humility, Prov.</hi> 15.33. But <hi>when pride cometh, then cometh shame, Prov.</hi> 11.2. And commonly great Works undertaken for ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, miss of their end, and turn to the Author's shame; nor have any less praise then they that most hunt after it.</p>
                     <p>It's true, the <hi>Lord</hi> sometimes gives wicked men even what in their thoughts they ask; as some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire riches onely, and God gives it them with a curse; some honor and dignity, and they have it, that their fall may be the greater; others fame and reputation (<hi>as loving the praise of men more then the praise of God</hi>) and these have many times what they aim at; they are extolled to the skies, and that shall be the reward of all the good that ever they do. Lastly, God's people make spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and eternal things, Grace and Glory, and God's favour their onely option, and they have their desire; yea not seldom, are riches and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation super-added, though they seek them not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they seek onely God's <hi>glory</hi> on <hi>Earth</hi>; as for <hi>their own glory,</hi> they let that alone till they come to <hi>Heaven,</hi> knowing that he onely is happily famous, who is known and recorded there: True, he lives so well, that the praise of men (especially good men) will follow; but as I said before, so say I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he wil not follow it, least to <hi>gain the shadow,</hi> he should <hi>lose the substance</hi>; as <hi>Absolom in seeking a Kingdom, lost himself.</hi>

(as those <hi>Reprobates, Luke</hi> 13. alledge unto him their <hi>preaching in Christs Name, &amp; casting out Devils</hi>) <hi>We have fasted</hi> (say they) <hi>and thou seest it not; we have afflicted our selves, and thou takest no notice thereof</hi>; they expect some great reward; but the Lord answers, <hi>Have ye fasted to me</hi>?

No, but in love to your own credit, profit, and such like carnal respects; and therefore look to it (as you love your own souls) for if in doing good, and discharging our places, we have served our selves, and sought our selves rather then God; when we come for his reward, (as <hi>Esau</hi> when he had brought the <hi>Venison,</hi> came for <hi>the blessing,</hi> making himself as sure of it, as if he had had it, before he kneeled for it) God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer will be, Let him reward you whom you have served; <hi>Thou servedst thy self, reward thy self,</hi> if thou wilt; for I never reward any service but mine own: The <hi>Pharisaical giver,</hi> gives to himself, not to <hi>God; Dat sibi non Domino</hi>; He aims at his own praise, what reward can he look for, let him pay himself: But <hi>our Saviour, Mat.</hi> 6. makes the case so plain, that none can question it: <hi>Take heed</hi> (saith he) <hi>that ye do not your almes, that ye pray not, that ye fast not to be seen of men</hi>; otherwise, <hi>ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven, ver.</hi> 1: and in <hi>ver.</hi> 2.5, 16: speaking of the <hi>Scribes and Pharisees,</hi> that did <hi>give</hi> their <hi>Alms, prayed</hi> and <hi>fasted to be seen

And the reason of it is, <hi>Civil mens good works are as a meer Carkase without the soul,</hi> since <hi>Faith</hi> is wanting: Nor is it any excuse before God, to plead that the <hi>matter</hi> of the Work is <hi>good,</hi> when <hi>the end is not so</hi>; for which, see <hi>Isa.</hi> 66:3:</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the proud and unthankful shal lose the reward of all their performances, is not all; for as <hi>thankfulness</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> are the onely means to enrich us with God's Blessings; so <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>unthankfulness</hi> is the onely way to make God withdraw and take from us both himself and his blessings, yea instead thereof to send his curse, and to cross us in all we do, as may be proved plentifully: <hi>When the people became murmurers, it displeased the Lord, and the Lord heard it; therefore his wrath was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed the utmost part of the Host, Numb.</hi> 11.1, 2: <hi>Because the King of Assyria said, By the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of mine Arm have I done it, and by my wisdom, for I am prudent; therefore (saith the Lord) I have removed the borders of the people, and have spoiled their treasures, and have pulled down the Iuhabitants like a valiant man, Esay</hi> 10:13: When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> took the praise of their greatness, wit, &amp; worth, to themselves, which was due to God, you know

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if men <hi>rob him of his Tribute,</hi> or <hi>clip bis Coyn,</hi> he may perhaps <hi>pardon</hi> it: (though that were much, and he is not discreet that will run the hazard.) But if they go about to <hi>take his Crown from him,</hi> there is <hi>no hope of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pardon</hi> for that.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God</hi> is very bountiful in all other things; his <hi>Wisdom he communicates,</hi> and <hi>his Iustice he distributes,</hi> and <hi>his Holiness he imparts,</hi> and <hi>his Mercy he bestows,</hi> and <hi>his onely Son he hath freely given,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30, 31. <hi>But his Glory he will not give to another,</hi> as himself speaks, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.8. And indeed this is the main fruit and return that comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>God</hi> from all his Works. This in the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi> is as the <hi>fat of the burnt-offering</hi> was in <hi>the Old</hi>: and we know <hi>all the fat was the Lords, and he that did eat that, was to be cut off from his people, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 3.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.25. If you will see it in an example, look upon <hi>Herod</hi>; who in stead of giving the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his gifts unto God, took it to himself, and was <hi>cut off from his people, by, or after a strange and unheard of manner, Acts</hi> 12.</p>
                     <p>And thus we see by what hath been said, that if <hi>pride, covetousness, hypocrisie,</hi> or any the <hi>like springs,</hi> shall <hi>set the wheels of our hearts a moving,</hi> our <hi>Honey</hi> will prove but <hi>gall,</hi> and our <hi>Wine, Vinegar</hi>; yea, if these be <hi>the ends</hi> of our doing duties, <hi>such an end will follow it,</hi> as we had <hi>better be without it,</hi> even such <hi>a misery at the end,</hi> as will know <hi>no end of misery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:102698:316"/>Let men therefore beware they rob not <hi>God of his glory,</hi> which he so much stands upon, least <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> by <hi>God</hi>'s just permission, <hi>rob them</hi> of <hi>their souls,</hi> which they ought so much to stand upon.</p>
                     <p>Again secondly, if the Grace of <hi>God</hi> be the <hi>Fountain</hi> from which all our endowments <hi>flow,</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> may be honored by our gifts, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end of our injoying them; let us not so much as <hi>share with God in squinting one eye at Gods, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at our own honor</hi>; Yea if <hi>God</hi> wil reward no Work, nor bless it with his Grace, unless it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to his glory: Let us direct all our <hi>thoughts, speeches, and actions to his glory,</hi> as he hath directed our Eternal Salvation thereunto: Let us make <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega, the first and the last,</hi> of all our actions and endeavours; Let us add this to all our other gifts, that we give the glory of them to <hi>God</hi>: As what else should men propose for their end, then that glory which shal have no end? Yea let us with one unanimous voice say, He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us all the Grace and Happiness we have, and we wil give him all the possible thanks and honor we can; let it be our main request and daily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Teach us, O Lord, to receive the benefit of thy merciful favours, and to return thee the thanks and the glory, and that for ever and ever. And so much of the <hi>Ends,</hi> which we are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to our selves in our beneficence; the <hi>lets and impediments</hi> follow.</p>

                     <p>I Might mention many great lets and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as <hi>Ignorance, Infidelity, Pride, Intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, self-love, hard heartedness,</hi> and other the like,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102698:317"/>
do much hinder mens bounty and liberality to the poor, as may partly appear by what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready delivered; but nothing like Covetousness; yea name but <hi>Covetousnese,</hi> and that includes all the rest. <hi>Covetousness is the Grave of all good,</hi> it makes the heart barren of all good inclinations; and it is a <hi>bad ground where no flower will grow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It cannot be denyed, but enough hath been said in this and <hi>the Poors Advocate,</hi> to perswade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rational man, not onely that there is a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this duty, but sufficient to enflame him with a desire of performing it, according to the utmost of his ability: But so it is, that the <hi>Covetous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> is so far from being prevailed withall, that he will not come so near the same, as to give it the hearing.</p>
                     <p>Or suppose such an one should be so ingenuous as to hear it, there is no hope of prevailing with him: As what think you, when that <hi>rich man, Mark</hi> 10 17. &amp;c. who <hi>ran after Christ, kneeled down to him, and was so inquisitive to know how he might attain eternal life</hi>; yea, who <hi>had from his youth squared his life according to Gods Law,</hi> insomuch that <hi>Christ loved him</hi>; Yet when he was <hi>admonished by our Saviour to sell all and give to the poor, and he should have Treasure in Heaven, he turned his back upon Christ, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way very sorrowful, because he was marvellous rich.</hi> He had <hi>a good mind to Heaven in reversion</hi>; but for all that, he would not part with his <hi>Heaven,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had <hi>present possession</hi>: Whence our <hi>Saviour</hi> so bewails the miserable condition and difficulty of such mens being saved, <hi>v.</hi> 17. to 26. And the <hi>Apostle</hi> the like, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. For if he that had so good affections, made conscience of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102698:317"/>
all his wayes, was so desirous to be saved, that <hi>Christ</hi> was taken with him; What hope of this Wretch that hath a <hi>blockish, seared,</hi> and <hi>senseless Conscience,</hi> that is past feeling, and never made scruple of any thing from his infancy? No, these solid Arguments, and strong inducements from <hi>Gods Word,</hi> wil be so far from prevailing with him, that it is rare if he do not slight and scorn what hath been spoken. The covetous man knows no other God then his belly, and desires no other Heaven then his Coffers full of Angels.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly and lastly, admit the best that can be expected, <hi>viz.</hi> that he shall not only lend a listen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ear to all that hath been said, but that it does also convince, and almost perswade him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come liberal; As I dare appeal to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences that have hitherto heard what hath been alledged out of <hi>God's Word,</hi> whether it hath not made their hearts burn within them; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have not been convinced, and with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa, almost perswaded to become merciful, Acts</hi> 26.28. Whether with <hi>Pharoah,</hi> their spirits have not began to thaw a little, <hi>Go, do sacrifice to your God in this Land</hi>; yea in their judgements yeilded to all that hath been demanded them, and been rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pray some <hi>Moses</hi> to pray for them: And yet harden and knit again, whereby all labour (like <hi>Moses Message,</hi> or the sweet words of <hi>Paul</hi>) it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly lost. The covetous man, though he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in his conscience, and doth resolve to be bountiful, yet no hope of his doing it; for his <hi>goodness is as a morning Cloud, and as a morning dew; it goeth away</hi> as the <hi>Lord</hi> once spake to <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Iudah, Hos</hi> 6.4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:102698:318"/>Good thoughts to carnal &amp; covetous hearts, are only as <hi>Passengers,</hi> not <hi>Inhabitants</hi>; they may make it a thorough-fare, but they can never settle or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there: If at any time they melt with <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi> they suddenly knit again. Nor is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heart made of flesh, that wil not at some time or other relent. Even <hi>Flint and Marble</hi> wil <hi>in some weather stand in drops.</hi> It is not onely recorded of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> that he did thus melt, and of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that he <hi>was almost perswaded to become</hi> good; but the holy Ghost further testifies, that <hi>Esau wept; Ahab put on Sackcloth,</hi> that <hi>Iudas repented, and restored;</hi> that <hi>Foelix trembled</hi>; that <hi>Pilate took Christs part, and washt his hands in witness that he was free from the blood of that just man</hi>; that <hi>Balaam wisht to dye the death of the righteous</hi>; that <hi>Herod delighted in Iohns Ministry</hi>: And yet we see that all came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

                        <hi>GOod deeds flow from good men</hi> (such as know themselves <hi>deputed Stewards, not Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Lords of their wealth</hi>) as naturally <hi>as springs out of Rocks</hi>: But with <hi>the covetous Cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> it is far otherwise; <hi>as good perswade a Caniball, as the covetous to shew mercy</hi>: To wrest any good deeds out of the <hi>Dives's of these dayes,</hi> (though there be millions in the case of <hi>Lazarus</hi>) is far more hard then to <hi>wring Verjuice out of a Crab</hi>; yea, you may as wel <hi>press water out of a stone.</hi> We read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. that <hi>churlish Laban</hi> (<hi>Nabal</hi> I should say, though the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference bee so smal, that these two infamous Churls spel each other's Name backwards) when <hi>distressed David</hi> askt him <hi>victuals, he reviled him,</hi> when he should have <hi>relieved him.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more cheape then good Words; these he

might have given, and been never the poorer; but his foul mouth doth not onely deny, and <hi>give him nothing,</hi> but that which was <hi>worse then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> bad Language; So fares it with these Churls, when any <hi>David</hi> is driven to <hi>ask them Bread, they give him stones</hi> instead thereof; let them be moved by some one to give an Alms, or do some charitable deed, <hi>they cannot hear on that ear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or if this Wretch for his credit sake, does speak fair, <hi>all his good deeds be onely good words</hi>; and he may be answered as <hi>that Beggar</hi> did the <hi>Bishop,</hi> when instead of an Alms he gave him his blessing, That if his blessing had been worth a penny, he would not have been so bountiful. So that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very house were of his profession, <hi>Charities Hand</hi> would no longer <hi>hold up Poverties head.</hi>

                        <hi>Words from a dead man,</hi> and deeds of <hi>Charity from a covetous man,</hi> are both <hi>alike rare,</hi> and hard to come by. The <hi>Mountains</hi> are not more <hi>barren of fruit,</hi> then <hi>he of goodness; The Rocks are not so hard as his heart</hi>; he is a friend to none but himself; <hi>His Charity begins at home, and there it ends.</hi> To urge or perswade him to be liberal, is all one, as to <hi>intreat a Tyger to be tame and gentle,</hi> or <hi>a Wolf to be pittiful and mercifull.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is such <hi>an antipathy</hi> between his heart, and one that is in distress, that he hath not the patience to hear a poor man speake; yea out of a desperate resolution to give him nothing, he wil not vouchsafe to look upon him, but turn his face or eyes another way, as though the poore man were such an eye-fore, as might not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.

And just it is, that as the unmerciful wil not hear others when they stand in need, so <hi>God</hi> should not regard them when they shal stand in need: <hi>Blessed are the merciful</hi> (saith <hi>our Saviour</hi>) but that stands not with his disposition; <hi>for the penny which comes out of his purse, is like a drop of blood drawn from his heart</hi>; and his reward shall be answerable.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>covetous man's heart is like his Chest,</hi> ever close shut, except it be to receive. He is sparing &amp; <hi>niggardly in giving, but open handed to receive</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is brought; like an <hi>Hog</hi> or <hi>Medler,</hi> he never does <hi>good</hi> to any til he be <hi>dead and rotten,</hi> He is like a <hi>Butlers earthen box,</hi> out of which nothing can be drawn til it be <hi>broken</hi>; Or some kinde of <hi>Vermine,</hi> which is of no use til <hi>uncased.</hi> He resembles <hi>a spunge</hi> that <hi>soaks up excessively</hi>; but til <hi>Death</hi> comes with his Iron grasp to <hi>squeeze</hi> him, he will <hi>not yeild one drop</hi>; Onely then <hi>some good comes of his Goods.</hi>

that the more wee give, the more wee have: That liberallity will make a man lastingly rich, as having <hi>Gods</hi> Word that such shall never want: If we can no way be so liberal to our selves, as by giving to the poor, and in them to the possessor of all things; It should methinks make rich men of all others, put the same in practice, since they are all for gain, and looking after commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie; all for treasuring up, all for themselves, all for riches, it being their onely <hi>summum bonum</hi>; For no such way to encrease their Estates, or benefit themselves, can ever be found out; this wil do it above what they are able any other way, or what they were ever yet acquainted with: How then should it take with them? How should it not whet them on, and make them put the same in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise? For should you rich men plot and break your brains to study and contrive all the dayes of your lives how you may do your selves the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est good, this is the onely way.</p>
                     <p>It is fabled of <hi>Midas,</hi> that whatsoever he touched, it was turned into Gold; but it may more truly be so said of the hand of Charity; for that turneth a Cup of cold Water into a never failing Mine of Gold: As thus; if we but sow the seed of our Beneficence, we shall not onely reap an earthly crop, but have also an heavenly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, which wil never fail us; it wil return unto us a double Harvest, the crop of all temporal and spiritual benefits in this life, and of everlasting blessedness in the life to come.

graces, and eternal glory; but stooping to our infirmity, even multiply and pay us with our own mony also, even with the coyn of worldly blessings, which is so currant among us. And what greater gain can be imagined, then to change Earth for Heaven, transitory trifles for eternal treasures, the bread of men for the bread of <hi>Angels,</hi> rotten rags for glorious robes, and a little drink, yea a cup of cold water (if the Well or River be our best Celler) for the Water of Life, which will infinitely delight and satisfie us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out glutting or satiety. Then is our <hi>Saviours</hi> words, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.33. worth harkening to of all rich men, where he saith; <hi>Give alms, provide your selves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth.</hi> And indeed it being so, a man would think there needed no pressing, or perswading any to this duty, that have either grace or wit; for who does not wish well to himself and his? and yet no duty more neglected; insomuch that I can never enough admire! the little Charity of most rich men in these daies, or pity their simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. For the want of Charity is the strongest conviction of folly that can be. Nor were it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible they should be so close-fisted, if they were not as barren of Wit, as they abound in wealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As observe but the depth of such an one, he buies <hi>a Lease of seven years,</hi> with <hi>an Inheritance</hi> that is <hi>everlasting.</hi>

that ever was heard of! But <hi>Solomon</hi> gives the reason, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.16. for what he speaks there of a Fool, is more true of a Covetous &amp; Uncharitable Rich man; <hi>He hath a price put into his hand, but he wants an heart to make use thereof.</hi> As O the brave opportunities such have! to be happy, and to make their seed happy here, and much more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if they were wise, and did but truly love themselves, and their precious souls.

Certainly they must needs think there wil be no such <hi>Day of Iudgement</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> speaks of, or that he is a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lyar, and means not to be as good as his word; For if they do in the least believe either of these; yea if they did but come so near belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as to grant such a thing may be, or it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, they could not be such careless, witless, and wicked fools, as to venture and hazard the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or damnation of their souls, upon the doubtful event of such a weighty business.</p>
                     <p>O my Brethren! bethink your selves (before your Glasses be run out) be perswaded, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to love your money less, and your selves and souls more. And do not lose your souls to save your silver; or if you do, you wil one day dearly rue it, I mean when you come in <hi>Hell</hi>: As let me ask your Consciences but this question, What would you give in those scorching flames to be delivered out of them, into <hi>Abrahams bosom,</hi> or the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi>? Yea, what would you not give, if you then had it? Let <hi>Nabal</hi> be but ransomed out of <hi>Hell,</hi> he wil no longer be a <hi>Churl</hi>: Let <hi>Dives</hi> return from that fiery Lake, to

his former riches, the sensible World shall admire his Charity. Let <hi>Iudas</hi> be ransomed out of Hell, he wil no more <hi>betray his Master</hi> for money. Let <hi>Esau</hi> find the same favour, he will never again <hi>sell his Birth-right.

And how would they bestir themselves, that they might please <hi>God,</hi> having once tasted of those torments which now many are in doubt of, because no man ever saw Hell, that returned back to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? yea, if the offer were but made to these Churls on their death-beds, when <hi>Conscience</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to <hi>accuse, God</hi> appears to be <hi>angry,</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> is ready to <hi>seize upon their souls,</hi> they would then give all they have, had they ten thousand worlds, for a short reprieve, to the end they might have the like possibility; As certainly, when <hi>Pharoah</hi> saw the <hi>Sea</hi> ready to <hi>swallow him</hi>; he was heartily sorry that ever he had wronged poor innocents, and <hi>oppressed God's own portion</hi>: How much more, when he felt the flames of Hell-fire about his ears? And the like of <hi>Ahab,</hi> touching <hi>Naboth,</hi> and all such covetous and cruel men. What gained <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> and <hi>Nabal,</hi> or <hi>Dives,</hi> or that <hi>rich man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi> by heaping up Riches, and ingrossing all to themselves, when shortly after by their covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and cruelty, they both lost their Estates, and themselves? <hi>The foolish Virgins</hi> to save, or spare a

Yea, what would they not have given for a little Oyle, and for entrance with <hi>the wise,</hi> into the <hi>Wedding</hi>? Such will one day be the case of all covetous men: Indeed at present none are wise but they; for they account poor honesty but a kind of simplicity; but then they wil acknowledge themselves to have been of all fools, the greatest; nor deserve they any pity: Who pities that man's death, that having the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine by him which can help him, dyes and will not take it? If ever you see a drowning man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse help, conclude him a wilful Murtherer.</p>
                     <p>O my Brethren! look not for <hi>Dives</hi> nor <hi>Iudas</hi> to come out of Hell to warn you, since all this that I have said, and much more, is written for your learning and warning; lest it fare with you, as it did with the <hi>Greeks of Constantinople,</hi> who had store of Wealth; but because they would spare none to the reparation of the Walls, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Souldiers, they lost all to the <hi>Turks,</hi> which afterwards no money could recover.

                     <p>NInthly, Is it so, that what we give here to <hi>Christ's</hi> poor members, we shall receive again in Heaven with ten thousand, thousand fold increase of <hi>God</hi> himself; What wise man then wil not disburse a good part of his Estate, even as much as he can well spare, this way, when it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102698:333"/>
will bring in such benefit? Yea, one would think the more covetous men are, and the more they love their money, the more liberal and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful this should make them. Some love their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney so well, that they would, if possible, carry in with them when they dye; If so, this is the only way: The onely means to have the fruit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of our riches for ever, is to send them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us into our <hi>Heavenly Countrey,</hi> where we shall have our everlasting habitation: Nor can we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry any more of our Wealth with us, then what we thus lay out; for these earthly things are lost by <hi>keeping,</hi> and <hi>kept by bestowing.</hi> Neither can they and we long continue together, seeing either they will leave us in our life time, or we shall leave them at the hour of death, when all that we pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess shall be left behind us, and that onely shal be our own, which we have sent before us. In which respect our riches are fitly compared unto <hi>Seed,</hi> which can no otherways be truly kept, then when we seem utterly to lose it; for if we keep it in our <hi>Garners,</hi> it will either be spent in the use, or in time must corrupt and perish; but if we cast it <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ground,</hi> where it seemeth to rot, and to be lost, it is the onely way to preserve and keepe it from losing &amp; perishing. Give then that which you can no otherwise keep, that you may receive that which you can never loose; for to part with that which you cannot keepe, that you may get that you cannot loose, is a good bargain.</p>
                     <p>Again, What folly is it, saith <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> there to leave thy Wealth, whence thou art a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not to send it before thee, whither thou art going. To leave &amp; lose thy riches in thy Inn, &amp;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102698:334"/>
the place of thy Pilgrimage, and not to transport it into thine own Country, and Mansion house, where thou art ever to reside; let thy Goods bee where thy Countrey is: Let us imitate herein <hi>wise Travellers,</hi> who being <hi>in a strange</hi> and dangerous <hi>Countrey,</hi> wil not carry their Riches and Treasures about them, because they be then in danger by thieves and enemies, to be spoiled of them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding also therewith the loss of their lives, but deliver them rather to the <hi>Agents and Factors</hi> of sufficient <hi>Merchants,</hi> dwelling in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that so taking from them <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> they may receive them at their coming home. The best means of transporting them thither is, to put thy money into the <hi>Lords Treasury,</hi> to deliver it unto the <hi>poor,</hi> who like <hi>trusty Porters,</hi> will carry it for us; whereas if we carry it our selves, it will like heavy burthens, hinder our journey, &amp; like the Camels Bunch, keepe us from entering into the straight Gate; whereas if the poor whom <hi>God</hi> hath appointed for this service, carry it for us, we shall avoid the trouble, and escape this danger.</p>
                     <p>Our Wealth can never do us so much good, as when it helps us in our way to <hi>Heaven,</hi> where there is no use of such transitory things; for there the valuation of Gold ceaseth, Riches are of no use there; and in <hi>Hell</hi> it was a drop of water that the <hi>Churl</hi> wished for; not a Bag of Gold, nor a Lordship of many Acres, he had too large an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of them before: Wherefore ye rich men, yea all men to the utmost of your ability, <hi>do that good before death, which may do you good after death,</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> speaks; put a good part of your Goods (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as much as you can wel spare from your own
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102698:334"/>
use, and for the well furnishing of your Journey) into the hands of the poor, whom <hi>Christ</hi> hath appointed as his <hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>Factors,</hi> and so it shall most surely be repaid, with infinite encrease (here if we need it; however) having finished our Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, and safely arrived at our heavenly home, when Death hath spoiled us of all the rest, we shall most richly be provided. And this is the right course to <hi>make us friends of the unrighteous Mammon,</hi> unto which <hi>our Saviour</hi> perswadeth us, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.9. This is to play the <hi>wise Stewards,</hi> that when by <hi>Death</hi> we are thrust out of our Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, we having discreetly laid out our Master's Goods, may be joyfully received into those ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting <hi>Habitations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor will it so much grieve a good man (at the upshot of all) that he hath been a <hi>poor Treasurer,</hi> as joy him that he hath been a <hi>good Steward</hi>: Yea, it wil be the sweetest and joyfullest saying that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our ears did hear, when <hi>Christ</hi> shall say to us, as you heard before, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, and inherit the Kingdom, &amp;c.</hi> This will far more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice thy soul, then it does now refresh the others body.</p>
                     <p>Again, Is there any place so safe as <hi>Heaven? where no thief comes,</hi> where no Plunderer comes, where no rust comes: Is there any place like that? Or can you put it into a better and safer hand, then into the hands of <hi>God</hi> himself? If then you wil lay it where you may be sure to have it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, put it into <hi>Gods</hi> hand, lay it up in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> But if thou wilt not, or if contrariwise, thy onely care is to hoard up Riches upon the earth, this does plainly shew, that this World is thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

                     <p>BUt many to save their purses, will object, that they are poor themselves, and have nothing to spare them when they want relief: And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them speak more truly then they are aware; for though they abound with earthly Riches, yet are they bare and beggarly in respect of the chief riches, and spiritual Treasure; though they are <hi>rich in goods,</hi> yet are they <hi>poor in Grace, poor in Love towards God, and their Neighbours; poor in Faith and Obedience,</hi> and <hi>poor in Pity, Mercy and Compassion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Brethren, which makes them so nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly and close handed, that they wil part with nothing for their relief. They have not for the poor, a few scraps to preserve them from perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with hunger; but they have enough for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to pamper their bellies, and with the <hi>Rich Glutton,</hi> to <hi>fare deliciously every day</hi>: They have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to entertain their rich friends with super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous pomp and plenty; and they, they will not leave to their own appetite, but press them with their importunity, to eat still more, when alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they have eaten enough, and too much; but to the poore they will not allow some poor pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to keep them from famishing. They who make no spare of their most costly Wines, but swallow them down themselves with great excess, and provoke, yea even compel others to drink of them unto drunkenness, will not give a little
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102698:335"/>
small drink to the poor members of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to quench their thirst; they have not for the poor some worn and cast Apparel, to cover their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, and keep their bodies from the injuries of Wind and Weather; but they have enough not onely for their own use, but also for pride and ostentation, their Chests full thrust with rich Clothing, and their Wardrobes thorowly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with gorgeous Garments, which serve for little other use, then to keepe those from sloath and idleness, that keep them from moulding and Moth-eating: And whereas they have no course Clothes to cover naked <hi>Christ,</hi> they have costly Ornaments of <hi>Arras</hi> and <hi>Tapastry,</hi> for their walls. Finally, They have not a few pence to spare for the relieving of naked and hungry <hi>Christ,</hi> be hee in never so extream necessity; but they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shillings and pounds to spend wastfully and riotously upon Dicing and Gaming, vain Sights, and obscene Stage-playes, and so upon all other sinful pleasures and worldly delights, which their carnal appetites can any way desire.</p>
                     <p>But what a fearful reckoning have these men to make at the day of Judgement, when they give in their accounts unto God? And with what indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will <hi>Christ</hi> look upon them, who have thus meanly and basely regarded him. Then they wil have the wit (or cause) to wish that they had not thus occasioned <hi>Christ</hi> to deal with them, as they have dealt with him and his. But <hi>there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading them to believe, that are ordained to perish.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But say thou hast but a small pittance of this Worlds goods, and not such plenty or superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as is before spoken of; yet oughtest thou out of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102698:336"/>
that little thou hast, to spare somewhat to relieve those that are in extream necessity, either by sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what thou canst spare; or if thou hast nothing to sell, yet God commandeth thee, rather then thou shouldest neglect these Works of Mercy; to <hi>labour with thy hands, that thou mayest have to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that needeth, Ephes.</hi> 4.28. And therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse not thy neglect of this duty by saying that thou hast nothing for them, unless thou hast no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to waste upon thy superfluous vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nothing to sell; unless thou art unable by, thy honest labour, to earn thy living, and art thy self such an one, as needeth by others to be relieved: that the poorest are not exempted from this duty, we may see in the example of the <hi>poor Widow,</hi> who was so commended by our <hi>Saviour</hi> for <hi>casting into the Treasury her two mites, which was all her substance, Mark</hi> 12.43. In the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves poor, gave even above their ability to the relief of those that were poorer, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. In the <hi>Apostles, Acts</hi> 3.6. and in <hi>our Saviour Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who though he were so poore, that he lived upon what others out of their love and duty mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred unto him, as appears <hi>Luke</hi> 8.3. yet he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self gave Alms to those who were in greater want, as we may gather <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.6.8.</p>
                     <p>Yea, if we did indeed rightly consider it, our small means should move us the rather to give, and the more carefully to exercise this Christian duty, since this is the means whereby being poor, we may become richer, as I have plentifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>the Prevention of Poverty, Chap.</hi> 30. which I may not stand to repeat. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9, 10, <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.24, 25. &amp; 28.27. <hi>Psal.</hi> 112.3. <hi>Isa.</hi> 32.8. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.38.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102698:336"/>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. Which Scriptures shew, that giving to the poor does not weaken, but much strengthen our Estates, and is so far from being the cause of our want and poverty, that it is the onely means to keep us from it, and bring to us plenty and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.</p>
                     <p>Besides, if having little we are content in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <hi>God,</hi> to part with somewhat, we perform a duty the more acceptable to <hi>God,</hi> and in the day of <hi>Christ's</hi> appearing we shal be so much the more richly rewarded; and for the present, our Work will be so much the more commendable, as wee may see, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.43. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2.</p>
                     <p>Neither are we to imagine, that if we be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in feeding <hi>Christ,</hi> that he will be careless in feeding us; that he will deny us meat, who hath given us his precious blood; that he will suffer us to want Earthly trifles, who hath provided for us heavenly riches. Let such more then heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish diffidence, be far from us, who professe our selves to be of the Houshold of Faith. But rather let us believe <hi>God, under hope, above hope</hi>; that is, when in respect of humane means and second causes, we have cause to despaire, as <hi>Abraham</hi> in the case of a Child, when there was no possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Nature, nor probability in Reason.</p>

the most and greatest go the broad way to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; or if thou wilt not live be Precepts, but by Examples, why dost thou then propound for thy pattern those who are carnal &amp; covetous, and not rather the example of <hi>our Saviour Christ,</hi> and the holy men of <hi>God,</hi> whose bounty even out of their poverty, is for this very purpose recorded in the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>I, but wil the Worldling say, I have a great Charge, and many Children, and therefore I must not give away my Goods to strangers; for the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi> teacheth us, that <hi>Parents must lay up for their Children,</hi> and that he <hi>who neglecteth this duty, hath denyed the Faith, and is worse then an Infidel,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. Unto whom I answer with <hi>Bazil</hi>; They who are miserable having Wife and Children, would not be liberal if they were without them. Again, Was not the <hi>Gospel</hi> written as wel to the married, as unmarried? To Parents, as wel as to those who have no Children? Thirdly, Didst thou desire Children of <hi>God</hi>? or did he give thee Children, that thou mightest make them a Plea and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to neglect his Commandments, and thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and love to Christ? Or maist thou not justly fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thou thus abusest the blessing of posterity, that <hi>God</hi> wil lessen their number, lighten thee of this Charge, and so take away thy excuse, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving thee of thy chiefest comfort? The which should be most just with God so to punish thee, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou makest <hi>Idols</hi> of them, loving them better then <hi>God</hi> who gave them.</p>
                     <p>But thy Children are dear unto thee, and must be provided for; and reason good: Yet let thy <hi>God</hi> be dearer; and let them not make thee to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect

him who gave thee to thy self, and them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee; and hath provided all that thou enjoyest both for thee and them. Provided for them a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency or sufficiency; but deny not unto <hi>God</hi> of thy abundance and superfluity.</p>
                     <p>But I may answer thee in thine own words; <hi>He that provideth not for his family, is worse then an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.</hi> If thou art a Believer, <hi>Christ's</hi> Family is thy Family, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11, 13, 14, 16, 17. They are thy <hi>Mother, Brethren</hi> and <hi>Sisters.</hi> If we be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one body, we should think the discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of our Brethren pertain to our selves: Men do well to provide for their Wife and Babes, but not then when the present necessities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cannot be supplyed, without the same bee lessened. How did they in the <hi>second and fourth</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> provide for their Families, Wives and Children, when they <hi>sold their Houses and Lands, and gave away all the money</hi>? Were they worse then <hi>Infidels,</hi> because they were more careful to supply the present wants of the Saints, then to provide for themselves, Wives and Children, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.34, 35, 36, 37. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaking of the wicked, says, <hi>They leave their substance to their Babes, Psal.</hi> 17.14. They put Wife and Children into their Wills, but leave out <hi>Christ</hi> and his Children, because they love Wife and Children more then <hi>Christ.</hi> But let such know, <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more then me, is not worthy of me, Matth.</hi> 10.37. <hi>Luke</hi> 10:36, 37, 38. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yea and his own life also, he cannot be my Disciple, Luke</hi> 14.26.

Or that God will regard and feed thy Children, who hast neglected his, and suffered them to pine and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish for want of Relief? No, the onely means to obtain <hi>God's</hi> blessing upon thy self and thy poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is to obey his Commandments, to trust him upon his word, &amp; to give liberally unto the poor; for the righteous man, who is merciful and lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, not onely himself, but his seed also is blessed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.26. He doth not say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That his children shal live in a rich and pompous Estate, for so they may do, and yet with the <hi>rich Glutton,</hi> be everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly condemned; yea, they may be wasters and prodigals, who wil wickedly and riotously spend what thou hast as wickedly gotten and reserved; yea, it may be this Worldly Wealth which thou leavest them, may be the means of furthering and encreasing their everlasting ruine, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condemnation: As how commonly does the leaving great Estates to children (which the rich Father minds not) make them so much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er sinners, and to spend their dayes in pride, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, idleness, uncleanness, tyranny, oppression, and in all excess of Wickedness? but that they shal have <hi>Gods</hi> blessing upon that which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, which whether it be less or more, wil make it sufficient, and so sanctifie it to their use, that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102698:338"/>
it shal be unto them a pledge of <hi>God</hi>'s love, and a pawn or earnest-penny of their eternal salvation. Whereas if we will not so far forth trust <hi>God,</hi> as we would one another; if we will give nothing for <hi>God</hi>'s and for <hi>Christ</hi>'s sake, who have given us our selves, and all we have: just it is he should suffer us to beg ourselves, and have our children beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, permitting none to extend mercy towards them, as he hath peremptorily threatned, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 109.10, to 17.</p>

                     <p>But this is the case, (with which I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude:) First, the gain of giving is inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> who are owners of the whole World, hath promised we shall be repaid with the increase of an hundred fold here, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, thousand fold in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and that our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and posterity shall reap the fruits of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence.

                     <p>Secondly, The security is beyond all excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for we have <hi>God's</hi> Word and Hand-writing for it, even express <hi>Testimonies, Precepts,</hi> and <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> out of <hi>both Testaments</hi>; who is so true of his word, that he never failed a tittle in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof, and also all-sufficient to perform: <hi>Nihil promittit, &amp; non reddit; fidelis ille factus est debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

do a man whom they take to be able and honest. This must of necessity be the main and only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why men are no more liberal to the poor: As for instance; If a man of Worship or Credit should speak or write to one of us, and wish us to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burse such, or such a sum of money to the poore about us, and he would take it as his own Debt, and not onely pay it us again, but take it as a great favour; We would willingly do it without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reluctancy, yea rather then fail, we would borrow it, though we had our selves many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; yea, there is no man when he sows his ground, thinks that it is lost and cast away, or so buryed in the Earth, that he shal never see it more: No, he lookes that that should bring him in a great deal more, and pay him with overplus, for all his cost; and this hope makes him prodigal of his Seed, so that it shal have as much by his good wil, as the ground can bear or bring forth: And does not this plainly prove, that we wil give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to a man's Word or Bond; yea, that we wil trust the very ground it self, rather then take <hi>God's</hi> or <hi>Christ's Bond,</hi> or the <hi>Bible-Security</hi>? You know the place wel enough, where <hi>God</hi> hath given his <hi>Bill</hi> to you, for the re-payment of what you give to the poor, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.17. <hi>He that giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord; and that which he hath given, he will repay him again.</hi> Lo brethren, the bil of <hi>Gods</hi> own hand (as I may call it) in which he hath both acknowledged the Debt, and promised pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <p>BUt thou seest not this increase in thy worldly estate by giving Alms, nor dost thou perceive, that it brings thee any such blessedness as hath been talked of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer,</hi> This Objection makes me conclude, that thou art a Miser, and deservest not the name of an Alms-giver: or if so, let me add, that if thou believest no more then thou seest, why dost thou take upon thee the name of a <hi>Christian?</hi> who liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by Faith, rather then by Sence: For by how many secret passages can <hi>God</hi> conveigh unto thee the reward of thy Alms-deeds? though he writeth no Superscription upon them, to certifie thee for what it is sent; it is sufficient that thou hast it, and that thou knowest that he sent it: As for the reasons which moved him to give these benefits unto thee, he wil acquaint thee with them more particularly when he shal cal thee to make up thy recknoning. Thou growest in thy stature from a Child unto a Man, and thou seest not thy grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though thou perceivest that thou art grown: neither knowest thou the particular time, and means when, or whereby thou comest to this height: And thou knowest and acknowledgest, that thou art nourished by thy meat, though thou seest not the secret passages whereby it is carried from the stomach to the several parts; nor canst
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102698:341"/>
tell at what time, or by what food thou hast been chiefly nourished. Why then hast thou not the like faith? and much stronger in spiritual, then thou hast in respect of natural things? seeing they are much more secret and insensible; and when thou hast <hi>God</hi>'s promise of reward, and seest it performed by his blessings multiplied upon thee, why dost thou doubt? or call them into question<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ascribe them to thy self, or other helps? seeing whatsoever the means are, they are of <hi>God</hi>'s send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Finally, if thou sayest, that thou seest no possibility of increasing thy wealth, by giving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a great part of it unto the poor; I answer, And what more reason hast thou by the collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sence? that thy seed which thou sowest should be multiplied, which thou castest away, and lettest to rot in the earth, unless thou hast learned it by experience: And is not <hi>God</hi>'s Word a more infallible Teacher, and surer ground for thy faith to rest on: especially when thou art not without experience of the like increase, springing from the sowing of the seeds of thy benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this point, if thou doubtest of these promises of <hi>God,</hi> made unto those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the poor; because thou seest not how, or when they are performed; why dost thou believe the Remission of thy sins? Salvation by <hi>Christ?</hi> and everlasting life? when as thou seest none of these, nor hast any other ground but <hi>God</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, even as thou hast for the reward of thine Alms-deeds: And therefore it thou doubtest of the one, thou doubtest of the other: and were not the profession of thy faith, concerning those
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102698:342"/>
spiritual things good cheap; but that it should cost thee as dear, as the giving of Alms: thou wouldst doubtless discover and proclaim thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity there, as well as here; and plainly shew, that it was in meer formality and hypocrisie. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks our mistrust, or at least the smal confidence we have in what <hi>God</hi> speaks in his Word; especially touching temporals, is the greatest wonder in the world. And certainly if we cannot trust him for our bodies; how do we, or how can we trust him with our souls? which is the greater trust. But beloved, what I speak I speak not to all; for we have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded our selves better things of you, and such as accompany salvation, though we thus speak, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9.</p>
                     <p>And so I have <hi>finished,</hi> what at first I <hi>promised</hi>; with an overplus in behalf of the Poor: But as <hi>Iohn</hi> could onely <hi>Baptize with water</hi>; so I can but teach you with Words; and when <hi>God</hi> withholds his contemned Grace, <hi>Paul</hi> himself cannot move a soul.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> shall set it home to your hearts, that you may so meditate on what hath been spoken, and so practise what hath been prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; that <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> may be pacified, your sins by free grace pardoned, and your souls eternally saved: That while you are here, you may enjoy <hi>the peace of God which passeth all understanding,</hi> Philip. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>7. and when you depart hence, you may arrive at the <hi>Haven</hi> of all happiness in <hi>Heaven; where is fulness of joy, and pleasures for evermore,</hi> blessed and happy are yee, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.11.

and be baptized; But being ignorant and unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their divers cunning sleights, they (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Devil) undermined my simplicity, and Satan turning himself into an Angel of light, reasoned with me that same night, saying, <hi>When thou art up in the Morning, go on and perswade them, and bring them unto God; and in case they demand ought of thee, so they will hearken and condescend unto thee, do what thou shalt think necessary, without staggering at all at the matter, to the end many may besaved.</hi> And again, the Devil going before to prepare the way, whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Wits to devise mischief against me, silly Wretch, and sowed in their minds hypocrisie, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation, and deceit. But I, O unhappy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, skipping out of my Bed at the dawning of the day, could not finish my wonted Devotions, neither accomplish my usual prayer: But wishing that all men might be saved, and come to the knowledge of the Truth. I folded and wrapped my self in the snares of the Devil, I got me unto the wicked Assembly, I required of them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Covenant made the night before; and coming (as I thought) unto the Baptism; I (silly soul) not knowing of any thing, answered but in a word, and became reproachfully defamed. I spake without malice, yet felt I their inveterate and deadly spite; for instantly the Divel raised an Assembly about me, who carried me to an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of theirs, where a foul filthy <hi>Ethopian</hi> being appointed, this option or choice was offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, namely; <hi>Whether I would sacrifice to the Idol; or have my Body polluted with that foul and ugly Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian.</hi> In which strait, I having ever kept my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity undefiled, and much abhorring that filthy
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102698:345"/>
villany to be done to my body, brake out into many moans, lamentations and cryes against both. Yet (O wretched man that I am) at length yeilded rather to sacrifice. Whereupon the Judge putting Incense into my hand, caused me to set it to the fire upon the Altar; for the which impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I was delivered both from that and Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But upon my discharge, the Devil raised such an out-cry in the City, in pronouncing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me that just, and yet unjust sentence, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen hath sacrificed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon he was excommunicated out of the Church, and driven with shame and sorrow out of <hi>Alexandria</hi>; and going to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and being there among the Congregation, was reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the Priests to make some Exhortation in the Church to the people; the which he refused to do for a great while; but at length being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained through importunity, he rose up, and turning the booke as though he would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded some place of the Scripture, he hap'ned upon, &amp; read onely the 16. <hi>verse</hi> of the 50. <hi>Psalm,</hi> where he found it thus written; <hi>But God said unto the sinner, What hast thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou shouldst take my Covenant into thy mouth; seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my Word behind thee.?</hi> Which being read, he shut the Book, and sate down weeping and wailing, the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation weeping and lamenting with him; he said unto the Church, Wo is me; my Mother which brought me forth as an high and lofty Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, yet suddenly I am turned down to the ground; as a fruitful Tree, yet quickly withered; as a burning Light, yet forthwith darkned; as a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102698:345"/>
running Fountain, yet by and by dried up. Wo is me that ever I was decked with all gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and now seem pitifully to be deprived of all. The Lord hath made and ingrafted me a fruitful Vine, but instead of pleasant Clusters of Grapes, I brought forth pricking Thorns: Let the Well-springs of tears be stirred up, and let my Cheeks be watered; let them flow upon the earth, and moisten it; for that I am soaked in sin, and bound in mine iniquity; every creature sorroweth, and may well pity my case, for that I was wont here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore to pour out my prayers unto God for them all; but now there is no salve for me: Where is he that went down from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Iericho,</hi> who also salved and cured him that was wounded of the Thieves? Whenas I went about to enlighten others, I darkned my self; when I endeavoured to bring others from death to life, I brought my self from life to death.</p>
                  <p>Oh blinded heart! how didst thou not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? O foolish mind! how didst thou not bethink thy self? O witless brain! how didst thou not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand? O thou Sence of Understanding! Where didst thou sleep? But it was the Devil which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked thee to slumber and sleep, and in the end to slay thy unhappy &amp; wretched soul: He bound my power and might, and wounded me. I bewail sometime the fall of <hi>Sampson,</hi> but now have I faln far worse my self. I bewailed heretofore the fall of <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet now am I faln far worse my self. <hi>I</hi> have bewailed heretofore the estate of all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet now am <hi>I</hi> plunged worse then them all. <hi>Sampson</hi> had the hair of his head clipt off, but the Crown of Glory is faln off my head. <hi>Sampson</hi> lost
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102698:346"/>
the carnal eyes of his body, but my spiritual eyes are digged out: Even as he was severed from the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and held captive among Idolaters, so <hi>I</hi> have separated my self from the Church of God, and am joined with evil spirits. Alas! my Church liveth, yet am <hi>I</hi> a Widower. Alas! my Sons be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, yet am I barren. Alas O Spirit which camest heretofore down upon me, why hast thou forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me? O thou Devil, what hast thou done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me? O Satan, how hast thou wounded me? It was the wiliness of a Woman that brought <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> to his confusion; but it was my own <hi>Tongue</hi> that brought me to this sinful Fall. Alas! every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rejoiceth, and I alone forsaken and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Bewaile him that is bereaved of the Holy Ghost; bewail me that am thrust out of the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Chamber of Christ; bewail me that am tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the prick of Conscience; for now it behoveth me to shed infinite tears for my great sin. Who knoweth whether the Lord wil have mercy upon me? Whether he will pity my fall? Whether he will be moved with my desolation? Whether he will have respect unto my humility, and incline his tender compassion towards me? Now let the Elders mourn, for that the staffe whereto they leaned is broken. Now let the young men mourn, for that their School-Master is faln. Now let the Virgins mourn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of Virginity is defiled. Now let the Priests mourn, for that their Patron and Defender is shamefully falne from the Faith. Assist me holy Spirit, and give me Grace to repent. Let the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of tears be opened, and gush out into streams, to see if that peradventure I may have the grace
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102698:346"/>
worthily and throughly to repent: Why hast thou shut my mouth by the holy Prophet <hi>David?</hi> Am I the first that have sinned? Or am I the first that fell? Why hast thou forsaken me, and banished me from among the Saints, and astonied me to preach thy Laws? Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the Pillar of truth, after his fall, wiped away that bitter passion of forswearing his Master, with monrnful tears, and was purged from the venom of the Serpent in a short time. Restore me again to my former health of salvation. O all ye which behold my wounds, tremble for fear, least God forsake you, and you fall into the like crime. O wo is me that I am se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from among the company of the blessed Assemblies: I have my death's wound: I see the Clouds in the Skye shadowing the Light from me, and the Sun hiding from me his bright beams. O Satan! What mischief hast thou wrought unto me? How hast thou pierced my breast with thy poysoned Dart? Thinkest thou that my ruine will avail thee any thing at all? Thinkest thou to procure unto thy self ease and rest, whiles that I am grievously tormented? But how can I speak, whenas my Tongue is tyed? My lips dare not once move; my throat is dammed up; all my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and iustruments are polluted with iniquity. But <hi>I</hi> will proceed on; and first, I will fall to the ground on my bare knees, and make mine hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble supplication unto all the faithful and blessed of God, both great and small, that they wil help me, silly wretch, which by reason of the superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my sinne, dare not crave ought at the hands of God: O ye Saints and blessed of God, with waterish eyes, and wet cheeks soaked in dolour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102698:347"/>
and pain. I beseech you to fall down before the Mercy-seat of God for me miserable sinner, wo is me, that am compassed thus on every side, &amp; shut up in my sin: The Lord hath made me an Angel, I have made my self a Devil: I was as as a skilful law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, yet am I overthrown by my unrighteous deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I was an heir of the Kingdom of God, but now am an inheritor of the Kingdom of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel: I am choaked with infamous doings; but who wil Minister Moisture unto the Temples of my Head? and who wil give streams of tears unto my Eyes, that I may bewail my self in this my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful plight? O all ye my friends, tender my case, pity my person, in that I am dangerously wounded, in that I am a scorn to all men; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving trodden under foot the the Seal and Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of my Profession, and joined in League with the Devil. In that I am rejected and cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the face of God; it is for my lewd life that I am thus polluted. I see the Spider over my seat building his Cobweb: There is no sorrow like to my sorrow; there is no affliction that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth my affliction; there is no bitterness that passeth my bitterness; there is no lamentation more lamentable then mine? Neither is there any sin greater then my sin, for there is no salve for me. Where is that good Shepherd of Souls? I have broken my Vow I made in Baptism: Alas that ever I was Doctor, and now occupy not the room of a Disciple! Thou knowest, O Lord, that I fell against my Will: Who is able to signifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, when again I shall be coupled, and made Companion of the Saints of God? O! I am not worthy to hear the Message of them that bring
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102698:347"/>
such tidings; for the threats of the Prophets and Evangelists onely belong unto me. O the bosom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the which I am deprived of! I am becom partaker with the Rich Man in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and scorching flames in the horrible pit? I am tormented with the prick of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; I do fear the dreadful day of Judgment, for that I am damn'd for ever, I do fear the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, for that it is eternal. I will prostrate my self before the Threshold and Porches of the Church, that I may intreat all people both small and great, and will say unto them, Trample and tread me under foot, which am the foolish Salt, the unsavory Salt; tread me which have no taste nor rellish of God: Wo is me that I fell most dangerously, and cannot rise again. Assist me, O Holy Syirit, and give me grace to repent, and wipe out of the Book of the Conscience, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation printed against me: But thou, O Lord, think upon me, though I am of polluted lips, and have uttered lewd things with my Tongue; and accept thou Repentance, Affliction, and bitter tears, the dolour of my heart, and the heaviness of my soul; and have mercy upon me, and raise me up from out of the Mire of Corruption and Filth; for the puddle hath even choacked me up. Wo is me, that sometime was a Pearle glistering in the golden garland of Glory, but now thrown into the dust, and trodden in the mire of contempt? Wo is me, that the Salt of God now lieth on the Dunghil! O how many great streams of Lamentation and tears will wash a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and purge mine humble heart? <hi>I</hi> will turn my talk to God: Why hast thou lift me up, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102698:348"/>
cast me down? <hi>I</hi> had not committed this impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unless thou hadst withdrawn thy hand from me. <hi>David</hi> sinned too bad in thy sight, yet after his Repentance thou receivedst him to mercy: Grant that <hi>I</hi> may not become an habitation for Devils, but that <hi>I</hi> may trample under foot the Devil, which hath trod upon me. <hi>I</hi> have fallen and am bruised, there is no health in me. <hi>Why hast thou, O Lord, broken down my hedge and strong holds. The wilde Boar out of the Wood hath destroied me, and the wilde Beasts of the field hath eaten me up. Rid me, O Lord, from the roaring Lion, that the Bill of sin written against me may be blotted out; that I may cease from my Lamentation in the evening, and receive joy in the morning. Let my sackcloth be rent in sunder, and gird me with joy and gladness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus in his bitter affliction, and grief of mind he uttered these things confusedly, and out of order.</p>
