            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

turn. I have taken no notice of <hi>Pluto, Caron, Cerberus,</hi> nor of no one of the infernal Crew. How concerned am I that you have drained all thoſe rare mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the equality of the Dead, of their trouble at Life, of the falſe conſtancy which <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> affect to make appear at their dying hour, of the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous misfortune of thoſe young people, that dye before the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of whom they thought to inherit, and whom they ſo much courted. But when all is done, ſince you had invented this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, it was but just and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that you ſhould pick and
<pb facs="tcp:135343:5"/>
chooſe what was beſt in it. I have at leaſt endeavoured to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate you in the end you had propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to your ſelf. All your <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues</hi> include their Moral, and I make all my Dead moralize, otherwiſe it had not been worth while to make them ſpeak; ſome of the living would have ſerved well enough to te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l frivolous things. Moreover, there is this conveniency in it, that a Man may ſuppoſe the Dead to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of great Reflection, as well for their experience-ſake, as becauſe of their vacant time; and one ought to believe, that they think a little more then is
<pb facs="tcp:135343:5"/>
uſual whilſt alive. They diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of things here above bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than we, becauſe they behold them with greater indifferency and more tranquility, and they are willing enough to diſcourſe of them, becauſe they ſtill pretend to ſome interest in them. You have made the moſt part of their <hi>Dialogues</hi> ſo ſhort, that 'tis apparent you did not believe them to be great Talkers, and in this I can eaſily agree with you. As the Dead are very witty, they ought to make a quick diſcovery of the ending of all matters. I could believe too, that they might be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily enlightened as to agree with
<pb facs="tcp:135343:6"/>
one another about every thing, and conſequently that they ſhould ſcarce ever ſpeak; for I fancy that it belongs to us Ignorants only to diſpute, who do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Truth; even as it is the property only of the Blind, who ſee not the place they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, to joſtle one another as they go along. But here we cannot be perſwaded that the Dead ſhould have changed their qualities, ſo far as not to be any longer of contrary Judgments. When we have once conceived an opinion of Perſons in this World, we cannot alter it. Thus I have made it my buſineſs to make
<pb facs="tcp:135343:6"/>
the Dead known again, at leaſt ſuch as are moſt eminent. You made no difficulty to ſuppoſe ſome, and ſome of the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures too perhaps which you allot them; but I ſtood in no need of that Priviledge. <hi>Hiſtory</hi> did ſupply me with plenty enough of real Dead, and real Adventures, to diſpenſe with my borrowing any aſſiſtance from Fiction. You will not be ſurpriſed, that the Dead do ſpeak of what did hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a long time after them, you that do ſee them entertain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves every day with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of each other. I am ſure that at this very moment you
<pb facs="tcp:135343:7"/>
know <hi>France,</hi> upon a multitude of Reports that have been made you, and that you know that ſhe is at this day in point of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what <hi>Greece</hi> was formerly. Above all, your famous Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who has made you ſpeak our Language ſo well, will not have failed to tell you, that <hi>Paris</hi> has had the ſame eſteem for your Works as had <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi> Happy the Man that could follow your Style as that great Man did, and in his Expreſſions lay hold of that fine ſimplicity, and that natural plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, which are ſo proper for <hi>Dialogues!</hi> For my part, 'tis
<pb facs="tcp:135343:7"/>
far from my Thoughts, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the glory of having imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated you well; I deſire none but that of having well known, that a Man cannot imitate a more excellent <hi>Model</hi> than your Self.</p>

                  <p>YOU may know it of all the <hi>Thebanes</hi> that lived in in my time. They will tell you that I offered them to rebuild at my own charges the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:135343:10"/>
Walls of <hi>Thebes;</hi> which you had beaten down, upon condition they would put this Inſcription upon them. <hi>Alexander the Great did beat down theſe Walls, but Phrinea the Courtiſan has raiſed them up again.</hi>

                  <p>You were afraid then that future Ages ſhould not know what Trade you had driven?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phrin.</speaker>
                  <p>I tell you I had been excellent at it; and all perſons that are extraordinary in any Profeſſion whatever, are poſſeſſed with this folly of Monuments and Inſcriptions.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Alex.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis true that <hi>Rhodopea</hi> had this humour before you. Her Beauty gained her ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that with it ſhe built one of thoſe famous Pyramids in <hi>Egypt</hi> which are ſtanding to this day; and I remember that as ſhe was ſpeaking of it the other day to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:135343:10"/>
ſome dead French Ladies, who pretended to have been very love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, theſe Shadows began to weep, ſaying, that in the Age and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where they had lately lived, Beauties did not now make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages whereby to raiſe Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phrin.</speaker>
                  <p>But for my part, I had that advantage above <hi>Rhodopea,</hi> that in raiſing up again the Walls of <hi>Thebes,</hi> I made my ſelf equal to you, who had been the greateſt Conquerour in the World, and made it appear that my Beauty was able to repair what your Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour had deſtroyed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Alex.</speaker>
                  <p>Theſe are two things which certainly did never enter into compariſon with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. You are pleaſed with your ſelf then, that you have been ſo Gallanted.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phrin.</speaker>
                  <p>And you, you are very
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:135343:11"/>
well ſatisfied that you have made deſolate the better part of the World? Why was there not a <hi>Phrinea</hi> in each Town which you deſtroyed! There ſhould have remained no ſigns of your furies.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Alex.</speaker>
                  <p>Were I to live again, I would again be a famous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phrin.</speaker>
                  <p>And I would be a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conquerour. Beauty has a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right to command Men, and Valour has but a right gained by force. Beauties have a right in all Countries, ſo have not Kings nor Conquerours. But yet the better to convince you, <hi>Philip</hi> your Father was a very valiant man, ſo were you too, however you would neither of you work any fear into <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour, who, whilſt he lived, did nothing but inveigh againſt you both; and another <hi>Phrinea,</hi> far
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135343:11"/>
beyond me (for the name is lucky) being likely to loſe a Suit in Law of conſequence, her Lawyer, who in vain had ſpoken his beſt for her, bethought himſelf of putting by a great Veil, which partly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her, and preſently upon the ſight of her beauty, the Judges who were juſt going to caſt her, chang'd their minds. So the noiſe of your Arms could not in a long run of years ſilence an Oratour, and the attractives of a fair Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did, in a moment, corrupt all <hi>Areopagus</hi> with its ſeverity.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Alex.</speaker>
                  <p>Though you have called another <hi>Phrinea</hi> to your aſſiſtanc, I do not believe that <hi>Alexanders</hi> Party is at all the weaker. It would be very ſad if.....</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phrin.</speaker>
                  <p>I know what you are going to ſay to me. <hi>Graecia, Aſia, Perſia,</hi> the <hi>Indies,</hi> all theſe make a fine ſhew: Yet, if I ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:135343:12"/>
from your glory, what does not belong to you upon that ſcore; if I did give to your Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to your Captains, to Chance it ſelf, the ſhare belonging to them, don't you think you would be a loſer by it? But a Fair Lady ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhares with any one the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her Conqueſts, all is her own. Believe me, the condition of a pretty Woman is a pretty condition.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Alex.</speaker>
                  <p>It has appeared that you have been ſo perſwaded. But do you think this part reaches ſo far as you have puſhed it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phrin.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no, for I am eaſy of belief. I confeſs I have, in an high degree, injured the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a pretty Woman, but you hove done as much by that of a Great Man. You and I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered too much. If I had been contented with two or three Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantries
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135343:12"/>
at the moſt, I had not been irregular, and no exceptions could have been taken; but to have been galanted to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as to have had wherewithall to rebuild the Walls of <hi>Thebes,</hi> that was indeed too too much. On the other ſide, if you had conquered <hi>Greece</hi> only, the neighbouring Iſlands, and ſome little part too perhaps of the Leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and made up a State of them for your ſelf, nothing had been more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; but to run on ſtill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing whither, and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taking of Towns, and know not why, and always upon execution, without deſign, 'tis that that was not approved of by many judicious perſons.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Alex.</speaker>
                  <p>Let thoſe judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſay what they will. If I had made uſe of my valour and good fortune with ſo much diſcretion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135343:13"/>
there would ſcarce have been any talk of me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phrin.</speaker>
                  <p>Nor of me neither, if I had been too diſcreet in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of my Beauty. When one will make a noiſe only, thoſe qualities which ſeem moſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are not the fitteſt for that purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>THou art very proud then, <hi>Milo,</hi> of having carried an <hi>Ox</hi> on thy ſhoulders, at the Olimpick Games.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Milo.</speaker>
                  <p>For certain it was a very brave action. All <hi>Greece</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud it, and the honour of it reached as far as the City of <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona</hi> my native Country, which has afforded an infinite number of ſtout luſty men. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, thy City of <hi>Sibaris</hi> will be cried down to eternity becauſe of the effeminacy of her Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who baniſhed all Cocks from their Town, leſt they ſhould
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135343:14"/>
be wakened by them; and when they made any invitation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they invited them a year before-hand, that they might have the more leaſure to make their Treat with as much dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as they would themſelves.</p>

                  <p>Thou jeereſt the <hi>Sibariſts;</hi> but thou groſs <hi>Crotonian,</hi> doſt not thou think that in boaſting to have carried an Ox is not to be very like them?</p>

                  <p>And thou, doſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to have behaved thy ſelf Man-like, when thou madeſt thy complaint that thou hadſt paſſed a night without ſleeping, becauſe one of the Roſes wherewith thy Bed was ſtrewed, lay folded in two under thee?</p>

                  <speaker>Smin.</speaker>
                  <p>What didſt thou never ſee a Lover, who being loaded with the favours of a Miſtreſs, to whom he had rendred ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſervices, was troubled in the poſſeſſion of his happineſs, for fear that grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould work more in the heart of the Beauty, than her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Milo.</speaker>
                  <p>No, I never ſaw any ſuch. But what if ſuch a thing ſhould be?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Smin.</speaker>
                  <p>And didſt thou never hear talk of ſome Conqueror, who, at his return from a glorious Expedition, ſhould not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſatisfied with his Triumphs, becauſe Fortune might have had a greater ſhare than either his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or his Conduct, and that his deſigns might have taken upon falſe and ill grounded Meaſures?</p>

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:135343:15"/>
                  <speaker>Milo.</speaker>
                  <p>No, I never heard ſpeak of any ſuch. But once again, what doſt thou infer hereupon?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Smin.</speaker>
                  <p>That this ſame Lover, and this Conqueror, and generally all men, although they ſhould lie upon Flowers, could not ſleep if one ſingle Leaf only were foulded in two. A little thing ſpoils a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Pleaſures are Beds of Roſes, where 'tis very hard to have every Leaf remain ſpread out, and not one to lie double; yet the fould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one alone is enough to cauſe a great uneaſineſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Milo.</speaker>
                  <p>I am not very much verſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe affairs; but methinks, that thou, and the Lover, and thy ſuppoſed Conqueror, and all of you together, are extreamly too blame. Why do you make your ſelves ſo nice?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Smin.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah <hi>Milo!</hi> your Wits are not <hi>Crotonians,</hi> as thou art; but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135343:15"/>
they are <hi>Sibariſts,</hi> more refined yet than I was.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Milo.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſee well enough what the matter is. Your Wits, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, enjoy more pleaſures than they need, and they let their nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs retrench what they have too much. They are willing to have ſome feeling of the leaſt diſlikes, becauſe there are other ways de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights enough for them; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account I find they are in the right.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Smin.</speaker>
                  <p>There's nothing at all of that. Your Wits enjoy no more pleaſures than they need.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Milo.</speaker>
                  <p>They are fools then to make themſelves ſo nice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Smin.</speaker>
                  <p>There is the miſchief of it. Niceneſs does become men ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well: it ariſes from the good qualities, both of the mind, and heart: Man takes a delight to have them, and he that wants them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135343:16"/>
for them; in the mean time, niceneſs does leſſen the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of pleaſures, and one is not overloaded with them. It makes them leſs ſenſible; and pleaſures, of themſelves, are not over lively. How men are to be pitied! Their natural condition ſupplies them with few pleaſing things, and their reaſon teaches them to delight yet leſs in them.</p>

                  <p>ALas! how wretched am I, my poor <hi>Strationice!</hi> you know how I have lived. I was ſo exact in my fidelity to my firſt Husband, that I burnt my ſelf alive rather than I would take a ſecond. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I could not preſerve my ſelf from being ill ſpoken of. A Poet, <hi>Virgil</hi> by name, has been pleaſed to change a wiſe Woman, ſo ſtrict as my ſelf, into a young Goſſip, that lets her ſelf be taken with the handſomeneſs of a Stranger the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt day ſhe ſees him. My whole ſtory is quite contrary. To tell the truth, as to the pile of Wood
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135343:17"/>
wherein I was conſumed, I had right done me. But gueſs why I caſt my ſelf into it? It is not out of any farther fear of being obliged to marry a ſecond time, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am grown deſperate upon this ſtranger's leaving of me.</p>

                  <p>Indeed, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this may be very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. There will hardly be any more Women that will burn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of a conjugal fidelity, if, after their death, a Poet may have the liberty to ſay what he will of them. May be too, your <hi>Virgil</hi> was not ſo much in the wrong. Has he not cleared ſome intrigues in your life, which you hoped would not have been known? Who knows?

A Painter at the Court of the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> my Husband, was diſſatisfied with me; and out of revenge, he drew me as in the Arms of a Soldier. He expoſed his Picture to view, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:135343:19"/>
took his heels. My Subjects, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of my Glory, would have burnt this Picture publickly; but I being drawn admirably well, and full of Beauty, though the poſtures allotted me therein were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to my Vertue, I forbad the burning of it, and recalled the Painter, whom I pardoned.

I will maintain that 'tis harder to drink and ſing, as I have ſung, and as I have drunk, than to philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize as you have done; to ſing and to drink as I have, a man's Soul ſhould be freed from all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions, ſhould aim no more at what does not depend upon us, ſhould always be in a diſpoſition to take time as it ſhould come. In fine, there would be many little Affairs to regulate about him; and though there be no great matter of Philoſophy in all this, one has trouble enough for all that to compaſs it. But a man may philoſophize as you have done upon more reaſonable terms. One is not obliged to cure ones ſelf neither of Ambition, nor of Covetouſneſs; a man may have a favourable acceſs to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Court; he may purchaſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>Why not? You fancy that the Minds of men ſeek for Truth altogether? Diſabuſe your ſelf. Man's mind and falſhood ſympathize moſt ſtrangely. If you have a truth to ſpeak, you'l do very well to fold it up in <hi>Fables,</hi> 'twill be far more pleaſing. If you'l relate <hi>Fables,</hi> they may take without having the leaſt colour of truth in them. Thus Truth has need to borrow the ſhape of Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to be kindly received in the mind of man; but Falſhood creeps into it well enough in its own proper ſhape, for that is the place of its birth, and its uſual place of aboad, and Truth is there a meer ſtranger.

The day of the meeting together of ſo many pretty Pretenders, we all of us ran over in a diſtracted manner the faces of each other; and I took notice with ſatisfaction, that my Rivals did look but with an ill eye upon me. The Emperour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; at firſt he paſſed by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral rows of Beauties without ſaying a word; but when he came at me, my eyes were very ſerviceable to me, and they ſtayed him.

But the Grapes were born in the Picture by a little Country Boy; and the Painter was told, That truly they muſt needs be well done, ſince they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed the Birds to them; but that the little Country Boy muſt needs be very ill done, ſince the Birds were not afraid of him. They

                  <p>It is not the ſame thing to make Satyrs: it is not always neceſſary to undervalue thoſe they are made of; but to give ſome certain unreliſhing praiſes, I fancy a man muſt in ſome kind contemn thoſe very perſons he praiſes, and think them great Cullies.

                  <p>No, no. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be deducted from thoſe kind of praiſes, to reduce them to ſome reaſonable meaſure; but, to

ſpeak the truth, the abatement we make is very little, and we take them at our own rates. In ſhort, let a man be praiſed in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you will, he will always take the advantage of believing that he is above all common praiſes, and that his merit did reduce the praiſer to go beyond all bounds.

you; but ſo ſoon as you had done any action that was mild, the face of things changed, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was found in revenge, but a barbarous and inhumane Glory: one part of your life was praiſed to the prejudice of the other. For my part, I ſhould have been afraid leſt you would have given your ſelf the recreation to take me at my own words, and would have ſaid to me; <hi>Chuſe either Severity, or Clemency, to make the Character of an Hero: but when this is done, ſtick to your own choice.</hi>

                  <p>Why, will you have one look ſo narrowly to it? 'Tis for the advantage of great perſons, that all matters ſhould be proble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical for flattery.

Had you never no ſcruple upon you about all thoſe Elegies which were heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon you? was there any need of ſtraining a man's wit, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that they were intended to you? Praiſes do not diſtinguiſh Princes; Heroes have no more than others: but Poſterity does diſtinguiſh the praiſes which have been given to different Princes.

                  <p>IT is true, the Muſes had a ſhare in the Paſſions which we two have had, and they rendred them very pleaſant: But this difference there is, you writ the Praiſes of your Lovers, whereas my Gallants did all they could to extol mine.</p>

                  <p>This does not ſurpriſe me, for I know that Women com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are more tender hearted than Men. That which does ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe me is, that you ſhould let your Lovers know your inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                  <p>But in fine, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all their diligences, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Victors in a fair way, you do them a favour in acknowledging them to be ſo.

                  <p>Ah! this does not hinder, but that that which is a Victory for them, is always a kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat on our ſide. In being loved,

                  <p>Oh! things would run too faſt; and Love is ſuch a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pleaſing kind of Trade, that it was very well done to give it time to laſt as long as it was poſſible. What would it be if one ſhould be entertained upon the firſt offers? What would become of all thoſe cares to pleaſe, of all that reſtleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when we tax our ſelves of ſome neglect to give ſatisfaction,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:135343:36"/>
of all that earneſtneſs wherewith we endeavoured for one happy moment? to conclude, all that delightful mixture of pleaſure and pain, which is called Love? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be more inſipid, if we did only exchange love for love.</p>

                  <speaker>Sapho.</speaker>
                  <p>Well then, if Love muſt needs be, as it were, a Fight, I could rather wiſh that Men had been obliged to ſtand upon the defenſive. And have not you told me too, that Women were more inclined to be tender hearted than they? Upon that ſcore Women would attack them the better.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Laura.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, but they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves too well. When 'tis deſigned that one Sex ſhould reſiſt, 'tis intended the reſiſtance ſhould be no more than would make the Victory better pleaſing to the Victor, but not ſtrong
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:135343:37"/>
enough to gain it. It ought not to be ſo weak as to yield upon the firſt Aſſault, nor ſo vigorous as not to yield at all. Here is our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and 'tis likely it would not be the Mens. Believe me, when we have well argued the caſe of Love, or of any other matter whatever, it is found in the end, that things are well as they are, and that the pretended Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would ſpoil all.</p>

                  <p>Ah <hi>Socrates!</hi> I knew well enough you had a ſingular way of arguing, and drawing ſo dexterouſly thoſe you had to deal with into Arguments whereof they did not fore-ſee the Concluſion, that you lead them whither you had a mind; and it was that which you called to be the Midwife of their thoughts, and bring them to Bed. I confeſs here I am brought to Bed of a Propoſition quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which I propoſed; for all that, I cannot yield yet. Sure it is, there are no more any of thoſe vigorous and ſturdy Souls of Antiquity, no <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> no <hi>Phocions,</hi> no <hi>Pericles,</hi> nor, in ſhort, no <hi>Socrates.</hi>

                  <p>Where does it ſtick? Is it that Nature has exhauſted her ſelf, and has no farther ſtrength to produce thoſe great Souls? And why ſhould ſhe have waſted her
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:135343:40"/>
ſelf in nothing but in rational Men? None of her Works did degenerate yet; why ſhould men only degenerate?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mont.</speaker>
                  <p>That is a point indeed; they do degenerate. Nature ſeems to have ſhewed us heretofore ſome patterns of great men, thereby to perſuade us, that ſhe could have made ſome if ſhe had had a mind to it, and that afterwards ſhe had made all the reſt with neglect enough.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Socrat.</speaker>
                  <p>One thing mind. Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is an object of a particular kind, a far off, does add to it. Had you known <hi>Aristides, Phocion, Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and my ſelf, ſince you will put me in that number, you would have found in your Age ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were like us. That which does uſually cauſe this prevention in people for Antiquity, is, becauſe they are out of humour with their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:135343:40"/>
Age, and Antiquity takes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thereof. Men exalt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, to pull down their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries. When we lived, we eſteemed our Anceſtors more than they deſerved; and now, our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity eſteem us more than is our deſert: but our Anceſtors, and we, and our Poſterity, all this is equal enough; and I believe the Spectacle of the World would be very tedious to him that ſhould look upon it with an eye of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, for 'tis always the ſame.</p>

                  <p>I ſhould have believed that every thing was in motion, that all did change, and that the different Ages had their different Characters, as men had. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Are not ſome Ages learned, and are not others ignorant? Are not ſome plain and downright, and others again ſubtil and crafty? Some are ſerious, and ſome are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:135343:41"/>
toyiſh: ſome again are fine and quaint, and others are groſs and dull.</p>

                  <speaker>Mont.</speaker>
                  <p>Why ſhall there not be then ſome Ages more vertuous, and others more wicked?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Socrat.</speaker>
                  <p>That is no conſequence. Cloaths change; but by that it is not meant that the Bodies change their form too: The neatneſs or the groſſneſs, the knowledge or the ignorance, the more or leſs of a certain kind of downrightneſs, the ſerious or the toyiſh Genius; theſe make but the out-ſide of Man, and all this does change; but the heart does not change, and whole Man conſiſts in the heart. People are ignorant in one Age, but the mode to be learned may come: People are intereſted, but the mode to be diſ-intereſted will never come. Of the prodigious
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:135343:41"/>
number of Men unreaſonable enough that are born in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, Nature, may be, has two or three dozen of them that are reaſonable, which ſhe muſt diſperſe over the whole Earth; and you judge well enough, that there are never in no place ſo many as may make a mode there of Vertue and of Righteouſneſs.</p>

                  <p>I have juſt now had a ſtrong Conteſt with <hi>Cato</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> about the manner how we both died. I pretended that in this laſt action I had ſhewed my ſelf more a Philoſopher than he had.</p>

                  <p>I think you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bold, that you dare queſtion ſo famous a death as his. Was there any thing more glorious, than to take care that all was well ſetled in <hi>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:135343:42"/>
kill himſelf, that he might end with the Liberty of his Country, and avoid falling into the hands of a Vanquiſher, who would, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever have ſpared him?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Adrian.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh! if you did nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly examine that death, you would find there were ſeveral things to queſtion in it. In the firſt place, he had been ſo long in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himſelf for it, and he did prepare himſelf with ſuch viſible ſtrifes, that no body in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica</hi> made any queſtion, but that <hi>Cato</hi> would kill himſelf. Secondly, Before he gave himſelf the blow, he was fain to read often the Dialogue where <hi>Plato</hi> treats of the Immortality of the Soul. Thirdly, The deſign he had laid put him ſo out of humour, that, going to Bed, and not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sword under his Beds-head, (for, as people rightly gueſſed what he had a mind to do they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:135343:43"/>
it away) he called one of his Slaves to ask him for it, and gave him ſo great a blow with his fiſt upon the face, that with it he ſtruck out his teeth: this is ſo true, that he drew back his hand all bloody.</p>
               </sp>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I confeſs, this blow with the fiſt does very much ſpoil this Philoſophical death.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Adrian.</speaker>
                  <p>You cannot believe what a ſtir he made about this Sword taken away, and how he railed at his Son and at his Servants; ſaying, that they had a mind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him up to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> hands and feet tied together. In fine, he ſcol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them all in ſuch a manner, that they were fain to go out of his Chamber, and let him kill himſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, indeed, things might have gone on a little more mildly. He needed but have peaceably ſtayed till the next day to give himſelf his death. Nothing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:135343:43"/>
is more eaſie than to die when one is bent upon it. But in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the meaſures he had taken upon the account of his conſtancy, were ſo exact, that he could ſtay no longer; and he had not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, killed himſelf, had he delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a day longer.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Adrian.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſay right; and I ſee that you have skill in generous deaths.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Yet ſome ſay, that after they had carried this Sword to <hi>Cato,</hi> and had withdrawn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he fell aſleep, and ſnored. That would be brave enough.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Adrian.</speaker>
                  <p>And do you believe this? He had but done ſcolding every body, and beating his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: a man does not ſo eaſily fall aſleep after ſuch an exerciſe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, his hand he had ſtruck his Slave with did pain him too much to let him fall aſleep, for he was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:135343:44"/>
not able to bear the pain he felt: and he made it be bound up by a Phyſician, though he was juſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to kill himſelf. In ſhort, from the time his Sword was brought, till Mid-night, he read <hi>Plato</hi>'s Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues twice over. Then I could prove eaſily by a great Supper he made for all his friends, by a walk he took afterwards, and by all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages that happened till he was left alone in his Chamber, that it muſt be very late when that Sword was brought him: Moreover, the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue he read twice over is very long; and by conſequence, if he ſlept, he ſlept but a little while. Truly, I am much afraid he did but make as if he ſnored, that he might have the honour of it from thoſe that hearkned at his Chamber door.</p>

which, however, does carry in the bottom ſomething that is very he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical. But which way can you pretend that yours has the better of it? For as much as I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, you died in your Bed, in a plain and unremarkable manner.</p>

                     <hi>Cato</hi> treated Death like a buſineſs that was too ſerious, but you ſee, I drolled with it: and herein it is that I pretend that my Philoſophy went far beyond <hi>Cato</hi>'s. It is not ſo difficult haughtily to out-brave Death, as it is to joak her in a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs manner; nor is it ſo hard a thing to receive her kindly when we call her to our aid, as when ſhe comes when we have no need of her.</p>

                  <p>Yes, I grant, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s death is not ſo brave as yours; but, as ill luck would have it, I had not obſerved that you had made theſe ſmall Verſes, in which the bravery of yours does conſiſt.</p>

At leaſt that which cannot be wanting to our Names, is as I may ſay, a Grammatical death; ſome changes in the Letters does put them in a condition to be of no farther uſe than to intangle the Learned. It is not long ſince I ſaw here below two dead perſons, who had a very hot Conteſt with one another.

                  <speaker>Eraſmus.</speaker>
                  <p>No doubt of it, the benefits of Fortune, as Gentility or Riches, are not it.</p>

                  <p>What you ſay, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes me. Does not Sciences come to the Learned, as Riches do to the moſt part of ſuch as are rich? Is it not by way of Succeſſion? You learned men, you inherit of the Antients, as we do of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. If all we enjoy was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed unto us, all that you know was bequeathed to you alſo.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:135343:62"/>
And 'tis that which makes many learned men look upon what they have received from the Ancients, with the ſame reſpect as ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do upon the Lands and the Houſes of their Anceſtors, wherein they would be loth to make any alteration.</p>

                     </gap> Heirs to their Fathers Greatneſs, and the Learned were not born Heirs to the Knowledge of the Ancients. Learning is not a Succeſſion that Man receives, it is a new Acquiſition which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to make; or if it be a Succeſſion, it is hard enough to come by, though it be very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</p>

                  <p>Well then; ſet the labour there is to gain the Goods of the mind, againſt that a man meets with to preſerve the Goods of Fortune, then all is equal; for,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:135343:63"/>
in fine, if you regard difficulty alone, 'tis certain the concerns of the World have more in them, than the ſpeculations of the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net have.</p>

                     <hi>Charles</hi> V.</speaker>
                  <p>It does not depend upon hazard? What, does not the mind conſiſt in a certain Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Brain? And is Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the leſs to be made of, for tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Birth of a well diſpoſed Brain, than if it were born of a Father that were a King? You were a great Wit; but ask all the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, what did hinder that you were not a ſtupified Block-head? Almoſt nothing, ſome little diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a Muſcle-ſtring; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in fine, that the exacteſt Anatomy could never diſcover.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:135343:63"/>

                  <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
                  <p>That is well; be ſerious now, I adviſe you. Thus you have ever made your Bravado's of—Witneſs that great Country of <hi>America,</hi> which you made be called <hi>Virginia,</hi> in memory of a very doubtful quality. If, by good luck, that place were not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, the name it bears
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:135343:65"/>
would be very improper: but it is no matter, this is not the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in queſtion. Do ſo much as give me a reaſon for your myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conduct, and for all thoſe projects of Marriage, which came to nothing. Is it that the ſix Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. your Father, did teach you not to marry; as the continual Courſes of <hi>Charles</hi> V. taught <hi>Philip</hi> II. to ſtay conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Madrid?</hi>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I might keep to the reaſon which you ſupply me with. Indeed my Father ſpent his whole life in marrying himſelf, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marrying again; in repudiating ſome of his Wives, and cauſing others to be beheaded. But the true ſecret of my Conduct is, that I found nothing more pretty than to frame Deſigns, make Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and execute nothing. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of what a man does ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:135343:65"/>
deſire, abates of the eſteem of it; and things do not paſs from our imagination, to reality, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome loſs. You come into <hi>England</hi> to marry me; then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Balls, Feaſting, Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings; nay, I go ſo far as to give you a Ring. Hitherto every thing ſmiles as much as poſſible; all conſiſts but in Preparatives, and in <hi>Ideas:</hi> Beſides, that which does perfect the delight of Marriage, is already exhauſted. Here I ſtick, and diſmiſs you.</p>

very unhappy indeed, that you did loſe them.</p>

                  <p>How? What delights were there in my life? I never ſped in any thing. I was like to be King four ſeveral times: firſt of all <hi>Poland</hi> was the place in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> at laſt, <hi>France,</hi> in all appearance, was likely to fall to me: yet, for all this, I am come hither without Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>And this is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you were not aware of. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways imaginations, hopes; and never any reality. You did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but prepare your ſelf for Royalty all your life-time, as I did all along prepare my ſelf for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>

                  <p>You miſtake your ſelf; I have no concern with the Maid you have been told of. The King, of whom I was beloved, had a mind to leave his Kingdom to Strangers that were Uſurpers, and go and hide himſelf in a Country full of Mountains, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould not have been very well contented to follow him. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought my ſelf of a Stratagem to divert him from this deſign. I ſent for an Aſtronomer, whom I dealt withal under-hand; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had made a ſhew of ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Nativity, he told me one day, in preſence of <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, that all the Planets were Cheats, or I ſhould inſpire a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of long continuance into a

great King. I preſently ſaid to <hi>Charles; You will not take it ill then, Sir, that I go over to the Court of</hi> England; <hi>for you will be no longer King, and you have not loved me long enough to fulfil my deſtiny.</hi> His fear of loſing me made him reſolve to be King of the <hi>French;</hi> and he began, at that very time, to re-eſtabliſh himſelf.

                  <p>I grant it: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I was reſolved to marry <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman,</hi> though I could not bring him to it out of hopes of an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which he had not, as yet, obtained. I will tell you a ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem that goes beyond yours. I began to build Temples, and to do ſeveral other works of Piety; after which, I made ſhew of a deep Melancholy. The Sultan asked me the reaſon of it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and a thouſand times: and when I had made as much a do as was neceſſary, I told him, that the cauſe of my trouble was, becauſe all my good Actions, as our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors had told me, did me no good; and that, as I was a Slave, I did but labour ſor <hi>Soliman,</hi> my Lord. Hereupon <hi>Soliman</hi> made me free, to the end, that the Merit of my
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:135343:74"/>
good Actions might redound to my own ſelf. But when he had a mind to live with me as formerly, and treat me like a Beauty of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> I made as if I were much ſurpriſed; and repreſented unto him, in a very ſerious manner, that he had no Right over the Perſon of a free Woman. <hi>Soliman</hi> had a tender Conſcience: he went to a Doctor of the Law, with whom I did deal under-hand, to conſult about this Caſe. His Anſwer was, that <hi>Soliman</hi> ſhould beware of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending any thing over me, who was no more his Slave; and that, unleſs he did marry me, I could be no longer his. Now he is more in Love than ever. He had but one Choice to make, but a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary one, and dangerous to boot for a Sultan: However, he made it, and married me.</p>

                  <p>No. But yet, that is it which does cruelly trouble me: And though I know nothing will happen to me, if you would; for all that, fore-tell me ſomething; it would employ me. You cannot imagine what a ſad thing it is, to have no time to come to look upon. Come; ſome little Propheſie, pray you, ſuch as you will.</p>

                  <p>To behold your reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, one would think you were yet living. Thus one is too above. One cannot be what one is there, with patience: we anticipate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways what we ſhall be; but here we muſt be more wiſe.</p>

                  <p>Ah! Have not men reaſon to do as they do? The time preſent is but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and it would be a pitiful caſe, they ſhould be reduced to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their fore-ſight there: Is it not better they ſhould extend it as far as it is poſſible, and gain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon time to come?

                  <p>But they borrow ſo much upon time to come, by their imaginations, and by their hopes, that, when it is preſent, they find that it is quite ſpent, and make no uſe of it. In the mean time, they do not break themſelves of their impatience, nor of their reſtleſs humour. Mens great Lure is, <hi>Time to come</hi> ſtill; and we Aſtrologers know it better than any. We boldly tell them, that there are cold Signs
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:135343:76"/>
and hot Signs; that ſome are Male, and ſome are Female; that ſome Planets are good, and ſome bad; and that there are others that, in themſelves, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor bad; but they take upon them either of the two Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, according as they fall or light in company. And all theſe flames are very well accepted of, becauſe it is believed they lead to the knowledge of time to come.</p>

Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, to try whether there was any thing of certainty in his Art, he did apply his whole care, one day, to obſerve the Rules exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and did fore-tell ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Events in one perſon, harder by much to gueſs at, than your four Marriages. All he fore-told did come to paſs: Never was he
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:135343:77"/>
more ſurpriſed. He preſently looked over his Aſtrological Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, which had been the Ground of his Predictions, know you what he found?

                  <p>There are other-guiſe ſtories than this known, and more to their diſadvantage; and yet their Trade holds good. People will never be diſ-abuſed in any thing that concerns <hi>Time to come;</hi> it has too powerful a Charm. Men, for example, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice all they have to one Hope;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:135343:78"/>
and all they had, and what they have lately purchaſed, they ſtill ſacrifice it to another Hope: and this ſeems to be a malicious Order, eſtabliſhed in Nature, to bereave them ſtill of what they poſſeſs. Men do little care to be happy in the moment then preſent, they put off being ſo to <hi>a Time to come,</hi> as though that time ſhould be of another Make, than this that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come.</p>

                  <p>And what is the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this fine Opinion? I know a little Fable that will inform you. I did formerly learn it at the Court of Love, it was a kind of Academy, which was held in your Country of <hi>Provence. A man was thirsty, and was ſat down by a Fountain. He would not drink of</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:135343:78"/>
                     <hi>the Water that was running before him, becauſe he hoped, that in ſome ſhort time better would come.</hi> This time being paſt; <hi>This is ſtill the ſame Water,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>this is not that which I will drink of; I had rather tarry a little longer yet.</hi> At length; <hi>as the Water was ſtill the ſame, he ſtayed ſo, that the Spring happened to dry up, and he drank not at all.</hi>

                  <p>As much as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me. And I believe that, of all the Dead that are here, there is not one who was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Life ſooner than he had made the uſe of it, he did intend. But what matters it? I reckon, the pleaſure of fore-ſeeing, hoping, of fearing too, and of having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one <hi>a Time to come,</hi> to be great things. A wiſe man, in your Opinion, would be like we Dead, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
