         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p n="1">1. HAD I designed the following Collection either for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or Perusal of the learned World, I should have needed to say but very little by way of Introduction to it: The Editors of the several Treatises here put together, having already observed so much upon each of them, that it would I believe be difficult to discover, I am sure be very needless to trouble the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with any more.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61802:4"/>2. BUT as it would be Ridiculous for me to pretend to have design'd a Translation for those who are able with much more Profit and Satisfaction to go to the Originals; so being now to address my self to those especially who want that Ability, I suppose it may not be amiss be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I lead them to the Discourses them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to give them some Account both of the Authors of the several Pieces I have here collected; and of the Tracts themselves; and of that Collection that is now the first time made of them in our own Tongue. Tho' as to the first of these, I shall say the less, by reason of that excellent Account that has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given of the most of them by our Pious and Learned Dr. <hi>Cave</hi>: Whose Lives of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> with his other Admirable Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Primitive Christianity,</hi> I could heartily wish were in the hands of all the more judicious part of our <hi>English</hi> Readers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. NOR may such an Account as I now propose to my self to give of the following Pieces be altogether useless to some even of the Learned themselves; who wanting either the Opportunity of Collecting the several Authors necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for such a search, or leisure to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min them; may not be unwilling to see that faithfully brought together under one short and general View; which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61802:4"/>
would have required some Time and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have search'd out, as it lay dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd in a Multitude of Writers, out of which they must otherwise have gather'd it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Value which the <hi>Ancients</hi> put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Epistle.</hi> Of St. <hi>Clement</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who was the Author of it: That it was the same <hi>Clement</hi> of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>Phil. iv.3.</hi> Of his Conversion to Christianity: When he became Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as also whether he suffer'd <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> uncertain. Of the <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of his Writing this <hi>Epistle,</hi> and the two main <hi>Parts</hi> of it. Of the <hi>Time</hi> when it was written. That there is no reason to doubt but that the <hi>Epistle</hi> we now have was truly written by S. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> The <hi>Objection</hi> of <hi>Tentzelius</hi> against it of no force. How this <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> was first published by Mr. <hi>Patrick Young;</hi> and translated by Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> into <hi>English.</hi> Of the <hi>present Edition</hi> of it.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61802:5"/>1. THE first <hi>Tract</hi> which begins this <hi>Collection,</hi> and perhaps the most worthy too, is that Admirable, or as some of the Ancients have called it, that <note n="*" place="margin">Euseb. Hist. Eccles. lib. III. cap. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>wonderful Epistle of S.</hi> Clement <hi>to the</hi> Corinthians; and which he wrote not in his own Name, but in the Name of the <hi>whole Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to them. An <hi>Epistle</hi> so highly esteem'd by the Primitive Church, that we are told it was wont to be publickly read in the <note n="†" place="margin">Idem, lib.

Can. ult.</note> Collections of the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> was placed among the Sacred and Inspired Writings. Nor is it any small Evidence of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue which in those days was put upon this Epistle, that in the only Copy, which for ought we know, at this day remains of it, we find it to have been written in the same <note n="*" place="margin">MS. Alexan.</note> Volume with the Books of the <hi>New Testament</hi>: And which seems to confirm what was before observed concerning it; that it was heretofore wont to be read in the <hi>Congregations,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. BUT of the <hi>Epistle</hi> it self, I shall take occasion to speak more particularly by and by. It will now be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to enquire a little into the <hi>Author</hi> of it; and consider when, and upon what occasion it was written by him.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61802:5"/>3. AND first for what concerns the Person who wrote this <hi>Epistle</hi>; it is no small Commendation which the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> by S. <hi>Paul</hi> has left us of him; <hi>Phil.</hi> iv.3. Where the <hi>Apostle</hi> mentions him not only as his Fellow-Labourer in the Work of the Gospel; but as one <hi>whose Name was written in the Book of Life.</hi> A Character, which if we will allow our Saviour to be the Judg, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that of the highest Power and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And who therefore when his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples began to rejoyce upon the account of that Authority which he had bestow'd upon them, insomuch <hi>that even the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils were subject unto them</hi>; Luke x.17. tho' he seem'd to allow that there was a just matter of Joy in such an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Power, yet bade them not to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce so much in this, that those Spirits were subject unto them; but rather,</hi> says he, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that your Names are written in the Book of Life.</hi>

                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61802:8"/>
we are now speaking of to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> I have already taken notice how great a Value was put upon it in the most Primitive Ages of the Church, and what a mighty Commendation has been left us of it, by the Writers of those Times. Nor indeed does it at all come short of the highest Praises which they have given to it; being a Piece compos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such an admirable Spirit of Love and Charity; Of Zeal towards God, and of Concern for the Church of Christ; Of the most excellent Exhortations deliver'd with the greatest Plainness and Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Speech, and yet pressed many times with such moving Eloquence too; that I cannot imagine what could have been desired in such an <hi>Epistle</hi> more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the End for which it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; What could have been written more becoming an <hi>Apostolical</hi> Age, and the Pen of one of the most eminent <hi>Bishops</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. BUT that it may be the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by those who shall now think fit to peruse it; there are a few things which it will be necessary for me in this place to observe concerning it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. AND the first is, the <hi>Occasion</hi> that was given for the writing of this Epistle. For however we have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account what it was, yet may we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61802:8"/>
from the Subject of it, give a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Guess at it. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his First Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the two great things that seem'd to have es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially called for it were the <hi>Divisions</hi> of that Church upon the account of their Teachers, and of their vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their own Spiritual Gifts; and the great <hi>Mistake</hi> that was getting in among them concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>future Resurrection.</hi> But tho' the Apostle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his Writing and Authority did for the present put a stop to the One, and set them right as to the Other; yet it seems after his Death, they began again to fall not only into the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, but into the same Errour too, that had given them so much trouble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="13">13. NOW this gave occasion to St. <hi>Clement</hi> to write the present Epistle to them: In which having first taken notice of the Rise of those new Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were broke out among them, and exhorted them to a Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of them; he in the next place goes on by many Arguments to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the undoubted Truth and Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the future Resurrection; which was the other thing in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had before observed them to have been greatly and dangerously mistaken.</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61802:9"/>15. THIS then was the Occasion, and is the main Subject and Design of the following Epistle. But now what <hi>time</hi> it was written, it is not so easie to determine. <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in Epist.

                  <hi>Junius</hi> supposes it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by St. <hi>Clement</hi> in the Name of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> about two Years before his Martyrdom; and that from the Place of his Banishment: Which also seems to have been the Opinion of our Learned <note n="†" place="margin">Annot. 2. p. 41.</note> Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> in his Notes on this Epistle. <note n="‖" place="margin">Baron.

                  <hi>Cotelerius</hi> agrees; only he supposes the Persecution was then drawing towards an end; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwise unlikely that such an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy could have been sent from <hi>Rome</hi> with the Epistle, as by the Close of it we find there was.

               <p n="16">16. NOW that which seems yet more to countenance this Opinion is, that St. <hi>Clement</hi> in <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61802:9"/>
speaks of the Temple Service not only as still continuing, but as being in such a state as necessarily supposes all things to be yet in Peace and Quiet at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> And from whence that <note n="†" place="margin">Dodwel. loc. supr. cit.</note> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man with great Reason concludes, that this Epistle must have been written somewhat before the XII. year of <hi>Nero,</hi> in which the Jewish Wars first brake out. Let us add to this, that in the Close of this Epistle we find mention made of <note n="*" place="margin">Epist. chap. lix. pag 78.</note> 
                  <hi>Fortunatus</hi> as the Person whom the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had probably sent to <hi>Rome</hi> with an account of their Disasters; and by whom together with the four Delegates of their own, the Roman Church returned this Epistle to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians.</hi> Now <hi>Fortunatus</hi> is expresly said by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to have been an old Disciple in his time; insomuch that he tells us he was <hi>the first Fruits of</hi> Achaia, 1 Cor. xvi.15. And therefore we must conclude that this Epistle could not have been written so late as some would have it, seeing this Man was not only still alive, but in a Condition of undertaking so great a Journey as from <hi>Corinth</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>: For from thence it is most likely he was sent with the Letter of that <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>; and so became the Bearer of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> which was written in the Name of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in answer to it.</p>
               <p n="17">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61802:10"/>17. I CONCLUDE then that this Epistle was written shortly after the End of the Persecution under <hi>Nero,</hi>

it on the same Occasion that we find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in this we now have; that this Epistle was of great Reputation, so as to be publickly read in the Churches heretofore; All this the Authority of the Ancient Fathers will not suffer us to doubt. That the Copy we now have of this Epistle was taken from the End of a Manuscript of the New Testament, written as is supposed about the time of the <hi>first General Council of</hi> Nice, within little more than Two Hundred Years after St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s Death; and at the very time that it was yet wont to be so read in the Churches; both the <note n="‖" place="margin">Vid. Jun. Praefat. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. Clem.</note> Learned Editor of it assures us, and the Manuscript its self sufficiently declares. Now how can it be supposed, that an Epistle so famous in those days; so well known to every Christian at that time, when the very Copy was written, which we at this day have of it; should have been alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the Transcriber of this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript Bible, and a spurious piece started up to supply the place of it?</p>
               <p n="21">21. NOR is this yet all: For if we have not now the true Copy of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, it is manifest that then neither had the Ancient Fathers of those first Ages, a true Copy of it. <note n="*" place="margin">Vid.

And can this be rationally supposed? Can we think that those great Men, and diligent Searchers into Antiquity, were ignorant of an Epistle, not only in every Bodies Hand, but almost in every Bodies Memory through their constant reading and hearing of it?</p>
               <p n="22">22.

               <p n="27">27. THERE are indeed two other Exceptions which <note n="*" place="margin">Photii Bibl.</note> 
                  <hi>Photius</hi> has made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst St. <hi>Clement</hi> upon the Account of the Epistle before us, which yet he look'd upon as unquestionably his; the One for that he speaks in it of the <hi>Worlds beyond the Ocean</hi>; the Other, in that he seems not to have Written so honourably as was sitting, of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>our Blessed Saviour.</hi> But as the latter of these is but a meer Cavil against this Holy Man, who in his Other Epistle expresly asserts his Divine Nature, and even in this speaks in such a manner of him, as shews him to be much more than a meer Creature: So in the former he said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what was agreeable both to the Notions and Language of the times in which he lived; when it was common to call our <hi>British Isles</hi> another World; or as St. <hi>Clement</hi> here stiles them the <hi>Worlds beyond the Ocean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. AND these I think are the chief Exceptions that have been at any time raised against the following Epistle; and which however insisted upon in these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days, yet did not hinder the first and best Ages of the Church, when Men were less curious, but much more pious, from putting a very great Value upon it.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61802:13"/>
Nor will they I suppose have any more weight with any serious and ingenuous Mind now: Or hinder him from esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a very great Blessing to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Times, that a Work so highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed among the Ancient Fathers, but so long, and as it was justly feared, irrecoverably lost to these latter Ages, was at last so happily found out, for the Encrease and Confirmation both of our Faith and Piety.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THE next Piece that follows in the present Collection, is the <hi>Epistle</hi> of St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> In placing of which I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Example, not so much of our most Reverend <note n="*" place="margin">Edit. Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp. &amp; Ignat. Oxon. Anno 1644.</note> Archbishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> as of St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> himself: Though in the Order of Time the Epistles of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> ought to have had the precedence; St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> not writing this Letter to the <hi>Philippians</hi> till about the time that that glorious Martyr suffer'd for the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61802:14"/>
Faith of Christ; as from several Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in the Epistle it self may plainly be made appear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. FOR first; Having in his ix<hi>

                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> as one of them. Now the <note n="†" place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Martyrdom</hi> of that Holy Martyr tell us, that the time when they beheld his <hi>Patience set forth before their Eyes</hi> was, when he passed by them in Chains to <hi>Rome</hi> in order to his being cast to the wild Beasts, according to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced upon him by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Trajan:</hi> By consequence that this Epistle must have been written some time after his Condemnation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. BUT St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> goes yet farther; and in the next Words supposes, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> might have been dead at the time that he wrote to them. For en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing his Exhortation to them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Examples of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and the rest of those excellent Men whom he there names, he subjoyns; <hi>Being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of this, that all these have not run in vain, but in Faith and Righteousness, and are gone to the place that was due to them from the LORD, with whom also they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61802:15"/>
suffered. For they loved not this present World, but him who died, and was raised again by God for us.</hi> In which words he evidently implies that <hi>Ignatius</hi> too, as well as the rest of those whom he there mentions was by this time gone to the <hi>Place that was due to him from the LORD, upon the Account of his Sufferings</hi>; and by consequence had finished his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom.</p>
               <p n="4">4. IT was then about the time of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi>'s Death that S. <hi>Polycarp</hi> wrote this Epistle to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> And yet that if this Holy Man had suffer'd, it was but a very little time that he had done so, is clear from another Passage of the same <note n="‖" place="margin">Epist <hi>of</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp, numb. xiv. pag. 98.</note> Epistle: Where he desires the <hi>Philippians</hi> to send him word <hi>what they had heard with any Certainty concerning</hi> Ignatius, <hi>and those that went to</hi> Rome <hi>with him.</hi> And from whence it appears, that though he supposed that <hi>Ignatius</hi> by that time might have suffer'd, yet he had not received any certain Account of it, but was still to learn the Manner and Circumstances of his Passion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. NOW this will lead us to a yet more exact Conjecture of the time of St. <hi>Polycarp</hi>'s writing the following E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle; <hi>viz.</hi> that it must have been just about the time of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Death: It being no way probable that had <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61802:15"/>
been any long time dead, so great a Bishop, and so dear a Friend of his as St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> was, should have been still to learn the Certainty of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. AND this may serve, by the way, not only to fix the Time when this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle was written; but also to shew how groundless the Exception of those <note n="*" place="margin">Dallaeus in Pseudepigr. cap. xxxii. pa. 428. Larroque Observat. in Pearson, p. 69.</note> Men is against the Authority of it, who pretend to find out a Contradiction between the two Passages I have now mentioned: And would from thence infer either the utter Falseness of this whole Epistle; or at least conclude that this latter part of it is none of <hi>Polycarp</hi>'s, but added by some latter hand to give the greater Credit to the <hi>Epistles</hi> of St. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> which they are resolved by all means to reject as none of his. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were not Men willing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, where is the Contradiction they so much boast of between the two Places I have before alledged? Is it that in the former of them he sets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the Sufferings of St. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and exhorts them to follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his Patience? But 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Sufferings he there speaks of were those which the <hi>Philippians</hi> had <hi>seen in him.</hi> The Weight of his Chains; the Hardships of his Journey; the Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Souldiers that guarded him; and of which the <note n="‖" place="margin">Ignat. Epist. <hi>to the</hi> Romans, cap. v. p. 163.</note> blessed Martyr him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61802:16"/>
complains in one of his Epistles; and to add no more, the Expectation of that cruel Death he was suddainly to undergo.</p>
               <p n="7">7. BUT I suppose the Contradiction lies in what follows; that in <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeum &amp; Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roque loc. cit.</note> one place he speaks of him as if he had already suffered; and yet in the other desires the <hi>Philippians</hi> to send him word what they heard of him. Now what is there in all this that does not very well agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> either by the Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Arrival of <hi>Ignatius</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; or by the Consideration of the Solemn <hi>Festival</hi> that was wont at that time to be held there; and at which it was usual to exhibit such kind of Spectacles to the People; or it may be, lastly, from the Accounts which he had received of the Holy Martyr from some of those that were with him; did suppose, nay if you will, did not doubt but that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was dead when he wrote his Epistle to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> Yet having not hitherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any certain Account of it, and being not sure whether he had suffered or no; or if he had, how he had been treated by his Enemies, and how he had behaved himself in his last Encounter with the Beasts; desires the <hi>Philippians,</hi> who were much nearer to <hi>Rome</hi> than he was, and might therefore very probably have heard much later from thence than
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61802:16"/>
he had done, to send him a certain Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what they knew as to this matter. What is there in this, I do not say that looks like a Contradiction, but that is not very Natural: And particularly most becoming the Love and Friendship of the Blessed <hi>Polycarp</hi> towards him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom he so diligently enquired? I am sure <note n="*" place="margin">Photius Bibl. Tmem. cxxvi. pag. 305.</note> 
                  <hi>Photius</hi> who not only had read this Epistle, but transcribed this last Passage out of it, tho' as severe a Critick as any that have ever perused it since, saw no Contradiction in it to any thing that went before. Since if he had, he was not of a Humour to have let it pass, without making some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection or other upon it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. LET me add yet more, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could those see the Contradiction here pretended, who in our present times would have been as forward as any to have made use of it to the Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this Epistle, had they had but the least Grounds so to do. I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance only in Two; the first, the late Learned Divine of <hi>Leyden,</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Proleg. ad Var. Sacr. in Polycarp.</note> Monsieur <hi>le Moyne:</hi> Who tho' he judged the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage relating to St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epistles, which was wanting in his Manuscript, to be abrupt, and would from thence ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue against the Authority of it; yet has made no Reflection on the Words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following, and in which those
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61802:17"/>
Others will have the Contradiction to lie.</p>
               <p n="9">9. THE Other that I shall mention in Opposition to this Pretence, is a yet later Writer, <note n="*" place="margin">Exercit. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. Exerc. IV. num. 42. pag. 157.</note> 
                  <hi>Ernestus Tentzelius</hi>; who tho' no great Friend to this Epistle, which he supposes to have been <hi>Corrupted,</hi> no less than those of <hi>Ignatius</hi> were in the Antient Editions of them; yet utterly refuses to comply with this Objection, as not apprehending that there was the least Ground for it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. BUT to return from this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, in Answer to the Exception of two of the most Learned Adversaries of this Epistle, against the Credit of it: Tho' as I have now shewn, St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> wrote not to the <hi>Philippians</hi> till after the Death of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this Epistle in order of time ought to have been placed after those which the other wrote immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it: Yet was it fit to give this the Precedency in the following Collection, both as containing a most proper Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the Epistles of <hi>Ignatius</hi>; and as having in all probability been first sent in the same Order, by St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> to the <hi>Philippians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. FOR thus we find that Holy Man speaking to them in the <note n="†" place="margin">Polycarp. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. num. xiii. p. 97.</note>

But to this I reply; 1<hi>st.</hi> That it is allow'd that there is nothing in this <hi>Epistle</hi> that may give any just Grounds for the Suspicion of any such Fraud as this: It being acknowledged even by Mons<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Daillé</hi> himself, one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Adversaries of it, to be an <hi>Epistle</hi> in all respects worthy of St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> excepting only in the <hi>Close</hi> of it, which I shall more particularly consider by and by. So that either we have then this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle</hi> pure and uncorrupted as it was first written; or at least we have it so little prejudiced by any Alterations that may have been made in it, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p n="19">19. SEEING then there is nothing but a mere Conjecture for the Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this Epistle, and such just Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to conclude that there is no good Foundation for it; to be sure none that may compare with the Arguments we have against it: I think we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that for any thing yet appears to the contrary, we not only have the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Epistle of St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> but that Epistle free from any designed Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Depravations of it.</p>
               <p n="20">20. NOR is there any more, that I do not say there is much less Weight, in the other Supposal of Monsieur <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roque Observ. in Vind. Pears. p. 65, 66.</note> 
                  <hi>Daillé,</hi> continued and abetted by his Learned De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender Monsieur <hi>Larroque,</hi> tho' without any more weight of Reason than what had been before fully answer'd by our most Learned and judicious Bishop <hi>Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi> Namely; That this Epistle origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ended at the <hi>Doxology</hi> which we meet with <hi>Chapter</hi> the XII<hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">th</hi>,</hi> and that what follows concerning the <hi>Epistles</hi> of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> has been added to it by some latter hand. But now, what proof do they offer of this? What Authority have they to support such a Supposition?
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61802:20"/>
This they pretend not to: All they have to say is, that the <hi>Doxology</hi> which we find there seems to imply that the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> originally went no farther; And that in what follows there is a flat Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to what went before; the <hi>Close</hi> of the <hi>Epistle</hi> speaking of <hi>Ignatius</hi> as if he were still alive, whom the true <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polycarp</hi> had before set forth to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> as having <hi>suffer'd,</hi> and <hi>been gone to the place that was prepared for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. AS for what concerns the latter of these Suggestions, I have already ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewn how vain and groundless it is. Nor can we reasonably suppose that any one who designed to serve a turn by corrupting such an Epistle as this, would have been either so negligent as not once to read over the Piece he was about to make so considerable an Addition to; or having read it, would have been so foolish, as to have, without any need, subjoyn'd a Request to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> directly contrary to what the true <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp</hi> had told them before; and which by consequence would be sure to discover the Fraud, and frustrate the Design of it.</p>
               <p n="22">22. SO little appearance of Reason is there in this Suggestion, which yet these Learned Men insist upon, as their main Argument against the latter part
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61802:21"/>
of this <hi>Epistle.</hi> As for the other Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which they bring against it, <hi>viz.</hi> that St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> must have concluded at the XII<hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter,</hi> because of the Vow which he there makes for these to whom he wrote; I reply, first: That this is at the best but a very uncertain Guess; seeing it is notorious to all that have ever read the <hi>Epistles</hi> either of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> or those that followed after, that nothing is more common than to meet with such kind of Conclusions, not only in the end, but in the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> 1 Tim. i.17.</note> beginning, and <note n="†" place="margin">Ephes. iii.20. Rom. xv.33.</note> middle; in short, in all the parts of their <hi>Epistles.</hi> To look no farther than the <hi>Epistle,</hi> with which we have begun this Collection, of St. <hi>Clement</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>: How many of these sort of Stops may we find in the Progress of it? I am sure there are not less than seven or eight of them. But I suppose he would be thought very ridiculous who should therefore reject all that follow'd the first of these, as none of St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>'s, but pieced on to the end of his <hi>Epistle</hi> by some other hand, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Doxology</hi> seem'd to imply his having concluded there.</p>
               <p n="23">23. BUT to lay aside Conjectures, and proceed to that, which will put a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal end to this Difficulty; I observe, 2<hi>dly,</hi> That this Passage which these Men deny to be St. <hi>Polycarps,</hi> and suppose to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61802:21"/>
have been added to it by some latter hand, is expresly quoted by <note n="*" place="margin">Euseb. Hist. Eccles. lib. iii. c. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his <hi>Ecclesiastical History,</hi> as a part of this <hi>Epistle.</hi> If therefore it be the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of some other hand, 'tis evident it was made to it before <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s time, that is to say, within two Hundred Years after the time of St. <hi>Polycarp</hi>'s writing of it; and whether this be probable we will now more particulary enquire.</p>
               <p n="24">24. FOR the better clearing of which I must observe, that this <hi>Epistle</hi> of St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> like that of St. <hi>Clement</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, was for several Hundreds of Years wont to be <hi>publickly read</hi> in <hi>the Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia</hi>: So <note n="‖" place="margin">Hieron. de Script. in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp.</note> St. <hi>Jerome</hi> expresly assures us; or as his Interpreter <hi>Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> renders him, in the <hi>Synod</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi> of <hi>Asia.</hi> By which a <note n="*" place="margin">Le Moyne Prolegom. ad var.

               <p n="25">25. HENCE <note n="†" place="margin">Apud Euseb. Hist. Eccles. lib. iv. cap. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speaks of it as an <hi>Epistle</hi> that was in every Bodies hand; and obvious to be read by any, for the Benefit of their Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Which being so, it can hardly be supposed but that so inquisitive a Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher into Antiquity as <hi>Eusebius</hi> was, must
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61802:22"/>
needs have been very well acquainted with it; and doubtless have had a true and genuine Copy of it. Seeing then he produces this Passage as a part of that <hi>Epistle</hi> which was generally received as Authentick in his Days; and that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle</hi> its self being spread into all Hands, and publickly read in the <hi>Eastern Churches</hi> immediately after the Death of its great Author, could not have been corrupted or alter'd, but the Cheat must needs have been discover'd; of which yet we have not the least intimation in all Antiquity: I think it cannot be doubted but that this, as well as the rest of that <hi>Epistle,</hi> was written by St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> himself; and not added to his Epistle by some latter Hand, as is suggested, not only without all ground, but against such plain and un-answerable Evidence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p n="26">26. HAVING said thus much in Vindication of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> and to clear it from those Prejudices that have of late been raised against it; it remains only for me to observe, that though the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Translation</hi> was truly made from the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Copies</hi> of it, set out by <hi>Bishop Vsher</hi> first, and since reprinted by <hi>Cotelerius</hi> in his <hi>Collection</hi> of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Fathers</hi>; yet is not this the first time that this <hi>Epistle</hi> has appear'd in our Language.

To pass by the first, and most imperfect of them; the best that for a long time was extant, contained not only a great number of <hi>Epistles</hi> falsly ascribed to this Author, but even those that were
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61802:23"/>
Genuine so alter'd and corrupted, that it was hard to find out the true <hi>Ignatius</hi> in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THE first that began to remedy this Confusion, and to restore this great Writer to his Primitive Simplicity, was our Most Reverend and Learned Arch-bishop <hi>Usher,</hi> in his <hi>Edition</hi> of Them at <hi>Oxford, Anno</hi> 1644. But still we wanted a correct Copy of the Original Greek; the <hi>Epistles</hi> set out by him, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly more sincere than any we had seen before, yet consisting only of the Old <hi>Latin Translations</hi> of them. Now this was in great measure perform'd by the Learned <hi>Isaac Vossius,</hi> in the <hi>Edition</hi> published by him at <hi>Amsterdam, Anno</hi> 1646: And presenting us from the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> Manuscript with six of the <hi>Epistles</hi> of this <hi>Holy Martyr</hi> mentioned by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi> in their ancient and pure <hi>Greek</hi>; and the seventh so happily amended, that there is but little doubt to be made of the Integrity of that too. And concerning these <hi>Epistles</hi> of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> enumerated by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and set out according to their Primitive Purity by these two great Men, and from them <hi>translated</hi> into the following <hi>Collection</hi>; there are two things to be consider'd and proved by me in this place: First,<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Vossii Praefat. in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat ad Lecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</note> That St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> did write such <hi>Epistles</hi> as those we have here <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated</hi>: And secondly; that those <hi>Epistles</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:61802:24"/>
we here have, are the very <hi>Epistles</hi> that he wrote.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THAT <hi>Ignatius</hi> did, in general, write some <hi>Epistles</hi> to the <hi>Churches</hi> about him, however it has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd by Some, is yet I think now u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally allow'd even by <note n="‖" place="margin">Vid. Vindic. Pearson in Proëm. p. 20.</note> those who are the greatest Opposers of those <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles</hi> which we affirm to be his. That he wrote to those <hi>particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> to which the <hi>Epistles</hi> here sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd are addressed, we have both St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> to assure us. For, first; <note n="†" place="margin">Polycarp. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. Numb. xiii. pag. 97. Annot. Cotel. in loc. Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp. p. 486. B.</note> St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> in the Close of his <hi>Epistle,</hi> (which I am now to look upon as sufficiently proved to be his) speaking to the <hi>Philippians</hi> of this Holy Man, tells them; that he had sent them all such <hi>Epistles</hi> of his, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> had either written to <hi>himself,</hi> or to his <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> or as had hitherto come to his Hands. So that here then we have a plain Account of two of those <hi>Epistles</hi> which we affirm <hi>Ignatius</hi> to have written; One to St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> himself, Another to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. BUT <hi>Eusebius</hi> will enable us to carry this Testimony yet farther: Whilst assuring us, that he wrote four <hi>Epistles</hi> from <hi>Smyrna</hi>; namely to the Churches of <hi>Ephesus, Magnesia, Tralles</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>; he gives us just grounds to conclude that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61802:24"/>
these also must have been part of St. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp</hi>'s Collection; and have been some of those others, besides the two before mentioned, which he tells us he sent to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> Unless we should suppose that either he knew not of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s writing, though every Day, almost eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hour, with him at the time that he wrote them: Or else that knowing of it, He took no care to preserve the Copies of his <hi>Epistles</hi>; which yet we see he put the highest Value, that can well be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, upon. Seeing therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any reason suppose, either that St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> did not know of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s writing to these <hi>Churches</hi>; nor is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that being present with him at the writing of them, and acquainted with it, he should not have kept any Copies of his Letters to them: Seeing lastly; he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self tells us that he had Copies of more of the <hi>Epistles</hi> of this <hi>Great Saint,</hi> besides those that were sent to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and that what he had, he sent to the <hi>Philippians</hi>; neither can we reasonably doubt but that these also were in his Hands, and sent by him to the Church at <hi>Phillipi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. AND thus have we I think upon very good grounds concluded that <hi>Six</hi> of the <hi>Seven Epistles,</hi> which we affirm to have been written by St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> were collected by St. <hi>Polycarp</hi>; and sent, together with his own <hi>Epistle,</hi> to the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61802:25"/>
                  <hi>Philippians.</hi> Let me add yet farther, that neither can we reasonably question but that the Seventh too was at that time in the Hands of St. <hi>Polycarp</hi>; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that what we now have is no other <hi>Collection,</hi> than what he made, and by that means help'd to preserve to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages, of the <hi>Epistles</hi> of this <hi>Holy Martyr.</hi> Now this I conclude not only from the Nearness of the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> to which it was written, to that of <hi>Symrna</hi> in which St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and from the great Respect which all the Neighbouring Churches payd to him, as a kind of <hi>Universal Bishop</hi> of the whole Lesser <hi>Asia</hi>; but from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the <hi>Epistle</hi> its self: Which tells us that it was sent by <hi>Ignatius</hi> to the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> not only from the <hi>same place,</hi> and at the <hi>same time,</hi> that he wrote to St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> himself, and to his <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Smyrna</hi>; but also by the same <hi>Person</hi> that carried the other two; and that <hi>Person</hi> St. <hi>Polycarps</hi> own <hi>Deacon,</hi> whom he had sent with <hi>Ignatius</hi> to <hi>Troas,</hi> and by whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote back that <hi>Epistle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. St. <hi>POLYCARP</hi> then certainly knew of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s writing to the <hi>Philadelphians</hi>; and very probably sent on <hi>Burrhus</hi> his <hi>Deacon</hi> from <hi>Smyrna</hi> to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> with his Letter. And then I think we may very reasonably conclude, that he brought
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61802:25"/>
back with him the Copy of it; and so that St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> had that <hi>Epistle</hi> too in his Hands, when he wrote to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. SUCH good grounds have we to believe, that the Collection we now have of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epistles, was no other than what St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> himself made; and refer'd to in that passage of his own <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> which I have before shewn to be truly his, and not the Addition of any latter hand. And the same is the Account which <note n="‖" place="margin">Hist. Eccles. lib. iii. cap. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> himself has given us of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He tells us that as <hi>Ignatius</hi> was on his way to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was to be cast to the Wild Beasts; he not only confirm'd the <hi>Churches</hi> that were in the places through which he passed, by his Exhortations, but wrote to the Chiefest of those others that were near, such <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles</hi> as these of which we are now speaking. And that, as he goes on, in this following Order. First, from <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Vid. Chrys. Orat. ad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochen.</note>, where he tarried some time with his Old Acquaintance and Fellow-Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> he wrote to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, Magnesians, Trallians</hi> and <hi>Romans:</hi> And being gone farther on his Way to <hi>Troas,</hi> he from thence wrote to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphians,</hi> and <hi>Smyrneans</hi>; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Letter to <hi>Polycarp,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61802:26"/>8. I SAY nothing to the Testimony of <note n="‖" place="margin">Libr. de Script. Illustr. cap. xvi.</note> St. <hi>Hierome</hi> as to this Matter, who as he exactly agrees with <hi>Eusebius</hi> in all this, so I make no question but that he transcribed his Account out of him. It is I think sufficiently evident from what has been already observed, not only that St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> did in general write <hi>some Epistles</hi> which even Mounsieur <note n="*" place="margin">Apud Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Vindic. Ignat. Prole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gom. pag. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Daillé</hi> himself thinks ought not to be any question; but that he wrote to those <hi>particular Churches</hi> to which the <hi>Epistles</hi> we now have, are directed; and of which I am perswaded there ought to be as little doubt.</p>
               <p n="9">9. AS for the other point proposed, and in which the foregoing also will be yet more fully confirmed; namely, that those <hi>Epistles</hi> we now have are the same that <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote: Two things there are that seem to determine our Belief of it. First; that there is nothing in these <hi>Epistles,</hi> as we now have them, either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Spirit of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> or the Character that Antiquity has given us of them: Nothing disagreeing to the Time in which he wrote, or that should seem to speak them to have been the Work of any latter Author; which hardly ever fails to appear in such pieces as are falsly imposed upon <hi>Ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>; and which not appearing in these <hi>Epistles,</hi> inclines us the more readily to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61802:26"/>
conclude that they were undoubtedly written by him whose they are said to be.</p>
               <p n="10">10. BUT this is only a presumptive Argument in favour of these <hi>Epistles</hi>; and which though it may serve to dispose us the more readily to receive them as true and genuine, yet is not alone suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove them so to be. The other Argument I have now to offer is positive and convincing; namely, That we find these <hi>Epistles,</hi> as they now are, exactly agreeing both with the Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which St. <note n="*" place="margin">Pearson Vind. Ignat. par. I. cap. 3. pag. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Polycarp</hi> and <note n="†" place="margin">Ibid. cap. ii. pag. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> have left us of those which they took to be the Authentick <hi>Epistles</hi> of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man; and with the numerous Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the <note n="‖" place="margin">Pearson ibid. pag. 8 ad 25. Comp. Testim. Cotelerii de Ignat. Et Usser. Dissert. Ignat.</note> 
                  <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> have taken out of them; and which all occur in the same Words, in our present Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of them, that they are cited in their Writings.</p>
               <p n="11">11. THIS has been so fully shewn by our most Learned Bishop <hi>Pearson,</hi> and indeed was so manifest of its self to any one that had ever made any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons of this kind; that Monsieur <note n="*" place="margin">Apud Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Vind. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. Proaem. pag. 20. Et Vind. par. i. pag. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Daillé</hi> himself could not deny but that we have the same <hi>Epistles</hi> now, that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius, Athanasius,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome, Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Gelasius</hi> had heretofore. So that the only Question then to be consider'd by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61802:27"/>
us is; Whether those which <hi>Eusebius,</hi> &amp;c. had, were not counterfeit, but the <hi>true Epistles</hi> of this great Martyr.</p>
               <p n="12">12. AND here, first, it is evident, that if those <hi>Epistles</hi> which <hi>Eusebius</hi> first, and then the rest of those great Men I before mentioned, took for the <hi>Genuine Epistles</hi> of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> were none of his; the true <hi>Epistles,</hi> which I have just now shewn, and which it is confes'd were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by him, must before that time have been utterly lost, or otherwise destroyed out of the World: It being very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that had the true <hi>Epistles</hi> been still remaining, neither so inquisitive a Search<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er into Antiquity as <hi>Eusebius</hi> should have heard of them, nor such great and learned Men as those that followed after, have had any Suspition of such a Deceit. But now whether this be probable; Whether it can be supposed that such <hi>Epistles</hi> as these, directed to so many great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Churches,</hi> collected by so Venerable a Man as St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and written by so glorious a Martyr as St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> should within so little time be utterly lost out of the <hi>Church</hi>; I shall leave it to any one, who considers how great a Reverence the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> had for every thing that came from the Hands of such Holy and Excellent Men, and such glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Martyrs</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> to determine.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:61802:27"/>13. WE read in the <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>See below,</hi> p. 228.</note> 
                  <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom</hi> of this Blessed Saint, with what a mighty Care those who went with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and were the Eye-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of his Sufferings, gathered up the few hard Bones of his Body which the Lions had left; and how they brought them back in a kind of Triumph to his Church at <hi>Antioch.</hi> And we are told with what Pomp they were many Ages after taken up from the place where they were first buried, and carried by the Command of the younger <hi>Theodosius</hi> within the City: Insomuch that as our <note n="†" place="margin">Evagrius lib. i. cap. 16. Nicephor. lib. xiv. cap. 44.</note> Historians observe, there was a Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Solemnity established upon that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; and Annually observed to the very time in which they wrote, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it. But was the Church then so careful of a few dead Bones of such a Saint as this, and did they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem them as so great a Treasure; and yet had they so little regard to his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, the last Testimonies of his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the <hi>Churches</hi> to which he wrote, as to suffer them within Two Hundred Years to be so utterly lost, as not to be once known or heard of, by the greatest and most curious Searchers into Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity? This is, I confess, to me so very improbable, that I could almost as easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe the Holy Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to have been upon a suddain
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61802:28"/>
changed into some other <hi>Epistles</hi> than what St. <hi>Peter</hi> or St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote; as that such <hi>Epistles</hi> as these could be so totally defaced, as some pretend, and new ones set out in the room of them, and yet no Body know any thing of the doing of it. But such Impossibilties as these must learned Men be content to please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and impose upon others withall, who resolve to be wiser than any that went before them; and to be able to know better at fiftteen hundred years distance what <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote, than those who lived within two Generations of him.</p>
               <p n="14">14. FOR to press our Argument yet more closely: Since it is allow'd that <hi>Ignatius</hi> did write some <hi>Epistles,</hi> and I think sufficiently evident that St. <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp</hi> did make a Collection of them, and send them together with his own to the <hi>Philippians</hi>; I presume it will not be question'd but that he most certainly had the Genuine Writings of that Holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, his dear Friend and Fellow-Disciple. Now St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> suffer'd not according to the earliest Computation of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Bishop <note n="‖" place="margin">Pearson dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert. Chron. ii. cap. xiv ad xx.</note> 
                  <hi>Pearson</hi> till the Year of our Saviour 147. And <note n="†" place="margin">Usher. Anno 169. Euseb. &amp; in eum Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. 167. Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus 175. &amp;c. <hi>See below.</hi>
                  </note> others suppose it to have been yet later. Hitherto there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is certain that the true <hi>Epistles</hi> of <hi>Ignatius</hi> continued in the Church: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by no means probable that they should
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61802:28"/>
have been changed whilst the Men lived to whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote; whilst <hi>Polycarp</hi> was living who collected them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and whilst those of the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> remained, to whom he sent them.</p>
               <p n="15">15. TO St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> let us add his Scholar and Admirer, <hi>Irenaeus</hi>; and as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self professes a most diligent Collector of whatever fell from that Holy Man. That he had the <hi>Epistles</hi> of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Euseb. Hist. Eccles. lib. v. cap. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> assures us; who particularly takes notice of his quoting several Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages out of them. And one of his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <note n="‖" place="margin">Ibid. lib. iii. cap. 36.</note> he mentions out of the Works of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> which still remain: And of which though the <hi>Greek</hi> be lost, yet the Old <note n="†" place="margin">Irenaeus, lib. iii. cap. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Latine Version,</hi> as well as the <hi>Greek</hi> of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> shews us, that it was taken out of the <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Ignatius</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> where it still occurs in our present Copy of it. And it must be allow'd that the other Passages of which <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaks, were also to have been found the <hi>Epistles</hi> as he had them: Because o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, the Difference between what the one quoted, and the other read in his Copy of those <hi>Epistles,</hi> would present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have discovered the Fraud; and shewn that his <hi>Epistles</hi> were not the same with those which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> mentioned.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:61802:29"/>16. AND this puts the Matter yet more out of doubt: For if <hi>Eusebius</hi> had the same <hi>Epistles</hi> that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had, we must allow one of these two things; Either that he had a Genuine Copy of them, as we affirm; or that <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> the Disciple and Contemporary of St. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp</hi> had not; which we think it very unreasonable to suppose.</p>
               <p n="17">17. FOR not to say any thing as to this Matter, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> lived too near the time both in which <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote, and St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> collected his <hi>Epistles,</hi> to have been imposed upon in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: Seeing he himself tells us how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful he was to gather up whatever came from the Hand of the Blessed <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and that he not only had the <hi>Epistles</hi> of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as appears by his citing of them; but, as <note n="‖" place="margin">Apud Euseb. Epist. ad Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin. Hist. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. lib. v. cap. 20.</note> himself declares, had also the Epistle of <hi>Polycarp</hi> to the <hi>Philippians</hi>; at the end of which the <hi>Epistles</hi> of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> were subjoyned: What can we conclude, but that the Copy he had of both was taken from that of his Master <hi>Polycarp</hi>; which being to be sure Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, it must remain that <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s was so too.</p>
               <p n="18">18. WERE it needful to add any thing yet farther to shew that <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who is confessed to have had the same Copy of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> that we have now,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61802:29"/>
had no other than that of St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> so often mentioned; I might to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> before alledged, add that of <note n="†" place="margin">Orig. Homil. vi. in Luc. Et in Cantic. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg.</note> 
                  <hi>Origen,</hi> who began to live some time before the other died. Now this Father has not only spoken of these <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,</hi> but has left us two Quotations to this day out of them; and both to be found in our Copies which we suppose to be true and Authentick. And from him to <hi>Eusebius</hi> was not above half a Century; too little a while for so great an Alteration to have been made in Writings spread up and down into so many Hands; read by all the Learned and Pious Men of those days; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all these Accounts utterly uncapable of such a Change, as is without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of one single Writer, only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I know not what Conjectures, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have been made in them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IN the foregoing Chapter I have given such an Account of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> as seem'd necessary to vindicate the Authority of them, and to remove those Prejudices which some had of late endeavour'd to raise against them. I am now to pass from the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61802:32"/>
Writings of this Holy Man, to his tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Great and Heroical Sufferings: An Account whereof is in the next place subjoyn'd, in the Relation of those who accompanied him from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>; and were there the Eye-Witnesses of his Martyrdom.</p>

               <p n="3">3. AND here it will be necessary for me in the first place to consider the Character which he gives of himself in the Beginning of all his <hi>Epistles,</hi> and which he constantly asserted before the <note n="*" place="margin">

As to the former Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, we are told by some of the Writers of his Life, that St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was the Child whom our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour took in his Arms, and set before his Disciples as a Pattern of Humility, when he told them, That <hi>unless they should be converted,</hi>

THERE is so much of <hi>Romance</hi> in all the latter part of this Story, and so little Grounds for the former, that I shall not need to spend any time in the confuting of either. It is enough that <note n="*" place="margin">Homil. in S. Ignat. To. I. Fevardent. p. 499, 506 B.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61802:34"/>
this sense was this Name commonly used among the Ancients; as has been shewn in a multitude of Examples by Bishop <note n="*" place="margin">Vind. Ignat. Part. II. p. 144.</note>

               </p>
               <p n="8">8. IT remains then that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was called <hi>Theophorus</hi> upon no other Account, than as any other Divine or Excellent Person might have been so called; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon the Account of his admirable Piety: Because his Soul was full of the Love of God, and sanctified with an extraordinary Portion of the Divine Grace; as both his Life shewed, and the earnest desire he had <hi>to be dissolved and to be with Christ</hi>; and his Joy when he saw himself approaching towards it; and (to mention no more,) his Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in his last, and most terrible Conflict with the Wild Beasts, will not suffer us to doubt.</p>

Or lastly, Whether, as <note n="*" place="margin">Mart. apud Coteler.</note> 
                  <hi>Metaphrastes</hi> tells us, upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting with Those of the <hi>Senate</hi> who were with him, he was advised <q>not to let him suffer at <hi>Antioch,</hi> least thereby he should raise his Esteem the more among the People there, and render him the more dear and desirable to them:</q>
We cannot but doubt, that God hereby designed to present to all
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61802:36"/>
the Nations through which he was to pass, a glorious Instance of the Power of his Religion, that could enable this Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Martyr with so much Constancy to despise all the Violence of his Enemies; and to be impatient after those Tryals which they hoped should have affrighted him into a base and degenerous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with their Desires.</p>
               <p n="14">14.

                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:61802:37"/>
were a sort of Men that did nothing contrary to the Laws, nor were guilty of any Impieties; but worshipped <hi>Christ</hi> as the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and exercis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Temperance both in Meat and Drink, nor medled with any thing that was forbidden: He began to repent of what he had done, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the <hi>Christians</hi> should indeed be searched out, but that being discover'd they should not be put to Death; On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they should not be admitted into any Offices, nor be suffer'd to meddle with any <hi>Publick Employs.</hi> Thus was not only the Life of <hi>Ignatius</hi> of great Use to the <hi>Church</hi>; but his very Death the means of procuring much Good to it.</q>
And what <hi>Metaphrastes</hi> here tells us, we find in effect deliver'd by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Usser. Annot. in Act.

               <p n="16">16. BUT tho' I should be far from envying any thing that might make for the Honour of this Blessed Martyr; yet are there many Circumstances in the Story which <hi>Metaphrastes</hi> has here put together, that make me justly call in question the Truth of it. For first, it is evident beyond all doubt, that the <hi>Persecution</hi> was abated at <hi>Antioch</hi> before
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61802:37"/>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> suffer'd, nay before he was yet gone out of the Lesser <hi>Asia.</hi> Insomuch that in his three last <hi>Epistles</hi> which he wrote from <hi>Troas,</hi> to the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> the <hi>Smyrnaeans,</hi> and to <hi>Polycarp</hi> himself; he particularly takes notice of the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church of Antioch,</hi> and exhorts them to send Congratulatory Messages thither upon the account of it.</p>
               <p n="17">17. NOR was this Suspension of the Persecution granted upon <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but upon the Remonstances which his own Officers made to him both of the Numbers of those that died for the Christian Faith, and of the Innocency of their Lives; and lastly of the Readiness with which they not only suffer'd when taken, but voluntarily came and presented themselves before them. Two of these <hi>Epistles</hi> relating to this very Persecution we have still remaining; the One writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <note n="*" place="margin">Apud Usser.

It is true that notwithstanding these <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts</hi> of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> the Persecution still continued; nor was it so soon over in other Places as it was at <hi>Antioch.</hi> This is plain not only from the <hi>History</hi> of this time left us by <note n="*" place="margin">Lib.

                  <hi>Prayer</hi> which this <hi>Holy Saint</hi> made at his <hi>Martyrdom</hi>: Where, say our <hi>Acts,</hi>

whether it be worth the observing, that in the <hi>Collection</hi> made by the late Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cotelerius</hi> of the Writings of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Fathers,</hi> there is instead of these <hi>Genuine Acts,</hi> inserted the Account which <hi>Metaphrastes</hi> put together of his Sufferings, several <hi>Ages</hi> after.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. WHEN I first enter'd upon the Design of publishing the following <hi>Collection,</hi> I intended to have here put an End to it: The following Pieces under the Names of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Hermas,</hi> together with the <hi>Second Epistle</hi> of St. <hi>Clement</hi>; however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly very Ancient, and confess'd by all to come but little, if any thing, short of the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Times; having yet been neither so highly esteem'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ancients, nor so generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by many of the present Times, as those I have already mention'd. But when I consider'd the Deference which Others among the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> have paid to them, and the Value which is still put upon them by many, not inferior either in Learning or Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to those who speak against them; I thought I could not better satisfie All, than by adding them in a <hi>Second Part</hi> to the fore-going <hi>Epistles:</hi> That so both they who have a just Esteem for them, might not complain of being defrauded
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61802:47"/>
of any part of what remains of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Writings</hi>; and those who are otherwise minded might look upon them as standing in a second Rank, and not taking place, (which otherwise they must have done,) of those undoubtedly Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and Admirable <hi>Discourses,</hi> that make up the former part of this Work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. AND here the first <hi>Piece</hi> that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs, is the <hi>Catholick Eplistle</hi> of St. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> the <hi>Companion</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Disciple</hi> of our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi>: Being generally esteem'd to have been one of the <note n="*" place="margin">Clem. Alex. Strom. Lib. II. p. 410. Euseb. Hist. Eccles. lib. I. cap. 12. &amp; lib. II. cap. 1.</note> LXX. that were chose by him; However our Country-Man <note n="†" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. IT is not my design to enter on any long Account of the Life of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so largely spoken of in the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi>; and of whom little certain can be written, besides what is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded. His <hi>Country</hi> was <hi>Cyprus,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Island</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean Sea</hi>; where there inhabited in those days so great a Number of <hi>Jews,</hi> that in the Time of <note n="*" place="margin">Euseb. Chron. ad ann. CXVII.</note> 
                  <hi>Trajan</hi> they conspired against
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61802:48"/>
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> there, and slew of them <note n="*" place="margin">Dion. lib. LXVIII. Xiphiline, &amp;c.</note> two Hundred and Forty Thousand Men. Upon which being cast out of the <hi>Isle,</hi> they were never suffer'd upon any account to set foot again in it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of Death.</p>
               <p n="4">4. HIS <hi>Name</hi> was at first <hi>Joses,</hi> but by the <hi>Apostles</hi> changed into <hi>Barnabas</hi>; which being interpreted, says St. <hi>Luke,</hi> is the <hi>Son of Consolation:</hi> And as we may conjecture from the <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> iv.36, 37.</note> place where it is first mentioned, was given him by the <hi>Apostles</hi> as an Honourable Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his Charity, in selling his whole Estate for the Relief of the poor <hi>Christians</hi>; and upon the account of that <hi>Consolation</hi> which they received thereby.</p>
               <p n="5">5. HIS first <hi>Education,</hi> says <note n="‖" place="margin">Apud Baron. Annal. ad ann. XXXIV num. 262. Comp. <hi>Dr.</hi> Cave <hi>in his Life,</hi> numb. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastes,</hi> was at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel</hi>; by whom he was instructed, together with St. <hi>Paul</hi>: Which perhaps moved that great <hi>Apostle</hi> upon his Conversion to apply himself to him, as the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Person to introduce him into the Acquaintance of the other <hi>Apostles</hi>; and afterwards to embrace him as his chief Friend and Fellow-Labourer in the Work of the Gospel.</p>

From thence they fetch'd a pretty large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass through the <hi>Lesser Asia:</hi> And having with various Success preached to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Cities</hi> of it, after <note n="‖" place="margin">Usher.

                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:61802:49"/>8. HERE they tarried a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble space, in a sedulous Discharge of their <hi>Ministry:</hi> Till some Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies arising between the <hi>Jewish</hi> and the <hi>Gentile Converts,</hi> they were obliged for the better composing of them, to go up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; where a final End was put to them by <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="9">9. WITH Joy they return'd to their Disciples at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and brought the Determination of that Divine <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi> unto them. But it was not long 'ere St. <hi>Peter</hi> coming down after them, a little abated their Satisfaction: <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Galat.</hi> ii.11, 14.</note> Whilst to please the <hi>Jewish Converts</hi> he dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his <hi>Christian Liberty</hi>; and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> complains, led <hi>Barnabas</hi> also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same Dissimulation with him.</p>
               <p n="10">10. AND here St. <hi>Paul</hi> had occasion first of all to reprove St. <hi>Barnabas</hi>; which he did with great freedom, for his unseasonable Complyance. But it was not very long before he had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Occasion offer'd for a yet worser Contention with him. For the next Year these two <note n="*" place="margin">

was for taking his Cousin <hi>Mark</hi> again with them, but St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not consent to it; because that in their former Travels he had consulted too much his own Ease and safety, and <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> xiii.13.</note> left them at <hi>Pamphilia</hi> in the midst of their Journey.</p>
               <p n="11">11. BEING both resolute in their Opinions, the One to take his Kinsman with him, the Other not to yield to it; They not only came to some sharp Words with one another about it, but went their several ways <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> xv.36, 41.</note>, <hi>Barnabas</hi> with <hi>Mark</hi> to <hi>Cyprus</hi>; and <hi>Paul</hi> with <hi>Silas,</hi> into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia.</hi> Thus after a joynt Labour in their Ministry for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Fourteen Years, were these two excellent Men, by a small Punctilio, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from one another: The <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> intending hereby to shew us, that the <hi>Best Christians</hi> are still subject to the same Infirmities with other Men; and therefore ought not to be either too much exalted in their own Piety, or to despise others whom they suppose to be less perfect than themselves,</p>
               <p n="12">12. NOR was it a small Benefit which from hence accrued not only to the <hi>Church,</hi> which thereby enjoyed the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of these two great Men much more in their separate Labours, than if they had continued still together; but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61802:50"/>
to St. <hi>Mark:</hi> Who being by the Severity of St. <hi>Paul</hi> brought to a deep Sense of his former Indifference in the Work of the Gospel, and yet not left by St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> to give way to any desperate Resolutions thereupon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came afterwards a most useful <hi>Minister of Christ,</hi> and deserved not only to be made again the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Colos.</hi> iv.10.</note> Companion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but to receive a very high Testimony of his <note n="†" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv.11.</note> Zeal from him. So well does the Wisdom of <hi>God</hi> know how to turn the Infirmities of Men to his own Glory, and to the Good of those who serve him with an honest and upright Heart.</p>
               <p n="13">13. WHAT became of St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> after this, and whither he went, is very uncertain. <note n="*" place="margin">Recognit. Clem. apud Baron. Annal. ad ann. LI. num. 52, 54. Et not. ad Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Jun. xi.</note> Some tell us, that from <hi>Cyprus</hi> he went on to <hi>Rome,</hi> and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Gospel</hi> there, even before St. <hi>Peter</hi> came thither. But tho' <hi>Baronius</hi> can by no means allow this, yet is he content that <hi>Barnabas</hi> should be thought to have come thither after him. At least this he <note n="‖" place="margin">Ibid. Annal. num. 54.</note> pretends to be without Dispute, that St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> came into <hi>Italy,</hi> and preach'd the <hi>Gospel</hi> in <hi>Liguria</hi>; where he founded the ancient <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> as from many ancient Monuments and Writers, says he, might be made appear; tho' at the same time he produces not one Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in proof of it. I shall therefore conclude, till I am better inform'd, that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61802:50"/>
St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> spent the Remains of his Life in converting his own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the <hi>Jews</hi>; of which as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore observed, there were such vast Numbers in that <hi>Island,</hi> and for whom we cannot but think he must have had a very tender regard. Or if we shall suppose him to have gone any farther, I presume it was only into the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts of the <hi>Lesser Asia,</hi> and <hi>Judaea,</hi> where he had before preach'd; or at farthest into <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. in Vit. ejus Edit.

                  <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where some tell us he went, and consecrated his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew St. <hi>Mark</hi> the first Bishop of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> at <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. AND in this Opinion I am the rather confirm'd from the consideration of his <hi>Epistle</hi> which I have here sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd: Which seems manifestly to have been design'd for the Benefit of the <hi>Jews</hi>; and to shew how all the parts of it had a farther Spiritual Meaning than what at first sight appear'd, and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to lead them to the Faith and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. IN this Exercise therefore he most likely spent his Life; and if we may credit the Relation of the <note n="†" place="margin">Alexandr. Monach. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. Barnabae.</note>

                  <hi>Baronius</hi> himself is forced to acknowledg, that there is nothing of this kind to be met with in any ancient Author; nor does either <hi>Eusebius</hi> or <note n="‖" place="margin">Hieron. de script. in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nab.</note> St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> where they treat expresly of this <hi>Holy Man,</hi> so much as once give the Title of <hi>Martyr</hi> to him.</p>

               <p n="29">29. NOW the Account which <note n="*" place="margin">Euseb. Hist. Eccles. loc. cit. p. 44. B.</note>

And this was that which a late Learned <note n="‖" place="margin">Bruno de Therap. p. 193</note>

               <p n="30">30.

               <p n="31">31.

If any one shall think it strange, that disputing against the <hi>Jews</hi> for the Truth of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> he should not have urged any of those <hi>Passages</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which seem to us the most apposite to such a purpose; Such as the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Jacob</hi> concerning the <hi>Time</hi> that <hi>Shiloh</hi> was to come; the LXX <hi>Weeks</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>; the <hi>Prophecies</hi>

It was therefore then but little necessary to use those Arguments against them, which now appear to be the most proper and convincing; since the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> is alter'd, and the <hi>Jews</hi> either deny that their <hi>Messiah</hi> is come; or that it was necessary for him to have come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time, that our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> appeared in the Flesh.</p>

               <p n="4">4. WHAT the Condition of this <hi>Hermas</hi> was before his <hi>Conversion,</hi> we cannot tell; but that he was a Man of some Consideration, we may conclude from what we read of him in his <hi>Third</hi>

               <p n="6">6. BUT this was not all; he not only patiently bore with them, but was himself disturb'd with many anxious <note n="†" place="margin">

But however, being of an honest and upright Disposition, and having a great Sincerity in his Religion; it pleased God at last not only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of his Faults, in thus negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his Family, but to give them Grace to hearken to his Admonitions, and to embrace at once both the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith,</hi> and a <hi>Practice</hi> also suitable thereunto.</p>
               <p n="7">7. WHAT he did after this we have no account; but that he lived a very strict Life, we may reasonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, in that it pleased God to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61802:61"/>
such extraordinary Revelations to him; and to employ him in several Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages to his <hi>Church,</hi> both to correct their Manners, and to warn them of the <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi> that were about to come upon them.</p>

But then if this be so, as I think it most likely that it is; we must conclude that the <hi>Epistle</hi> of which we are now speaking, was indeed the first written to them, however called

               <p n="3">3.

And to the end I may proceed the more clearly in this Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I will divide the several Pieces now to be examined into the <hi>Three</hi> following Ranks: The, <hi>First,</hi> of Those which are <hi>Antecedent</hi> to any I have here collected; as being pretended to have been written either by our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> himself, or by the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> or by the <hi>Apostles.</hi> The, <hi>Second,</hi> of such Other <hi>Tracts</hi> as are ascribed to some of those <hi>Fathers,</hi> whose <hi>Genuine Remains</hi> I have here put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:61802:70"/>4. OF the first of these kinds is that pretended Letter of our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> to <hi>Abgarus</hi> King of <hi>Edessa,</hi> a little City of <hi>Arabia</hi>

                  <hi>Evagrius</hi> who wrote about Two Hundred Years after this, not only confirmed all that had been said by Both these, but added, from <hi>Proco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> several other Circumstances, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, for ought appears, to either of them.

                  <hi>Du Pin</hi> well observes) there never was any.

               <p n="30">30. THERE is then nothing in any of those Pieces which make up the rest of <hi>Cotelerius</hi>'s Collection, and are indeed All that still remain under the Names of those Fathers of which we are now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that can with any good Grounds be relied upon as the Genuine Products of those Holy Men. Let us see, in the last place; Whether any of those Discourses which have been sent abroad under the Names of some others of the <hi>Apostolical Fathers,</hi> may deserve to be received by us, as coming truly from them.</p>
               <p n="31">31. AND here I shall in the first place take it for granted, that what those who are usually the most fond of such Spurious Pieces; I mean, the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> have yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most unanimously rejected as false and counterfeit, may securely be laid aside by us, without any further enquiry into the Condition of them.

                  <hi>Natalis Alexander</hi> himself was ashamed to undertake the Defence of them: And not only he, but all the other Writers of the same <hi>Church, Baronius, Bellarmine, Sixtus Senensis, Possevine, Espencaeus, Bisciola, Labbe, &amp;c.</hi> have freely acknowledged the little Credit that is to be given to them.</p>
               <p n="32">32. BUT two Pieces there are which <hi>Alexander</hi> is still unwilling to part with; tho' he cannot deny but that the most Learned Men, even of his own Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, have at last agreed in the rejecting of them. And those are, the <hi>Passion of St.</hi> Andrew, written, (as is pretended,) by the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of <hi>Achaja</hi>; and the Works set out under the Name of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite.</hi>

               <p n="34">34. BUT much less is the Credit that ought to be given to the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Works of <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite:</hi> Which as <note n="‖" place="margin">Natal. Alex. §. I. Vol. I. p. 136. Labbe de Script. Tom. I. in Dionysio.</note>

it be imagin'd, that had such consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Books as these been written by him, none of the Ancients of the first IV Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies should have heard any thing of them. Or shall we say that they did know of them; as well as the Fathers that lived after, and yet made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, tho' they had so often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to have done it, as <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> not to name any Others, had?</p>
               <p n="35">35. IN short, one of the first times that we hear of them, is in the Dispute between the <hi>Severians</hi> and <hi>Catholicks</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Year D.XXX.II. When the Former produced them in favour of their Errours, and the Latter rejected them as Books utterly unknown to all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore not worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them.</p>
               <p n="36">36.

               <p n="37">37.

               <head>CHAP. X. Of the <hi>Authority</hi> of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Treatises,</hi> and the <hi>Deference</hi> that ought to be paid to them upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>This is shewn from the following Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations: <hi>1st,</hi> That the <hi>Authors</hi> of them were <hi>Contemporary</hi> with the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and instructed by them. <hi>2dly,</hi> They were Men of an eminent <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> and therefore to be sure such as could not be ignorant of what was taught in it. <hi>3dly,</hi> They were very careful to preserve the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in its Purity, and to oppose such as went about to corrupt it. <hi>4thly,</hi> They were Men not only of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Piety,</hi> but of great <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Constancy;</hi> and therefore such as cannot be suspected to have had any Design to prevaricate in this Matter. <hi>5thly,</hi> They were endued with a large Portion of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and as such, could
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61802:81"/>
hardly err in what they deliver'd as the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> And <hi>6thly,</hi> Their <hi>Writings</hi> were approved by the <hi>Church</hi> in those days, which could not be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in its <hi>Approbation</hi> of them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUT, <hi>Secondly,</hi> and to proceed yet farther: The following <hi>Collection</hi> pretends to a just Esteem, not only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of its <hi>Perfection,</hi> as it is an <hi>Entire Collection</hi> of what remains to us of the <hi>Apostolical Fathers</hi>; but yet much more, from the Respect that is due to the <hi>Authors</hi> themselves, whose Writings are here put together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IF, <hi>First,</hi> we consider them as the Contemporaries of the <hi>Holy Apostles</hi>; Some of them bred up under our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ</hi> himself, and the rest instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by those Great Men whom he commissioned <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> xxviii.19. <hi>Mark</hi> xvi.15.</note> 
                  <hi>to go forth and preach to all the World,</hi> and <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv.49. <hi>Acts</hi> i.8. <hi>Acts</hi> ii.</note> endued with an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Assistance</hi> of his Blessed <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> for the doing of it: We cannot doubt but that what they deliver to us, must be, without Controversie, the <hi>pure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi>; What <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> taught, and what they had themselves received from their own Mouths. This is the least Deference we can pay to them, to look upon them as faithful Deliverers of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in those most
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61802:82"/>
early Times: When <hi>Heresies</hi> were not as yet so openly broke out in it, Nor the true Faith so dangerously corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Mixture of those erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Opinions, which afterwards more fatally infected the Minds of Men, and divided the <hi>Church</hi> into so many Parties and Factions. So that here then we may read with Security, and, let me add, with Respect too: And not doubt but what these <hi>Holy Men</hi> deliver to us, is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the true Doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> as if we had received it, like them, from our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. BUT, <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Authors</hi> of the following Pieces had not only the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of living in the <hi>Apostolical Times,</hi> and of hearing the <hi>Holy Apostles,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with them, but they were of a very <hi>Eminent Character</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> too; Men raised up to the highest pitch of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> in some of the most <hi>famous Churches</hi> of the World; Chosen by the <hi>Apostles</hi> to preside in their own proper <hi>Sees</hi>; at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> at <hi>Smyrna</hi>; One of them set apart, by the express Command of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> to be the Companion of the Great St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Work of the Ministry; and the rest for the most part commended for their rare Endowments, in the inspired Writings of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us. And therefore we may be sure
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61802:82"/>
that such Men as these must needs have been very carefully <hi>instructed</hi> in the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and have had a most perfect and comprehensive <hi>Knowledg</hi> of the <hi>Faith,</hi> as it is in <hi>Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. HAD they been some ordinary and obscure Writers, even of the <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Times,</hi> Men of no Note, no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the <hi>Church</hi>; tho' still whilst we had a good Account of their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, the very Advantage of the <hi>Age</hi> wherein they lived would have render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Discourses justly Venerable to us; yet should we not perhaps have been obliged to pay such a Deference to their Writings, as not to make Allowance for some little Defects or Mistakes that might have happen'd to them. But now having to do with Men, not only instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in common by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> with the other <hi>Christians</hi> of those days, but particularly bred up, and instituted by them: Having here the Writings of Men who had attained to such a perfect Knowledg in the Mystery of Godliness, and were judg'd to have been so well grounded and setled in it, as to deserve to be raised up by the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves to the Government of such eminent Churches, as those over which these Holy Men were <hi>Over-Seers</hi>: It is plain that we cannot with any reason doubt of what they deliver to us, as the <hi>Gospel</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:61802:83"/>
of <hi>Christ</hi>; but ought to receive it, if not with equal Veneration, yet but with a little less Respect, than we do the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writings</hi> of those who were their Masters and Instructers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. YET farther, <hi>Thirdly</hi>: The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Authors,</hi> were not only such E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Men, and bred up under such mighty Advantages, and so well instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Knowledg of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as I have now observed; but they were moreover Persons of a <hi>Consummated Piety,</hi> adorn'd with all those <hi>Christian Virtues</hi> they so affectionately recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to us. But especially, they were zealous <hi>Watchmen</hi> over their <hi>Churches</hi>; careful to instruct them in the true <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and no less care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preserve them against the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of those <hi>Heresies,</hi> which even in their days began to corrupt the Purity of it. Hence we read with what Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness that Blessed Martyr <hi>Ignatius</hi> first, and then his Fellow-Disciple St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> set themselves against those who would insinuate some <hi>Other Doctrines</hi> into the Minds of their People, than what the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> had deliver'd unto them. What wise <hi>Directions</hi> they gave them for the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi> of such <hi>false Teachers</hi>; <note n="*" place="margin">Euseb. Hist. Eccles. lib. III. c. 35.</note> and how earnestly they <hi>exhorted</hi> them by keeping firm to their respective <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> and to the <hi>Apostolical Doctrine</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61802:83"/>
by them, to prevent their gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Advantage against them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. WITH what Assurance do they deliver the Doctrine which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? How confidently do they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it to be the <hi>true Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>? And exhort the <hi>Churches</hi> to whom they write, not to give any heed to such as would insinuate any Other Doctrine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Minds? And how did they themselves shew them by their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, how they should avoid such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? Insomuch that <note n="*" place="margin">Epist. ad Flor. in num. apud Euseb. Hist. Eccles. lib. V. c. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us, that if St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> at any time chanced to hear any One deliver any Other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine than what he had been taught, he did not only not give any Countenance to such an One; but was wont to stop his Ears at him, and cry out with Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Grief, <hi>Good God! To what Times hast thou reserved me, that I should endure this</hi>? Nay he would not tarry in the same place with such a Person, but would leave the House, if he knew that any <hi>Hereticks</hi> were in it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. BUT of the Care which these Holy Men had to keep close in every the least Circumstance to the Doctrine and Practice of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> we cannot, I think, desire a fairer Instance to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, than what <note n="†" place="margin">Euseb. Hist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eccles. lib. v. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of the same Blessed <hi>Martyr.</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:61802:84"/>
How that hearing of the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western Churches</hi> about the <hi>Time</hi> of keeping <hi>Easter,</hi> he thought it worthy his Pains, at an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme old Age, to take a Journey as far as <hi>Rome</hi> for the composing of it. And notwithstanding all that <hi>Anicetus,</hi> who was then <hi>Bishop</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> could say to move him from his <hi>Practice</hi>; yet having this Ground for it, that St. <hi>John</hi> was wont to keep <hi>Easter</hi> as he did; the good Man held close to it, and would not hear of changing a <hi>Custom</hi> which that blessed <hi>Apostle</hi> had deliver'd to him.</p>
               <p n="8">8. AND when such was the Care which these Holy Writers had of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fast, even to the least particular, of what they received from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that they would not comply with the rest of the <hi>Church</hi> in such an indifferent matter, only because by so doing they should depart from the Practice of One of them; Surely we may with Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence depend upon the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they deliver, as most <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>genuine</hi>; What our <hi>Saviour</hi> taught his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> them.

               <p n="9">9. TO this general Piety of their Lives, and Care for the Truth and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Religion; let me add, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> their Courage and Constancy in the maintaining of it. How great this was I have already shewn, in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Accounts which I have given of the several <hi>Fathers</hi> whose <hi>Writings</hi> are here subjoyn'd. It shall suffice in this place to observe, that the most of them after having spent their Lives in a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful administration of the great Charges to which they were called, were at last made perfect by <hi>Martyrdom</hi>; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent the most <hi>exquisite Cruelties</hi> with a <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Constancy,</hi> worthy both of the <hi>Religion</hi> they profess'd, and of the eminent <hi>Characters</hi> which they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. NOW tho' this do's not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately argue the <hi>Purity</hi> of their <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> yet being added to what I have before observed, will give us a new Ground to rely upon the Truth of what they deliver. For since we cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably doubt but that such Persons as these, must needs have known what the Doctrine of the <hi>Apostles</hi> was; and have been perfectly instructed in that Religion which they were esteem'd able
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61802:85"/>
and worthy to preach to others: We have in this a clear Demonstration of their Integrity both in their Teaching and Writing of it; and must conclude, That they who liv'd such excellent Lives, and took so much Pains in the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi>; that stuck with such Firmness to it, notwithstanding all the Endeavours of their Enemies to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and chose rather to undergo the most bitter Deaths, than they would in any wise depart from it; have doubtless dealt most uprightly in this matter, and deliver'd nothing to us but what they took for the true Doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> and what therefore we may conclude, undoubtedly was so.</p>
               <p n="11">11. SUCH good reason then have we upon all these Accounts to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Writings</hi> of these <hi>Holy Men,</hi> as containing the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>uncorrupted Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> and his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</hi> But now, <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance yet higher: These Writers were not only thus qualified by these Ordinary means to deliver the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to us, but in all probability were endued with the <hi>Extraordinary Assistance</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> too. So that what they teach us, it not to be look'd upon as a mere traditionary Relation of what had been deliver'd to them, but rather, as an <hi>Authoritative Declaration</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61802:85"/>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> to us; tho' indeed as much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,</hi> as their <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Assistances</hi> were less than theirs.</p>

               <p n="14">14.

               <p n="15">15. CONCERNING the former of these, we are told by St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> vi.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61802:86"/>
that when the <hi>Apostles</hi> thought it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to establish a new <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> that might take care of those things, which they, who were of a higher Rank, could not find Leisure to attend to; tho' their <hi>Ministry</hi> were of the lowest Nature, and which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much lesser Capacities in those who were to discharge it, than theirs whose Business it was to <hi>Govern</hi> and <hi>Instruct</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; yet they particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly laid it down to the <hi>Brethren,</hi> as one of the <hi>Qualifications</hi> that was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Those whom they chose for that purpose, that they should be <hi>Men well approved of, full of the Holy Spirit and of Wisdom,</hi> Vers. 3. And of One of them, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> it is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly observed, Vers. 8. <hi>That he was full of Faith and Power, and did Signs and great Wonders among the People.</hi> And when the <hi>Jews</hi> disputed against him, we read Vers. 10. <hi>That they were not able to stand against the Wisdom and Spirit by which he spake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. NOW if such were the Care which they took in the Choice of those who were to be admitted into the lowest <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; We cannot doubt but that they were certainly much more careful not to admit any into the highest Rank of Honour and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in it, but what were in a yet
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61802:87"/>

And the Other <note n="‖" place="margin">Clem. Alex. de Divit. Salv. num. xlii. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seb. Hist. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. lib. III. c. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Clement</hi> yet more plainly speaks the same thing: That St. <hi>John</hi> being returned from his Banishment in <hi>Patmos,</hi> went about the Country near unto <hi>Ephesus,</hi> both to form and settle <hi>Churches,</hi> where he saw occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and to admit into the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Clergy, such as were mark'd out to him by the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. AND then for the Other thing observed; It is clear that the very <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Hands,</hi> did in those days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> in an extraordinary manner, upon Those who were ordain'd to the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> This
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61802:87"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates in his <hi>First Epistle</hi> to <hi>Timothy, Ch.</hi> iv.14. where he exhorts him <hi>to stir up, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Gift, i. e.</hi> the extraordinary Power of the <hi>Holy Spirit, which,</hi> says he, <hi>is in thee by the Imposition of my hands.</hi> 2 Tim. i.6. And would you know how this Ceremony of setting him apart for such a Service came to endue him with such an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Power; the same <hi>Apostle</hi> will tell you, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv.14. <hi>That it was given unto him by Prophecy; with, or through the Imposition of Hands</hi> upon him. That is to say; <hi>God,</hi> who by his <hi>Prophets</hi> had before design'd and mark'd him out for that great Office, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i.18. upon the actual admission of him into it by the outward Rite of <hi>Laying on of Hands,</hi> and upon the solemn Prayers that were then withal made for him, did bestow the <hi>Gifts</hi> of his <hi>Blessed Spirit,</hi> in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner upon him.</p>
               <p n="18">18. NOW this as will it afford us just cause to conclude that those Holy Men, whose Writings we have here col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, were doubtless endued with a very large Portion of the extraordinary <hi>Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> Whether we consider the <hi>Frequency</hi> of those <hi>Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in the <hi>Age</hi> in which they lived; Or the <hi>extraordinary Strictness</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> of their <hi>Lives</hi>; Or the <hi>Greatness</hi> of those <hi>Stations</hi> to which they were called in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61802:88"/>
the <hi>Church</hi>; Or lastly, the <hi>Judgment</hi> which the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who called them to those <hi>high Offices,</hi> were by the <hi>Spirit</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to make of them; So, (3<hi>dly</hi>) If we look to those Accounts which still remain to us of them; they will plainly shew us that they were endued, and that in a very singular manner, with this <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Gift</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Spirit.</hi>

               <p n="19">19. OF <hi>Barnabas,</hi> the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> it self bears Witness, that <hi>He was a good Man, full of the Holy Ghost, and of Faith, Acts</hi> xi.24. <hi>Hermas</hi> is another of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself makes mention, <hi>Rom.</hi> xvi.14. as an early Convert to <hi>Christianity:</hi> And what extraordinary <hi>Revelations</hi> he had, and how he <hi>foretold</hi> the <hi>Troubles</hi> that were to come upon the <hi>Church,</hi> his following <hi>Visions</hi> sufficiently declare.</p>
               <p n="20">20 <hi>CLEMENT</hi> is not only spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by the same <hi>Apostle,</hi> but with this advantageous <hi>Character</hi> too, that he was the <hi>Fellow-Labourer</hi> of that great Man, and had <hi>his Name written in the Book of Life, Phil.</hi> iv.3. And when we shall consider to how much lesser and worser Men these <hi>Gifts</hi> were usually commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated at that time; we can hardly think that so excellent a Man, and the Companion of so great an <hi>Apostle</hi>; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed first in the <hi>planting</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi>

with him, and then set to govern one of the most considerable <hi>Churches</hi> in the World, should have been destitute of it.</p>
               <p n="21">21. AS for St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> I have before observed that he had this <hi>Gift</hi>; and by the help of it, warned the <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="24">24. I SHALL add but One Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration more, the better to shew the true Deference that ought to be paid to the <hi>Treatises</hi> here collected, and that is, <hi>Sixthly:</hi> That they were not only writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by such Men as I have said, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and judg'd worthy by them both for their Knowledg and their Integrity, to govern some of the most eminent <hi>Churches</hi> in the World; and lastly, <hi>endued</hi> with the <hi>extraordinary Gift</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; and upon all these Accounts to be much respected by us: But were moreover received by the

                  <hi>Church</hi> in those <hi>First Ages,</hi> as <hi>Pieces</hi> of a very great value, which could not be mistaken in its Judgment of them.</p>
               <p n="25">25. THE <hi>Epistle</hi> of St. <hi>Clement</hi> was a long time read publickly with the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Scriptures</hi> in the <hi>Congregations</hi> of the Faithful; made a part of their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and was numbred among the <hi>Sacred Writings,</hi> however finally separated from them.

<q>That they are such <hi>Epistles,</hi> by which we may be greatly profited; For, <hi>says he,</hi> They treat of Faith and Patience, and of all things that pertain to Edification in the <hi>LORD.</hi>

               <p n="29">29. SO that now then we must either say that the <hi>Church</hi> in those days was so little careful of what was taught in it, as to allow such <hi>Books</hi> to be <hi>publickly read</hi> in its <hi>Congregations,</hi> the Doctrine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it did not approve; Or we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that the following Pieces are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to us, not only by the Learned Men of the <hi>First Ages</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but by the whole Body of the Faithful, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

For since it is certain that in those Times the <hi>Extraordinary Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> were bestowed, not only upon the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> (tho' upon them in a more eminent degree) but also upon a great many of the common <hi>Christians</hi> too: Since One particular <hi>Design</hi> of these <hi>Gifts</hi> was for the <hi>Discerning</hi> of <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> to judg of what was <hi>proposed</hi> by any to the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>written</hi> for the <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi> of it: We cannot doubt but what was universally approved of and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, not by a <hi>few Learned Men,</hi> but by the <hi>whole Church</hi> in those days; what was permitted to be publickly read to the Faithful for their Comfort and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; must by this means have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a more than <hi>Humane Approbation</hi>; and ought to be look'd upon by us, tho' not of <hi>Equal Authority</hi> with those <hi>Books</hi> which they have deliver'd to us as <hi>strictly Canonical,</hi> yet as standing in the first Rank of <hi>Ecclesiastical Writings,</hi> and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the true and pure <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> without the least <hi>Error</hi> intermix'd with it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That in the following <hi>Treatises,</hi> there is deliver'd to us a good account, both of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Times. This shewn in several particulars.

What we meet with in these <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises</hi> concerning the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Of the Necessity of <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating</hi> with the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of it. Of <hi>Schismaticks, Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates.</hi> Of their <hi>publick Assembling</hi> for the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and what was done by them in those Meetings. Of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Instances of their <hi>Discipline;</hi> particularly, of their <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of <hi>Sins.</hi> Of the Care which
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61802:91"/>
their <hi>Bishops</hi> had of the whole <hi>Church.</hi> Of the <hi>Respect</hi> that was paid to them.

Of their <hi>Practical Instructions,</hi> and how severe their <hi>Morality</hi> was; shewn in several particulars. That upon the whole, we may here see what the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> then was, and still ought to be.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. AND now having shewn in the foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> what Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence we ought to pay to the <hi>Authority</hi> of those <hi>Holy Men,</hi> whose <hi>Writings</hi> I have here collected; it may not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, in the <hi>Third</hi> place to enquire, What it is which they deliver to us; what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we find in them, of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in those Times in which they lived.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IT would be endless for me to go about to make a just <hi>Catalogue</hi> of all the Particulars of this kind that occur in the following Pieces; and I have already in a great measure perform'd it, in the <hi>Index</hi> which I have for that purpose subjoyn'd to them. I shall therefore here consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der only a few particulars, in such Points as may seem most worthy to be remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and by them (as by a short <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> shew) How the Judicious <hi>Reader</hi> may himself improve it, into a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

               <p n="3">3.

only the <hi>Son of God,</hi> but is himself also <hi>God.</hi> That in the fulness of Time he took upon him our <hi>Nature,</hi> and became <hi>Man</hi>: Was <hi>born</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> was <hi>crucified</hi> under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi>; That he <hi>suffer'd</hi> for our <hi>Salvation,</hi> and was <hi>raised</hi> again from the <hi>dead,</hi> not only by the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> but by his <hi>Own</hi> also. That he is our <hi>High-Priest</hi> and <hi>Protectour</hi> now, and shall come again at the End of the <hi>World,</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> the whole Race of Mankind.

of our <hi>Death.</hi> And that tho' the <hi>Devil</hi> may attacque us, and use all his Arts to draw us away from our <hi>Duty</hi>; yet it must be our own Faults if we are overcome by him, and therefore that we ought not to be afraid of him.</p>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61802:93"/>
but at large proved too, in the following Discourses. There we may see, not only that there shall be a <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Resurrection</hi>; but that we shall be <hi>raised</hi> in the very <hi>same Bodies</hi> in which we go down into the <hi>Grave.</hi> And that being raised, we shall be <hi>judged</hi> by <hi>Christ</hi> according to our <hi>Works</hi>; and be either <hi>unspeakably rewarded,</hi>

And how light soever some may make of the Business of <hi>Schism</hi> now,<note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>See Schism.</hi>
                  </note> yet it is plain these <hi>Holy Men</hi> had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different Apprehension of it, and hardly thought that such could be <hi>saved</hi> as continued in it.</p>

And in the mean time, they declare,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61802:94"/>
that we ought not to have any Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with them: Only we must <hi>pray</hi> for them, that they may be <hi>converted,</hi> which yet they supposed would be very hard.</p>
               <p n="16">16. AS for those who continued in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>;<note place="margin">

Here we may see, how from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they had their set <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi>: And how they look'd upon such <hi>Offertories,</hi> both as more acceptable unto God, and more prevalent with him, than any <hi>Private Addresses</hi> that they could make to him.</p>
               <p n="17">17. IN these <hi>Assemblies,</hi> they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put up their <hi>Prayers</hi> to <hi>God,</hi>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61802:95"/>
after the same manner, that our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> had set them the <hi>Example</hi>; of <hi>one common Loaf,</hi> which was <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>distributed</hi> to them, not of little separate and unbroken Wafers, as some now do.</p>

in the <hi>Church,</hi> came that mighty Respect, that was shewn to the <hi>Bishops</hi> in those days: And which how great it was, the following <hi>Treatises</hi> abundantly shew.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Index, <hi>Suffer.</hi>
                  </note> But if God called a Man to it, they doubted not but that our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ</hi> would both support him in his <hi>Conflicts,</hi> and most gloriously reward him for the enduring of them. Hence was it their Opinion, that <hi>Martyrdom</hi> blotted out all <hi>Sins</hi>: That they who suffer'd for the Faith, should have a <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> peculiar to themselves, above all <hi>Other Saints</hi> in <hi>God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> And when God shew'd such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for them, they concluded that they could never almost do enough, to testifie their Respect to them.</p>

TO this we must ascribe the Care they took to gather up their <hi>Remains,</hi> the <hi>Honour</hi> which they gave to them, and the <hi>Solemnities</hi> with which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited them into the Earth. Hence came their <hi>Custom,</hi> which we here find,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61802:96"/>
of writing down the particulars of their <hi>Conflicts</hi>; and sending them abroad to the <hi>Churches</hi> round about. Hence their <hi>Anniversary Meetings</hi> at their <hi>Tombs</hi> and <hi>Monuments,</hi> Where they recited the <hi>Acts</hi> of their <hi>Martyrdoms,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made express Discourses in <hi>Praise</hi> of their <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and to <hi>exhort</hi> One Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the like <hi>Constancy.</hi>

We must consider, that <hi>Troubles</hi> and <hi>Afflictions</hi> are not only sent upon us to punish us for our Sins; but as <hi>Monitors</hi> too, to draw us off from them.</p>

and <hi>Schismaticks</hi>; for those of whom there is but little Hope that they will ever come to <hi>Repentance,</hi> or that <hi>God</hi> will give them <hi>Grace</hi> so to do.</p>
               <p n="36">36.

               <argument>
                  <p>That the <hi>Writers</hi> of those Times used no <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation</hi> of <hi>Humane Eloquence;</hi> but deliver'd themselves with the greatest <hi>Plainness</hi> that they were able.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:61802:98"/>1. THERE is yet one thing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by me, with Reference to the <hi>Discourses</hi> here subjoyn'd; and that is, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> concerning the <hi>Manner</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they are <hi>written,</hi> and that true primitive Simplicity, which appears in all the parts of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IT is one Property of <hi>Truth,</hi> that as it do's not need any Disguises, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does it seek any vain Ornaments of Humane Eloquence, to recommend it self to the Approbation of those to whom it is tender'd. When the <hi>Apostles</hi> preach'd the <hi>Gospel</hi> to the World, they did it not <hi>with Excellency of Speech, nor with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing Words of Mans Wisdom; but in the demonstration of Spirit and of Power.</hi> They gave such convincing Proofs of their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mission,</hi> as forced all indifferent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to acknowledg their Authority: And they thought it after that, too mean a thing to endeavour to <hi>catch</hi> Mens <hi>Ears,</hi> when without any such Arts they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>captivated</hi> their <hi>Reason,</hi> and forced them to confess the <hi>Truth</hi> of what they deliver'd.</p>
               <p n="3">3. AND the same was the Method of those <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> who succeeded them. They knew the Excellency of their <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> and the mighty Influence which the <hi>Revelations</hi> it made of the <hi>Future
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61802:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
State,</hi> would be sure to have upon the Minds of all considering Men: And therefore they contented themselves to lay these things before them in a plain and simple manner; and with such an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Sincerity, as is beyond all the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Rhetorick</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p n="4">4. LET not then the <hi>Reader</hi> be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised, if in the following Discourses he meets with none of those Ornaments, that are wont to recommend the Writings of Others to his perusal. But rather let him consider, that he has here to do with Men who were above such a Care. Their business was to <hi>instruct</hi> not to <hi>please</hi>; to speak to Mens <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Consciences,</hi> not to their <hi>Fancies</hi>: And they knew that this is evermore best done by a plain and unaffected Discourse; by solid <hi>Rules</hi> and substantial <hi>Motives,</hi> not by <hi>vain Words</hi>; which if they satisfie a Man at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, yet seldom leave any <hi>lasting Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> behind them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. BUT of the <hi>Authors</hi> of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Treatises,</hi> and of the <hi>Discourses</hi> themselves I have said enough, perhaps too much: Tho' yet I think no more than what was necessary to prepare the <hi>English Reader,</hi> for whom I am now chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd, to a useful perusal of them. As for the present <hi>Collection,</hi> I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say thus much; that it is the first of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61802:99"/>
this kind that was ever set forth in our <hi>own Language</hi>; nor were the greatest part of the following <hi>Pieces,</hi> ever (that I know of) before <hi>translated</hi> into it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I CONFESS, when I consider the great Usefulness of such a Work, and the high Esteem, which not only the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> but the most Learned of all Ages have had of the <hi>Treatises</hi> here <hi>collected</hi> together; I have sometimes won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that among so many things as have of late been brought into the <hi>English Tongue,</hi> none has yet hitherto undertaken such a Task as this. But when I came to the Tryal, I soon found out what may perhaps have been one reason of it: Since, could I have foreseen the Difficulty of the Work, I much question whether I should ever have been persuaded to go about it. And this I say, not to magnifie any thing that I have done, which I have too much reason to fear will be far from deserving any great Commendation; but to suggest an <hi>Apology</hi> for whatever Defects those of greater Leisure, more Health, and better Abilities, shall chance to find in it, notwithstanding all the Care I have taken to guess aright at the Intention of my <hi>Authors,</hi> and to deliver what upon the best Examination I could make, I then took to be their Meaning.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:61802:100"/>7. I NEED not say any thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince those who are at all acquainted with these Matters, and who are alone the competent Judges of the present Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, How hard oftentimes it is, with the help of the best <hi>Copies,</hi> to hit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the true Meaning of an <hi>Author</hi> that lived so many <hi>Ages</hi> since, as those I have here <hi>collected.</hi> And what great Defects in many places there are, in the <hi>Copies</hi> I have here been forced to make use of, is not unknown to them. Had I whilst I was about this Work, been in another place, where I could have had recourse to the Assistance of a very Learned Friend; than whom none could have afforded me a better help in this particular, or would more readily have done it; I should have had much less reason to apprehend any <hi>Defects</hi> in it. But however, as it is, I am not aware of any great Errors that I have committed; and am in some hope that I have no where very much, nor at all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerously, mistaken the Meaning of those <hi>Holy Men,</hi> whose Sense I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to represent.</p>
               <p n="8">8. THIS I am sure of, that my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in this whole Undertaking, was to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the best I could to the Interests of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Piety:</hi> And I thought my self at this time, the rather obliged to do it from the <hi>Press,</hi> in that it has pleased God
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61802:100"/>
in some measure to take me off, from the Ability of doing it, from the <hi>Pulpit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. IF it shall be ask'd how I came to chuse the Drudgery of a <hi>Translator,</hi> rather than the more ingenuous part of publishing somewhat of my own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, it was in short this; Because I hop'd that such Writings as these would find a more general and unprejudiced ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with all sorts of Men, than any thing that could be written by any One now living: Who, if esteem'd by some, is yet in danger of being despis'd by more; whose Prejudice to his Person will not suffer them to reap any Benefit, by any thing, tho' never so useful, that can come from him; Whilst such <hi>Tracts</hi> as these may possibly receive a general Respect from all sorts of Persons; and meet not only with an <hi>Entertainment,</hi> but an <hi>Esteem</hi> too from <hi>All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. THESE were the <hi>Motives</hi> that first induced me to set about this Work; and in the Reasonableness of which should I chance to be mistaken, yet I cannot but persuade my self that the Honesty of my Intentions, shall excuse me to all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Persons. Let Others then, to whom God has given better <hi>Opportunities,</hi> and greater <hi>Abilities,</hi> serve the <hi>Church</hi> in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and higher <hi>Performances.</hi> It shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice me in any way to minister to the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61802:101"/>
Souls of Men. And if by this present Undertaking I shall but in any measure have contributed to the reviving a true Sense of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> among us; but especially to the disposing of any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men to consider more seriously the fatal Consequences of our present Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and to labour what in them lies to the Composing of them; I shall heartily bless God, both that he first prompted me to undertake this troublesome Task, and has since enabled me, tho' amidst many <hi>Infirmities,</hi> to go through with it.</p>

Perfect, that I may attain to that Portion, which by God's Mercy is allotted to me: Fleeing to the Gospel as to the Flesh of Christ; and to the Apostles as to the <hi>Great</hi> Presbytery of the Church.

                     <p n="7">VII.

                     <p n="8">VIII. I THEREFORE did as became me, as a Man composed to Unity. For where there is Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and Wrath, God dwelleth not. But the Lord forgives all that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, if they <note n="*" place="margin">

                        </note> that he will free you from every Bond. Nevertheless I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you that you do nothing out of Strife, but according to the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christ.

                     <p n="9">IX. THE Priests indeed are Good: But much better is the High Priest to whom the Holy of Holies has been committed; and who alone has been intrusted with the Secrets of God.

And all these things <hi>tend</hi> to the Unity <hi>which is</hi> of God. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Gospel has somewhat in it far <hi>above all other Dispensations</hi>; Namely, the Appearance of our Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, his Passion and Resurrection. For the Beloved Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets refer'd to Him: But the Gospel is the Perfection of Incorruption. All <hi>therefore</hi> together are Good, if ye believe with Charity.</p>

These also bear witness unto you. And I my self give Thanks to God for you, that ye received them, as the Lord shall <hi>receive</hi> you.

But I arm you before-hand against certain Beasts in the shape of Men; whom you must not only not receive, but if it be possible must not meet with. Only you must pray for them, that if it be the Will of God they may repent; which yet will be very hard. But of this our Lord Jesus Christ has the Power, who is our true Life. For if all these things were done only in shew by our LORD, then do I also only seem to be Bound: And why have I given up my self to Death, to the Fire, to the Sword, to Wild Beasts? But <hi>now</hi> the nearer I am to the Sword, the nearer am I to God: What is between me and the Beasts, is between me and God. Only in the Name of Jesus Christ, who was a Perfect Man, and by his
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61802:196"/>
Assistance, am I ready to suffer All things together with Him.</p>

But for the Names of such as do this, they being Unbelievers, I thought it not fitting to write them unto you. Nay, God forbid that I should make any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, till they shall repent to <hi>a true Belief of</hi> Christ's Passion, which is our Resurrection.</p>

                     <p n="8">VIII. FOLLOW your Bishop, as Jesus Christ, the Father: And the Presbytery, as the Apostles. As for the Deacons, reverence them as the Command of God.

we have received them. <hi>Moses,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Servant took them; but the LORD himself has given them unto us, that we might be the People of his Inheritance, having suffered all things for us.

For this cause there shall be both a Resurrection and a Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution. I beseech those that are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent among you, if so be you will take the Counsel which with a good intention I offer to you; You have those with you towards whom you may do good; Do not forsake them. For the Day is at hand in which All things shall be destroyed, together with the Wicked One. The LORD is near, and his Reward is with him. I beseech you therefore again and again; be as good Law-givers to one another; continue faithful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors to each other; Remove from among you all Hypocrisie. And may God, the LORD of all the World, give you Wisdom, Knowledge, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; and a true apprehension of his Judgments in Patience. Be ye

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:61802:259"/>
that I saw her wash'd in the River <hi>Tyber</hi>; and I reach'd out my hand unto her, and help'd her out of the River. And when I saw her, I thought with my self, saying, That I should be happy had I fortun'd to have met with a Wife like unto her both for her Beauty and Manners. This I thought with my self; nor did I think any thing more. But not long after, as I was walking and musing on these Thoughts, I began to honor the Creature of God, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my self how noble and beautiful it is. And when I had walk'd <hi>a little,</hi> I fell asleep. And the Spirit caught me away, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me through a certain Place to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Right-hand, through which no Man could pass. It was a Place among Rocks, very steep, and unpassable for Water. When I was past this Place I came into a Plain; and there falling down upon my Knees, I began to pray unto the LORD, and to confess my Sins. And as I was praying, the Heaven was opened, and I saw the Woman which I had coveted, saluting me from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:61802:259"/>
and saying, <hi>HERMAS,</hi> hail! And I looking upon her, answered, Lady, What dost thou do here? She answered me, I am taken up hither to convince thee of Sin unto the LORD. Lady, said I, Wilt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me? No, said she: but hear the Words which I am about to speak unto thee. God who dwelleth in Heaven, and hath made All things out of Nothing, and has multiplied them for his Holy Churches sake, is angry with thee, because thou hast sinned against me. And I answering said unto her, Lady, If I have sinned against thee, <hi>tell me</hi> where, or in what Place, or when did I ever speak an unseemly or dishonest Word unto thee? Have I not always esteemed thee as a Lady? Have I not always reverenced thee as a Sister? Why then dost thou imagine these wicked things against me? Then she, smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon me, said, The desire of Naughtiness has risen up in thy heart. Does it not seem to thee <note n="*" place="margin">Edit.

very great one, to such a Man: for a righteous Man thinketh what is righteous. And whilst he does so, and walketh uprightly, he shall have the LORD in Heaven favourable unto him in all his Works. But as for those who think wickedly in their hearts, they take to themselves Death and Captivity: and especially those who love this present World, and glory in their Riches, and regard not the good things that are to come; their Souls wander up and down, <hi>and know not where to fix.</hi> Now this is the Case of such as are Doubtful, who trust not in the LORD, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise and neglect their own life.

                        <p n="2">II. AS soon as she had spoken these Words the Heavens were shut, and I remained utterly swallowed up in Sadness and Fear; and said within my self, If this be laid against me for Sin, how can I ever be saved? or how shall I ever be able to intreat
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61802:260"/>
the LORD for my many and great Sins? With what Words shall I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech him to be merciful unto me? As I was thinking over these things, and meditating in my self upon them, behold a Chair set over against me of the whitest Wool, as bright as Snow. And there came an old Woman in a bright Garment, having a Book in her hand, and sate alone,<note place="margin">Vid. Hieron. in Hosoam. vii.9.</note> and salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, saying, <hi>HERMAS,</hi> hail! And I being full of Sorrow, and weeping, answered, Hail, Lady! and she said unto me, Why art thou sad, <hi>Hermas,</hi> who wert wont to be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and modest, and always cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? I answered, and said to her, Lady, a Reproach has been objected to me by an excellent Woman, who tells me that I have sinned against her. She replied, Far be any such thing from the Servant of God. But it may be the desire of her has risen up in thy Heart? <hi>For</hi> indeed there is such a Thought even in the Servants of God, leading unto Sin. Nor ought such a detestable Thought to be in the Servant of God; nor should a Spirit that is approved desire that

which is evil; nor especially <hi>HER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS,</hi> who contains himself from all wicked Appetites, and is full of all Simplicity, and of great Innocence.</p>

NEVERTHELESS the LORD is not angry with thee for thine own sake, but upon the account of thy House, which has committed Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness against the LORD, and against their Parents. And that Act of thy Fondness towards thy Sons; in that thou hast not admonished them, but hast permitted them to live wickedly; and for this Cause the LORD is angry with thee: But he will heal all the Evils that are done before thee in thy House. For through their Sins and Iniquities, thou art wholly consumed in secular Affairs. But now the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God hath taken Compassion upon thee, and upon thine House, and hath <note n="*" place="margin">

As the Workman bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his Work, offers it to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he pleases; so shalt thou by teaching every day what is just, cut
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61802:261"/>
off a great sin. Wherefore cease not to admonish thy Sons, for the LORD knows that they will repent with all their heart, and he will write thee in the Book of Life. And when she had said this, she added unto me; Wilt thou hear me Read? I answer'd her, Lady, I will. Hear then, <hi>said she</hi>; And opening the Book she read, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, greatly, and wonderfully, such things as I could not keep in my Memory. For they were terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Words, such as no Man could bear. Howbeit I committed her last Words to my Remembrance; for they were but few, and of great use.
<q>Behold the mighty LORD, who by his invincible Power, and with his excellent Wisdom made the World, and by his glorious Counsel encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed the Beauty of his Creature, and with the Word of his strength fix'd the Heaven, and founded the Earth upon the Waters; and by his powerful Vertue establish'd his Holy Church, which he hath blessed: Behold, he will remove the Heavens, and the Mountains, the Hills and the Seas; and all

                        <p n="1">I. AS I was on the Way to <hi>Cumae,</hi> about the same time that I had been the last Year, I began to call to mind the Vision I formerly had. And again the Spirit carried me away, and brought me into the same Place, in which I had been the Year before. And when I was come into the Place, I fell down upon my Knees, and began to Pray unto the LORD, and to Honour his Name, that he had esteemed me worthy, and had manifested unto me my former Sins. And when I arose from Prayer, behold I saw over against me the Old Woman whom I had seen the last Year, walking and reading in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Book. And she said unto me, Can'st thou tell these things to the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61802:263"/>
Elect of God? I answered and said unto her, Lady, I cannot retain such great things in my Memory, but give me the Book, and I will write them down. Take it, says she, and see that thou restore it again to me. As soon as I had receiv'd it, I went aside into a certain Place of the Field, and transcribed every Letter, for I found no Syllables.<note place="margin">Clem. Alex. Strom. vi.</note> And as soon as I had finished what was written in the Book, the Book was suddenly caught out of my hands, but by whom I saw not.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. AFTER fifteen days, when I had fasted, and intreated the LORD with all earnestness, the Knowledge of the Writing was revealed unto me. Now the Writing was this: Thy Seed, O HERMAS! hath sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against the LORD, and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed their Parents, through their great Wickedness. And they have been called the Betrayers of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and have gone on in their Treachery. And now have they added Lewdness to their other Sins, and the Pollutions of Naughtiness;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:61802:263"/>
Thus have they fill'd up the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their Iniquities. But do thou upbraid thy Sons with all these Words; and thy Wife, which shall be thy Sister. And let her learn to refrain her Tongue, with which she calumniates. For when she shall hear these things, she will refrain her self, and shall obtain Mercy. And <note n="‖" place="margin">

Then shall their Sins be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given which they have heretofore committed, and the Sins of all the Saints, who have sinned even unto this day; if they shall repent with all their Hearts, and remove all Doubts out of their Hearts. For the LORD hath sworn by his Glory concerning his Elect, having determined the certain Day, that if any one shall even now sin, he shall not be saved. For the Repentance of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous has its End. The Days of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are fulfilled to all the Saints; but to the Heathen, there is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance even unto the Last Day. Thou
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:61802:264"/>
shalt therefore say to those who are over the Church, that they order their Ways in Righteousness; that they may fully receive the Promise with much Glory. Stand fast there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye that work Righteousness; and continue to do it, that your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture may be with the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Happy are ye, as many as shall endure the Great Tryal that is at hand, and whosoever shall not deny his Life. For the LORD hath sworn by his Son, that who so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth his Son and him, being afraid of his Life; he will also deny him in the <note n="‖" place="margin">

                        <p n="3">III. BUT thou, O <hi>Hermas!</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not the Evils which thy Sons have done, neither neglect thy Sister, but take care that they amend of their former Sins. For they will be instructed by this Doctrine, if thou shalt not be mindful of what they have done wickedly. For the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Evils worketh Death;
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61802:264"/>
but the Forgetting of them, Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. But thou, O HERMAS! hast under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone a great many Wordly Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for the Offences of thy House; because thou hast neglected them, as things that did not belong unto thee; and thou art wholly taken up with thy great Business. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, for this cause shalt thou be saved, that thou hast not departed from the Living God; And thy Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and singular Continency shall preserve thee, if thou shalt continue in them.

Happy are all they that do Righteousness, they shall not be consumed for ever. But thou wilt say; Behold there is a great Tryal coming. If it seems good to thee, Deny <hi>him</hi> again.

MOREOVER, Brethren, it was reavealed to me, as I was sleeping, by a very goodly young Man, saying unto me; What thinkest thou of that old Woman from whom thou receivedst the Book; Who is she? I answered, a Sybil. Thou art mistaken, said he, she is not. I reply'd, who is she then, Sir? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered me, it is the Church of God. And I said unto him, Why then do's she appear Old? She is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, said he, an Old Woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she was the first of all the Creation, and the World was made for her. After this I saw a Vision at home in my own House, and the Old Woman whom I had seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, came to me and ask'd me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had yet deliver'd the Book <hi>which she had given me</hi> to the Elders <hi>of the Church?</hi> And I answered, that I had not yet. She reply'd, Thou hast well done, for I have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Words <hi>more</hi> to tell thee.

                        </head>
                        <p n="1">I. THE Vision which I saw, Brethren, was this. When I had often fasted and pray'd unto the LORD, that he would manifest unto me the Revelation which he had promised by the Old Woman to shew unto me: The same Night she appear'd unto me, and said unto me; because thou dost thus afflict thy self, and art so desirous to know All things, come into the Field, where thou wilt, and about the sixth Hour, I will appear unto
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:61802:266"/>
thee, and shew thee what thou must see. I ask'd her, saying; Lady, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what part of the Field? She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, wherever thou wilt, <hi>only</hi> chuse a good and a private place. And before I could begin to speak and tell her the place, she said unto me; I will come where thou wilt. I was therefore, Brethren, in the Field, and I observed the Hours, and came into the place where I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to go. And I beheld a Bench placed; it was a linnen Pillow, and over it spread a Covering of fine Linnen. When I saw these things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in this Manner, and that there was no Body in the place, I began to be astonish'd, and my Hair stood on end, and a kind of Horror seiz'd me, for I was alone. But being come to my self, and calling to mind the Glory of God, and taking Courage, I fell down upon my Knees, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan again to confess my Sins as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And <hi>whilst I was doing this,</hi> the <hi>Old Woman</hi> came thither with the six young Men whom I had seen before, and stood behind me as I was praying and confessing my
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:61802:266"/>
Sins unto the LORD. And touching me, she said; leave off now to pray only for thy Sins; pray also for Righteousness, that thou maist re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a part from her in thy House. And she lifted me up from the place, and took me by the Hand, and brought me to the Seat; and said to the young Men, Go, and Build. As soon as they were departed, and we were alone, she said unto me; sit here. I answered her; Lady, let those who are Elder sit first. She reply'd, sit down as I bid you. And when I would have sate on the right side, she suffered me not, but made a sign to me with her Hand, that I should sit on the left. As I was therefore musing, and full of Sorrow, that she would not suffer me to sit on the right side, she said unto me, HERMAS, why art thou sad? The place which is on the right Hand is theirs who have already attain'd unto God, and have suffered for his Name sake. But there is yet a great deal remaining unto thee, before thou canst sit with them. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, as thou dost in thy Sincerity,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61802:267"/>
and thou shalt sit with them; as all others shall that do their Works, and shall bear what they have born.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. I said unto her; Lady, I would know what it is that they have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered? Hear <hi>then,</hi> said she: Wild Beasts, Scourgings, Imprisonments, and Crosses for his Name sake. For this cause the right Hand of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness belongs to them, and to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as many as shall suffer for the Name of God; but the left belongs to the rest. Howbeit the Gifts and the Promises belong to both; to them, and to those on the left Hand; only that sitting on the right Hand they have some Glory <hi>above the others.</hi> But thou art desirous to sit on the right Hand with them; and thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are many. But thou shalt be purg'd from thy Defects: As also all who doubt not, shall be cleansed from all the Sins which they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto this Day. And when she had said this she would have departed; Wherefore falling down before her Feet, I began to intreat her, for the LORD'S sake, that she would shew
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61802:267"/>
me the Vision which she had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised. Then she again took me by the Hand, and lifted me up, and made me sit upon the Seat on the left side; and holding up a certain bright Wand, said unto me; seest thou that great thing? I reply'd; Lady, I see nothing. <hi>She answered</hi>; Dost thou not see over against thee a great Tower, which is built upon the Water with bright square Stones? For the Tower was built upon a square by those six young Men that came with her. And thousands of other Men brought Stones: Some drew them out of the Deep; Others carried them from the Ground, and gave them to the six young Men. And they took them, and built. As for those Stones which were drawn out of the Deep, they put them all into the Building; for they were polish'd, and their Squares exactly answered one another, and so one was joyn'd in such wise to the other, that there was no space to be seen where they joyn'd. Insomuch that the whole Tower appear'd to be built as it were of one Stone. But
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:61802:268"/>
as for the other Stones that were taken off from the Ground, some of them they rejected, others they fitted into the Building. Others they cut out, and cast at a distance from the Tower. Moreover there were many other Stones, which lay round about the Tower, which they made no use of in the Building. Some of these were rough, others had Clefts in them; others were white and round, not proper for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Tower. Besides these, I saw other Stones cast afar off from the Tower, and falling into the High-Way, but not continuing in the Way, but were rolled from the Way into a desert Place. Others I saw falling into the Fire and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Others were glowing hot just by the Water, yet could not roll themselves into it, though very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to fall into the Water.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. AND when she had shew'd me these things she would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. But I said unto her, Lady, What do's it profit me to see these things, and not understand what they
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61802:268"/>
mean? She answer'd and said unto me, you are very cunning, in that you are desirous to know those things which <note n="‖" place="margin">

                           </note> relate to the Tower. Yea, said I, Lady, that I may declare them unto the Brethren; and they may rejoyce, and hearing these things may glorifie God with great Honour. Then she said; Many indeed shall hear them, and when they shall have heard them, some shall rejoyce, and others weep. And yet even these, if they shall repent, shall rejoyce too. Hear therefore what I shall say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Parable of the Tower, and after this be no longer importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with me about the Revelation. For these Revelations have an end, seeing they are fulfilled. But thou dost not leave off to desire Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for thou art very <note n="†" place="margin">Edit. Oxon.</note> urgent. As for the Tower which thou seest built, it is I my self, namely the Church, which have appeared to thee both now, and heretofore. Wherefore ask what thou wilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Tower, and I will reveal it unto thee, that thou mayst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with the Saints. I said unto
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:61802:269"/>
her, Lady, Because thou hast thought me once worthy to receive from thee the Revelation of all these things, declare them unto me. She answer'd me; whatsoever is fit to be revealed unto thee, shall be revealed: <note n="*" place="margin">Clem. Alex. Strom. xii.</note> Only let thy Heart be with the LORD, and doubt not, whatsoever thou shalt see. I ask'd her, Lady, why is the Tower built upon the Water? <hi>She replied</hi>; I said before to thee that thou wert very Wise to enquire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently concerning the Building! therefore thou shalt find the Truth. Hear therefore why the Tower is built upon the Water:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Baptism.</hi>
                           </note> Because your Life is and shall be saved by Water. For it is founded by the Word of the Almighty and Honourable Name; and is supported by the Invisible Power and Virtue of God.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. AND I answering said unto her; These things are very admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: But Lady, who are those six young Men that build? They are, <hi>said she,</hi> the Angels of God, which were first appointed, and to whom the LORD has deliver'd all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:61802:269"/>
to build them up, and to rule over. For by these the Building of the Tower shall be finish'd. And who are the rest who bring them Stones? They also are the Holy Angels of the LORD; but the other are more excellent than these. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the whole Building of the Tower shall be finished, they shall all feast together besides the Tower, and shall glorifie God, because the Structure of the Tower is finish'd. I ask'd her, saying; I would know the Condition of the Stones, and the meaning of them, what it is? She answering said unto me; Art thou better than all others, that this should be revealed unto thee? For others are both before thee, and better than thou art, to whom these Visions should be made manifest: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless that the Name of God may be honour'd, it has been, and shall be reveal'd unto thee, for the sake of those who are doubtful, and think in their Hearts whether these things are so or not? Tell them that all these things are true; and that there is nothing in them that
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:61802:270"/>
is not true; but all are firm, and truly established.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. HEAR now then concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stones that are in the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The square and white Stones, which agree exactly in their joynts; are the Apostles, and Bishops, and Doctors, and Ministers who through the Mercy of God have come in, and govern'd, and taught, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred holily and modestly to the Elect of God, both that are fallen asleep, and which yet remain; and have always agreed with them, and have had peace within themselves and with each other. For which cause their Joints exactly meet together in the Building of the Tower. They which are drawn out of the Deep and put into the Building, and whose Joynts agree with the other Stones which are already built, are those which are already fallen asleep, and have suffered for the sake of the LORD'S Name. And what are the other Stones, Lady, that are brought from the Earth; I would know what they are? She answer'd, They which
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:61802:270"/>
lie upon the Ground and are not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, are those which God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved because they have walked in the Law of the LORD, and directed their ways in his Commandments. They which are put in the Building of the Tower, are the young in Faith and the Faithful. And these are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish'd by the Angels to do well, because that Iniquity is not found in them. But who are those whom they rejected, and laid besides the Tower? They are such as have sinn'd, and are willing to repent; for which cause they are not cast far from the Tower, because they will be useful in the Building if they shall repent. They therefore that are yet to repent, if they shall repent shall become strong in the Faith; that is, if they repent now, whilst the Tower is building. For if the Building shall be finish'd, there will then be no place for them to be put in, but they shall be rejected; For he only has this Priviledge, who shall now be put to the Tower.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="346" facs="tcp:61802:271"/>VI. BUT would you know who they are that were cut out and cast afar off from the Tower? <note n="‖" place="margin">Vid. Edit. Oxon.</note> Lady, said I, I desire it. They are the Children of Iniquity, who believed only in Hypocrisie, and departed not from their Evil Ways: For this cause they are not saved, because they are not of any Use in the Building by reason of their Sins. Wherefore they are cut out, and cast afar off, because of the Anger of the LORD, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have provoked him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against them. As for the great Number of other Stones which thou hast seen placed <hi>about the Tower,</hi> but not put into the Building; those which are rugged, are they who have known the Truth, but have not continued in it, nor been joyn'd to the Saints; and therefore are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. Those that have Clefts in them, are they who keep up Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in their Hearts against each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and live not in Peace; that are friendly when present with their Brethren, but as soon as they are departed from one another, their
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:61802:271"/>
Wickedness still continues in their Hearts. These are the Clefts which are seen in those Stones. Those that are maim'd and short are they who have believed indeed; but still are in great measure full of Wickedness; for this cause are they maim'd and not whole. But what are the white and round Stones, Lady, and which are not proper for the Building of the Tower? She answering said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; How long wilt thou continue Foolish and without Understanding; asking every thing and discerning nothing? They are such as have Faith indeed; but have withal the Riches of this present World. When therefore any Troubles arise, for the sake of their Riches they deny the LORD. I answering said unto her; when therefore will they be Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the LORD? When their Riches shall be cut away, says she, in which they take delight, then they will be profitable unto the LORD for his Building. For as a round Stone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he be cut away, and cast some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what oft of its Bulk cannot be made square; so they who are rich in this
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:61802:272"/>
World, unless their Riches be pared off, cannot be made profitable unto the LORD. Learn this from thy own Experience: When thou wert Rich, thou wast unprofitable; but now thou art profitable, and fit for the Life which thou hast under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; for thou also once wast one of those Stones.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. AS for the rest of the Stones which thou sawest cast afar off from the Tower, and running in the Way; and tumbled out of the Way into Desert places; they are such as have believed indeed, but through their doubting have forsaken their true Way, thinking that they could find a better. But they wander and are miserable; going into desolate Ways. Then for those Stones which fell into the Fire, and were burnt; They are those who have for ever departed from the Living God; nor has it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come into their Hearts to repent, by reason of the Affection which they bear to their Lusts and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses which they commit. And what are the rest which fell by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:61802:272"/>
and could not roll into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? They are such as have heard the Word; and were willing to be baptized in the Name of the LORD; but considering the great Holiness which the Truth requires, have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn themselves, and walk'd again after their wicked Lusts. Thus she finish'd the Explication of the Tower. But I being still urgent, ask'd her: Is there Repentance allow'd to all those Stones which are thus cast away and were not suitable to the Building of the Tower; and shall they find place in this Tower? They may repent, said she, but they cannot come into this Tower; but they shall be placed in a much lower Rank; and this after that they shall have been afflicted, and fulfill'd the Days of their Sins. And for this cause they shall be removed, because they have received the Word of Righteousness. And then they shall be translated from their Afflictions, if they shall have a true sense in their Hearts of what they have done amiss. But if they shall not have this Sense in their Hearts, they shall not be
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:61802:273"/>
saved, by reason of the Hardness of their Hearts.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. WHEN therefore I had done asking her concerning all these things, she said unto me; Wilt thou see somewhat else? And I being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of seeing it, I became very chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Countenance. She therefore looing back upon me, and smiling a little, said unto me: Seest thou se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Women about the Tower? La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, said I, I see them. This Tower, replied she, is supported by them, according to the Command of the LORD: Hear therefore the Effects of them. The first of them which holds her Hand fast, is called Faith; by her the Elect shall be saved. The next which is girt up, and looks Manly, is named Abstinence: She is the Daughter of Faith. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore shall follow her shall be happy in all his Life; because he shall abstain from all evil Works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that if he shall contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from all Concupiscence, he shall be the Heir of Eternal Life. And what Lady, said I, are the other five?
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:61802:273"/>
They are, reply'd she, the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of One another. One of them is called Simplicity; the next Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; the third Modesty; then Discipline, and the last of all is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. When therefore thou shalt have observed the Works of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou shalt be able to observe all things. Lady, said I, I would know what <hi>particular</hi> Virtue every one of these has. Hear then, replied she; They have equal Vertues; and their Vertues are knit together, and follow one another as they were born. From Faith proceeds Abstinence; from Abstinence, Simplicity; from Simplicity, Innocence; from Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, Modesty; from Modesty, Discipline and Charity. Therefore the Works of these are Holy and Chast, and Right. Whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall serve these, and hold fast to their Works, he shall have his Dwelling in the Tower with the Saints of God. <hi>Then</hi> I ask'd her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Times, whether the End were now at Hand? But she cry'd out with a loud Voice, saying; O foolish Man! Dost thou not see the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:61802:274"/>
Tower that it is always building? When therefore the Tower shall be finish'd, and built, it shall have an End; and indeed it shall soon be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished. But do not ask me any more Questions. What has been said may suffice for thee and for all the Saints; with the renewal of your Spirits. For these things have not been revealed to thee only, but that thou mayst make them manifest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all. For therefore, O HERMAS, after three Days thou must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand these Words which I begin to speak unto thee, that thou mayst speak them in the Ears of the Saints; that when they shall have heard and done them, they may be cleansed from their Iniquities, and thou to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. HEAR me therefore, O my Sons! I have bred you up in much Simplicity, and Modesty, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency; for the Mercy of God, which has dropp'd down upon you in Righteousness; that you should be sanctified, and justified from all Sin and Wickedness: But ye will not
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:61802:274"/>
cease from your evil Doings. Now therefore hearken unto me, and have Peace one with another, and visit one another, and receive one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and do not enjoy the Creatures of God alone. Give freely to them that are in need. For some by too free feeding contract an Infirmity in their Flesh, and do Injury to their Bodies; whilst the Flesh of others, who have not Food, withers away, because they want sufficient Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their Bodies are consum'd. Wherefore this Intemperance is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to you, who have, and do not communicate to them that want. Prepare for the Judgment that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to come upon you. Ye that are the more Eminent search out them that are Hungry, whilst the Tower is yet unfinish'd. For when the Tower shall be finish'd, ye shall be willing to do good, and shall not find any place for it. See therefore, ye that glory in your Riches, least perhaps they groan who are in want; and their Sighing come up unto God, and ye be shut out with your Goods without the Gate of the Tower.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:61802:275"/>
Behold I now warn you who are set over the Church, and love the highest Seats; be not ye like unto those that work Mischief. And they indeed carry about their Poison in Boxes; but ye contain your Poison and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in your Hearts; and will not purge them, and mix your Sense with a Pure Heart, that ye may find Mercy with the Great King. Take heed, my Children, that your Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deprive you not of your Lives. How will ye instruct the Elect of God, when ye your selves want Correction? Wherefore admonish one another, and be at Peace among your selves; that I standing before your Father, may give an Account for you unto the LORD.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. AND when she had made an end of talking with me, the six young Men that built came and carried her to the Tower; and four others took up the Seat <hi>on which she sate,</hi> and went away again, they also, to the Tower. I saw not the Faces of these, for their Backs were towards me. As she was going along
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:61802:275"/>
I asked her, that she would reveal to me what concern'd the three Forms in which she had appear'd unto me. But she answering said unto me; concerning these things thou must ask some other, that they may be revealed unto thee. Now, Brethren, in the First Vision the last Year, she appeared unto me exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old, and sitting in a Chair. In another Vision, she had indeed a youthful Face, but her Flesh and Hair were old; and she talked with me standing, and was more chearful than the first time. In the third Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, she was in all respects much younger, and comely to the Eye; only she had the Hair of an Aged Person: Yet she looked chearful, and sate upon a Seat. I was therefore very sad concerning these things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til I might understand the Vision. <hi>Wherefore</hi> I saw the same Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in a Vision of the Night saying unto me; All Prayer needeth Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. Fast therefore, and thou shalt learn from the LORD that which thou dost ask. I fasted therefore one Day. The same Night a young Man
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:61802:276"/>
appear'd to me and said; Why dost thou thus often desire Revelations in thy Prayers? Take heed that by asking many things, thou hurt not thy Body. Let these Revelations suffice thee; Canst thou see more notable Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than those which thou hast al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received? I answered and said unto him; Sir, I only ask this one thing upon the account of the three Figures of the Old Woman <hi>that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me,</hi> that the Revelation may be compleat. He answer'd me; You are not without Understanding, but your Doubts make you so; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as you have not your Heart with the LORD. I replyed and said; But I shall learn these things more carefully from you.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. HEAR then, says he, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Figures, about which you enquire. And first, in the first Vision she appear'd to thee in the Shape of an Old Woman; because your ancient Spirit was decay'd, and without Strength, by reason of your Infirmities, and the Doubtfulness of your Heart. For as they who are
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:61802:276"/>
Old have no hope of renewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor expect any thing but their Departure: So you being weakned through your worldly Affairs gave your self up to Sloath, and cast not away your Sollicitude from your self upon the LORD; and your Sense was confused, and you grew Old in your Sadness. But Sir, I would know why she sate upon a Chair? He answered; Because every one that is weak sitteth upon a Chair by reason of his Infirmity; that his Weakness may be upheld: See therefore the Figure of the first Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. IN the second Vision you saw her standing, and having a youthful Face, and more chearful than her former; but her Flesh and her Hair were ancient. Hear, said he, this Parable also. When any one grows Old, He despairs of himself by reason of his Infirmity and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty; and expects nothing but the last Day of his Life. But on the suddain an Inheritance is left to him; and he hears of it, and rises; and
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:61802:277"/>
being become chearful, he puts on <hi>new</hi> Strength; And now he no longer lies along, but stands; and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from his former Sorrow; and sits not, but acts manfully. So you, having heard the Revelation which God revealed unto you; because God had Compassion upon you, and renew'd your Spirit; both laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side your Infirmities, and Strength came to you, and you grew strong in the Faith; and God seeing your Strength rejoyced. For this cause he shewed you the Building of the Tower; and will shew other things unto you, if you shall have Peace with all your Heart among each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. BUT in the third Vision you saw her yet younger; fair and chearful, and of a serene Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. For as if some good News comes to one that is sad, he straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way forgets his Sadness, and regards nothing else but the good News which he has heard; and for the rest he is comforted, and his Spirit is renew'd through the Joy which
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:61802:277"/>
he has received: Even so you have been renew'd in your Spirit, by see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these good things. And for that you saw her sitting upon a Bench, it denotes a strong Position; because a Bench has four Feet, and stands strongly. And even the World its self is kept up by the four Elements. They therefore that repent perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, shall be young; and they that turn from their Sins with their whole Heart, shall be establish'd. And now you have the Revelation fully; ask no more to have any thing farther revealed unto you. But if any thing be to be revealed, it shall be made manifest unto you.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. I Saw a Vision, Brethren, twenty Days after the former Vision; a Figure of the Tribulation that is at hand. I was walking in the Field
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:61802:278"/>
Way: Now from the publick Way to the Mannour <hi>whither I went</hi> is about ten Furlongs. It is a Way very little frequented: And as I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, I entreated the LORD that he would confirm the Revelations which he had shew'd unto me by his Holy Church: and would grant Repentance to all his Servants, who had been offended, that his great and honourable Name might be glorified; and because he thought me Worthy to whom he might shew his Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and that I might honour him, and give thanks unto him. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold somewhat like a Voice answer'd me; <hi>Doubt not,</hi> HERMAS. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I began to think, and say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my self; why should I doubt, seeing I am thus setled by the LORD, and have seen such glorious things? I had gone but a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Brethren, when behold I saw a Dust rise up to Heaven. I began to say within my self; Is there a Drove of Cattle coming, that raises such a Dust? It was about a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long off from me. And behold I saw the Dust rise more and more, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61802:278"/>
that I began to suspect that there was somewhat extraordinary in it. And the Sun shone a little; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I saw a great Beast, as it were a Whale; and fiery Locusts came out of his Mouth. The Heigth of the Beast was about a hundred Feet; and he had a Head like a <note n="‖" place="margin">Vas ur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then I call'd to mind the Word which I had heard; <hi>Doubt not,</hi> HERMAS. Wherefore, Brethren, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Faith of God, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring who it was that had taught me great things, I deliver'd my self bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto the Beast. Now the Beast came on in such a manner, as if it could with one Blast have devour'd a City. I came near unto it; and the Beast extended its whole Bulk upon the Ground; and put forth nothing but its Tongue, nor once moved its self, till I had quite pass'd by it. Now the Beast had upon its Head four Colours, first Black, then a Red, and Bloudy Colour, then a Golden; and then a White.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="362" facs="tcp:61802:279"/>II. AFTER that I had pass'd by it, and was gon forward about thirty Foot; behold there met me a certain Virgin well-adorn'd, as if she had been just come out of her Bride-Chamber, all in white, having on white Shoes, and a Vail down her Face; and cover'd with shining Hair. Now I know by my former Visions that it was the Church; and thereupon grew the more chearful. And she saluted me saying, Hail O Man! I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd the Salutation, saying, Lady, Hail! She answering said unto me, Did nothing meet you, O Man! I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; Lady, There met me such a Beast, as seem'd able to devour a whole People: But by the Power of God, and through his singular Mercy I escap'd it. Thou didst escape it well, said she; because thou didst cast thy whole Care upon God; and open'dst thy Heart unto him; believing that thou couldst be safe by no other, than by his Great and Honourable Name. For this cause the LORD sent his Angel, who is over the Beasts, whose Name is HEGRIN, and stopp'd his
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:61802:279"/>
Mouth, that he should not devour thee. Thou hast escap'd a great Tryal by means of thy Faith; and because thou, didst not doubt for such a terrible Beast. Go therefore, and relate to the Elect of God, the great things that he hath done for thee. And thou shalt say unto them, that this Beast is the Figure of the Tryal that is about to come. If therefore ye shall have prepared your selves, ye may escape it, if your Heart be pure and without Spot; and if ye shall serve God all the rest of your Days without complaint. Cast all your Cares upon the LORD, and he will direct them. Believe in God, ye doubtful, because he can do all things; He can both turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Wrath from you, and send you Help and Security. Wo to the double-minded, to those who shall hear these Words, and shall despise them; It had been better for them that they had not been born.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. THEN I ask'd her concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the four Colours which the Beast had upon its Head. But she answer'd me, saying; Again art thou curious
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:61802:280"/>
in that thou askest concerning these things. And I said unto her, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; Shew me what they are? Hear, said she: The Black which thou sawest, <hi>denotes</hi> the World in which you dwell. The Fiery and Bloudy Colour, <hi>signifies,</hi> that this Age must be destroyed by Fire and Bloud. The Golden Part are ye, who have escaped out of it. For as Gold is try'd by the Fire, and is made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; so are ye also in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner try'd who dwell among <hi>the Men of this World.</hi> They therefore that shall endure to the end, and be proved by them, shall be purged. And as Gold, by this Tryal is cleansed and loses it Dross; so shall ye also cast away all Sorrow, and Trouble; and be made pure for the Building of the Tower. But the White Colour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the time of the World which is to come, in which the Elect of God shall inhabit: Because the Elect of God shall be pure and without Spot unto Life Eternal. Wherefore do not thou cease to speake these things in the Ears of the Saints. Here ye have the Figure of the great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:61802:280"/>
that is about to come; which if you please, shall be nothing to you. Keep therefore in mind the things which I have said unto you. When she had spoken thus much, she departed: But I saw not whither she went. But suddainly I heard a Noise, and I turn'd back, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid; for I thought that the Beast was coming toward me.</p>

Messenger, that I should dwell with thee all the remaining Days of thy life. But I thought that he was come to try me, and said unto him, Who are you? For I know to whom I am delivered. He said unto me, Do you not know me? I answer'd, No. I am, said he, that SHEPHERD, to whose Care you are delivered. Whilst he was yet speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Shape was changed; and when I knew that it was he to whom I was committed, I was asham'd, and a suddain Fear came upon me, and I was utterly overcome with Sadness, because I had spoken so foolishly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. But he said unto me, Be not asham'd, but stir up Vertue in thy Mind, through the Commands which I am about to deliver unto thee. For, said he, I am sent to shew unto thee all those things again, which thou hast seen before; and especially such of them as may be of most use unto you.

But be thou at all times mindful of the LORD, and thou shalt never sin. For if such an Evil Thought should arise in thy Heart, thou wouldst be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a great Sin; and they who do such things, follow the way of Death.
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:61802:285"/>
Look therefore to thy self, and keep thy self from such a Thought: For where Chastity remains in the Heart of a Righteous Man, there an Evil Thought ought never to arise. And I said unto him, Sir, Suffer me to speak a little with you. He bad me, Say on. And I answer'd, Sir, If a Man shall have a Wife that is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the LORD, and shall catch her in Adultery; shall a Man sin that continues to live still with her? And he said unto me; As long as he is ignorant of her Sin, he commits no fault in living with her: But if a Man shall know his Wife to have offended; and she shall not repent of her Sin, but go on still in her Fornication, and a Man shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue nevertheless to live with her, he shall become guilty of her Sin, and partake with her in her Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And I said unto him; what therefore <hi>is to be done</hi> if the Woman continues on in her Sin? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; Let her Husband put her away, and let him continue by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But if he shall put away his Wife, and marry another, he also
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:61802:285"/>
shall commit Adultery. And I said; What if the Woman that is so put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way shall repent, and be willing to return to her Husband, shall she not be received by him? He said unto me, Yes; and if her Husband shall not receive her, he will sin; and commit a great Offence against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: But he ought to receive her though an Offender, if she repents; only not often. For to the Servants of God there is but one Repentance. And for this Cause a Man that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth away his Wife ought not to take another, because she may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. This Act is alike both in the Man and in the Woman. Now they commit Adultery, not only who pollute their Flesh, but who also make an Image. <note n="‖" place="margin">

                        <p n="2">II.

either to those who shall hereafter believe, or who have already believ'd in the LORD.

For let a Man be never so happy; yet if the Thoughts of the other Angel arise in his Heart, that Man or Woman must needs sin. But let a Man or Woman be never so Wicked, and the Works of the Angel of Righteousness come into his Heart, that Man or Woman must needs do some Good. Thou seest therefore how it is good to follow the Angel of Righteousness. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou shalt follow him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

in his Works, thou shalt live unto God. And as many as shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Works, shall live also unto God.</p>

For if thou shalt abstain from what is Good, and not do it; thou shalt sin. Abstain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from all Evil, and thou shalt know all Righteousness.

Keep thy self therefore from them, that thou mayst live unto God, and be written among those that abstain from them. And thus have I shewn thee what things thou must avoid: Now learn from what thou must not abstain. Abstain not from any good Works, but do them. Hear, said he, what the Vertue of those good Works is which thou must do, that thou mayst be saved. The first of all is Faith; the Fear of the LORD; Charity; Concord; Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Equity; Truth; Patience; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity.

When thou askest any thing of the LORD, say not within thy self; How shall I be able to ask any thing of the LORD and receive it, seeing I am so great a Sinner against him? Do not think thus, but turn unto the LORD with all thy Heart. Ask without Doubting, and thou shalt know the Mercy of the LORD; How that he will not forsake thee, but will fulfil the Request of thy Soul. For God is not as Men, mindful of <hi>the</hi> Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>he has received</hi>; but he forgets Injuries, and has Compassion upon his Creature. Wherefore purifie thy Heart from all the Vices of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent World; and observe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands I have before deliver'd unto thee from God; and thou shalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

whatsoever good things thou shalt ask, and nothing shall be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto thee of all thy Petitions; if thou shalt ask of the LORD without doubting.

But he that doubts; shall hardly live unto God, except he repent. Wherefore purifie thy Heart from doubting, and put on Faith; and trust in God; and thou shalt receive all that thou shalt ask.

this Doubting how cruel and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious it is; and how it utterly roots out many from the Faith, who were very faithful and firm.

                           </note> Art thou without Sense that thou dost not understand it?

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:61802:296"/>
there is another <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Edit. Oxon. p. 70. b.

Now those doubtful Persons come to him, as to a Divine Spirit, and enquire of him, what shall befal them. And this lying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, having no Power in him of the Divine Spirit, answers them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Demands; and fills their Souls with Promises according as they desire. Howbeit that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is vain, and answers vain things to those who are themselves vain. And whatsoever is asked of him by vain Men, he answers them vainly. Nevertheless he speaketh some things truly. For the Devil fills him with his Spirit, that he may overthrow some of the Righteous.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. WHOSOEVER therefore are strong in the Faith of the LORD, and have put on the Truth; they are not joyned to such Spirits, but depart from them. But those that are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and often repenting; like the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, consult them, and heap up
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:61802:297"/>
to themselves great Sin, serving I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols. As many therefore as are such, enquire of them upon every Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; worship Idols, and are foolish, and void of the Truth. For every Spirit that is given from God is not asked; but having the Power of the Divinity speaks all things of its self; because it comes from above from the Power of the Holy Spirit. But he that being ask'd speaks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mens desires, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning many other Affairs of this present World, understands not the things which relate unto God. For <hi>these Spirits</hi> are darkned through such Affairs, and corrupted, and broken. As good Vines if they are neglected, are oppress'd with Weeds and Thorns, and <hi>at last</hi> kill'd <hi>by them</hi>; So are the Men who believe such <hi>Spirits</hi>: They fall into many Actions and Businesses, and are void of Sense, and when they think of things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining unto God, they understand nothing at all. But if at any time they chance to hear any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the LORD, their <note n="†" place="margin">

that have the Fear of the LORD, and search out the Truth concerning God, have all their Thoughts with the LORD. They apprehend what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is said to them, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they understand it, because they have the Fear of the LORD in them. For where the Spirit of the LORD dwells, there is also a great Sense added. Wherefore joyn thy self to the LORD, and thou shalt understand and apprehend all things.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. LEARN now, O Unwise Man! How Sadness grieves the Holy Spirit, and how it saves. When a Man that is doubtful is engaged in any Affair, and do's not accomplish it by reason of his Doubting; this Sadness enters into him, and grieves the Holy Spirit, and makes him sad. Again, Anger when it overtakes any Man for any Business, he is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved; and Anger possesses his Heart; and he is disturb'd in his Work which he is about, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repents, because he did amiss. Thus both Doubting and Sadness hurt the Holy Spirit. Doubting,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:61802:298"/>
because his Work did not succeed; and Sadness, because he angr'd the Holy Spirit. <note n="‖" place="margin">Antioch. Hom. xxv.</note> Remove therefore Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from thy self; and offend not the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in thee; least he ask the LORD, and depart from thee. For the Spirit of the LORD which is given to us in the Flesh, endures not Sadness. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cloath thy self with Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which has always Favour with the LORD, and thou shalt rejoyce in it. For every chearful Man do's well, and relishes those things that are good, and despises Unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But the sad Man do's wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because he grieves the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is given to the chearful Man. And again he do's ill, because he prays with Sadness unto the LORD, except he first makes a thankful acknowledgment unto him <hi>of former Mercies</hi>; and obtains not of God what he asks. For the Prayer of a sad Man has not always Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to come up to the Altar of God. And I said unto him, Sir, Why has not the Prayer of a sad Man Vertue to come up to the Altar of God?
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:61802:298"/>
Because, said he, that Sadness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in his Heart. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Man's Prayer shall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Sadness, it will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Requests to ascend pure to the Altar of God. For as Wine when it is mingled with Vinegar, has not the Sweetness it had before; so Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness being mix'd with the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, suffers not a Man's Prayer to be Pure, <hi>as it would be otherwise.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purifie thy self from Sadness, which is Evil, and thou shalt live unto God. And all others shall live unto God, as many as shall lay aside Sadness, and put on Chearfulness.</p>

For that which is fitted to empty Vessels is not broken, but the one agrees to the other. But when such a one comes into the Company of Just Men, who have the Spirit of God, and they pray unto the LORD; that Man is emptied, because that Earthly Spirit flies from him, and he is dumb, and cannot speak any thing. As if in a Store-House you shall stop up Wine or Oyl; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those Vessels shall place an empty Jar; and shall afterwards come to open it, you shall find it empty as you stopp'd it up: So those em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty Prophets, when they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Spirits of the Just, are found to be such as they came. Thus
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:61802:299"/>

And believe the Spirit which comes from God, and has Power <hi>as such.</hi> But believe not the Earthly Spirit, in whom there is no Trust nor Vertue, but he is empty; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is from the Devil.

Take a Stone, and throw it up towards Heaven; or take a Spout of Water, and mount it up thither-ward; and see if thou canst reach unto Heaven. Sir, said I; How can this be done? For neither of those things, which you have mentioned, are possible to be done. And he answer'd; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as these things cannot be done, so is the Earthly Spirit without Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and without Effect.

humble than all Men; and answers to none when he is ask'd; nor to every one singly; neither do's the Spirit of God speak to a Man when he will; but speaks when God pleases. When therefore a Man who has the Spirit of God shall come into the Church of the Righteous, who have the Faith of God, and they pray unto the LORD; then the Holy Angel of God fills that Man with the Blessed Spirit, and he speaks in the Congregation as he is moved by God. Thus therefore is the Spirit of God known, because whosoever speaks by the Spirit of God, speaketh as the LORD will.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. HEAR now concerning the Earthly Spirit which is empty and foolish, and without Vertue.

For in much Delicacy there is Folly; and many Pleasures are needless to the Servants of God. Such Lusting therefore is evil and pernicious, which brings to Death the Servants of God.

it; it will flie far from thee, and not appear before thee, but be afraid of thy Armour; and thou shalt have the Victory, and be crown'd for it; and shalt attain unto that Desire which is good; and shalt give the Victory which thou hast obtain'd unto God, and shalt serve him in doing what thou thy self wouldst do. For if thou shalt be subject to good Desires, and follow them; thou shalt be able to get the Dominion over thy wicked Lustings; and they shall be subject to thee as thou wilt.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. AND I said; Sir, I would know how I ought to serve that Desire which is good? Hearken, said he, Fear God, and put thy Trust in him; and love Truth, and Righteousness; and do that which is good. If thou shalt do these things, thou shalt be an approved Servant of God; and shalt serve him. And when he had fulfilled these Twelve Commands, he said unto me; Thou hast <hi>now</hi> these Commands, walk in them; and exhort those that hear them that they repent; and that
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:61802:302"/>
they keep their Repentance pure all the remaining Days of their Life. And fulfil diligently this Service which I commit to thee, and thou shalt receive great Advantage by it, and shalt find Favour with all such as shall repent, and shall believe thy Words. For I am with thee, and will force them to believe. And I said unto him; Sir, These Commands are Great and Excellent, and able to chear the Heart of that Man that shall be able to keep them. But Sir, I cannot tell, whether they can be observed by any Man? He answer'd; Thou shalt easily keep these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and they shall not be hard: Howbeit if thou shalt suffer it once to enter into thy Heart that they cannot be kept by any one, thou shalt not fulfil them. But now I say unto thee; If thou shalt not observe these Commands, but shalt dissemble, thou shalt not be saved, nor thy Children, nor thy House: Because thou hast judged that these Commands cannot be kept by Man.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="410" facs="tcp:61802:303"/>IV. THESE things he spake very angrily unto me, insomuch that he greatly affrighted me. For he changed his Countenance, so that a Man could not bear his Anger. And when he saw me altogether troubled and confounded, he began to speak more moderately and chearfully say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; O foolish, and without Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing! Unconstant, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Majesty of God, how great, but withal how merciful he is; who created the World for Man; and hath made every Creature subject unto him, and given him all Power, that he should be able to overcome all these Commands. He is able, said he, to overcome all these Commands, who has the LORD in his Heart: But they who have the LORD only in their Mouths, and their Heart is hardned, are far from the LORD. To such Persons these Commands are hard and difficult. Put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye that are empty and light in the Faith, the LORD your God, and keep him in your Hearts; and ye shall understand how that nothing is
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:61802:303"/>
more easie then these Commands, nor more pleasant, nor more gentle and holy: And turn your selves to the LORD your God, and forsake the Devil and his Pleasures, because they are Evil, and Bitter, and Impure. And fear not the Devil, because he has no Power over you. For I am with you, the <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Angel.</hi>
                           </note> Messenger of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, who have the Dominion over him. The Devil do's indeed affright Men; but his Terror is vain. Wherefore fear him not, and he will flee from you.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. AND I said unto him; Sir, Hear me speak a few Words unto you. He answer'd, Say on: A Man indeed desires to keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; and there is no one but what prays unto God, that he may be able to keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But the Devil is hard, and by his Power rules over the Servants of God. And he said; He cannot rule over the Servants of God, who believe in him with all their Hearts. The Devil may strive, but he cannot overcome them. For if ye resist
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:61802:304"/>
him, he will flee away with shame from you. But they that are not full in the Faith, fear the Devil, as if he had some great Power. For the Devil tries the Servants of God, and if he finds them empty, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys them. For as a Man, when he fills up Vessels with good Wine, <note n="†" place="margin">Origen. in Matth. xxiv.42.</note> and among them puts a few Vessels half full, and comes to try and tast of the Vessels, do's not try those that are full, because he knows that they are good; but tasts those that are half full, least they should grow sowre; for Vessels half full soon grow sowre, and lose the Tast of Wine: So the Devil comes to the Servants of God to try them. They that are full of Faith resist him stoutly, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from them, because he finds no place where to enter into them; then he go's to those that are not full of Faith, and because he has place of entrance he goes into them and do's what he will with them, and they become his Servants.</p>

be able, through the help of the LORD, to keep these Commands which you have delivered. Thou shalt keep them, said he, if thou shalt purifie thy Heart towards the LORD.

Estates, and provide your selves with Delicacies, and stately Buildings, and superfluous Houses? For he that provides himself these things in this City, do's not think of returning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own City. O foolish, and doubtful, and wretched Man! Who understandest not that all these things are other Mens, and under the Power of another! For the LORD of this City saith unto thee, either obey my Laws, or depart out of my City. What therefore shalt thou do who art subject to a Law in thine own City? Canst thou for thy Estate, or for any of those things which thou hast provided, deny thy Law? But if thou shalt deny it, and wilt afterwards return into thy own City, thou shalt not be received, but shalt be excluded thence. See therefore that like a Man in another Country, thou procure no more to thy self than what is necessary, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee; and be ready, that when the God or LORD of this City shall drive thee out of it, thou mayst oppose his Law, and go into thine own City; where thou mayst with

                        <head>The Second SIMILITUDE. As the <hi>Vine</hi> is supported by the <hi>Elm,</hi> so is the <hi>Rich-Man</hi> help'd by the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the Poor.</head>
                        <p>AS I was walking into the Field, and consider'd the Elm and the Vine, and thought with my self of their Fruits; an Angel appear'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and said unto me; What is it that thou thinkest upon thus long within thy self? And I said unto him; Sir, I think of this Vine and this Elm, because their Fruits are fair. And he said unto me; <note n="‖" place="margin">Vid. Origen. in Jos. Hom. x.</note> These two Trees are set for a Pattern to the Servants of God. And I said
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:61802:307"/>
unto him; Sir, I would know what the Pattern is for which these Trees are set. Hearken, saith he; Seest thou this Vine and this Elm? Sir, said I, I see them. This Vine, saith he, is fruitful, but the Elm is a Tree without Fruit. Nevertheless this Vine unless it were set by this Elm, and supported by it, would not bear much Fruit; but lying along upon the Ground, would bear ill Fruit, because it did not hang upon the Elm: Whereas now being supported upon the Elm, it bears Fruit both for its self and for that. See there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how the Elm gives no less, but rather more Fruit than the Vine. How, Sir, said I, do's it bear more Fruit than the Vine? Because, said he, the Vine being supported upon the Elm gives both much and good Fruit: Whereas if it lay along upon the Ground it would bear but little, and that very ill too. This Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude therefore is set forth to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God; and it represents the Rich and Poor Man. I answer'd, Sir, make this manifest unto me. Hear, said he: The Rich Man has
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:61802:308"/>
Wealth; howbeit towards the LORD he is Poor: For he is taken up about his Riches, and prays but little to the LORD; and the Prayers which he makes are lazy and without force. When therefore the Rich Man reaches out to the Poor those things which he wants, the Poor Man prays unto the LORD for the Rich; and God grants unto the Rich Man all good things; because the Poor Man is Rich in Prayer; and his Requests have great Power with the LORD. Then the Rich Man ministers all things to the Poor, because he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that he is heard by the LORD; and he the more willingly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting affords him what he wants, and takes care that nothing be lacking to him. And the Poor Man gives Thanks unto the LORD for the Rich; because he do's this Work to him from the LORD. With Men therefore the Elm is not thought to give any Fruit; and they know not, neither understand that its Company being added to the Vine, the Vine bears a double En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, both for its self and for the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:61802:308"/>
Elm. Even so the Poor praying unto the LORD for the Rich, are heard by him; and their Riches are encreased, because they minister to the Poor of their Wealth. They are therefore both made Partakers of each others Good Works. Whosoever therefore shall do these things, he shall not be forsaken by the LORD, but shall be written in the Book of Life. Happy are they who are Rich, and perceive themselves to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased: For he that is sensible of this, will be able to minister somewhat to others.</p>

I answer'd, Sir, I see them; and some are dry, and others full of Leaves. These Trees, saith he, which are green are the Righteous, who shall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the World to come. For the World to come, is the Summer to the Righteous; but to Sinners it is the Winter. When therefore the Mercy of the LORD shall shine forth, then they who serve God shall be made manifest, and plain unto all. For as in the Summer the Fruit of every Tree is shewn and made manifest,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:61802:310"/>
so also the Works of the Righteous shall be declared and made manifest, and they shall all be restored in that World merry and joyful. For the other <note n="†" place="margin">

And also all the other Nations shall be burnt, because they have not acknowledged God their Creator. Do thou therefore bring forth good Fruit, that in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer thy Fruit may be known; and keep thy self from much Business, and thou shalt not offend. For they that are involved in much Business, sin much; because they are taken up with their Affairs, and neglect to serve God. And how can a Man that do's not serve God, ask any thing of God, and receive it? But they who serve him, ask and receive what they desire. But if a Man has only
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:61802:310"/>
one thing to follow, he may serve God, because his Mind is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by taken off from God, but he serves him with a pure Mind.

                           <pb n="427" facs="tcp:61802:311"/>II. HEARKEN unto the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude which I am about to propose unto thee, as to this matter. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Man having a Farm, and many Servants, planted a Vineyard in a certain part of his Estate for his Posterity: And taking a Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a far Country chose one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants which he thought the most faithful and approved, and deliver'd the Vineyard into his care; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him that he should stake up his Vines. Which if he did, and fulfilled his Command, he promised to give him his Liberty. Nor did he command him to do any thing more; and so went into a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. After then that that Servant had taken that Charge upon him; he did whatsoever his LORD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him. And when he had staked the Vineyard, and found it to be full of Weeds, he began to think with himself, saying; I have done what my Lord commanded me; I will now dig this Vineyard, and when it is digg'd it will be more beautiful; and the Weeds being pull'd up it
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:61802:312"/>
will bring forth more Fruit, and not be choak'd by the Weeds. So setting about his Work he digg'd it, and pluck'd up all the Weeds that were in it: And by that means the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard became very beautiful and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, and not over-run and choak'd with Weeds. After some time the LORD of the Vineyard comes and goes into the Vineyard, and when he saw that it was handsomely stak'd, and digg'd, and the Weeds pluck'd up that were in it, and the Vines flourishing, he rejoyced great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Care of his Servant. And calling his Son whom he loved, and who was to be his Heir; and his Friends with whom he was wont to consult, he tells them what he had commanded his Servant to do, and what his Servant had done more: And they immediately congratulated that Servant, that he had received so full a Testimony from his Lord. Then he said unto them; I indeed promised this Servant his Liberty, if he observed the Command which I gave him; and he observed it, and besides has done a good Work to my
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:61802:312"/>
Vineyard, which has exceedingly pleased me. Wherefore for this Work which he hath done, I will make him my Heir together with my Son; because that when he saw what was good, he dissembled it not, but did it. This Design of the LORD, both his Son and his Friends approved, <hi>namely,</hi> that this Servant should be Heir together with his Son. Not long after this, the Master of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily calling together his Friends, sent from his Supper several kinds of Food to that Servant. Which when he had received, he took so much of them as was sufficient for himself, and divided the rest among his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Servants. Which when they had received, they rejoyced; and wish'd that he might find yet greater favour with his Lord, for what he had done to them. When his Lord heard all these things, he was again fill'd with great Joy; and calling again his Friends and his Son together, he related to them what his Servant had done with the Meats which he had sent unto him. They therefore so much the more assented to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:61802:313"/>
of the Houshold; that he ought to make that Servant his Heir to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Son.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. I SAID unto him; Sir, I know not these Similitudes, neither can I understand them, unless you expound them unto me. I will, says he, expound all things unto thee whatsoever I have talk'd with thee, or shewn unto thee. Keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the LORD and thou shalt be approved, and shalt be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Number of those that keep his Commandments. But if besides those things which the LORD hath commanded, thou shalt add some good thing; thou shalt purchase to thy self a greater Dignity, and be in more favour with the LORD than thou shouldst otherwise have been. If therefore thou shalt keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the LORD, and shalt add to them these Stations, thou shalt rejoyce; but especially if thou shalt keep them according to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. I said unto him; Sir, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thou shalt command me, I will observe; for I know that thou
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:61802:313"/>
wilt be with me. I will, said he, be with thee, who hast taken up such a Resolution; and I will be with all those who purpose in like manner. This Fast, saith he, whilst thou dost also observe the Commandments of the LORD, is exceeding good. Thus therefore shalt thou keep it. First of all, take heed to thy self, and keep thy self from every wicked Act, and from every filthy Word, and from every hurtful Desire; and purifie thy Sense from all the Vanity of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent World. If thou shalt observe these things, this Fast shall be such as it ought to be. Thus therefore do.

For I understood that that was the Similitude. He said unto me; Thou art very ready in asking: Howbeit thou oughst not
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:61802:314"/>
to ask any thing, for if it be fitting to shew it unto thee, it shall be shewed. I answer'd him; Sir, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thou shalt shew, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining it unto me, I shall in vain see it: And what Similitudes thou shalt propose, and not expound them, I shall in vain hear them. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered me again, saying, Whosoever is the Servant of God, and has the LORD in his Heart, desires Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of him, and receives it; and he explains every Similitude, and understands the Words of the LORD which need an Enquiry. But they that are lazy, and slow to pray; doubt to seek from the LORD, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the LORD be of such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Goodness, that without ceasing he giveth all things to them that ask of him. Thou therefore who art strengthened by that Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Messenger, and hast received such a powerful <hi>Gift of</hi> Prayer; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou art not sloathful, why dost thou not now ask Understanding of the LORD and receive it? I said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; seeing I have thee present, it is necessary that I should seek it of
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:61802:315"/>
thee, and ask thee; for thou shewest all things unto me, and speakest to me when thou art present. But if I should see or hear these things when thou wert not present, I would then ask the LORD that he would shew them unto me.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. AND he reply'd; I said a little before that thou wert subtle and bold, and that thou askest the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>of these</hi> Similitudes.

The Farm before mention'd denotes the whole Earth: The Lord of the Farm is he, who created and finished all things; and gave Vertue unto them. His Son is the Holy <note n="‖" place="margin">Vid.

had committed. The Food which he sent him from his Supper, are the Commands which he gave to his People by his Son. The Friends whom he call'd to Counsel with him, are the Holy Angels whom he first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Absence of the Master of the Houshold is the Time that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unto his Coming. I said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; Sir, All these things are very excellent, and wonderful, and good. But, continued I, could I or any other Man besides, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so wise, have understood these things? Wherefore now Sir, tell me what I ask. He replied, ask me what thou wilt. Why, said I, is the Son of God in this Parable, put in the place of a Servant?</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Hearken, said he; The Son of God is not put in the condition of a Servant, but in great Power and Authority. And I answer'd, How, Sir? I understood it not. Because said he, The Son set his <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:61802:316"/>
and suffer'd much, that he might blot out their Offences. For no Vineyard can be digg'd without much Labour and Pains. Wherefore having blotted out the Sins of his People, he shew'd to them the Paths of Life, giving them the Law which he had received of the Father. You see, said he, that he is the LORD of his People, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all Power from his Father. But why did the LORD take into Counsel his Son, concerning <hi>dividing the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the Good Angels? Hear: Because that Messenger heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Holy Ghost, which was first of all infused into the Body in which God should dwell. For <hi>his</hi> Understanding placed him in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as it seem'd Good to him. This Body therefore into which the Holy Spirit was brought, served that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, walking rightly and purely in Modesty; nor ever defiled that Spirit. Seeing therefore the Body at all times obeyed the Holy Spirit, and labour'd rightly and chastly with him; nor falter'd at any time; that Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wearied conversed indeed Servily, but being stoutly approved with the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:61802:316"/>
Holy Spirit, was accepted by God. For such a powerful Course pleased God, because he was not defiled in the Earth, keeping the Holy Spirit in Council with him. He called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Son, and the Good Angels, that there might be some place of standing given to this Body which had served the Holy Spirit without Complaint; least it should seem to have lost the reward of its Service. For every pure Body, shall receive its reward; that is found without Spot, in which the Holy Spirit has been appointed to dwell. And thus you have now the Exposition of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable also.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. SIR, said I, I now understand your Meaning, since I have heard this Exposition. Hearken farther, said he: Keep this thy Body Clean and Pure; that the Spirit which shall dwell in it may bear Witness unto it, and be judged to have been with thee. Also take heed that it be not instill'd into thy Mind that this Body perishes, and thou abuse it to any Lust. For if thou shalt defile thy Body; thou shalt
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:61802:317"/>
also at the same time defile the Holy Spirit; and if thou shalt defile the Holy Spirit, thou shalt not live. And I said; What if through Ignorance this should have been already committed, before a Man heard these Words; How can he attain unto Salvation, who has thus defiled his Body? He reply'd; As for Mens former Actions, which through Ignorance they have committed, God only can afford a remedy unto them; For all power belongeth unto him. But now Guard thy self; and seeing God is Almighty and Merciful, he will grant a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to what thou hast formerly done amiss, if for the time to come thou shalt not defile thy Body and Spirit: For they are Companions together, and the One cannot be defiled but the other will be so too. Keep therefore both of them Pure, and thou shalt live unto God.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. AS I was sitting at home, and praising God for all the things which I had seen; and was thinking concerning the Commands, that they were exceeding Good and Great, and Honest, and Pleasant; and such as would certainly bring a Man to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; I said thus within my self: I shall be happy if I shall walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to these Commands, and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall walk in them shall live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. Whilst I was meditating on this wise, I saw him whom I had before been wont to see, sitting by me; and he spake thus unto me. What doubtest thou concerning the Commands which I have delivered unto thee? Doubt not whether they are Good, but trust in the LORD and thou shalt walk in them. For I will give thee strength <note n="‖" place="margin">
                              <hi>In them.</hi>
                           </note> to fulfil them. These Commands are profitable to
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:61802:318"/>
those who shall repent of those sins which they have formerly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; if for the time to come they shall not continue in them. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore ye be that Repent, cast away from you the naughtiness of the present World. And put on all Vertue, and all Righteousness, and so shall ye be able to keep these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; neither sin from henceforth any more. For if ye shall keep your selves from sin for the time to come, ye shall cut off a great deal of your former sins. Walk in my Commands, and ye shall live unto God: These things have I spoken unto you. And when he had said this, he added; let us go into the Field, and I will shew thee Shepherds of Sheep. I reply'd, Sir, let us go. And we came into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Field, and there he shew'd me a young Shepherd, <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Annot. Coteler. in loc.</note> finely array'd, with his Garments of a Purple Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. And he fed large Flocks; and his Sheep were full of Pleasure, and in much Delight and Chearfulness; and they ran here and there, as it were rejoicing. And the Shepherd took very great Satisfaction in his Flock;
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:61802:318"/>
and the Countenance of that Shepherd was Chearful, running up and down among his Flock.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. THEN the Angel said unto me; See'st thou this Shepherd? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, Sir, I see him. He said unto me; this is the <note n="†" place="margin">
                              <hi>Angel.</hi>
                           </note> Messenger of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Pleasure. He therefore cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the Minds of the Servants of God, and turns them from the Truth, delighting them with many Pleasures, and they perish. For they forget the Commands of the living God, and live in luxury and in vain satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and are corrupted by this Evil-Angel, some of them unto Death; and others even to a falling off from <hi>the truth.</hi> I replied; I understand not what you mean, by being corrupted unto Death, and so falling away. Hear, says he: All those Sheep which thou sawest exceeding fair and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, are such as have for ever departed from God, and given themselves up to the desires of this present Time. To these therefore there is no return, by Repentance, unto Life; because that to their other Sins they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:61802:319"/>
this, that they have Blasphemed the Name of the LORD. These kind of Men are ordained unto Death. But those Sheep which thou sawest not leaping for Joy, but feeding in one place; are such as have indeed given themselves up to Pleasures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; but have not spoken any thing wickedly against the LORD. These have not departed from the Truth, and therefore have yet Hope laid up for them in Repentance. For <hi>such</hi> a Defection has some hope still left of a renewal; But they that are dead, are utterly gone for ever. Again we went a little farther forward; and he shew'd me a great Shepherd, who had as it were a Wild Figure; clad with a White Goats Skin, having his Bag up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Shoulder, and in his Hand a Stick full of Knots, and very hard, and a Whip in his <hi>Other</hi> Hand; And his Countenance was Stern and Sour; enough to affright a Man; such was his look. He took from that young Shepherd such Sheep as lived in Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, but did not skip up and down; and drove them into a certain Steep Craggy Place, full of Thorns and
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:61802:319"/>
Briars, insomuch that they could not get themselves free from them; but being entangled in them, fed upon Thorns and Briars, and were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously tormented with his Whipping. For he still drove them on, nor afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them any Place or Time to stand still.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. WHEN therefore I saw them so cruelly whipp'd and afflicted, I was grieved for them, because they were greatly tormented, nor had they any Rest afforded them. And I said unto the Shepherd that was with me; Sir, Who is this cruel and implacable Shepherd, who is moved with no Compassion towards these Sheep? He answer'd, <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Origen. in Psal. xxxvii. Hom. 1.</note> This Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd is indeed the <note n="‖" place="margin">
                              <hi>Angel.</hi>
                           </note> Messenger of the Righteous, but is set over them for their Punishment. To him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are deliver'd those who have erred from God, and follow'd the Desires and Pleasures of this World, and served them. For this Cause he punishes them every one according to their Deserts with cruel and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kind of Pains. Sir, said I, I
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:61802:320"/>
would know, what kind of Pains they are which every one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes? Hearken, said he; The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pains and Torments are those which Men every Day undergo in their <hi>present</hi> Lives. For some suffer Losses; others Poverty; others di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sicknesses. Some are Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant; Others suffer injuries from those that are Unworthy; Others fall under many other Tryals and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences. Many with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled design aim at many things, and it profiteth them not, and they say that they have not Success in their Undertakings. These things call to their Mind what they have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, and they complain of the LORD. When therefore they shall have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergon all kind of Vexation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencie; then they are deliver'd over to me for good Instruction, and are confirm'd in the Faith of the LORD, and serve the LORD all the rest of their Life with a pure Mind. And when they begin to repent of their Sins, then they call to mind their Works which they have done amiss, and give Honour to God, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:61802:320"/>
That he is a just Judge, and that they have deservedly suffer'd all things according to their Deeds. And for what remains <hi>of their Lives</hi> they serve God with a pure Mind, and have Success in all their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and receive from the LORD whatever they desire. And then they give thanks unto the LORD that they were deliver'd unto me; nor do they suffer any more Cruelty.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. I SAID unto him; Sir, I intreat you now to shew me one thing. What, said he, dost thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire? I said unto him; Are they who depart from the Fear of God tormented for the same time that they enjoy'd their false Delight and Pleasures? He answer'd me; They are tormented for the same Time. And I said unto him, they are then tormented but little; whereas they who enjoy their Pleasures so as to forget God, ought to endure seven times as much Punishment. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd me; Thou art foolish; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther understandest thou the Efficacy of this <hi>kind</hi> of Punishment. I said unto him, Sir, If I understood it, I
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:61802:321"/>
would not desire you to tell me. Hearken, said he, and learn what the force of both is, both of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and of the Punishment. An hour of Pleasure is terminated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its own Space: But one hour of Punishment has the Efficacy of thirty Days. <note n="*" place="margin">Origen. in Num. Hom. viii.</note> Whosoever therefore enjoys his false Pleasure for one Day, and is one Day tormented, that one Day of Punishment is equivalent to a whole years space. Thus look how many Days any one pursues his Pleasures, so many Years is he punish'd for it. You see therefore, how that the Time of Worldly Enjoyments is but short, but that of Pain and Torments, a great deal more.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. I REPLY'D, Sir; forasmuch as I do not understand all these Times of Pleasure and Pain; I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you that you would explain your self more clearly concerning them. He answer'd me saying; Thy Foolishness still sticks inseparably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee. Shouldst thou not rather purifie thy Mind, and serve God? Take heed, least when thy Time is fulfill'd, thou shalt be found still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:61802:321"/>
Hear then, as thou desirest, that thou mayst the more easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand. He that gives himself up one Day to his Pleasures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; and do's whatsoever his Soul desires; is full of great Folly, nor understands what he do's, but the Day following forgets what he did the Day before. For Sweetness and Worldly Pleasure have no Memory by reason of the Folly that is rooted in them. But when Pain and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment befal a Man a Day, he is <hi>in Effect</hi> troubled the whole Year <hi>after</hi>; because his Punishment continues firm in his Memory. Wherefore he remembers it with Sorrow the whole Year; and then calls to mind his vain Pleasure and Delight, and perceives that for the sake of that he was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. Whosoever therefore have deliver'd themselves over to such Pleasures, are thus punished; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that when they had Life, they rendred themselves liable to Death. I said unto him; Sir, And what Pleasures are hurtful? He answer'd, That is Pleasure to every Man which he do's willingly. For the Angry Man, gratifying his Passion perceives
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:61802:322"/>
Pleasure in it; and so the Adulterer, and Drunkard; the Detractor, and Lyar, and Covetous Man, and the Deceiver; and whosoever commits any thing like unto these, because he gratifies his Infirmities, he receives a Satisfaction in the doing of it. All these Pleasures and Delights are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Servants of God. For these therefore they are tormented and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Punishment. There are also Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures that bring Salvation unto Men. For many, when they do what is good, find Pleasure in it, and are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the Delights of it. Now this Pleasure is profitable to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, and brings Life to such Men: But those hurtful Pleasures, which were before mention'd, bring Torments and Punishment. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall continue in them, and shall not repent of what they have done, shall gain Death unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

Sir, said I, I came to intreat you, that you would command the Shepherd who is the Minister of Punishment, to depart out of my House, because he greatly afflicts me. And he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd; It is necessary for thee to endure Inconveniencies and Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for so that good Angel hath commanded concerning thee, because he would try thee.

                           </note> Messenger being grieved at their
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:61802:323"/>
Doings commanded that for some time thou shouldst suffer Affliction, that they may both repent of what they have done, and may wash them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from all desires of this present World. When therefore they shall have repented, and be purified, then that Messenger which is appointed over <hi>thy</hi> Punishment, shall depart from thee. I said unto him; Sir, If they have behaved themselves so as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that good Angel, yet what have I done? He answer'd; They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwise be afflicted, unless thou, who art the Head of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, suffer. For whatsoever thou shalt suffer, they must needs feel it: But as long as thou shalt stand well establish'd, they cannot experience any Vexation. I replyed; But, Sir, behold they also now repent with all their Hearts. I know, says he, that they repent with all their Hearts; but dost thou therefore think that their Offences who repent are immediately blotted out? No, they are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently; But he that repents must af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict his Soul, and shew himself hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all his Affairs, and undergo many and divers Vexations. And
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:61802:323"/>
when he shall have suffer'd all things that were appointed for him; then perhaps he that made him and all things besides will be moved with Compassion towards him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him some Remedy; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he shall perceive his Heart who repents, to be pure from every Evil Work. But at present it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for thee and for thy House to be grieved; and it is needful that thou shouldst endure much Vexation; as the Angel of the LORD who committed thee unto me, has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Rather give Thanks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the LORD, that knowing what was to come, he thought thee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to whom he should foretel that Trouble was coming upon those that were able to bear it. I said unto him; Sir, Be but thou also with me, and I shall easily undergo any Trouble. I will, said he, be with thee; and I will ask the Messenger who is set over <hi>thy</hi> Punishment, that he would moderate his Afflictions towards thee. And moreover thou shalt suffer Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity but for a little time; and then thou shalt again be restored to thy former Place; only continue on in

And when all of them had taken them, he laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side his Hook, and the Tree continued intire, as I had before seen it. At which I wondred, and mused within my self. Then that Shepherd said unto me; Forbear to wonder that that Tree continues whole, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so many Boughs have been cut off from it: But attend; for now it shall be shewn thee, what that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel means, who gave those Rods to the People. So he again demanded the Rods of them; and in the same Order that every one had received them, was he call'd to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored his Rod: Which when he had received, he examin'd them. From some he received them Dry and Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and as it were touch'd with the Moth; those he commanded to be separated from the rest, and placed by themselves. Others gave him their Rods dry indeed, but not touch'd with the Moth; these also he order'd to be set by themselves. Others gave
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:61802:325"/>
in their Rods half dry; these also were set apart. Others gave in their Rods half dry, and cleft; these too were set by themselves. Others brought in their Rods, half dry and half green; and were in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner placed by themselves. Others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd up their Rods two parts green, and the third dry; and they too were set apart. Others brought their Rods two parts dry and the third green; and were also placed by themselves. Others deliver'd up their Rods yet less dry, for there was but a very little, to wit, their Tops dry; but they had Clefts, and these were set in like manner by themselves. In the Rods of others there was but a little green, and the rest dry; and these were set aside by themselves. Others came, and brought their Rods green as they had received them, and the greatest part brought their Rods thus, and these also were put apart by themselves. Others brought their Rods not only green, but full of Branches; and these were set aside; being received by the Angel with great Joy. Others brought their Rods green with Branches, and those also
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:61802:325"/>
full of Fruit. They who had such Rods were very chearful; and the Angel himself took great Joy at them; nor was the Shepherd that stood with me less pleased with them.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. THEN the Angel of the LORD commanded Crowns to be brought: And the Crowns were brought made of Palms; and the Angel crown'd those Men in whose Rods he found the young Branches with Fruit; and commanded them to go into the Tower. He also sent those into the Tower in whose Rods he found Branches without Fruit, giving his Seal unto them. For they had the same Garment, that is, one white as Snow, with which he had them go into the Tower. And so he did to those who return'd their Rods green as they received them, giving them a white Garment; and so sent them away to go into the Tower. Having done this, he said to the Shepherd <hi>that was with me</hi>; I go my way; but do thou send these within the Walls, every one into the place in which he has deserved to dwell, examining first their Rods; but examine them
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:61802:326"/>
diligently that no one deceive thee. But and if any one shall escape thee, I will try them upon the Altar. Having said this to the Shepherd he departed. After he was gone, the Shepherd said unto me; Let us take the Rods from them all, and plant them; if perchance they may grow green again. I said unto him, Sir, How can those dry Rods ever grow green again? He answer'd me; That Tree is a Willow, and always loves to live. If therefore these Rods shall be planted, and receive a little Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, many of them will recover themselves. Wherefore I will try, and will pour Water upon them, and if any of them can live, I will rejoyce with him: But if not, at least by this means I shall be found not to have neglected my part. And they all came unto him, every one in the Rank in which he stood, and gave him their Rods; which having received, He planted every one of them in their several Orders. And after he had planted them all, he poured much Water upon them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that they were covered with Water, and did not appear above it.
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:61802:326"/>
And when he had water'd them, he said unto me; Let us depart, and after a little time we will return and visit them. For he who created this Tree, would have all those live that received Rods from it. And I hope, now that these Rods are thus wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, many of them, receiving in the Moisture, will recover.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. I SAID unto him, Sir; Tell me what this Tree denotes? For I am greatly moved, that after so many Branches have been cut off, it seems still to be whole; nor do's there any thing the less of it appear to remain, which greatly amazes me. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, Hearken. This great Tree which covers the Plains and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and all the Earth, is the Law of God, publish'd throughout the whole World. Now by this Law the Son of God is preach'd to all the Ends of the Earth. The People that stand under its Shadow, are those which have heard his Preaching, and believed. The great and good Angel which you saw, was MICHAEL, who has the Power over this People, and Governs them. For he has planted the Law in
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:61802:327"/>
the Hearts of those who have believed. And therefore he visits them to whom he has given the Law, to see if they have kept it. And he examines every ones Rod; and of those, many that are weakned. For those Rods are the Law of the LORD. Then he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all those who have not kept the Law, knowing the place of every one of them. I said unto him; Sir, why did he send away some to the Tower, and left others here to you? He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd; those who have transgress'd the Law, which they receiv'd from him, are left in my Power, that they may repent of their Sins: But they who satisfied the Law and kept it, are under his Power. But who then, said I, are those, who went into the Tower Crowned? He reply'd; All such as having striven with the Devil, have overcome him, are Crown'd. And they are those, who have suffer'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, that they might keep the Law. But they who gave up their Rods Green, and with young Branches, but without Fruit, have indeed endured Trouble for the same Law, but have not suffer'd Death; but neither have they deny'd their Holy Law: They
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:61802:327"/>
who deliver'd up their Rods Green as they received them; are those who were Modest and Just, and have lived with a very Pure Mind, and kept the Commandments of God. The rest thou shalt know, when I shall have consider'd those Rods which I have planted and watered.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. AFTER a few days we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, and in the same place stood that great Angel, and I stood by him. Then he said unto me; Gird thy self with a <note n="‖" place="margin">Vid. Edit. Oxon. p. 129 not. d.</note> Napkin, and serve me. And I girded my self with a clean Towel, which was made of Coarse Cloath. And when he saw me girded, and ready to minister unto him, he said; Call those Men whose Rods have been planted every one in his Order as they gave them. And he brought me into the Field, and I called them all, and they all stood ready in their several Ranks. Then he said unto them, let every one pluck up his Rod and bring it unto me. And first they deliver'd theirs, whose Rods were Dry and Rotten. And those whose Rods still continued so, he commanded to stand apart. Then they came whose Rods
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:61802:328"/>
were Dry but not Rotten. Some of these deliver'd in their Rods Green; Others dry and rotten, as if they had been touch'd by the Moth. Those who gave them up Green, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to stand apart: But those whose Rods were dry and rotten, he caused to stand with the first sort. Then came they whose Rods were half dry, and Cleft: Many of these gave up their Rods Green, but still Cleft. Others delivered them up Green with Branches, and Fruit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Branches, like unto theirs who went Crown'd into the Tower. Others deliver'd them up Dry and Rotten: And some as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, half dry, and cleft. Every one of these he order'd to stand apart, some by themselves, others in their respective Ranks.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. THEN came they whose Rods <hi>were for the most part Green</hi>; but cleft. These deliver'd their Rods altogether Green, and stood in their own Order. And the Shepherd rejoiced at these, because they were all even and free from their Clefts. Then they gave in their Rods, who had half Green and
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:61802:328"/>
half Dry. Of these some were found wholly Green, others half dry; others green, with young Shoots. And all these were sent away, every one to his proper Rank. Then they gave up their Rods, who had two parts Green, and the rest Dry: Many of these gave in their Rods Green; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny half dry; the rest dry but not rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. So these were sent away, each to his proper Place. Then came they who had their Rods two parts Dry and the third Green; many of these delivered up their Rods half dry; others dry and rotten; others half dry and cleft; but few Green. And all these were set every one in his own Rank. Then they reach'd in their Rods, who had them before a third part Green, and the rest dry; Their Rods were for the most part found Green, having little Boughs, with Fruit upon them; and the rest alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Green. And the Shepherd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sight of these rejoiced exceedingly, because he had sound them thus. And they also went to their proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="462" facs="tcp:61802:329"/>VI. NOW after he had examin'd all their Rods, he said unto me; I told thee that this Tree loved Life: Thou seest how many have repented, and attain'd unto Salvation. Sir, said I, I see it. That thou mightest know, saith he, that the Goodness and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the LORD is Great and to be had in Honour; who gave his Spirit to them that were worthy of Repentance. I answer'd, Sir, why then did not all of them repent? He reply'd; Those whose Minds the LORD foresaw would be Pure, and that they would serve him with all their Hearts, to them he gave Repentance. But for those whose deceit and wickedness he beheld, and perceived that they would not truly return unto him; to them he deny'd any return unto Repentance, least they should again blaspheme his Law with wicked Words. I said unto him; Now Sir, make known unto me, what is the place of every one of those, who have given up their Rods, and what their <note n="‖" place="margin">
                              <hi>Sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>

                           </note> Portion; that when they who have not kept their Seal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, but have cast away the Seal which they received, shall hear and
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:61802:329"/>
believe these things, they may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their <hi>Evil</hi>-deeds and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and receiving again their Seal from you, may give Glory to God, that he was moved with Compassion towards them, and sent you to renew their Spirits. Hearken, said he: They whose Rods have been found dry and rotten, and as it were touch'd with the Moth; are the Deserters, and the Betrayers of the Church. Who with the rest of their Crimes, have also blasphemed the LORD, and deny'd his Name which was called upon them. Therefore all these are Dead unto God; and thou seest that none of them have repented, although they have heard my Commands which thou hast delivered unto them. From these Men therefore Life is far distant. And they also who have deliver'd up their Rods Dry but not Rotten, have not been far from them. For they have been Counterfeits, and brought in Evil-Doctrines; and have perverted the Servants of God; and especially those who had sinn'd, not suffering them to return unto Repentance; but keeping them back by their False Doctrines. These therefore have
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:61802:330"/>
Hope; and thou seest that many of them have repented, since the time that thou hast laid my Commands before them; and many more will yet Repent. But they that shall not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; both they have lost Patience, and shall lose their Life. But they that have repented, their place is begun to be within the first Walls, and some of them are even gone into the Tower. Thou seest therefore, said he, that in the Repentance of sinners there is Life; but that for them who Repent not, Death is prepared.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. HEAR now concerning those who gave in their Rods half dry, and full of Clefts. They whose Rods were only half-dry, are the Doubtful; for they are neither Living nor Dead. But they who deliver'd in their Rods not only half-dry, but also full of Clefts, are both Doubtful and Evil-speakers; who detract from those that are absent, and have never peace among themselves; and that envy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Howbeit to these there is yet lest space for Repentance; for thou seest that some of these also have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented. Now all those of this kind
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:61802:330"/>
who have quickly repented, shall have a place in the Tower; but they who have been more slow in their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, shall dwell within the Walls: But they that shall not repent, but shall continue on in their <hi>wicked</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, shall die the Death. As for those who had their Rods Green, but yet Cleft; they are such as were always Faithful and Good; but who had some Envy and Strife among themselves concerning Dignity and Preheminence. Now all such are Vain and without Understanding, as contend with one another about these things. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless seeing they are otherwise Good, if when they shall hear these Commands they shall amend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and shall at my Perswasion suddainly repent; they shall forthwith begin to dwell in the Tower, as they who have truly and worthily repented. But if any one shall again return to his Dissention, he shall be shut out from the Tower, and shall lose his Life. For the Life of those who keep the Commandments of the LORD, consists in <hi>doing</hi> what they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; not in Principality, or in any <hi>other</hi> Dignity. For by Patience
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:61802:331"/>
and Humility of Mind Men shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto Life; but by Seditions, and Contempt of the Law, they shall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase Death unto themselves.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. THEY who in their Rods had half Green and half Dry, are those who are engag'd in many Affairs; nor are wholly applied to Holy things. For which Cause half of them liveth, and half is dead. Wherefore many of these since the time that they have heard my Commands, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented; and begun to live in the Tower. But some of them have whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallen away; to these there is no more place for Repentance. For by reason of their present Interests, they have blasphemed and denied God: And for this Wickedness have lost Life. And of these many are still in doubt; these may yet return; and if they shall quickly repent, they shall have a place in the Tower; but if they shall be more slow, they shall dwell within the Walls; but if they shall not repent, they shall die. As for those who had two parts of their Rods Green, and the third Dry; they have deny'd the LORD, by their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:61802:331"/>
sins. Of these many have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, and found a place in the Tower; and many have altogether departed from God. These have ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly lost their Lives. And some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a doubtful state, have raised up Dissentions: These may yet return, if they shall suddainly repent, and not be with-held by their pleasures; but if they shall continue in their Evil-doings they shall Die.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. THEY who gave in their Rods two parts Dry, and the other Green; are those who have indeed been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but withall Rich, and full of good things; and thereupon have desired to be famous <note n="‖" place="margin">
                              <hi>With foreign Nations.</hi>
                           </note> among those without, and have thereby fallen into great Pride, and began to aim at high mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to forsake the Truth: Nor did they hold fast to the Righteous, but lived <note n="‖" place="margin">
                              <hi>With foreign Nations.</hi>
                           </note> with Strangers; and this Life seem'd the more Pleasant to them. Howbeit they departed not from God, but continued in the Faith; only they did not exercise the Works of Faith. Many therefore of these repented; and began to dwell in the Tower. Yet others still living among strange
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:61802:332"/>
People, and being lifted up with their Vanities, have utterly fallen away from God; and follow'd the Works, and Wickednesses of the Heathen. These kind of Men therefore are reckon'd among Strangers to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. Others of these became Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful minded; despairing by reason of their wicked doings ever to attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation: Others being Dubious, stirr'd up Dissentions. To these there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and to those who by reason of their Doings are become doubtful, there is still hopes of return; but they must repent quickly, that their Place may be in the Tower. But they that repent not, but continue still in their Pleasures; are nigh unto Death.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. As for those who gave in their Rods Green, excepting their Tops, which only were Dry, and had Clefts; These were always Good, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and Approved towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>od: Nevertheless they sinn'd a little, by reason of their empty Pleasures, and little Disputes which they had among themselves. Wherefore many of them when they heard my words, repented forthwith; and began to dwell in the
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:61802:332"/>
Tower. Nevertheless some grew doubtful, and others to their doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Minds added Dissentions. To these therefore there is still hope of return, because they were always Good; but they shall hardly be moved. As for those lastly, who gave in their Rods dry, their Tops only excepted, which alone were Green; They are such as have believed indeed in God, but have lived in Wickedness; yet without departing from God: Having always willingly Born the Name of the LORD; and readily received into their Houses the Servants of God. Wherefore hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things, they return'd, and without delay repented, and lived in all Righteousness. And some of them suffered Death; others readily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went many trials, being mindful of their Evil-doings.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. AND when he had ended his Explications of all the Rods, he said unto me; Go, and say unto all Men that they Repent, and they shall live unto God: Because the LORD being moved with great Clemency hath sent me to preach Repentance unto all; even to those who by reason of their
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:61802:333"/>
Evil-doings, deserve not to attain unto Salvation. But the LORD will be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and keep the Invitation that was made by his Son. I said unto him; Sir, I hope that All when they shall hear these things will repent. For I trust that every one acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging his Crimes, and taking up the fear of the LORD, will return unto Repentance. He said unto me; Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall repent with all their Hearts, and cleanse themselves from all the Evils that I have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and not add any thing more to their sins, shall receive from the LORD the Cure of their former Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; if they shall not make any Doubt of my Commands, and shall live unto God. But they that shall continue to add to their Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and shall still converse with the Lusts of this present World, shall Condemn themselves unto Death. But do thou walk in these Commands, and thou shalt live unto God. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall walk in these, and exercise them rightly, shall live unto God. And having shew'd me all these things, he said: I will shew thee the rest in a few days.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. AFTER I had written the Commands and Similitudes of the Shepherd, the Angel of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; he came unto me, and said to me; I will shew thee all those things which the <note n="‖" place="margin">
                              <hi>See above</hi> Book I.</note> Spirit spake with thee under the Figure of the Church. For that Spirit is the Son of God. And because thou wert weak in Body, it was not declared unto thee by the Angel, until thou wert strengthened by the Spirit, and encreased in force, that thou mightest also see the Angel. For then indeed the Building of the Tower was gloriously shewn unto thee by the Church; nevertheless thou sawest all things shewn unto thee as it were by a Virgin. But now thou art enlightned by the Angel, but indeed by the same Spirit. But thou must consider all things dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently; for therefore am I sent into thine House by that Venerable <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="472" facs="tcp:61802:334"/>
that when thou shalt have seen all things powerfully, thou mayst not be afraid as before. And he led me to the Top of a Mountain of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and we sate upon its Top. And he shew'd me a great Plain, and about it Twelve Mountains in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Figures. The First was black as Soot. The Second was smooth, without Grass. The Third was full of Thorns and Thistles. The Fourth had Grass half dryed; of which the upper part was green, but that next the Root was dry; and some of the Herbs, when the Sun grew hot, were dry. The Fifth Mountain was very rugged; but yet had green Grass. The Sixth Mountain was full of Clefts, some lesser, and some greater; and in those Clefts grew Grass, not flourishing, but which seem'd to be withering. The Seventh Mountain had delightful Pasture; and was wholly fruitful; and all kinds of Cattle, and of the Birds of Heaven, fed upon it; and the more they fed of it, the more and better did the Grass grow. The Eighth Mountain was full of Fountains, and from those Fountains were water'd all kinds of
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:61802:334"/>
the Creatures of God. The Ninth Mountain had no Water at all, but was wholly destitute of it; and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd deadly Serpents, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to Men. The Tenth Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was full of tall Trees, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether shady; and under the Shade of them lay Cattle resting and chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cud. The Eleventh Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was full of the thickest Trees; and those Trees seem'd to be loaded with several sorts of Fruits; that whosoever saw them could not chuse but desire to eat of their Fruit. The Twelfth Mountain was altogether white, and of a most pleasant As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and its self gave a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Beauty to its self.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. IN the middle of the <note n="‖" place="margin">Origen. Hom. iii. in Ezech.</note> Plain he shew'd me a huge white Rock, which rose out of the Plain, and the Rock was higher than those Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and was square; so that it seem'd capable of supporting the whole World. It look'd to me to be old, yet had in it a new Gate, which seem'd to have been newly hewn out in it. Now that Gate was bright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sun its self; insomuch that
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:61802:335"/>
I greatly admired at its Light. About that Gate stood Twelve Virgins; of which Four that stood at the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Gate, seem'd to me to be the Chiefest; although the rest also were of worth, and they stood in the four parts of the Gate. It added also to the Grace of those Virgins, that they stood in pairs, cloathed with linnen Garments, and decently girded, their right Arms being at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as if they were about to lift up a Hook, for so they were adorn'd; and were exceeding chearful and ready. When I saw this, I wonder'd with my self to see such great and noble things. And again I admir'd upon the Account of those Virgins, that they were so handsom and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; and stood with such Firmness and Constancy, as if they would carry the whole Heaven. And as I was thinking thus within my self; the Shepherd said unto me; What thinkest thou within thy self, and art disquieted, and fillest thy self with Care? Do not seem to consider as if thou wert wise what thou dost not understand, but pray unto the LORD, that thou mayst have Ability

                        <p n="3">III. AND when he had said this unto me, I looked up, and behold I saw Six tall and Venerable Men coming; their Countenances were all alike; and they call'd a certain Multitude of Men; and they who came at their Call were also tall and stout. And those six commanded them to build a certain Tower over that Gate. And immediately there began to be a great Noise of those Men running here and there about the Gate, who were come together to build the Tower. Now those Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins which stood about the Gate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Building of the Tower was to be hastned on by them. And they stretched out their Hands, as if they were about to receive somewhat
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:61802:336"/>
from them. Then those six Men commanded, that they should lift up Stones out of a certain deep place, and prepare them for the Building of the Tower. And there were lifted up ten white Stones, square, and <note n="†" place="margin">
                              <hi>So</hi> Coteleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in loc.</note> not cut round. Then those six Men called the Virgins to them, and commanded them to carry all the Stones that were to be put into the Building; and having carried them through the Gate to deliver them to those that were about to build that Tower. Immediately the Virgins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to lift up all of them together those Stones, that were before taken out of the Deep.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. AND they also who stood about the Gate did carry <hi>Stones</hi> in such a manner, that those Stones which seem'd to be the strongest were laid at the Corners, the rest were put into the Sides; and thus they carried all the Stones, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them through the Gate, deliver'd them to the Builders, as they had been commanded. Now they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them at their Hands built with them. The Building was made
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:61802:336"/>
upon that great Rock, and over the Gate; and by these the whole Tower was supported. But the Building of the Ten Stones fill'd the whole Gate, which began to be made at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that Tower. After those ten Stones were five and twenty others lifted up out of the Deep; and these were placed in the Building of the same Tower; being lifted up by those Virgins, as the others had been before. After these were five and thirty others lifted up; and these were also in like manner fitted into the same Work. Then forty other Stones were brought up, and all these were added unto the Building of that Tower. So there began to be four Ranks in the Foundation of that Tower; and the Stones began to cease to be drawn out of the Deep; and they also which built rested a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Again, those six Men commanded the Multitude, that they should bring Stones out of those twelve Mountains to the Building of the same Tower. So they cut out of all the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Stones of divers Colours, and brought them, and gave them to the Virgins; which when they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:61802:337"/>
they reach'd them up, and carried them into the Building of the Tower. In which when they were built they became white, and different <hi>from what they were before</hi>; for they were all alike, and did change their former Colours. And some were reach'd up by the Men themselves, which when they came into the Building, continued such as they were put in. These neither became white, nor different <hi>from what they were before</hi>; because they were not carried by the Virgins through the Gate. Wherefore these Stones were disagreeable in the Building; which when those six Men perceived, they commanded them to be removed, and put again in the place from which they were brought. And they said to those who brought those Stones: Do not ye reach up to us any Stones for this Building; but lay them down by the Tower, that these Virgins may take them up and reach them to us. For unless they shall be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by these Virgins through this Gate, they cannot change their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: Therefore do not labour in vain.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <pb n="479" facs="tcp:61802:337"/>V. SO the Building that day was ended, howbeit the Tower was not finish'd; for it was afterwards to be built, therefore now also there was some delay made of it. And those six Men commanded those that built to depart, and as it were to rest for some time; but they order'd those Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that they should not depart from the Tower: Now they seem'd to me to be left for the guarding of it. When all were departed, I said unto that Shepherd; Sir, Why is not the Building of the Tower finish'd? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot, said he, be finish'd until its Lord comes, and approves of the Building; that if he shall find any Stones in it that are not good they may be changed; for this Tower is built according to his Will. Sir, said I, I would know, what the Building of this Tower signifies; as also I would be inform'd concerning this Rock, and this Gate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Mountains, and the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and the Stones that were drawn out of the Deep, and not cut, but put into the Building just as they came forth; and why the ten Stones
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:61802:338"/>
were first laid in the Foundation; then the twenty five; then thirty five; then forty? Also concerning those Stones that were put into the Building, and again taken out, and carried back into their place? Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil, <hi>I pray,</hi> the desire of my Soul as to all these things, and manifest all unto me. And he said unto me; If thou shalt not be dull, thou shalt know all, and shalt see all the other things that are about to happen in this Tower; and shalt understand diligently all these Similitudes. And after a few days we came into the same place where we had sate before; and he said unto me, Let us go unto the Tower; for the LORD of it will come and examine it. So we came thither, and found none but those Virgins there. And he asked them, whether the LORD of that Tower was come thither? And they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, that he would be there present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to examine the Building.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. AFTER a very little while I saw a great Multitude of Men coming, and in the middle of them a Man so tall, that he surpassed the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:61802:338"/>
Tower in Bigness. And about him were those six, who before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Building, and all the rest of those who had built that Tower, and many others of great Dignity: And the Virgins that kept the Tower ran to meet him, and kissed him, and began to walk near unto him. But he examined the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with so much care that he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led every Stone; and strook every one with a Rod which he held in his Hand; of which some being so struck turn'd black as Soot; others were rough; some looked as if they had Cracks in them; others seem'd maimed; some neither black nor white; some look'd sharp, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed not with the other Stones, and others were full of Spots. These were the several kinds of these Stones which were not found proper in the Building: All which the LORD commanded to be taken out of the Tower, and laid near it, and other Stones to be brought, and put in their Places. And they that built, ask'd him from which of the Mountains he would have Stones brought to put in the Place of those that were laid
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:61802:339"/>
aside: But he forbad them to bring any from the Mountains, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they should take them out of a certain Field that was near: So they digged in that Field, and found many bright square Stones, and some also that were round. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit all that were found in that Field were taken away, and carried through the Gate by those Virgins; and those of them that were square were fitted and put into the places of those that were pulled out. But the round ones were not put into the Building, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were hard, and it would have required too much time to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ut them; but they were placed about the Tower, as if they should here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be cut square, and put into the Building; for they were very white.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. WHEN he who was chief in Dignity, and LORD of the whole Tower saw this, he called to him the Shepherd that was with me, and gave him the Stones that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and laid about the Tower, and said unto him; Cleanse these Stones with all Care, and fit them into the
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:61802:339"/>
Building of the Tower, that they may agree with the rest; but those that will not suit with the rest, cast away afar from off from the Tower. When he had thus commanded him, he departed, with all those that came with him to the Tower: But those Virgins still stood about the Tower to keep it. And I said unto that Shepherd; How can these Stones, seeing they have been rejected, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the Building of this Tower? He reply'd; I will cut off the greatest part from these Stones, and will add them to the Building, and they will agree with the rest. And I said, Sir, How will they be able to fill the same place, when they shall be so much cut away? He answer'd; They that shall be found too little shall be put into the middle of the Building, and the greater shall be placed without, and keep them in. When he had said thus unto me, he added; Let us go, and after three days we will return, and I will put these Stones, being cleansed, into the Tower: For all these that are about the Tower must be cleansed, least the Master of the House chance to
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:61802:340"/>
come upon the suddain, and find those which are about the Tower, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and so shall despise them; and these Stones shall not be put into this Building, and I shall be look'd upon to have been negligent. When therefore we came after three days to the Tower, he said unto me; Let us examin all these Stones, and let us see which of them may go into the Building. I answer'd, Sir, Let us see.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. AND first of all we began to consider those which had been Black; for they were found just such as they were when they were pull'd out of the Tower: Wherefore he commanded them to be removed from the Tower, and put by themselves. Then he examined those which had been rough; and commanded many of those to be cut round, and to be fitted by the Virgins into the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Tower: So they took them, and fitted them into the middle of the Building; and he commanded the rest to be laid by with the Black Ones, for they also were become Black. Next he considered those which
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:61802:340"/>
were full of Cracks; and many of those also he order'd to be pared away, and so to be added to the rest of the Building, by the same Virgins: These were placed without, because they were found entire; but the residue through the multitude of their Cracks could not be reform'd, and therefore were cast away from the Building of the Tower. Then he consider'd those that were maimed; many of these had Cracks, and were become Black: Others had large Clefts: These he commanded to be placed with those that were rejected; but the rest being cleansed and reform'd, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be put into the Building: These therefore those Virgins took up, and fitted into the Middle of the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; because they were but Weak. After these he examined those which were found half White and half Black; and many of those were now Black; These also he order'd to be laid among those that were cast away. The rest were found altogether White; those were taken up by the Virgins, and fitted into the same Tower: <note n="‖" place="margin">Vid. MS. Lamb. Edit. Oxon, p. 15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>.</note> And these were put in the outside, because they were found entire; that so they
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:61802:341"/>
might keep in those that were placed in the middle; for nothing was cut off from them. Next he look'd upon those which were Hard and Sharp; But few of these were made use of, because they could not be Cut: For they were found very hard; but the rest were form'd, and fitted by the Virgins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the middle of the Building, because they were more weak. Then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd those which had Spots; of these a few were found Black, and these were carried to their Fellows. The rest were White and Entire; and they were fitted by the Virgins into the Building, and placed in the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, by reason of their Strength.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. AFTER this he came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider those Stones which were White and Round; and he said unto me, What shall we do with these Stones? I answer'd, Sir, I cannot tell. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, Canst thou think of nothing then for these? I answer'd, Sir, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not this Art; neither am I a Stone-Cutter, nor can I tell any thing. And he said, Seest thou not that they are very Round? Now to make them Square, I must cut off a
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:61802:341"/>
great deal from them; Howbeit it is necessary that some of these should go into the Building of the Tower: I answer'd; If it be Necessary, why do you perplex your self, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuse, if you have any Choice among them, and fit them into the Building? Upon this he chose out the largest and brightest, and squared them; which when he had done the Virgins took them up, and placed them in the Outside of the Building. And the rest that remained, were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried back into the same Field from which they were taken: Howbeit they were not cast away; Because, said he, there is yet a little wanting to this Tower, which is to be Built; and perhaps the LORD will have these Stones fitted into this Building, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are exceeding White. Then were there called twelve very Stately Women, cloath'd with a Black Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, girded, and their Shoulders free, and their Hair loose. These seem'd to me to be Country Women. And the Shepherd commanded them to take up those Stones which were cast out of the Building, and carry them back to the Mountains out of
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:61802:342"/>
which they were taken. And they took them up joyfully, and carried them back to their Places from whence they had been taken. When not one Stone remain'd about the Tower, he said unto me; let us go about this Tower, and see that nothing be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. We began therefore to go round it; and when he saw that it was handsomely Built, he began to be very Glad: for it was so beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully framed, that any one that had seen it must have been in Love with the Building: For it seem'd to be all but one Stone, nor did a joynt any where appear; but it look'd as if it had all been cut out of One Rock.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. AND when I diligently consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd what a Tower it was, I was extremely pleased; And he said unto me, Bring hither some Lime and little Shells, that I may fill up the Spaces of those Stones that were taken out of the Building, and put in again; for all things about the Tower, must be made Even. And I did as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me, and brought them unto him; And he said unto me, Be ready to Help me, and this Work will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:61802:342"/>
be finish'd. He therefore filled up the Spaces of those Stones, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the place about the Tower to be cleansed. Then those Virgins took Beasoms, and cleansed all the place around, and took away all the Rubbish, and threw on Water. Which being done, the place became delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the Tower Beauteous. Then he said unto me; All is now Clean: If the LORD should come to finish the Tower, he will find nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to complain of us. When he had said this he would have departed. But I laid hold on his Bag, and began to entreat him for the LORD's sake, that he would explain to me all things that he had shewn me. He said unto me, I have at present a little business; but I will suddainly explain all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee. Tarry here for me till I come. I said unto him; Sir, What shall I do here alone? He answer'd, Thou art not alone, seeing all these Virgins are with thee. I said; Sir, Deliver me then unto them. Then he called them, and said unto them; I commend this Man unto you till I shall come. So I remain'd with those Virgins; Now they were Chearful
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:61802:343"/>
and Courteous unto me; especially the four, which seem'd to be the Chiefest among them.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. THEN those Virgins said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; that Shepherd will not return hither to day. I said unto them; What then shall I do? They answer'd, Tarry for him till the Evening, if perhaps he may come and speak with thee; But if not, yet thou shalt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with us till he do's come. I said unto them, I will tarry for him till Evening; but if he comes not by that time I will go home, and return hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again the next Morning. They answered me; thou art deliver'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, thou mayst not depart from us. I said, Where shall I tarry? They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; Thou shalt sleep with us as a Brother, not as a Husband: For thou art our Brother, and we are ready from henceforth to dwell with thee; for thou art very dear to us. Howbeit I was ashamed to continue with them. But she that seem'd to be the chiefest amongst them, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced me, and began to kiss me. And the rest when they saw that I was kissed by her, began also to kiss
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:61802:343"/>
me as a Brother; and led me about the Tower, and play'd with me. Some of them also sung Psalms, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made up the Chorus with them. But I walked about the Tower with them, rejoycing silently and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my self to be grown young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And when the Evening came on, I would forthwith have gone home, but they with-held me, and suffer'd me not to depart. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I continued with them that Night near the same Tower. So they spread their Linnen Garments upon the Ground; and placed me in the middle, nor did they any thing else but Pray. I also pray'd with them without ceasing, no less than they. Who when they saw me pray in that manner, rejoyced greatly; and I continued there with them till the next day. And when we had worship'd God, then the Shepherd came and said unto them; You have done no Injury to this Man. They answer'd, Ask him. I said unto him, Sir, I have received a great deal of Satisfaction in that I have remained with them. And he said unto me, How didst thou sup? I answered,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:61802:344"/>
Sir, I feasted the whole Night upon the Words of the LORD. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thee well then, said he? I said, Sir, Very well. He answer'd, Wilt thou now learn <hi>what thou didst desire?</hi> I reply'd, Sir, I will: And first I pray thee that thou shouldst shew me all things in the Order that I asked them. He answer'd. I will do all as thou wouldst have me, nor will I hide any thing from thee.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. FIRST of all Sir, said I, Tell me, what this Rock and this Gate denote? Hearken said he; This Rock, and this Gate are the Son of God. I reply'd, Sir, How can that be; seeing the Rock is old, but the Gate new? Hear, said he, O foolish Man! and understand. The Son of God is indeed more antient than any Creature; insomuch that he was in Council with his Father at the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of all things. But the Gate is therefore new, because he appear'd in the last days at the fulness <hi>of time</hi>; that they who shall attain unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, may by it enter into the Kingdom of God. You have seen,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:61802:344"/>
said he, those Stones which were carried through the Gate, how they were placed in the Building of the Tower; but that those which were not carried through the Gate, were sent away into their own places? I answer'd, Sir, I saw it. Thus, said he, No Man shall enter into the Kingdom of God, but he who shall take upon him the Name of the Son of God. For if you would enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any City, and that City should be encompassed with a Wall, and had only one Gate, could you enter into that City except by the Gate which it has? I answer'd, Sir, How could I do otherwise? As therefore, said he, there would be no other way of entring into that City but by its Gate, so neither can any one enter into the Kingdom of God, but only by the Name of the Son of God, who is most dear unto him. And he said unto me, Didst thou see the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that built that Tower? Sir, said I, I saw it. He answer'd, All those are the Angels, venerable in their Dignity. With these is the LORD encompassed as with a Wall; but the Gate is the Son of God; who is the
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:61802:345"/>
only Way of coming unto God. For no Man shall enter into the Kingdom of God by any other Way, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Son. Thou sawest <hi>also,</hi> said he, the six Men, and in the middle of them that Tall, Great Man, who walk'd about the Tower, and rejected the Stones out of the Tower? Sir, said I, I saw them. He answer'd, that Man was the glorious Son of God; and those six were his Angels of most eminent Dignity, which stand about him on the Right Hand and on the Left. Of these excellent Angels none comes in unto God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. He added; Whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall not take upon him his Name, he shall not enter into the Kingdom of God.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. THEN he said, What is this Tower? This said he, is the Church. And what, Sir, are these Virgins? He said unto me, these are the Holy Spirits; for no Man can enter into the Kingdom of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept these cloath him with their Garment. For it will avail thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to take up the Name of the Son of God, unless thou shalt also receive
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:61802:345"/>
their Garment from them. For these Virgins are the Powers of the Son of God. So shall a Man in vain carry his Name, unless he shall also carry his Powers. And he said unto me; Sawest thou those Stones that were cast away? They carried indeed the Name, but put not on their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I said, Sir, What is their Garment? <note n="‖" place="margin">Vid. Annot. Edit. Oxon. p. 166. d.</note> Their very Names, said he, are their Garment. Therefore whosoever carries the Name of the Son of God, ought to carry their Names also; for the Son of God also himself carrieth their Names. As for those Stones, continued he, which being deliver'd by their Hands, thou sawest remain in the Building, they were cloathed with their Power; for which cause thou seest the whole Tower of the same <note n="†" place="margin">Vid. Origen. Philocal. c. viii.</note> Colour with the Rock, and made as it were of one Stone. So also those who have believed in God by his Son, have put on this Spirit. Behold there shall be one Spirit, and one Body, and one Colour of their Garments: And all they shall attain this, who shall carry the Names of these Virgins. And I said, Sir, Why then were
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:61802:346"/>
those Stones cast away which were rejected; seeing they also were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the Gate; and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Hands of these Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins into the Building of this Tower? Seeing, said he, thou takest care to enquire diligently into all things; hear also concerning those Stones which were rejected. All these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Name of the Son of God, and with that the Power of these Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. Having therefore received these Spirits they were perfected, and brought into the Number of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God; and they began to be one Body, and to have one Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for they were sensible of the same Righteousness, which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exercised. But after that they beheld those Women which thou sawest cloathed with a black Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with their Shoulders at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and their Hair loose; they fix'd their Desires upon them, being tempted with their Beauty; and were cloathed with their Power, and cast off the Cloathing of the Virgins. Therefore were they cast off from the House of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to those Women. But they
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:61802:346"/>
that were not corrupted with their Beauty, remained in the House of God. This, said he, is the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of those Stones which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. AND I said: Sir, What if any of these Men shall repent, and cast away their desire of those Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and be converted, and return to these Virgins, and put on again their Vertue; shall they not enter into the House of God? They shall enter, said he, if they shall lay aside all the Works of those Women, and shall resume the Power of these Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and shall walk in their Works. And for this Cause there is a stop in the Building, that if they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, they may be added to the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Tower; but if they shall not repent, that others may be built in their places, and they be utterly cast away. For all these things I gave Thanks unto the LORD, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved with Mercy towards all those upon whom his Name is called, he sent to us the Angel of Repentance to preside over us who have sinned against him; and that
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:61802:347"/>
he has renew'd our Spirits which were almost gone, and who had no hope of Salvation, but are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed to the Renewal of Life. Then I said; Shew me now Sir, Why this Tower is not built upon the Ground, but upon a Rock, and upon the Gate? He replied; Thou art yet foolish and without Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, seeing thou askest this. And I said; Sir, I must needs ask all things of you, because I understand nothing. For all your Answers are great and excellent; and which a Man can hardly understand. Hear, said he: The Name of the Son of God is great and without Bounds, and the whole World is supported by it. If therefore, said I, every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God be sustain'd by his Son; Why do's he not support those also who have been invited by him, and who carry his Name, and walk in his Commandments? Seest thou not, said he, that he do's support them, who with all their Heart carry his Name? He therefore is their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and gladly supports those who do not deny his Name, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly bear it.</p>
                        <p n="15">
                           <pb n="499" facs="tcp:61802:347"/>XV. AND I said: Sir, tell me, the Names of these Virgins; and of those Women that were cloathed with the black Garment. Hear, said he, the Names of those Virgins which are the more powerful, and stand at the Corners of the Gate. These are their Names: The First is called <note n="‖" place="margin">Origen. Hom. in Ezek.</note> Faith; the Second, Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; the Third, Power; the Fourth, Patience; the rest which stand beneath these are, Simplicity; Innocence; Chastity; Chearfulness; Truth; Understanding; Concord; and Charity. Whosoever therefore carry these Names, and the Name of the Son God, shall enter into the Kingdom of God. Hear now, said he, the Names of those Women, which were cloathed with the black Garment. Of these, Four are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal; the First is Perfidiousness; the Second, Intemperance; the Third, Infidelity; the Fourth, Pleasure. And the rest which follow are called thus, Sadness; Malice; Lust; Anger; Lying; Foolishness; Pride, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. The Servant of God which carries these Spirits, shall see indeed the Kingdom of God, but he shall
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:61802:348"/>
not enter into it. But Sir, what are those Stones which were taken out of the Deep and fitted into the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Then ten, said he, which were placed at the Foundation, are the first Age; the following five and twenty, the second, of Righteous Men. The next thirty five, are the Prophets and Ministers of the LORD. And the forty, are the Apostles and Doctors of the Preaching of the Son of God. And I said, Sir, Why did the Virgins carry even these Stones also through the Gate, and so put them into the Building? And he said, Because these first Spirits carried them; and they departed not one from the other, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Men from the Spirits, nor the Spirits from the Men; but the Spirits were joyned to those Men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the day of their Death; who if they had not had these Spirits with them they could not have been useful to the Building of this Tower.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. AND I said; Sir, Shew me this farther. He answer'd, What do'st thou demand? Why did these Stones come out of the Deep, and were placed into the Building of this
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:61802:348"/>
Tower, seeing that they long ago carried their just Spirits? <note n="†" place="margin">Vid. Edit. Oxon. p. 171. b.</note> It was necessary, said he, for them to ascend by Water, and so to be at rest. For they could not otherwise enter into the Kingdom of God, but by laying aside the Mortality of their former Life. They therefore being dead, were <hi>nevertheless</hi> sealed with the Seal of the Son of God, and <hi>so</hi> entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of God. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Man receives the Name of the Son of God, he is ordained unto Death; but when he receives the Seal he is freed from Death, and delivered unto Life. Now that Seal is Water, into which Men go down under the Obligation unto Death, but come up appointed unto Life. Wherefore to those also was this Seal <note n="‖" place="margin">Vid. Coteler. Annot. in loc. pag. 77, 78. Comp. 1 Pet. iii. 19.</note> preached, and they made use of it, that they might enter into the Kingdom of God. And I said; Why then, Sir, did these forty Stones also ascend with them out of the Deep, having already received that Seal? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Clem. Alex. Strom. ii. Et vi.</note> Because these Apostles and Teachers, who preached the Name of the Son of God, dying af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had received his Faith and
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:61802:349"/>
Power, preached to them who were dead before; and they gave this Seal to them. They went down therefore into the Water with them, and again came up. But these went down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; whereas those, who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dead, went down dead, but came up alive. Through these therefore they received Life and knew the Son of God: For which Cause they came up with them, and agreed in the Building of the Tower; and were not cut, but put in intire; because they dyed in great Purity being full of Righteousness; only this Seal was wanting to them. Thus you have the Explication of these things.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. I ANSWER'D: Sir, Tell me now what concerns those Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, why they are so different; some of one Form, and some of another. Hear, said he: These Twelve Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains which thou seest, are Twelve Nations, which make up the whole World. Wherefore the Son of God is preached to them, by those whom he sent unto them. But why, said I, are they different, and every one of a several Figure? <hi>He replied</hi>;
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:61802:349"/>
Hearken. Those Twelve Nations which possess the whole World, are Twelve Peoples: And as thou hast beheld these Mountains different, so are they. I will therefore open to thee the Meaning, and Actions of every Mountain. <hi>But</hi> first, Sir, said I, shew me this: Seeing these Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are so different, how have they agreed into the Building of this Tower; and are no less bright than those which came out of the Deep? Because, reply'd he, all the Nations under Heaven, that have heard and believed, have been called in the same one Name of the Son of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having received his Seal, they have all been made Partakers of the same Prudence and <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Sense.</hi>
                           </note> Knowledge; and their Faith and Charity have been the same; and they have carried the Spirits of these Virgins with his Name. And therefore the Building of this Tower seemed of the same Colour, and did shine like the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Sun. Howbeit after that they were thus perswaded, <hi>and that</hi> there began to be one Body of them all, some among them polluted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and were cast off from the
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:61802:350"/>
Generation of the Righteous, and again return'd to their former State, and became even worse than they were before.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. HOW, said I, Sir, were they worse who knew the LORD? He answer'd; If he who knows not the LORD liveth wickedly, the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of his Wickedness attends him. But he who has known the LORD, ought to abstain altogether from all Wickedness, and more and more be the Servant of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And do's not he then seem to thee to sin more who ought to follow Goodness, if he shall prefer the part of Sin; than he who offends with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing the Vertue of God? Wherefore these are indeed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd unto Death; But they who have known the LORD, and have seen his wonderful Works, if they shall live wickedly, they shall be doubly punish'd, and shall die for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. As therefore thou hast seen that after the Stones were cast out of the Tower, which had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; they were deliver'd to wicked and cruel Spirits; and thou beheldst
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:61802:350"/>
the Tower so cleansed, as if it had all been made of one Stone: <note n="‖" place="margin">Vid. Orig. Philocal. C. viii.</note> So the Church of God, when it shall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; (the Wicked and Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits, the Mischeivous and Doubtful, and all that have behaved themselves wickedly in it, and committed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of Sin, being cast out;) shall become one Body, and there shall be one Understanding, one O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, one Faith, and the same Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Then shall the son of God rejoice among them; and shall receive his People with a pure Will. And I said; Sir, All these things are great and honourable: But now shew unto me the Effect and Force of every Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; that every Soul which trusteth in the LORD, when it shall hear these things, many honour his Great, and Wonderful, and Holy Name. Hear, said he, the Variety of these Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that is, of the twelve Nations.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. THEY who have believed of the first Mountain, which is Black, are those who have revolted from the Faith; and spoken wicked things against the LORD; and betray'd the Servants of God. To these Death
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:61802:351"/>
is proposed, but there is no Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for them: And therefore they are Black, because their kind is wicked. Of the second Mountain which was Smooth, are the <note n="†" place="margin">
                              <hi>Feigned.</hi>
                           </note> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who have believed, and the Teachers of Naughtiness: And these are next to the foregoing, which have not in them the Fruit of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For as their Mountain is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and without Fruit; so also such kind of Men have indeed the Name <hi>of Christians,</hi> but are empty of Faith; nor is there any Fruit of the Truth in them. Nevertheless there is room left to them for Repentance, if they shall suddainly pursue it: But if they shall delay, they also shall be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Death with the foregoing kind. I said, Sir, Why is there room left to those for Repentance, and not to the foregoing kind, seeing their Sins are well nigh the same? There is therefore, said he, to these a return unto Life, because they have not blasphemed their LORD, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd the Servants of God: But by their desire of Gain have deceived Men, leading them according to the desires of Sinners; wherefore they
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:61802:351"/>
shall suffer for this thing. Howbeit there is still left them room for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, because they have not spoken any thing wickedly against their LORD.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. THEY who are of the third Mountain which had Thorns and Brambles, are those who believed, but were some of them Rich, others taken up with many Affairs: The Brambles are their Riches; the Thorns, those Affairs in which they were engaged. Now they who are entangled in much Business, and in Diversity of Affairs, joyn not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Servants of God, but wander, being called away by those Affairs with which they are choaked. And so they which are rich, with difficulty yield themselves to the <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Edit. Oxon. p. 178. Not. b.</note> Conversation of the Servants of God; fearing least any thing should be ask'd of them. These therefore shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of God. For as Men walk with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty bare-foot over Thorns; even so these kind of Men, shall scarcely enter into the Kingdom of God. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless there is afforded to all these
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:61802:352"/>
a return unto Repentance; if so be they shall quickly return to it; that because in their former days they have neglected to work, in the time that is to come they may do some Good. If therefore having repented they shall do the Works of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, they shall live: But if they shall continue in their Evil Courses, they shall be deliver'd to those Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that will take away their Life.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI AS for the fourth Mountain, which had much Grass, the upper part of which is green, but the rest dry, and some of which being touch'd with the Heat of the Sun, is wither'd; it denotes the doubtful, who have believed, and some others who carry the LORD in their Tongues, but have him not in their Heart: Therefore their Grass is dry, and without Root; because they live only in Words, but their Works are dead. These there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are neither dead nor living, and withal are doubtful. For the Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are neither Green nor Dry, that is, neither Dead nor Alive. For as their Grass dries away at the Sight
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:61802:352"/>
of the Sun; so the Doubtful as soon as they hear of Persecution, and fear Inconveniences, return to their Idols, and again serve them, and are ashamed to bear the Name of their LORD. This kind of Men then is neither Dead nor Alive; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less these also may live, if they shall presently repent: But if not, they shall be delivered to those Women, who shall take away their Life.</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. AS concerning the fifth Mountain that is craggy, and yet has green Grass: They are of this kind who have believed, and are Faithful indeed, but believe with Difficulty; and are bold, and self-conceited; that would be thought to know all things, but really know nothing. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by reason of this Confidence Knowledge is departed from them, and a rash Presumption is entred into them. But they carry themselves high, and as prudent Men; and though they are Fools, yet would seem to be Teachers. Now by reason of this Folly many of them whilst they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie themselves, are become vain and empty. For Boldness and vain
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:61802:353"/>
Confidence is a great Seducer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many of these are cast away: But others acknowledging their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, have repented, and submitted themselves to those who are know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And to all the rest of this kind there is Repentance allow'd; foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they were not so much wicked as foolish, and void of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. If these therefore shall repent, they shall live unto God; but if not, they shall dwell with those Women, who shall exercise their Wickedness upon them.</p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. FOR what concerns the sixth Mountain having greater and lesser Clefts, they are such as have believed; but those in which were the lesser Clefts are they who have had Controversies among themselves; and by reason of their Quarrels lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish in the Faith: Nevertheless many of these have repented, and so will the rest when they shall hear my Commands; for their Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies are but small, and they will easily return unto Repentance. But those who have the greater <hi>Clefts,</hi> will be as stiff Stones, mindful of
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:61802:353"/>
Grudges and Offences, and practising Anger among themselves. These therefore are cast from the Tower, and rejected to be put into its Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; therefore this kind of Men shall hardly live. Our God and LORD, who ruleth over all things, and has Power over all his Creatures, will not remember our Offences, but is easily appeased by those who confess their Sins: But Man being Languid, Mortal, Infirm, and full of Sins, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severes in his Anger against Man; as if it were in his Power to save or to destroy him. But I, as the Angel who am set over your Repentance, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish you, that whosoever among you has any such purpose he would lay it aside, and return unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and the LORD will provide Remedies for your former Sins, if you shall purge your selves from this Evil Spirit; but if you shall not do it, ye shall be delivered to him unto Death.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. AS for the seventh Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in which the Grass was green and flourishing, and the whole Mountain fruitful; and all kind of Cattel fed
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:61802:354"/>
upon the Grass of it; and the more the Grass was eaten, so much the more it flourished; they are such as believed, and were always good and upright; and without any Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among themselves, but still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in all the Servants of God, having put on the Spirit of these Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins; and been always ready to shew Mercy to all Men, and easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giving to all Men of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours without upbraiding, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Deliberation. Wherefore the LORD seeing their Simplicity and <note n="‖" place="margin">
                              <hi>Infancy.</hi>
                           </note> Innocence, has encreased them in the Works of their Hands, and given them Grace in all their Works. But I, who am appointed over your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance exhort you, that as many as are of this kind would continue in the same purpose, that your Seed may not be rooted out for ever. For the LORD hath try'd you, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you into our Number; and all your Seed shall dwell with the Son of God; for ye are all of his Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="25">XXV. AS concerning the eighth Mountain in which were a great
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:61802:354"/>
many Springs, by which every kind of all the Creatures of God was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; they are such as have believed the Apostles which the LORD sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the World to preach; and some Teachers who have preached and taught purely and sincerely, and have not in the least yielded to any Evil Desires, but have constantly walked in Righteousness and Truth. These therefore have their Conversation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Angels.</p>
                        <p n="26">XXVI. AGAIN; as for what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the ninth Mountain which was desert, and full of Serpents; they are such as have believed, but had many Stains: These are such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters as discharge their Ministry amiss; ravishing away the Goods of the Widows and Fatherless; and serve themselves, not others, out of those things which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. These, if they continue in this Covetousness, shall deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto Death, nor shall there be any hope of Life for them. But if they shall be converted, and shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Ministry sincerely, they may live. As for those which were
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:61802:355"/>
found rough; they are such as have deny'd the Name of the LORD, and not return'd again to the LORD, but have become savage, and wild; not applying themselves to the Servants of God; but being separated from them, have for the sake of a little Anxiety lost their Lives. For as a Vine that is forsaken in a Hedge, and never dress'd, perishes and is choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Weeds, and in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes wild; and ceases to be useful to its LORD. So this kind of Men despairing of themselves, and being made sour, have begun to be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to their LORD. Howbeit to these there is at last Repentance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, if they shall not be found from their Hearts to have denied <hi>Christ</hi>: But if any of these shall be found to have denied <hi>him</hi> from his Heart, I cannot tell whether such a one can attain unto Life. And I say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that if in these Days any one has denied, he should return unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; for it cannot be that any one who now denies the LORD, can afterwards attain unto Salvation: Nevertheless Repentance is proposed unto them, who have formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd.
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:61802:355"/>
But he who will repent must hasten on his Repentance, before the Building of this Tower is finished: Or if not, he shall be delivered by those Women unto Death. But they that are maimed, are the Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and those who mix one with another: These are the Serpents that you saw in that Mountain. For as the Poyson of Serpents is deadly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Men; So the Words of such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons infect and destroy Men. They are therefore maimed in their Faith, by reason of that kind of Life in which they lead. Howbeit some of them, having repented, have been saved; and so shall others of the same kind be saved, if they shall repent; but if not, they shall die by those Women whose Power and Force they enjoy.</p>
                        <p n="27">XXVII. FOR what concerns the tenth Mountain, in which were the Trees covering the Cattle, they are such as have believed; and some of them been Bishops, that is, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Churches. Others, are such Stones, as have not feigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with a chearful Mind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:61802:356"/>
the Servants of God. Then such as have been set over <hi>inferior</hi> Ministries; and have protected the Poor and the Widows; and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept a chast Conversation; therefore they also are protected by the LORD. Whosoever shall do on this wise, are honour'd with the LORD; and their Place is among the Angels, if they shall continue to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the LORD even unto the End.</p>
                        <p n="28">XXVIII. AS to the eleventh Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in which were Trees loaded with several sorts of Fruits; they are such as have believed, and suffered Death for the Name of the LORD; and have endured with a ready Mind, and have given up their Lives with all their Hearts. And I said, Why then Sir, have all these Fruit; but some fairer than others? Hearken, said he: Whosoever have suffered for the Name of the LORD are esteemed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable by the LORD; and all their Offences are blotted out, because they have suffered Death for the Name of the Son of God. Hear now, why their Fruits are different, and some of them excel others. They who
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:61802:356"/>
being brought before Magistrates, and being ask'd, deny'd not the LORD, but suffered with a ready Mind; these are more honourable with the LORD. The Fruits therefore that are the most fair are these. But they who were fearful and doubtful; and have deliberated with themselves whether they should confess or deny <hi>Christ</hi>; and yet have suffered; their Fruits are smaller, because that this Thought came into their Hearts: For it is a wicked and evil Thought for a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to deliberate whether he should deny his Master. Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye who have such Thoughts, that this Mind continue not in you, and ye die unto God. But ye who suffer Death for his Name sake, ought to honour the LORD, that he has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd you worthy to bear his Name; and that you should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from all your Sins. And why therefore do you not rather esteem your selves happy? Why do you not think that if any one among you suffer, he performs a great Work? For the LORD giveth you Life, and ye understand it not. For your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences did oppress you; and had you
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:61802:357"/>
not suffer'd for his Names sake ye had now been dead unto the LORD. Wherefore I speak this unto you who deliberate whether ye should confess or deny him: Confess that ye have the LORD for your God; least at any time denying him, ye be delivered over into Bonds. For if all Nations punish their Servants which deny their Masters; What think you that the LORD will do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, who has the Power of all things? Remove therefore out of your Hearts these Doubts; that ye may live for ever unto God.</p>
                        <p n="29">XXIX. AS for the twelfth Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which was white, they are such as have believed like sincere Children, into whose Thoughts there never came any Malice; nor have they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known what Sin was, but have always continued in their Integrity. Wherefore this kind of Men shall without all doubt inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; because they have never in any thing defiled the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, but have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with Sincerity in the same Condition all the days of their Life.
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:61802:357"/>
Whosoever therefore, said he, shall continue as Children without Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; shall be more honourable than all those of whom I have yet spoken: For all <hi>such</hi> Children are honour'd by the LORD, and esteemed the first of all. Happy therefore are ye who have removed all Malice from you, and put on Innocence; because ye shall first see the LORD. And after he had thus ended his Explication of all the Mountains, I said unto him; Sir, Shew me now also what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Stones that were brought out of the Plain, and put into the Tower in the room of those that were rejected; as also concerning those round Stones which were added into the Building of the Tower; and also of those who still continued round.</p>
                        <p n="30">XXX. HEAR now, says he, concerning those Stones which were brought out of the Plain into the Building of the Tower, and placed in the room of those that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: They are the Roots of that white Mountain. Wherefore because those who have believed of that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, were very Innocent; the LORD
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:61802:358"/>
of this Tower commanded that they which were of the Roots of this Mountain should be placed into the Building. For he knew that if they were put into this Building they would continue bright; nor would any of them any more be made black. But if he had added on this manner from the rest of the Mountains, he would <note n="‖" place="margin">
                              <hi>Not.</hi>
                           </note> have needed again to visit this Tower and to cleanse it. Now all these white Stones, are the young Men who have, and shall believe; for they are all of the same kind. Happy is this kind, because it is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Hear now also concerning those round and bright Stones. All these are of this white Mountain. But they are therefore found round, because their Riches have a little darkned them from the Truth, and dazzled their Eyes: Howbeit they have never departed from the LORD, nor has any wicked Word proceeded out of their Mouths; but all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and Vertue, and Truth. When therefore the LORD saw their Mind, and that they might adorn the Truth; he commanded that they should continue good, and that their
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:61802:358"/>
Riches should be pared away: For he would not have them taken whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away, to the End they might do some good with that which was left, and live unto God; because they also are of a good kind: Therefore they were a little cut away, and so put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Building of this Tower.</p>
                        <p n="31">XXXI. AS for the rest which continu'd still round, and were not found fit for the Building, because they have not yet received the Seal, they were carried back to their place; because they were found very round. But this present World must be cut away from them, and the Vanities of their Riches; and then they will be fit for the Kingdom of God. For they must enter into the Kingdom of God, because God has blessed this innocent kind. Of this kind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none shall fall away; for though any of them being tempted by the Devil should offend, he shall soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his LORD God. I the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Repentance esteem you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, whosoever are Innocent as little Children, because your part is good and honourable with the LORD.
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:61802:359"/>
And I say unto all you who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Seal; keep Simplicity, and remember not Affronts, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Malice; neither suffer Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness to grow in your Spirits through the Memory of any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences <hi>that you have received</hi>; but provide Remedies for these evil Rents, and remove them from you; that the LORD of the Sheep may rejoyce in you; <note n="‖" place="margin">Vid. Antioch. Hom. cxxii.</note> for he will rejoyce, if he shall find all whole. But if any of these Sheep shall be found scatter'd away, Wo shall be to the Shepherds: And if the Shepherds themselves shall be scattered, how will they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to God for the Sheep? Will they say that they were troubled by the Sheep? But they shall not be believed. For it is not to be believed, that the Shepherd should suffer by his Flock; and he shall be the more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for his Lie. Now I am the Shepherd; and I especially must give an Account of you.</p>
                        <p n="32">XXXII. WHEREFORE provide for your selves whilst the Tower is yet building. The LORD dwells in those that love Peace; for true Peace
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:61802:359"/>
is dear; but he is far off from the Contentious, and those who are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with Malice. Wherefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store unto him the Spirit intire, as ye received it. <note n="†" place="margin">Antioch. Hom xciv.</note> For if thou shalt give unto a Fuller a new Garment whole, thou wilt expect to receive it whole again: If therefore the Fuller shall restore it unto thee torn, wouldst thou receive it? Wouldst thou not presently be angry; and reproach him, saying; I gave my Garment to thee whole, why hast thou rent it, and made it useless to me? Now it is of no use to me, by reason of the Rent which thou hast made in it. Wouldst thou not say all this to a Fuller, for the Rent which he made in thy Garment? If therefore thou wouldst be concern'd for thy Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and complain that thou hadst not received it whole, what thinkest thou that the LORD will do, who gave his Spirit to thee intire, and thou hast render'd him altogether unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable? So that he can be of no use unto his LORD? For being corrupted by thee, he is no longer profitable to him. Will not therefore the LORD do the same concerning his Spirit,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:61802:360"/>
by reason of thy Sin? Undoubtedly, said I, he will do the same to all those whom he shall find to continue in the Remembrance of Injuries. Tread not then under foot, said he, his Mercy; but rather honour him, because he is so patient with respect to your Offences, and not like one of you; but repent, for that will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for you.</p>
                        <p n="33">XXXIII. ALL these things which are above written, I the Angel of Repentance have shewn and spoken to the Servants of God. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye shall believe and hearken to these Words, and shall walk in them, and shall correct your Ways, ye shall live. But if ye shall continue in your Wickedness, and in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Injuries, no such Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners shall live unto God. All these things which were to be deliver'd by me, I have thus spoken unto thee. Then the Shepherd said unto me, Hast thou ask'd all things of me? I answered, Sir, I have. Why then, said he, Hast thou not ask'd concerning the Form of these Stones that were put in the Building, that I
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:61802:360"/>
may explain that also unto thee? I answer'd, Sir, I forgot it. Hear then, said he, concerning those also. They are those who have heard these Commands, and have repented with all their Hearts: And when the LORD saw that their Repentance was good and pure, and that they could continue in it, he commanded their former Sins to be blotted out. For these Forms were their Sins, and they are therefore made even that <hi>their Sins</hi> might not appear.</p>

AFTER that I had written this Book, the Angel which had deliver'd me to that Shepherd, came into the House where I was, and sate upon the Bed, and that Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd stood at his Right Hand. Then he called me and said unto me; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd thee and thy House to this Shepherd, that thou mightest be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by him. I said, Yes LORD. If therefore, said he, thou wilt be protected from all Vexation, and from all Cruelty, and have Success
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:61802:361"/>
in every good Word and Work; and all Vertue and Righteousness; walk in those Commands which he has given thee; and thou shalt have Dominion over all Sin.

But ye despise his Goodness, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty which he shews towards you.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. I SAID unto him; Sir, Ask him since the time that he came into my House, whether I have done any thing disorderly, or have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him in any thing? I know, said he, that thou hast done nothing disorderly, neither wilt thou hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do any thing; and therefore I
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:61802:361"/>
speak these things with thee that thou mayst persevere; for he has given me a good Account concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee. But thou shalt speak these things to others, that they who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have repented, or shall repent, may be of the same opinion with thee; and he may give me as good an Account of them also, and I may do the same unto the LORD. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, Sir, I declare to all Men the wonderful Works of God: And I hope that all who love them and have before sinned, when they shall hear these things will willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and so recover Life. Continue therefore, said he, in this Ministry, and perfect it. And whosoever shall fulfil the Commands of <hi>this Shepherd,</hi> shall live; and shall have great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour both here, and with the LORD. But they that shall not keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, flee from their Life, and are Adversaries unto it. And they that follow not his Commands, shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver themselves unto Death; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one shall be guilty of his own Bloud. But I say unto thee, keep these Commandments, and thou shalt find a Cure for all thy Sins.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="528" facs="tcp:61802:362"/>III. MOREOVER I have sent these Virgins to dwell with thee, for I have seen that they are very kind to thee. Thou shalt therefore have them for thy Helpers, that thou mayst the better keep the Commands which have been given thee; for these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands cannot be kept without these Virgins. And thou seest how they are willing to be with thee; and I will also command them that they shall not at all depart from thy House. Only do thou purifie thy House; for they will readily dwell in a clean House. For they are Clean, and Chast, and Industrious; and all of them have Grace with the LORD. If therefore thou shalt have thy House pure, they will abide with thee. But if it shall be never so little pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, they will immediately depart from thy House; for these Virgins cannot endure any manner of Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I said unto him; Sir, I hope that I shall so please them, that they shall always delight to dwell in my House. And as he to whom you have committed me makes no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of me; so neither shall they
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:61802:362"/>
complain. <hi>Then</hi> he said to that Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; I see that the Servant of God will live and keep these Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and place these Virgins in a pure Habitation. When he had said this he delivered me again to that Shepherd, and called the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and said unto them; Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I see that ye will readily dwell in this Mans House, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him and his House to you; that ye may not at all depart from his House. And they willingly heard these Words.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. THEN he said unto me, Go on Manfully in thy Ministry; Declare to all Men the great things of God, and thou shalt find Grace in this Ministry. And whosoever shall walk in these Commands shall live, and be happy in his Life. But he that shall neglect them, shall not live, and shall be unhappy in his Life. Say unto all, that whosoever can do what is right, cease not to exercise themselves in good Works. For I would that all Men should be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Inconveniences they lie under. For he that wants and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:61802:363"/>
Inconveniences in his daily Life, is in great Torment and Necessity. Whosoever therefore delivers such a Soul from Necessity, gets great Joy unto himself. For he that is grieved with such Inconveniences, is equally tormented, as if he were in Chains. And many upon the Account of such Calamities, being not able to bear them, have <hi>chosen even</hi> to destroy themselves. He therefore that knows the Calamity of such a Man, and do's not free him from it, commits a great Sin, and is guilty of his Bloud. Wherefore exercise your selves in Good Works, as many as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Ability</hi> from the LORD; least whilst ye delay to do them the Building of the Tower be finish'd; because for your sakes the Building is stopp'd. Except therefore ye shall make haste to do well, the Tower shall be finish'd, and ye shall have no place in it. And after he had <hi>thus</hi> spoken with me, he rose up from the Bed, and departed, taking the Shepherd and Virgins with him. Howbeit he said unto me, that he would send back the Shepherd and Virgins unto my House, <hi>Amen.</hi>

and how much Jesus Christ vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to suffer for our sakes. What Recompense then shall we render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? Or what Fruit that may be worthy of what he has given to us? For <hi>indeed</hi>

He has illuminated us; as a Father, he has called us his Children; he has saved us who were lost and undone. What Praise shall we ascribe to him? Or what Reward that may be answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to those things which we have received? We were defective in our Understandings; worshiping Stones and Wood; Gold, and Silver, and Brass, the Works of Mens <hi>Hands,</hi> and our whole Life was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but Death. Wherefore being encompassed with Darkness, and having such a Mist before our Eyes, we have look'd up; and through his Will have laid aside the Cloud wherewith we were surrounded. For he had Compassion upon us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved in his Bowels towards us, he saved us; having beheld in us much Deceit, and Destruction; and seen that we had no hope of
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:61802:366"/>
Salvation but only by him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he called us, who were not; and was pleased from nothing to give us a Being.</p>

                        <hi>break forth and cry thou that travailest not; for she that is desolate hath many more Children, than she that hath an Husband.</hi> In that he said, <hi>Rejoice thou Barren that bearest not,</hi> He spake of us: For our Church was barren, before that Children were given unto it. And again; when he said, <hi>Cry thou that travailest not</hi>; He implied thus much: That after the manner of Women in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, we should not cease to put up our Prayers unto God <note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Simply.</hi>
                        </note> only. And for what remains, <hi>Because she that is desolate hath more Children than she that hath an Husband</hi>; It was therefore added, because our People which seem'd to have been forsaken by God, now believing <hi>in him,</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more than they who seem'd to have God. And another Scripture saith,<note place="margin">Mat. ix.13.</note> 
                        <hi>I came not to call the Righteous but Sinners to Repentance.</hi> The Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which is this; that those who

were lost, must be saved. For that is indeed truly great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, not to confirm those things that are yet standing, but those which are falling. Even so did it seem good to Christ to save what was lost; and when he came into the World he saved many, and called us who were already perishing.</p>

<pb n="539" facs="tcp:61802:367"/>
not with our Lips only, but with all our Heart, and with all our Mind. For he saith in <hi>Isaiah;</hi>

But what then must we do that we attain unto it? We must be converted to a divine and just Course of Life; and look upon all the things of this World,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:61802:368"/>
as none of ours; and not desire them. For if we shall desire to possess them, we are fallen from the Way of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</p>

We cannot therefore be the Friends of both; but we must resolve by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking one, to enjoy the other. And we think that it is better to hate the present things, as little, short-lived, and corruptible; and to love those which are to come, which are truly good, and incorruptible.
