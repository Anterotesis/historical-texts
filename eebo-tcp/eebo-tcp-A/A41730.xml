            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THis Treatiſe, which five Years
ſince, I willingly Dedicated to
You in the <hi>French Idiome,</hi> is
now again preſented to Your
ſelf, repleniſhed with many Obſervations
in the Latine Tongue: ſeeing that by the
great eſteem of Your Name, our <hi>French</hi>
Edition was not only Candidly accepted
in <hi>France;</hi> but alſo in other Forreign
Nations among Learned Men: The
exceeding happy ſucceſs of which, had
wrought in me an Admiration, had not
the fame of Your Tranſcendant Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

with all Humility I crave, that even as
You protected the former Edition, under

would vouchſafe alſo to protect This. <hi>Sir,</hi>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN the Year 1663. in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
I hearing the moſt Famous, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
Man in Studies, <hi>Francis de
le Boe-Sylvius,</hi> daily teaching concerning
the <hi>Pancreatick Juyce,</hi> to be one of the chiefeſt
Foundations of Phyſick, I endeavoured to find
out that, hitherto undiſcovered Juyce; the which
when I had done, and indeed after that manner
which he had firſt deſcribed to us; he having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
thereof, with all Diligence did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
me to Print thoſe things, which I had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
worthy of Notice, concerning this Subject,
through diverſe Diſſections of various Animals:
And I, willing to gratifie his Requeſt, publiſhed
a little Treatiſe, concerning the Nature, and
Office of the Pancreatick Juyce; which, although
in an unpoliſhed manner, nevertheleſs, it ſo took
with the Curious Indagators of Nature, that in
a ſhort time, ſufficient Examples of that Nature,
were deſired of me: For which cauſe, in the Year
1666, I publiſhed, at <hi>paris,</hi> this little Treatiſe, in
the <hi>French</hi> Tongue; which, three or four Months
<pb facs="tcp:64159:4"/>
together, I preſented to the Famous Dr. <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delot,</hi>
to be publickly examined; to whoſe Houſe
the moſt Curious Wits of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
reſort. And I, ſeeing that this ſecond
Edition wonderfully took with the moſt Learned
Phyſitians of all <hi>France,</hi> who have their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
at <hi>Paris,</hi> and returning to my own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
I found that there were remaining no Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of my Firſt Edition, being inſtigated by the
Printer, and my Friends, for their ſakes who
underſtood not the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, have again
turned the ſame little Treatiſe into <hi>Latine,</hi> and
that not barely, but in ſeveral places have inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
new Obſervations, and reſolves to ſeveral
Objections, put to me againſt this Treatiſe, both
in <hi>France,</hi> and other Countries, that my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might not ſeem, in any Reſpect, to be faulty;
So that, the Treatiſe, which I now publiſh, may
bear the name of a new one; which I hope, will
not be unacceptable to the <hi>Reader.</hi> But ſeeing
no writing (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) can be ſo exact, that
it may avoid the Cenſures of <hi>Criticks,</hi> without
doubt, there will be Carpers, who are better af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with Brawlings, and Drinkings, than the
Diſſections of Bodies, which will laugh at me,
for the ſpending ſo much time in the diſcovery of
this Juyce: But <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in an Epiſtle to
<hi>Damagetus,</hi> hath taught me in an Hiſtory of
<hi>Democritus,</hi> that thoſe Gibeings ought not to
be regarded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So much of which Hiſtory,
as moſt nearly appertaines to us, I will briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late:
<hi>Democritus,</hi> inferiour to none of the
<hi>Abderitans,</hi> when, to find out the nature of the
<pb facs="tcp:64159:4"/>
Bile, had betaken himſelf, apart from the City,
and there alone had diſſected many Animals;
he was generally reputed to be mad; wherefore
the Senate, and People of the <hi>Abderitans</hi> being
ſad, and troubled, did very much importune the
Prince of <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> that he would vouchſafe to
come, and cure the madneſs of <hi>Democritus:
Hippocrates,</hi> by the Merits of <hi>Democritus,</hi>
and the Intreaties of the <hi>Abderitans,</hi> taking Ship
went to <hi>Abderis,</hi> where he found all the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
and Inhabitants gathered together, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him without the Gates; part of whom
running before, and part following, led <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
to a high Hill without the City, (cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out ſave, help, heal,) that he might ſee the
Madneſs of <hi>Democritus:</hi> From whence they
ſaw <hi>Democritus</hi> ſometimes diſſecting Animals,
ſometimes muſeing, and ſometimes writing.
<hi>Hippocrates,</hi> going all alone to <hi>Democritus,</hi>
and making an exact tryal of him, although then
he underſtood he was not mad, asked him what
he wrote there? <hi>Democritus</hi> anſwered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Madneſs; And being further asked,
What he wrote of Madneſs? ſaid, What elſe,
than what it is, and how generated, and how
allayed in the Bodies of Men? For, theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
which you ſee here, that I open for this
purpoſe, is not becauſe I hate the Works of God, but
ſearch out the Nature and Seat of the Bile:
For, you know, this is the cauſe of Mens
Madneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which being underſtood,
ſaith <hi>Hippocrates, Democritus</hi> in truth, I call
God to witneſs, you ſpeak truly, and wiſely:
<pb facs="tcp:64159:5"/>
And he, returning to the <hi>Abderitans,</hi> who wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for him at ſome diſtance, commended <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,</hi>
and accuſed themſelves of Madneſs. I
wiſh <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the great Prince of <hi>Phyſitians,</hi>
might riſe from the Dead, he would not blame
thoſe leſs, which deride me for my more diligent
ſearch of the Pancreatick Juyce, than them
which judged <hi>Democritus</hi> to be mad, for his
exquiſite enquiry into the Bile: Seeing that he
thought them to be taught of God, which did not
only ſtudy about Heat, Cold, Dryneſs, and
Moiſture, but about their Cauſes: For, it is
not Heat (ſaith he) <hi>Lib. De Vet. Med.</hi> Text
<hi>XXVI. XII. which hath great force, but
Sharpneſs, and Fluidity, and other things by
me related.</hi> And he ſaith before Text <hi>XXIV.
XX. Becauſe there is in Man both bitter, ſalt,
ſweet, acid, ſharp, and fluid, and infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
having all manner of Faculties,
both of Plenty, and Strength.</hi> From whence
he commonly calls thoſe Faculties, and Powers
he affirms Salt, Bitterneſs, and Acidity, with
other things of the like Acrimony, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the cauſes of all Diſtempers, as appears <hi>Lib.
cap. Text XXV.</hi> From which it is as evident,
as the Sun at Noon-day, that <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
if he were alive, would judge our Diſſections,
and Searchings, about Salts, Acids, and other
Faculties, ſometimes abounding in the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juyce, to be highly neceſſary. In regard
<hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and other of the Antients, who
were famous in their time, were altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Pancreatick Juyce; neither did they
<pb facs="tcp:64159:5"/>
underſtand the whole depth of Nature; It is not
to be imputed to them as a Fault: But on the
contrary, thoſe famous, and chiefeſt Guides of
Wiſdome, and Inciters of Wits, are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended;
becauſe they broke the Ice for us; and
(as it is ſaid) thoſe things which we read, were
rightly invented, and obſerved by them, are to
be candidly embraced; and thoſe things, which
we really know to be falſe, and erronious, I
judge they ought to be corrected with ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
as we deſire thoſe things, which we now
write, ſhould be corrected with. If we conſider
a Thouſand Years yet to come, ſomething may
be found out, which will correct, and amend our
Writings, by the unwearyed Searchers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for Arts admit of a daily Improvement, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in this age of ours, in which the Yoke
of Authority being ſhook off, we may bring to the
Teſt thoſe things which our Reaſon and Senſe
doth afford us; for, the Enquirers into things
Natural ought not to diſtruſt themſelves, or ſo
doubtfully to follow the ſteps of their Anceſtors, as
at any time, when they ſhall diſcover Novelties,
be afraid to publiſh them.</p>

leaſt confeſs, till now, never any Syſteme was
found out, in which fewer, or leſſer difficulties
are, than this of ours, if they will but examine
our Dictates without Prejudice, and Envy.
Firſt of all, Let the <hi>Reader</hi> be perſwaded in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that our Pancreatick Juyce is no Fictions,
but a real Humour of our Bodies; and ſuch a
one indeed as after its own ſeparation from the
Blood, and Propulſion, to the Inteſtines, is in
a ſhort time after, again permixed with the Blood,
ſeeing that all Liquid things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carryed by the paſſage of
the Guts, do eaſily aſcend (by
the Venae Lacteae) the firſt<note n="*" place="margin">The Origin. is Thalamus.</note> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
of the Living, and the laſt of the Dead.</p>
            <p>Which being granted, he may further conſider
it was not (by the Almighty God) ordained in
vain, but for a common uſe to the Body; and
ſo all men will be eaſily perſwaded, that as
often as the Pancreatick Juyce is rightly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
its uſe doth naturally happen: And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
when it happens preternaturally, then it is
vitious, and preternatural: Seeing it is ſo, and
my whole <hi>Treatiſe</hi> conſiſts in the preſerving a
good Order of the Pancreatick Juyce, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
it when vitiated, and helping Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
from thence ariſing, we hope it will be very
acceptable, and profitable to <hi>Practitioners:</hi> For,
let this be its whole deſigne, to give a helping
<pb facs="tcp:64159:6"/>
hand to all who profeſs <hi>Phyſick,</hi> that they may
ſooner, ſafer, and more delightfully help the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
and miſeries of the Sick: And if I
unhappily miſs my aim, you may commend my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
and modeſtly correct thoſe things in which the
weakneſs of my Genious doth miſtake: And if
any one pleaſe to inform me better, I will allow
him to convince me of my Errour, and not to
accuſe me of Obſtinacy, ſeeing that I am not moved
by Ambition, but only deſirous of finding out
Truth, offer up theſe my Studies unto you.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Having often viewed this Treatiſe of the
moſt ingenious D. <hi>Regnerus de Graaf,</hi> and
many times alſo heard it wiſhed for in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
at length Reſolved to Tranſlate it for
their Sakes to whom the Original was not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable,
in Regard of their Neſcience of the
Language, though otherwiſe competently ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and intelligent. The which I am well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
will prove ſervicable (and I hope alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to them) in three Reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that it will be of great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tillity, for
the more compleat underſtanding the Works of
the Learned <hi>Franciſcus Sylvius de le Boe</hi> that
late Renowned Profeſſor of Phyſick in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of <hi>Leyden,</hi> the firſt part of whoſe <hi>Praxis</hi>
is already in Engliſh; for in regard that he
urgeth the Pancreatick Juice to be an Agent of
Fermentation and Concoction of the Chyle, and
<pb facs="tcp:64159:9"/>
ſo conſequently a conſtitutive part of the Blood,
and Authour of many grievous Diſeaſes, and
Enormities of the Body. It neceſſarily follows
1. That the certainty of this Juyce ought to be
known; that is, that it be a real Juyce, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in all Mens Bodies, and not a thing only
immaginary or uncertain, which this Author hath
evidently demonſtrated. 2. The way and manner of
collecting it, by ſenſible Experiment (the ſurest
of Guides) to convince thoſe who oppugne, and
reſolve the Doubting, which he hath largely
ſhewn. 3. Becauſe the Anatomical Diſquiſition
of the Pancreas, and its Juyce, is omitted by
<hi>Sylvius,</hi> in the firſt part of his Praxis, as not
pertinent to his preſent Scope, which omiſſion this
Book ſupplies, and to which the ſaid <hi>Sylvius,</hi> in
a manner, refers his Readers: So that he which
deliberately reads this Book, will be thereby
highly inducted to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the
Doctrines and Notions of the moſt Learned <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
concerning the Pancreatick Juyce, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his whole Writings, as they relate to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Diſeaſes, and Affections of the Body of
Man.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Commodity I ſhall propound is,
That this Book doth moſt Indubitably contain
the certain Cauſes of all Agues, or Intermitting
Feavers, with their true and effectual Rules of
Curation. It is a wonder to ſee the many Books
which have been written concerning Agues, and
Feavers, (perhaps as many as there are Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Medicines for the cure thereof) and the
great Diverſity of Opinions concerning their
<pb facs="tcp:64159:9"/>
Cauſes and differences; ſo that, for a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
with a tedious Ague, to call a Councel
of <hi>Phyſitians</hi> to his Aſſiſtance, uſually received
no more Relief, than a Criminal Perſon doth by the
Verdict of a Jury, which delivers him from Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
either to Death, or Baniſhment. Which
hath formerly enrolled this Diſeaſe in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of thoſe which were wont to be termed
<hi>Opprobrium Medicorum,</hi> the Reproach of
Phyſitians.</p>
            <p>Neither, in my Judgment, is it greatly to be
wondered at, that Phyſitians were wont to have
no better ſucceſs in the Cure of this Diſeaſe,
ſeeing they were involved in ſo many <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
about the Seat, and Cauſe thereof; ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
the Seat to be in the Blood in general, others
in ſome perticular Parts of the Veſſels, where
the Blood happened to be ſtagnant; others in the
Meſeraick Veines; others in the Guts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in the Colon, and ſeveral other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
as if they went about to gain the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the true Seat, Arithmetically, by the
rule of falſe Poſition. Then again, as to the
Cauſes, and Reaſons of Differences, whilſt
they aſcribed them to the Four Humours, <hi>viz.</hi>
Blood, Choler, Phlegme, and Melancholy,
and their different Degrees of Miſtion, and
Putre-Faction, they ran upon ſuch Rocks as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ſhip-wracked the Barks of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:
For, ſtill, as they endeavoured to
ſolve one difficulty that would ariſe, they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Riſe of another. But this Author's Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,
<pb facs="tcp:64159:10"/>
being ſo free from all Intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and Difficulties, renders it agreeable to
Truth.</p>
            <p>I have yet further to ſay in the behalf of its
Certainty, that is the Conſequence of Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which, although every ſingle Cure of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
doth not indeed declare the Adminiſtrator of
the Medicine, to have a certain Intelligence of
the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe; yet, when a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
ſhall be certainly cured, at divers times,
in different Perſons, and with different Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments;
alwayes from the Notions, Doctrines,
and Conſiderations of the ſame Cauſe, that
ſurely is a certain Argument that the Cauſe is
known. And this I my ſelf have oft-times
done even to Admiration, by removing Ague-Fits
in a few dayes ſpace, and never yet failing of
the Cure of any kind of Ague, whether Quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
Tertian, or Quartan, with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds;
and am yet (by God's bleſſing) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
at any time, to undertake the cure of
the worſt Ague-Fits that are; which Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
I acknowledge, I owe to this Author:
I am able alſo, to perform the ſame in thoſe
deplorable Fits, commonly called, The Fits of
the Mother.</p>
            <p>I have inſtanced this not out of boaſting, but to
ſhew the certainty, and excellency of the Doctrine
of the Pancreatick Juyce, and to excite the
Reader to a ſerious Contemplation, and Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64159:10"/>
There is yet a Third <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tillity of this Book,
which is, That it refutes ſeveral Errours in
Phyſick, and Anatomy; many of which, in
times paſt, have been received for certain
Truths, and ſome of them perhaps yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the Principle whereof relate to the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas,
or Sweet-Bread, and to the Nervous
Juyce; concerning which, I ſhall ſay no more,
but commit you to the things themſelves, as they
ſhall occur by reading.</p>
            <p>I have nothing more to ſay, but to beg the
Readers kind Acceptance; and withall to mind
him of the Difficulty of things of this Nature,
(eſpecially when an Author writes in ſuch a
ſtyle as <hi>de Graaf</hi> hath done) that if he meet
with any Errours committed by me, I hope he
will the more eaſily paſs them by, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Intentional, and I preſume not Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p>If I find this be kindly accepted, it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
me to ſerve my Country with ſome-what of
my own, more at large.</p>
            <p>I do expect to be cenſured, and ſnarled at by
ſome (for as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nihil moroſius
Hominum Judiciis</hi>) there is nothing more peev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
than Mens Judgments, I ſhall eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe

conſidering the ſolid ſayings of the Ancients,

            <p>Many famous men both in Judgment and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
were ſtired up by the Examples of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

about the ſame time, <hi>viz.</hi> 1650. and 51.
in divers Countries it was diſcovered by <hi>Olaus
Rudbechius,</hi> a <hi>Swede,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Bartholinus,</hi> a
<hi>Dane,</hi> both famous in <hi>Anatomy;</hi> that the <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick
Veſſels</hi> were diſtributed through the
whole Body.</p>
            <p>Alſo the <hi>Ductus's</hi> were obſerved in, or about
the Year 1656. (by <hi>Thomas Wharton</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
man) tending from the lower Maxillary Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule
by a ſtraight paſſage to the Nipples; which
are found alſo at the fleſhly Ligature of the

in his little Book for publick good. Alſo by his
Induſtry were found out many other Veſſels paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

his Example, ſome years ſince have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64159:15"/>
that the Glaudulous part of the Jaw being
preſt, a thick and viſcous Humour came forth
by the general opening of the Pores; from
which time we thought that that viſcous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which appears by Spitting, or other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the Jaws, did in an eſpecial manner
proceed from thoſe Duct:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jo. George Wirſungus</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> is not ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
to be paſſed by (who can all to mind all
Inventions) who was very excellent in the Study
of <hi>Anatomy;</hi> in the Year 1642. at <hi>Padua,</hi> firſt
found out the <hi>Ductus Pancreaticus,</hi> which for
the general good of Phyſicians, he cauſed to be
Engraven in Copper, from whom we might
have expected more, had he not been wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
Piſtol'd by envious perſons in his own
Houſe. Seeing therefore this famous man
could not ſo ſucceſſively find out the Uſe of this
Duct by his own Study, others, that they
might be ſerviceable to the Phyſical Republick,
perſiſted in the fame Labour, and with ſo much
the more Earneſtneſs, in regard daily, there
were more ſharp Diſputes concerning it's true
Office, and that eſpecially in the Univerſity of
<hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> the moſt famous and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatigable
<hi>Franciſcus de le Boe Sylvius</hi> leading the
way; who when he had underſtood the various
Experiments which we had ſucceſsfully made,
by the diſſecting of divers Kinds of Animals,
very often, as well in private as in publick,
adviſed us, that we would commit to Writing
theſe things which we had obſerved worthy of
Note concerning this matter.</p>

We diſtruſting our own Induſtry, (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that there are found ſome (gluttons of
Books, as they may be termed) who being
ſtimulated with the deſire of Vain Glory, ſpare
not to aſſault all with their ſcribling Pen, and
ſcurrilous Language;) were almoſt afraid to
enter upon this work.</p>
            <p>Yet conſiſidering that for the publick good, any

we at laſt put a helping hand to this Labour, and

            <p>We being perſwaded by the Council of him,

            <p>The <hi>Subſtanee</hi> of the Pancreas (or Sweet-Bread,
if you except its Membranes and veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels),
is wholly Glandulous; made up of many
ſmall Glandules; all which have ſo great a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Strength, that being ſeparated from
each other do ſtill retain their proper form; and
being put together, by reaſon of their looſe joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
make a ſoft Body: ſo that, not without
Reaſon, they have called the Pancreas a looſe
and ſoft Glandule. Moreover, each Glandules,
conſtituting the Pancreas, have their propper
Membranes; and all being joyned together, are
encompaſſed about with a Coat of ſufficient
Strength ariſing from the Peritonaeum; by the
benefit of which, they are ſtrongly kept, with
their little Veſſels, in their own place.</p>
            <p>Its <hi>Scituation,</hi> in a man, is under the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

            <p>If you conſider its <hi>Colour,</hi> it is pale, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
Glandulous; for the Blood gives little
or no Colour to the Pancreas.</p>
            <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is oblong, and broader, and thicker,
towards the Inteſtinum Duodenum, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Spleen narrower and thinner; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
it is differently conſtituted in diverſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals;
for in Dogs; Cats, Apes, Ottars, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the like Nature, it is Bipartite: So that
one part aſcendeth towards the Stomach, and
the other deſcendeth by the Membrane of the
Meſenterium, (according to the paſſage of the
Inteſtine) to the which, it is on every ſide firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knit.</p>
            <p>In Fiſhes and Fowls, for the moſt part it is
long and ſingle.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Magnitude</hi> of the Pancreas in Healthful
bodies is ſmall, and compared with the other
Bowels, comes ſhort of moſt, yet in men of
full growth, conſidered with the other Glandules
it exceeds them all.</p>
            <p>It's <hi>Longitude</hi> is uſually eight or ten Fingers
breadth, which it ſeldom exceeds in men of
perfect health. It's <hi>Latitude</hi> is ordinarily two
Fingers broad, or two and a half. It's <hi>Thickneſs,</hi>
for as much as we could obſerve in dead Bodies
by us Diſſected, is a Fingers breadth. Finally,
the weight is various, according to the diverſe
Magnitude of the Animal in which it exiſts:
We have with the moſt curious <hi>VVharton,</hi> often
obſerved it in Men to be four or five Ounces,
and in Horſes about eleven. The <hi>Veſſels</hi> of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64159:18"/>
Pancreas, by the moſt accurate Searchers of
Nature, are referred only to four Kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
Veins, Nerves, and it's own proper
Ductus. The <hi>Arteries</hi> borrow their Original
from the Caeliaca, the <hi>Veins</hi> from the Ramus
Splenicus; the <hi>Nerves</hi> from the ſixth pair of
Nerves, and the <hi>Ductus Pancreaticus</hi> ſeems to be
derived from the Parenchyma of the Pancreas.
For as much as each Glandules conſtituting
the Pancreas, ſend forth ſmall Veſſels, which
meeting in the middle thereof, make up this
large Ductus.</p>
            <p>This Veſſel which hath been before expoſed
to curious Eyes, in all appearance is Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous;
and although it be ſmall, nevertheleſs it
is ſufficiently ſtrong. It's bigneſs near the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinum
Duodenum, is about the quantity of
a ſmall ſized Quill, called a Pinion; but in it's
progreſs towards the greater Lateral branches,
and alſo to the leſſer, running to all the Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
of the Pancreas, it is divided, and gradually
leſſened; wherefore by how much the more it
approacheth the Spleen, by ſo much it is the leſs,
and ſends forth ſmaller branches</p>
            <p>This Ductus, or paſſage for the moſt part, is

            <p>We think it to be worth our while to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
that in many and different Animals, which
belongs to the Inſertion of the Ductus Pancre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aticus;
ſeeing that Nature oftentimes in one is
more depreſſed and obſcure, in another, more
clearly manifeſted; ſo that none can truly
determine concerning the Uſe, and Office
of any part, which hath not diligently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
the Fabrick, and Scituation, the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
annexed, and other accidents in divers Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
            <p>For which Cauſe, we will briefly inſert below
the Differences, which we have obſerved in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
kinds of living Creatures; as well that
which belongs to the Ductus, as that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to it's Inſertion, that all may be able the
better to judge of it's uſe. There are ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
which have only one ſingle Pancreatick
Duct. Others there are which have it double,
and laſtly, ſome have three, when the Ductus
is ſingle; ſometimes it enters with the Ductus
Biliarius into the Inteſtinum Duodenum, and
ſometimes a part. When the Ductus is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate,
ſometimes one, ſometimes both meet
together with the Ductus Biliarius in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine.
But when the Ductus is threefold, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
one only, ſometimes two, and ſometimes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64159:21"/>
all three enter into the Inteſtine by the ſame
paſſage, and alſo therein lay down a contained
Humour. And if you conſider the place of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
it very much differs in divers living
Creatures; for ſome are found in which the
Ducts do disburden themſelves into the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,
and alſo others in which they are diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the Ventricle.</p>
            <p>The ſingle Ductus for the moſt part is found
in Man, Calves, Hogs, Hares, Conies, Cats,
Dogs, Pikes, Carps, Eells, Barbils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as
we have formerly aſſerted; for in Men and
Dogs we find it ſometimes double, yet ſo as the
ſecond is leſs than the former, <hi>viz.</hi> then that
which paſſeth into the Duodenum with the
Ductus Biliarius.</p>
            <p>As often as theſe two Ducts happen in the
Animals but now cited, for the moſt part they
are conjoyned in the Pancreas; ſo that the one
being blown up, the other will ſwell; yet we
find them ſo conſtituted in Man, that they are
not joyned together, although both be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the extremity of the Pancreas almoſt in
the ſame Longitude and Magnitude. A two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Ductus is commonly found in Pheaſants,
Peacocks, Geeſe, Ducks, and other Animals,
eſpecially of the number of Fowls.</p>
            <p>The threefold Ductus, for the moſt part is in
Cocks, Hens, Pigeons and Magpyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When
the Ductus Pancreaticus is ſingle, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
joyned with the Ductus Biliarius about
it's Inſertion into the Inteſtinum, Duodenum,
in Men and Fiſhes, as we have above declared;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64159:21"/>
as alſo in Cats, in which once we found by the
ſide of the Gall-bladder, another little whitiſh
Veſſel towards which the Pancreas in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
manner extending it ſelf, which being
lightly compreſſed, there flowed a certain Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Ductus Pancreaticus, like to the
Juyce thereof, both in colour and ſubſtance:
But the Bile in the ſame Cat retained both it's
natural ſubſtance and colour, ſo that nothing
ſeem'd to be changed which related to it's natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The Ductus Pancreaticus, and the Ductus
Biliarius are not joyned together, but enter the
Inteſtine in divers places in Hogs, Calves, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and Hares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Ductus Pancreaticus is twofold,
or threefold, ſometimes only one of them is
joyned with the Ductus Biliarius, as is evident
in Pyes, and ſome other Birds, Sometimes two,
as appears in Peacocks, Geeſe, Ducks, Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants;
and Pigeons, in which now and then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one is joyned to the Ductus Biliarius: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
all three being joyned therewith do paſs
into the Inteſtine, as we have ſometimes obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in Hens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing we have already ſufficiently ſpoken of
it's Inſertion into the Inteſtine, it alſo remains
for us to ſpeak ſomething concerning the place
of Inſertion, as more nearly appertaining to our
buſineſs. The <hi>Pancreatick Juyce</hi> doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
diſcharge it ſelf into the Stomach in
Barbils and Carps; but in other Creatures (for
as much as we have obſerved) it diſchargeth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64159:22"/>
it ſelf into the Inteſtines, and that in divers
places; for in Men it is performed about four
Fingers breadth, under the Pylorus, and in Birds
about eight Fingers breadth, but in Hares and
Conies, the breadth of fifteen or ſixteen Fingers
below the Pylorus.</p>
            <p>Here we would diligently note, that as often
as we name the Ductus Biliarius, we always
thereby underſtand the Cyſticus and Hepaticus;
becauſe theſe two are always joyned together
about the end, only in Pigeons excepted, which
want the Gall-bladder, and furthermore, are
ſaid to have no Gall; nevertheleſs, they have
uſually a threefold Ductus Biliarius, one of
which enters immediately under the Pylorus,
the other two make their entrance into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
at a lower diſtance. Where thoſe Ducts
enter the Inteſtines or the Ventricle, the inner
Tunicle of that part buncheth out, being
wrinckled like a Navel; for which cauſe it
more difficultly admits the Stile then the
Ductus Biliarius, which is broader and not ſo
lax.</p>
            <p>There is no value found throughout the
Ductus Pancreaticus, nor in it's Inſertion to
the Ductus Biliarius, as is raſhly and falſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by ſome. And theſe few Obſervations
may be ſufficient as concerning the Syſteme of
the Pancreas; and no man ought to think, who
hath obſerved ſo great a variety in it, and ſo
many notable ſports of Nature about it, that
the Pancreas is ſlightly made; for the Liver,
the Spleen, and ſeveral other Entrails of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64159:22"/>
alſo highly neceſſary, being different in
themſelves are found out by ſuch, who diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apply themſelves to the Diſſecting of ſundry
living Creatures; neither will they eaſily ſay it
is unprofitable, who have obſerved it to be

            <p>AS concerning the uſe of the Pancreas, it
was not ſo much accounted of in former
dayes as now it is; for <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> the reverend
light and deity of ſome Phyſicians gave the
Pancreas no Name, concerning which now a
dayes, ſo many Opinions are ſeen in Authors:
For ſome think it only to ſerve as a Pillow
placed underneath the Ventricle, or Stomach,
and for the diſtribution of the Veſſels. Others
that it received the Chyle from the Inteſtines:
Others imagined that it purged the Excrement
of the Chyle: Others that it were as the Bilar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſicle
of the Spleen: Others, that the thicker
and more unapt purgations of the Blood, were
purged into it by the ordinary courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Others, that this part was made for the
Reception of the Excrement of the Nerves.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64159:23"/>
Finally, others have publickly taught, that the
Humour in the Pancreas was not only uſeful, but
highly neceſſary to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>The firſt Opinion may be aſcribed to the
Ancients, that this part is as a pillow under
the Stomach, and ſerveth to diſtribute the Veins
and Arteries; as <hi>Veſalius,</hi> the moſt ingenious
<hi>Anatomiſt</hi> of his time ſufficiently affirmes, who
broke forth into theſe words about the Fabrick
of Mans body, <hi>Lib. 5. cap. 4. De omento.</hi> 
               <q>This
body in Man (ſpeaking of the Pancreas) is
more white than red, every where attended
by the branches of the Vena porta, Arteries
and Nerves, that their Complications may be
the more firm, being only ſupported by the
lower Membrane of the Omentum; that it
may be placed under the Stomach like a prop,
or pillow.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But this Opinion is no way probable; ſeeing
then the Pancreas in Birds, Fiſhes, and many
other living Creatures, in which it is otherwiſe
ſcituate then in Men would be uſeleſs; becauſe
in thoſe it is in no wiſe found to be ſo placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Ventricle, neither doth it admit a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to the Veſſels, unleſs in a very few. But
becauſe the Ancients never had a true knowledge
of the Glandules, we muſt not blame them for
not delivering to us the true Uſe of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Opinion is attributed to <hi>Baccius</hi>
and <hi>Folius,</hi> both which ſharply maintained, that
the Chylus paſſeth from the Inteſtines to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and Spleen, through the Ductus Pancreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64159:23"/>
The contrary of which is as clear as the
Meridian Sun: Seeing that nothing is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Gutts into this Ductus, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Juyce ſent forth by it ſelf to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines.</p>
            <p>The third Opinion is aſcribed to <hi>Johan.
Veſlingius;</hi> becauſe in his Syſteme of <hi>Anatomy,</hi>
chap. 4. he thus ſpeaketh of the Pancreas: <q>The
uſe of this Ductus is not obſcure, for ſeeing it
hath acertain Juyce not much unlike to the
Bile, it is manifeſt that ſuch an Excrement is
ſeparated from the Chylus by a further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
and being conveyed into this Veſſel, is
thence emitted into the Duodenum.</q> 
               <hi>Aſellius,
Riolanus</hi> and others favour this Opinion; but
Experience contradicts it, and manifeſtly
ſheweth, that the Humour contained in the
Pancreas is never really in it ſelf bitter, and
therefore in no wiſe to be compared with the
Bile.</p>
            <p>If at any time it happens that the Probe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put into this Ductus be yellow, every one
will eaſily believe, that this is not occaſioned by
the Humour contained in the Pancreas, but
from the Bile, as well flowing from the Ductus
Cyſticus, as the Hepaticus immediately into
the Inteſtine; eſpecially if he conſider that the
Stylus is ſpotted by the Bile, before it paſſeth
from the Inteſtine to the Ductus Pancreaticus;
and again, that it paſſeth through the Bile
whilſt it is drawn out: For the Ductus Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,
and the Ductus Biliarius in Men perforate
the Inteſtine in the ſame place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:64159:24"/>
And although the moſt famous <hi>D. Van. Horne,</hi>
in a Bilious Diarhaea ſaw that Veſſel full of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
we ſay it was Preternatural, in as much as
the Bile, which Copiouſly adhered to the end
of the Ductus (as is wont to happen in a Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haea)
was thrown into the Cavity thereof,
by the Agitation of that dead Body: Alſo that
the excrement of the further Elaboration or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of the Chylus, is not ſent into this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
is manifeſt, in regard the ſame is witneſſed
by Occular Inſpection. In ſome Animals, that
Glandulous Body doth not at all touch the
Milky Veſſels; and in others it only paſſeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and in no wiſe enters their Subſtance; as
alſo becauſe they are eaſily ſeparated from the
Pancreas, without the Effuſion of any Chyle,
as we have formerly demonſtrated in Dogs,
Cats, and other Animals.</p>
            <p>Therefore we do not ſee upon what ground
they might maintain the further Concoction
of the Chylus to be celebrated in it, unleſs
they following the Opinion of <hi>Aſellius,</hi> would
take this Glandulous body for the Middle
Glandule of the Mefentery, into which the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae
Lacteae are altogether immerſed. The
fourth Opinion is of <hi>Bartholinus,</hi> as is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apparent from his Anatomy <hi>Chap. 13. De
Pancreate;</hi> where he thinks the Bile to be
purged Naturally by its Ductus, and will have
it to be the Bilar-Veſicle or Gall-Bladder of the
Spleen; ſo that the ſame uſe which the other
affords to the Liver, he believes that this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
to the Spleen: Which Opinion (by the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64159:24"/>
leave of ſo great a man) Anatomy in our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeems to confute: Seeing the Ductus
Pancreaticus paſſeth not to the Spleen;
neither are there any other Veſſels, which
do convey any thing from the Spleen to
it: For, there are found only two kinds of
Veſſels, which carry any thing back from the
Spleen, <hi>viz.</hi> The Veines and Lymphatick Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels:
But the Veines carry back the Blood to
the Liver, and the Complication of the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticks
carrying from the Spleen, do not in
like manner go to the Pancreas, but to the great
Receptacle of the Chyle; ſo that nothing can
be diſcharged out of the Spleen to the Pancre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
as our tryal in <hi>France</hi> hath ſufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted,
for their ſakes, who judging this to
be the beſt Opinion of moſt Authors, rejected
ours. We tyed a Dog upon a Table, as is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
by the firſt Figure of the third Table;
and when we had made a little Hole in the
left Hypocondrium, with our two fore-Fingers
we pull'd out the Spleen, whoſe Bloody Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
we tyed with two or three ſeveral Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and afterwards we cut the ſame in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
between the Spleen and the Bonds; and
when we had quite taken away the Spleen, we
drew together the Lips of the Wound with
ſmall threds in three or four ſeveral places,
whereby this Dog, in aſhort time, being well
cured, was returned to us, (at which we did
not at all wonder, becauſe we once had a Bitch,
which brought forth three or four Puppies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Extirpation of her Spleen); and two
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64159:25"/>
Mouths after the loſs of the Spleen in the ſame
Dog, we collected a notable quantity of the
Pancreatick Juice, which the Profeſſors of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degave,</hi>
the Doctors of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> D. <hi>Haverloo,</hi>
and D. <hi>de Maets,</hi> judged to be acidly Salt:
which being true, none as we think free from
Prejudice, will maintain that the Succus Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaticus
proceeds from the Spleen.</p>
            <p>Alſo, it is worthy to be noted, That thoſe
Dogs did no leſs greedily deſire, or better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
their Food after the Extirpation of the
Spleen, than before; from whence we, receding
from the Common Opinion, judge that no Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious
Matter or Humour is ſent from the
Spleen to the Stomach.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Opinion is attributed to the moſt
Famous <hi>Lindanus,</hi> ſeeing that in his <hi>Medic-Phyſiol.
c. 5. Art. 5. pag. 114.</hi> he ſaith, <q>When
I conſider what appertains to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, beſides the
ſtructure of the Pancreas; how many Diſeaſes
Practiſe takes notiee of in it, I cannot doubt but
that the thicker, and more uſeleſs Purgations of
the Blood, are thrown out into it, by the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Law of Nature; ſo as they may be corrected
by the Spleen: and alſo by an Extraordinary:
all the Melancholy which either an Intemperate
Diet, or Diſeaſe hath bred. The Ductus it ſelf
gives us cauſe to believe, That they are both car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
to the Intestines; and Curation teacheth the
ſame by the Medicines often required.</q> And this
Opinion ſeems alſo to us to be contrary to the
Truth, ſeeing that the Pancreatick Juice, as
often as it hath been truly collected by us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
appeared Limpid like Wine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:64159:25"/>
But what we ſhall ſay concerning the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious
Humour, will ſufficiently appear by
the following Article, and alſo by thoſe things
which ſhall be ſpoken of preſently after. The
Sixth Opinion is manifeſt enough from <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
Treatiſe of the Glandules, <hi>Chap. XIII.</hi>
whilſt he writes. <q>Therefore I think that this
Glandule (as likewiſe all others) do miniſter to
the Nerves, and that it receives ſome of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities
of the Nerves, of the Sixth Paire, with the
little Branches of the Spinal Marrow, in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
folding of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitings; and by its own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Veſſel carries it to the Inteſtines.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But ſeeing that the Nerves are deſigned to
carry Animal Spirits, we do not underſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what ground the induſtrious Anatomiſt will
hold, that the Excrementitious humour is
carryed through them, and wherefore he will
affirm that it is rather carryed into the Pancreas
than into the Spleen, or other parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
to which Nerves of the ſame Original do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
            <p>Truly the Pancreas is too far from the Brain
to receive its Excrement; moreover, the
Nerves abhor all acrimony, ſo as to receive
any ſharper Juice: For which cauſe, we judge
this Opinion to ſtand upon too ſlight a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to be admitted for Truth; and ſo much
the leſs, ſeeing we could never perceive any
Cavity or Liquour in the Nerves, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all the diligence we could uſe to this
purpoſe, the moſt accurate Microſcopes have
been of no uſe to us, for the diſcovery of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64159:26"/>
leaſt pores in them: We do not here ſpeak of
the diſtances which are like Pores, ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſmall Conveyances of the Nerves; but
of the Cavity it ſelf, of the little Pipes, by which
theſe Excrements ought to paſs. Furthermore,
it is proved by Ligatures that no remarkable
quantity of Humour is carryed by the Nerves,
in which there is not the leaſt Swelling, of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide the Ligature which we have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
nor yet by any other that we read
of.</p>
            <p>That which Chyrurgions cry out of the
dropping of the Nerves, we rather aſcribe to
the hurt of the Lymphatick Veſſels, being
nigh to the Nerves, than the hurt of the Nerves
themſelves; for which reaſon, that we might
have a more certain information, we have
ſometimes in Dogs, laid bare that notable Nerve
in the hinder-moſt part of the Legs, and cut it
croſs through the middle, and have put it into
a Vial, being freed from the Lymphatick Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
(as we uſe to do in collecting of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice), the neck of which was ſo
ſtraightned for this purpoſe, as that the Nerves
being cut aſunder, the Orifice might be well
cloſed by its thickneſs, that Spirits, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſubtile Matter paſſeth through the
Nerves, might not vaniſh into the Aire. We
fixed this Vial to the skin with the Nerve hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down into its Hollowneſs, hoping that if
any Liquor did paſs through the Nerves, we
ſhould by that means attain it, but in vain:
For, in the ſpace of four or five hours, we got
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64159:26"/>
not the leaſt drop; nor did we obſerve that the
Animal Spirits did adhere by Condenſation to
the ſides of the Glaſs.</p>
            <p>Such Birds are to be catcht with more ſubtile
nets; which after they are taken, we will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
to break-faſt withal. Seeing therefore
little or no viſible matter is carried through the
Nerves, we pray the Propugners of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to tell us, Why Nature in the Pancreas
(as they will have it) hath only formed a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
to receive the Excrements of the Nerves,
which ſometimes exceed in Magnitude the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
Nerves themſelves, whoſe ſmall
Branches often touch the Pancreas. What ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains
to the word Excrement, whereby
they point out our Juice, we think it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for it, if they underſtand whatſoever
is ſeparated from the Blood, whether good or
evil; but it is in no reſpect agreeable to the
Pancreatick Juice, if by the word Excrement
they underſtand whatſoever is carryed from the
Blood to be unprofitable, for Reaſons hereafter
to be declared.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Opinion is aſſigned to the moſt
Famous <hi>Franciſcus de la Boe-ſylvius;</hi> who thinks
nothing is carryed from the Inteſtines to the
Pancreas, by this Ductus; nor any ſecret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Excrement by the ſame to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines;
but a commendable Humour prepared
therein of Blood, and Animal Spirits; and ſo
conveyed to the Inteſtine, and permixed with
the Alement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:64159:27"/>
And in regard he knew that nothing was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
to the Inteſtines, but what was firſt ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
into the Stomach, and by that driven out
again through the Pilorus, or is ſent through
the Bilar, or Pancreatick Ductus; and he
moreover conſidering, not only in intermitting
Feavours, that the ſick were alwayes troubled
with various pains in their Loynes, by Cold,
Heat, Yawnings, Reachings, and Vomitings,
as well of inſipid Phlegm, and ſometimes acid,
as of Choler; ſometimes bitter, ſometimes
acid and bitter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alſo in other diſeaſes
proceeding from hence to the Hypocondriack
Affection. As for example, in the Scurvey,
the Diſeaſe called the Suffocation of the
Womb, the <hi>Chollerico Paſſio,</hi> pains of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and conſequently from hence in the Ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Mouths, or Thruſhes of Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Belchings, and Acid Humours do ariſe, he
concluded (although he never ſaw the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice, as he ingenuouſly confeſſeth,
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 37. of the uſe of the Spleen and Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules)
that the Pancreatick Juice, in its own
Nature was Subacid, in an eſpecial manner
tempered by the animal Spirits.</p>
            <p>For, he judged that the Bile which is bitter
and contrary to Acidity, could not be the cauſe
of an acid Humour; and therefore he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
that Spittle, alwayes inſipid in ſound
men; and oftentimes ſo acid, and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſharp in the ſick, came not from the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:64159:27"/>
And becauſe we heard that moſt Learned man
often teaching theſe and the like things, and
did ſee the ſame confirm'd by a happy practiſe
in the Hoſpital; his opinion ſo pleaſed us,
that we never frequented his Meetings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publick or private, without great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of mind; in which, being excited to
find out the further truth of the matter, by
the ſame worthy perſon and his Diſciples, we
have undertook the work; and although we
could not once deſpair of a happy ſucceſs; in
proceſs of time, God favouring our Enterprize
and Deſires, in the Year 1662. found out the
way of Collecting the Pancreatick Juice;
which, by way of Hiſtory, as it ſhall conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently

            <head>CHAP. III. In what manner the Pancreatick Juice
was found out.</head>
            <p>THE Firſt Experiment by which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to collect the Pancreatick Juice
in a living Dog, was a Ligature with which we
tied the upper-part of the Pancreas, together
with the thin Gut; for, by that means, we
hoped that after ſome Hours we ſhould have
found the Pancreatick Duct ſwell'd with Juice,
but in vain: which ſeemed to our Judgment
to happen by reaſon that the Motion of the
Blood being hindered to the Pancreas, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of the Juice from it was prevented al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
            <p>The Second Experiment was alſo by a Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
made about the Inſertion of the Ductus
into the Inteſtinum Duodenum, but alſo in vain.
The Reaſon perhaps was the Glandules of the
Pancreas being hurt, by whoſe Ductus all the
Pancreatick Juice might the more eaſilier have
flown out, by reaſon that neither in the great
Ductus nor in the lateral branches is there any
values found.</p>
            <p>The Third Experiment was by two boards or
planks, higher in the middle, than at the ends,
applyed and ſtraightly bound to the Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64159:28"/>
at the ingreſs of the Pancreatick Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus;
from whence, after ſome hours, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen
being opened again, which before had
been lightly ſtitched up, we found the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Ductus ſwelled with a clear and limpid
Juice; nevertheleſs, we could not conveniently
either take it out, or taſt it. By which ſucceſs
we being animated the more, reſolved a fourth
Tryal, by opening the Inteſtinum Duodenum,
according to the Longitude thereof; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
applying a little veſſel to the Orifice of
the Ductus Pancreaticus, as the firſt Figure of
the following Table <hi>A.</hi> demonſtrates; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by ſtraightly tying the ſaid Inteſtine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the neck of the veſſel: ſo that its Orifice
was diametrically oppoſite to the end of the
Ductus Pancreaticus, not doubting but by this
means we ſhould gather a rare quantity of the
Pancreatick Juice; but this alſo in vain: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, becauſe the air included within the
veſſel, denyed entrance to the Pancreatick Juice,
lightly touching it. Therefore we reſolved to
try a Fifth Experiment, with a little veſſel ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perforated, as the firſt Figure of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Table ſhews under the letter <hi>B.</hi> By which
advantage, in the ſpace of five hours, we col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
ſo great a quantity of Liquor, that the
veſſel was almoſt half full; whoſe contained
Liquor was of a bitter reliſh, and of a yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
colour; which we judged to happen,
becauſe the bile, (by reaſon the Inteſtine was
not firſt cleanſed) was intermixed with the
Succus Pancreaticus. Wherefore, after many
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64159:29"/>
and tireſome vexations of mind, we came to
a Sixth Experiment; which ſeeing it in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
ſufficiently anſwered our Expectations;
here wee will add its exact deſcription for the
ſake of the Curious, that they may give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to their proper ſenſes, which in others words
moſt eaſily leſſen the Credit.</p>
            <p>A little Veſſel, with a longer neck, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
as the II. Table under the letter <hi>A.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents;
in the upper part of whoſe Belly a
little hole was pierced <hi>B.;</hi> by which the air
included in it, gave way to the Pancreatick
Juice.</p>
            <p>Let the neck of the Veſſel be encompaſſed
with a little cord <hi>C.;</hi> and ſeverall Rings of
Iron, thereunto affixed, or any other conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
thing; by the advantage of which, the
Inteſtine may the more eaſily be ſtretched
up.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, you muſt take a wild Ducks
quill <hi>D.</hi> becauſe that kind of bird hath longer
and thinner than all others, which muſt be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
about the larger part thereof with Paper,
a little beſmeared with boiled Starch, that the
Orifice of the veſſel <hi>H.</hi> whilſt it is included
in it, may be moſt exactly cloſed: leſt either
the Bile or Blood, penetrating by the ſides of
the quill, defile the Juice collected, or to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
in the Veſſel.</p>
            <p>This quill is affixed to the Veſſel, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the ſtraightneſs of the Pancreatick Duct,
which will not admit the neck of the Veſſel.
Preſently you muſt take a little tap or ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64159:29"/>
made of ſoft Wood, and of ſuch thickneſs
that it may fill up the narrower Orifice <hi>G.</hi>
which with the Alligated thred <hi>K.</hi> by the help
of the Style may be ſo far protruded through
the larger part of the quill <hi>F.</hi> that a little there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may remain in the larger part of the quill <hi>G.</hi>
and there may ſtick ſo faſt, that it may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of its own accord into the Ductus Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaticus:
becauſe then the Pituitous or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miculous
cruſted matter, of the Inteſtines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
adhering about the end of the Ductus
being moved, would eaſily cauſe it to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed;
which need not be feared, if the ſtopple
remain in the quill.</p>
            <p>But the Tap is not ſo ſtrongly to be forced
into the Quill, but that by the help of the
thred it may eaſily be retracted. You have all

let the Style be thruſt under the Larynx, the

Alſo, How it is Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</head>
            <p>HAving related the Inſtruments with their

may ſee that we may eaſily come to a more
intimate knowledge of the Pancreatick Juice,
by obſerving not only the qualities thereof, but
alſo the Quantity which at all hours do flow to
the Inteſtinum Duodenum.</p>
            <p>The Qualities of the Pancreatick Juice ſo
collected, both Viſible and Tactable, ſuch as
we have frequently obſerved them, we ſhall
here ſet down for the ſake of thoſe who deſire

            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:64159:33"/>
As often as we have rightly collected the
Pancreatick Juice, we have found it like clear
Fountain Water, with ſome-thing of Viſcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but not without the aſſociating of Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
Spirits. The Qualities thereof are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
to the taſt; not alwayes in the ſame
manner in themſelves, which denote thoſe
Functions depending upon it, not ſeldome to
be vitiated, and the ſame is evinced by our
Experience; For, we ſometimes have found
it moſt gratefully acid, ſometimes almoſt inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
ſometimes auſtere, often times ſalt, but
moſt often acidly ſalt.</p>
            <p>Of this our Experience, we cite an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Witneſs, the moſt excellent <hi>D. Vander
Sprongh,</hi> with the moſt famous Profeſſor <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
as alſo many others who have ſometimes
been Fellowes of our practical Colledge, who
in their preſence judged with us, that in ſuch a
Collection it were both of an auſtere, and acidly
Salt Sapor.</p>
            <p>The notable Effect of the Auſterity thereof,
then alſo obſerved, we will hereafter declare.
Now having found out the Pancreatick Juice,
that we may clearly and diſtinctly ſubject the
Generation thereof to your Eyes, we will
propoſe a deſcription of all the Glandules, by
diſtinguiſhing them with the Famous D. <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
into Conglobated and Conglomerated.
We call them conglobated, which are Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
as it were, from one continued Subſtance,
having an equal Superifices; ſuch as in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery,
Neck, Shares, and other parts of the
Body, many are found.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:64159:34"/>
But we call thoſe Conglomerated, which
riſe from many leſſer Glandules joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
ſuch are the Pancreas, Salival Ducts,
and many others in the Fauces, Noſtrils; yea
they conſtitute the Thyme it ſelf, or Glandule,
under the Channel bone, concerning which we
are willing here to ſay ſomewhat of what we
have ſome years ſince obſerved, whilſt we were
Converſant about the diſſecting of Calves (in
which this Glandule was found very great, and
that which is moſt worthy of note, no leſs in
Calves, than in other Animals, That it is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
diminiſhed after the Birth) that this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Ductus was found repleat with a Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
humor, which we ſometime proſecuted;
but becauſe, upon the laying open thereof, the
Liquor did continually Flow out, the intire
Ductus vaniſhed away before we could enter its
end: For which reaſon, we were conſtrained to
defer its further Enquiry till another occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>That this Diſtinction of the Glandules is
not Fained but Real, the following Experiment
doth prove. As well the Conglomerated as
the Conglobated are cloathed with a Coat
or Membrane; which being taken away, and
a certain Liquor immitted, as well through
the Ductus Pancreaticus, as through the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livales;
alſo by the Arteries of all the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules,
by the help of a Syringe with divers
little pipes faſtned to the ſame, contrived by
us, and propoſed in our Treatiſe concerning
the Organs of men; as ſubſervient to many
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64159:34"/>
things in Generation; and there will be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by a moſt Elegant Spectacle Conglome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Glandules, receding or parting by courſe
from themſelves; eſpecially if from hence the
little Membranes, whereby they are connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
be cut with a Knife: Which, in no wiſe,
is to be expected from the Conglobated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules,
notwithſtanding the greateſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Glandules differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
in relation to their Subſtance: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in the ordinary courſe of Nature, we
have found a Cavity in the middle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated
Glandules; but not in the Conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated;
which, by that great Expounder
of Nature, and by an indiſſoluble bond of
Friendſhip endeared to us, <hi>Nicholas Stenon,</hi>
we have ſeen noted; and obſerved; who in his
Anatomical Obſervations concerning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated
Glandules, ſaith:</p>
            <q>For, outwardly the Conglobated Glandules are
hollow not inwardly like a Baſon, yet if you right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enter the Separation between the protuberating
Lips on every ſide, you ſhall find as it were a
Cleft or Chap, by which go forth certain Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick
Roots returning with the Membrane.</q>
            <p>Their Subſtances differ not only among
themſelves by way of Connexion, as they are
Conglobated and Conglomerated, but alſo in
the peculiar Veſſels; for, the Conglobated are
given to the Lymphatick Veſſels, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and at the Common Ductus Thoraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
or the Superior Folding thereof, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64159:35"/>
Conſpicuous in Dogs, drive out a Liquor
prepared in themſelves, or received from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But the Conglomerated diſpoſe their
Liquour into peculiar Cavities, as the Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
into the Mouth, the Pancreas into the Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum,
and ſo of others.</p>
            <p>That the Motion of the Lympha is ſuch, as
we have even now aſſerted, and not from
the Centre to the Circumference, is proved
by the Values in the Lymphatick Veſſels, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-where
exiſting, as may be ſeen in a little
Treatiſe, concerning the Values of the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick
Veſſels, by the moſt Famous, and our
entire Friend, Dr. <hi>Rayſch,</hi> Anatomyſt of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi>
Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1665. by whoſe Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable
Dilligence, at the ſame time, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
that Veſſel which he calleth the Bronchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Artery, by reaſon that it accompanyeth the
Widenings of the Branches of the ſharp Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
through the whole Subſtance of the
Lungs; as may be ſeen by the Figure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
inſerted into his little Book, aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and worthily Communicated to us.</p>
            <p>Seeing that the Duct's, and alſo the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the Glandules are diverſe, it is
worthy our enquiry, Whether the Humour,
obſerved in all the Glandules, be of the ſame,
or a different Quality? But we ſhall anſwer,
That the ſame, or like Humour is ſeparated in
all the Glandules, of a diverſe Species; for one
Liquor is depoſed in the Conglobated, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Conglomerated: For, that which is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
in the Conglobated is all of the ſame
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64159:35"/>
Nature: which is proved, not only by the
Subſtance of the ſame Glandules, every where
Conſimilar, but alſo by the wayes by which they
are all diſtburdened; for as much, as further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to us, ending in the Ductus Thoracicus.
Moreover, it is further Demonſtrable, by the
Liquor of the Conglobated Glandules, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
found more Saltiſh, and leſs Acid in
them, than in the Conglomerated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules
of the Pancreas; nevertheleſs more
of Acidity, and Salſitude, than that of the
Conglomerated Salivales. From whence it is
manifeſt, that a Liquor is ſeparated from the
Conglomerated Glandules of the Salivales, and
Pancreas not alike in all its Qualities, as we have
aſſerted even now to be done in the Congloba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
in which matter, that we might be more
certain, at the ſame time, and to the ſame Animal,
we applyed the Inſtrument depicted <hi>Tab.</hi> II.
<hi>Fig.</hi> II. both to the Ductus Pancreaticus, and
to the upper Salivary Duct, as is exhibited
<hi>Tab.</hi> III. <hi>Fig.</hi> II. But we found a notable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of the aforeſaid Liquors; For, the
Salival is either Temperate or Inſipid; but the
Succus Pancreaticus is acidly Salt, or ſuch like,
for the moſt part, as we have deſcribed it in the
former Chapter.</p>
            <p>Seeing there is a diverſe Juice of diverſe
Glandules, it deſerves our enquiry, What uſe
every one may have, and whether it be proſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
or unneceſſary? That is, Whether it
bringeth any Commodity to the Body? Or,
Whether it be ſuch as is in no wiſe Subſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64159:36"/>
to the Oeconomy of the Humane Fabrick?
It will not be hard to ſatisfie this difficulty, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
if we make a more exact Scrutiny in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Motion of thoſe Liquors; for ſeeing
that all the Liquor of the Conglobated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules,
is inſerted into the Ductus Thoracicus,
and there permixed with the Chyle, the chief
part of Aliments, and with the ſame may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and be purged into the Jugular Veine,
or left Subclavian Veſſel; from whence, being
confuſed with the deſcending Blood, neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paſſeth through the right Ear of the Heart,
into its right Ventricle. We do not ſee by
what name it may be called Excrementitious
and unprofitable; becauſe the Excrementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Humours are ſeparated from the Blood:
ſo that, according to the Order of Nature, they
may not any more be commixed therewith;
but are wholly ſeparated from the Body;
which is clearly ſeen in the Urine; the
which, being ſeparated from the maſſe of
Blood in the Reines, and thence deduced
through the Ureters into the Bladder: from
whence, after ſome ſtay, according to the
Dictate of the Will, by the Urinary paſſage it
is excluded from the Body; ſo that it can never
again return.</p>
            <p>So, the Juice of the Conglomerated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules,
is effuſed through particular Ducts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
divers Cavities of the Body, where it may
be mingled with other Humours neceſſary for
Nouriſhment, and is leaſt of all to be eſteemed
for Excrementitious, or Unprofitable. Which
that it may likewiſe, be made known, in like
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64159:36"/>
manner, as we have proſecuted the Liquor of
the Conglobated Glandules; ſo alſo, we ſhall
follow that of the Conglomerated flowing from
the Salivales, and the Pancreas.</p>
            <p>The Spittle is ſeparated from the Blood, in
the Maxillary Glandules, as well the Superiour
as the Inferiour, and is carryed by the ſaid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lival

where it may be mixed with the aſſumed Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or out of the time of the Aliments Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
is continually ſwallowed; the which
we never better conſider, than whilſt we hold
ſomthing in our Mouth; the which, becauſe
of the cleanneſs of the place, in which we are, we
will not ſpit out, neither dare we ſwallow it
down; for the Mouth is very quickly fill'd with
Spittle.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Spittle, although without our
knowledge, is continually ſwallowed, and
mingled, and confuſed in the ſtomack with
the Aliment, which truly would be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent,
if the ſame were unprofitable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious.</p>
            <p>The Pancreatick Juice is e<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>uſed in the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules
of the pancreas, after the ſame manner
as the Spittle in the ſalivales, being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſeparated in a Man about the breadth of
four fingers under the Pylorus into the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinum
duodenum,</hi> and there is mixed with
the Aliments already paſſed the fermentation
of the ſtomack, and with the ſame is driven
downwards by the periſtaltick motion of the
Gutts; in which propulſion the greateſt part
thereof, together with the more pure and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64159:37"/>
liquid part of the Aliment is carried to the
<hi>venae Lacteae,</hi> and thence to the Ciſtern; from
thence it penetrates through the <hi>Ductus Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racicus</hi>
to the ſubclavian Vein, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the right Ventricle of the Heart;
which indeed would happen againſt reaſon, if
the ſaid humours were Excrementitious, and
unprofitable to the oeconomy of the body of
Man.</p>
            <p>To this Opinion, beſides <hi>Sylvius,</hi> agrees <hi>Godofri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
Moebius,</hi> who in his Phyſiological foundations
of Medicine, <hi>c.</hi> 12. concerning the uſe of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,
thus ſpeaketh: <q>But this Juice (namely
the Pancreatick) ſeeing that it may be admixed
with the Chyle, together with the Bile in the
Duodenum, without all doubt it further helps
and promotes its Fermentation: For, if the
pure purged Excrement ſhould be of no uſe,
Nature would have derived that Channel to
the lower Inteſtines, wherein hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Excrements are lodged, not to the
Superiour, where the Chyle begun in the
Stomach, ought to be perfected.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing than that by Reaſons and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
already ſufficiently inferd, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
That the Humours, as well of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated,
as the Conglomerated Glandules,
are not Excrementitious. We think fit, before
we proceed any further, to propoſe their Way
or Mode of Generation.</p>
            <p>It hath been, in times paſt, believed by the
Antients, (to ſay nothing concerning Faulties,
and other their Figments) that the Glandules
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64159:37"/>
did imbile Superfluous Humidities, like unto
Sponges. But to the Neotericks, it ſeemed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a more attentive Examination of their
Structure, that this Simillitude was greatly
wide of the Truth; by reaſon the Glandules
are not every where open to the Pores, but are
ſufficiently cloathed on all ſides with a ſtrong
Membrane; &amp; therefore they think that nothing
entreth into the Glandules, unleſs it be thither
propelled by the Arteries and Nerves.</p>
            <p>But the Arteries carry the Humours of every
kind to the Glandules, under the Colour of
Blood; every of which, by reaſon of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Diſpoſition of the Pores, even as Seives
do admit ſuch Particles of the Humours, which
in reſpect of their Magnitude, and Figure,
have the greateſt Analogy, with the little
Pores; in the mean while excluding others,
which have with them a leſſer Simillitude;
which therefore by the name of Blood, are
conſtrained to return to the Heart; from
whence, being more exalted in their paſſage,
they are preſently driven indiſcriminately, by
the Pulſifick force thereof, to the Glandules,
and other parts of the Body; but, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Particles fitted to the Generation
of the Pancreatick Juice, are no where more
eaſily ſeparated than in the Pancreas, no
where more ſerous than in the Reins, no where
more commodiouſly Bilious than in the Liver;
&amp; ſo of the reſt: Becauſe there are ſome parts of
the Body which do more commodiouſly receive
this or that Humour into the Pores than others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64159:38"/>
Nature hath therefore invented a ſingular
Artifice, whereby it doth ſo happily abſolve ſo
diverſe a work, in diverſe parts of Animals;
which they do leſs admire, who diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
with themſelves, that the like thing doth
neceſſarily happen in Plants: For, we ſee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Plants, poſited in the ſame Sand, each to
admit a peculiar Juice; which, nevertheleſs, is
ſo Homo-geneous, that it may contain in it
ſelf diverſe Particles, as we ſee in Trees, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by the Induſtry of Gardeners, divers
Fruits do grow; whereas alſo divers Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
or Twigs are grafted into the ſame Stock;
which by reaſon of the different Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Pores, they admit this, and not
that part of the Liquor or Sap, others being
excluded, which have a leſſer Affinity with their
Pores.</p>
            <p>The which things being equally gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
we may inferre, that the matter fitted to
the generation of the Pancreatick Juice, is
ſeparated from the Blood by a certain diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the Pancreas; yet not ſo exactly,
but that it may bring divers other Particles with
it; as occular Inſpection doth aſcertain us to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the Reins; in which indeed primarily the
more Serous Particles of the blood, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Tranſcolation, are ſeparated from its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Maſſe; yet, nevertheleſs, we note thoſe
many Saline, Bilious, and other Humours;
which are, as it were, ſnatcht away therewith,
by reaſon of them or thoſe Particles largely
abounding in the Body; in like manner as Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64159:38"/>
doth Demonſtrate all theſe things
to our Eyes, as clear as the Meridian
Light.</p>
            <p>The Animal Spirits joyne themſelves to the
Succus Pancreaticus by a continual Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
continually ſeparated from the Blood,
with which, being joyn'd together by an Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Connexion, they run into the Inteſtinum
Duodenum. From whence it is Conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that our Pancreatick Juice is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but compounded of divers; this eſpecially,
Acid, Aqueous, Saline, and other Particles
therein found, adjoyned to the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
by whoſe Volatile Sweetneſſe the force
of Acids is reſtrained; whence it happens, that
the Pancreatick Juice is Naturally Acidly-Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.</p>
            <p>Some may ſay, after what manner may
the Pancreatick Juice be Acidly Temperate,
ſeeing that in the Precedent Chapter we
have ſaid, that it is very often Acidly-ſalt,
and naturally may be ſaid to be ſuch
as alwayes, or for the moſt part, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
to be? But, we ſhall Anſwer, That
perhaps it ſo happeneth in Dogs onely;
becauſe they ought to digeſt Bones, and other
things of a harder Concoction, but in Men
we judge there is no ſuch Salſitude exiſtant
or required; Becauſe, in Men, that which
is Vomited, is either Inſipid, or Bitter, or
Acid, very rarely, and perhaps never Acid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Salt; the which undoubtedly would happen
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64159:39"/>
if their Pancreatick Juice were Naturally
ſuch.</p>
            <p>But being granted, that in men, likewiſe
as in Dogs, it may naturally be Acidly Salt,
Whether then will our Hypotheſis run? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whither:
Becauſe a Salſitude joyned to it, as
hereafter ſhall be declared, doth no way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede
its primary Operation.</p>

            <p>ALL theſe things premiſed, deſervedly, who
can ask what the Juyce of the Glandules
may perform in the bodies of Animals? To
whom we ſhall anſwer, that the juyce of all the
Conglobated is ſubſervient to Sanguification,
but the liquor of the Conglomerated is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to other uſes: For that which is generated in
the Maxillary Glandules, and other of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glomerated,
placed about the cavity of the
mouth, for the moſt part abſolveth the Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Aliments in the Stomach: And that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
which is generated or ſeparated in the
Conglomerated Glandules of the Pancreas,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64159:39"/>
ſeems to us to perform far more: Seeing that
Nature for the moſt part ſo wiſely diſpoſeth
matters, that one and the ſame thing may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to many.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the uſe thereof is not yet ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known, we ſhall examine what is firſt effuſed
from it into the thin Intertine, and alſo happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in the ſame.</p>
            <p>There is a ſufficiently large quantity of this
Pancreatick juice continually brought to the
thin Gut (we remember there hath been col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
from one Dog, in the ſpace of ſeven
or eight hours, two Drachms, half an Ounce,
and from a Maſtive an intire Ounce) that it
may be continually lifted up, and fermented
with the Bile flowing from the ducts of the
Liver, to a double or tripple quantity (for
as much as we could obſerve by the benefit
of an inſtrument applied to their paſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the inteſtine in Doggs) being therein car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with a certain ſtrugling motion.</p>
            <p>That this Efferveſcency is excited from the
acidity of the Pancreatick Juice, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the Bile abounding with a fixed and
volatile ſalt, we dare the more freely aſſert;
becauſe hitherto we have ſeen no example of
an acid ſpirit concurring with a lixiviate ſalt
to happen without an effeverſcency ſufficiently
manifeſt, ſo that all impediments were taken
away. That both ſalts are found in the Bile,
Chymiſtry that moſt excellent and famous
Medical inſtrument of truth doth prove; by
the benefit of which we can ſeparate a vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64159:40"/>
ſalt efferveſcing with an acid ſpirit, and
lixivious ſalt more manifeſtly abſolving the
ſame work. But that the Pancreatick Juice
containeth in it ſelf an acidity is manifeſt by
an experiment above-recited; the which, for
their ſakes who are lovers of truth, and whoſe
belief derogates not from their proper Senſes,
as in the Academies of diverſe Regions, we
have performed both publickly and privately,
we have declared, not again to be repeated:
and it is notably confirmed by an experiment
which the moſt accurate ſearcher of nature,
<hi>Floventius Schuyl,</hi> in his written Tractate for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Medicine <hi>pag.</hi> 94. deſcribed in theſe
Words:</p>
            <q>Moreover, I have opened the Abdomen of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Living Dog in the ſame Method, and in
the Inteſtinal Bilar Ductus, which is common
to the Cyſtic and Hepatic, by a Compreſſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
in ſuch manner as the Figure repreſents;
that the Pancreatick Juice alone might iſſue
forth, we collected in the ſpace of nigh three
Hours the Quantity of two Ounces of Acidly
Sour Juice; whoſe manifeſt Sourneſs was not only
proved by the Taſt, but alſo by the permixing it with
warm Milk; which was ſo Coagulated, that
thereby was formed as it were a Cheeſe, being a
manifeſt Experiment, that Acidity was altogether
prevalent in the ſame.</q>
            <p>Alſo, <hi>pag.</hi> 157. Writing concerning the
Pellicle or Bilar Pore of Horſes; <q>I, (<hi>ſaith he</hi>)
by a double Experience, have found that Pellicle,
firſt of all to be Repleniſhed with a Humour Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acid,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64159:40"/>
then with a Bilious Humour, with a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Acidity; into which, in like manner, a
Humour, a little Souriſh, did flow from the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas,
and from thence into the Inteſtinum Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is likewiſe concluded, That the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juice, in Men, hath an Acidity in it, not
onely from the like nature of all the Bowels
and Contents in Brutes and Men, but dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
alſo from other Experiments: To wit,
by ſowr Belchings, without the Aſſumption
of ſowr and acid things into the Stomach; and
in the Hypoconders forthwith ſtretched out,
or after Rumbling and Noiſe, firſt obſerved in
the Belly, preſently again breaking out through
the Mouth.</p>

of the Loynes, eſpecially after any heavy
Affliction of the mind, as anger, terror, Fears,
occaſioned by the acidity of the Pancreatick
Juice, flowing into the thin Gut.</p>
            <p>If any one object in the Caſes now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Pancreatick Juice is evilly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
but that naturally in it ſelf it containeth
no Acidity, let him declare: Dr. <hi>Paiſenius,</hi>
a man joyn'd to us in peculiar Friendſhip, ſaith,
in his Diſputation concerning the Vices of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<q>How may that Juice Preternaturally wax
foure, if in the ſame, the Seeds of Acidity, as
we may ſo call them, were not Prae-exiſtent.</q> If we
ſtand by Authorities, no doubt but the Cauſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64159:41"/>
will fall: For, <hi>Hippocrates de Veteri Med.</hi>
§. XXIV. againſt thoſe, openly teacheth, That
there is not only in man an Acidity, and that
mixed with other things, and therewith ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered,
that it is neither Conſpicuous nor
Hurtful to a man; but alſo ſubjoyneth §.
XXV. But where the Acidity ſhall be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
then it is Conſpicuous and Hurtful to
man. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth not ſay, That it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſen,
but ſeparated: Therefore it is preſent
in the Natural State, although Inconſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>Beſides <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth that Melancholy is ſo
made of the Blood, as Muſt is made of
Wine.</p>
            <p>But now with what Probabillity may we
ſay, That in Wine, Ale, Milk, and the like
Liquors, which left to themſelves, without the
Addition of any other matter, do grow ſoure;
that the acid parts were not before Exiſtent?
What hinders, but that the ſame thing may
alſo happen in men?</p>
            <p>Beſides the Reaſons and Authorities already
brought, we will add the following Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which after a wonderful manner doth
confirm the natural acidity of the Pancreatick
Juice in Men. In the Year 1666. whilſt we
were reſident in the Academy of <hi>Andegave,</hi> a
Shipman, about thirty years of Age; a man
of a good Habit of Body, and for as much as
we could underſtand by the Standers by, very
Healthful; in his little Veſſel, endeavouring to
paſſe under an old Bridge, ſtanding upon the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64159:41"/>
River <hi>Moene,</hi> with his Maſt erected, was by
the Bridge, unhappily thrown down, which,
falling upon the man, killed him; whoſe dead
Body was immediately brought to the Hoſpital,
where the ſame being as yet warm, was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Dr. <hi>Croſnier,</hi> the Chyrurgion of the
ſame Hoſpital, and our ſelf; in which we
collected the Succus Pancreaticus, which we
exhibited to diverſe curious Taſts, who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to be acid; and for our own part we freely
profeſs never to have found it more gratefully
acid in Dogs.</p>
            <p>Who is he, theſe things being rightly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that doubteth of the Efferveſcency happening
between the Pancreatick Juice, and the Bile
rightly Conſtituted? Yet, leſt it ſhould in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part ſeem deficient, we will ſet down, in
few words, thoſe Primary Objections and
Difficulties, both here and in other Countries
propoſed to us againſt this Efferveſcency; the
which being caſt off, doubts of leſſer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will be ready to fall of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
            <p>The firſt Difficulty is, That the Pancreatick
Juice, as often as it hath been found by us In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid,
hath not in the leaſt been able to raiſe an
Efferveſcency with the Bile in the thin Gut.
To this Objection we anſwer, That it doth not
follow, that the Pancreatick Juice, ſometimes
found by us Inſipid, ſhould, at that time,
have in it no Acidity. Concerning which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
let them conſult <hi>Galen De Simp. Med.
Fac.</hi> Lib. 3. Cap. 13, 14, 15. as alſo <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:64159:42"/>
in that place before alledged, ſaying,
<hi>That in many mixed things, there are Subſtances of
various Qualities by Act, in which, nevertheleſs,
thoſe Subſtances are not ſound.</hi> The ſame is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by daily Experience, whereby it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that diverſe Liquors are rendered inſipid,
whoſe Effects we allow to conſiſt, partly in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid,
partly in Lixivious parts; for example,
the Spirit of Salt, which is moſt ſharp, may
be ſo dulcified with Spirit of Wine, that no
acidity may be perceived in it; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it failes not to Efferveſce, if it be
permixed with a Lixivious Salt; ſo alſo, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
other things, which appear not acid, by
reaſon of the Acid Particles which are in them,
do excite Perceptible Efferveſcencies both to
the Sight and Touch. But we do not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
deny, but that the Pancreatick Juice may
be ſometimes generated ſo Sluggiſh, as that
it may ſcarcely, indeed not at all ferment with
the Bile; but we then judge it to be diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or Sick. Yea, that thoſe Animals in whom
it ſo happens, do ſometimes dye by reaſon of
the Non-contingent Efferveſcency: But
this doth not deſtroy the Natural Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
            <p>The Second Difficulty which hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to me, is, that ſeeing our Bile and Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice is diluted with the Chyle, they
cannot Efferveſce: But to this Objection we
ſhall anſwer; That Oyle of Vitriol, being
mingled with Pure water, doth ſtir up a greater
Efferveſcency with the fileings of Steele, than
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64159:42"/>
if it were mingled therwith alone without
Water; and which is yet more, if after the
ſaid Efferveſcency hath ceaſed, if freſh Water
be added to it, the Oyle of Vitriol, with the
Steele Duſt, will ferment again afreſh. But that
we might have an Experiment which might
come nearer to our buſineſs, we have taken
Cows Milk, as having a very great Affinity with
the Chyle, and have poured to it Spirit of
Vitriol, mingled with the Lixivious Salt of
Tartar, and the Efferveſcency was preſently
excited, which continued a great deal longer,
than if the Oyle of Vitriol, and Oyle of Tartar
per Deliquium, had been mingled without the
Milk.</p>
            <p>We judge that the long continuance of the
Efferveſcency, ought to be aſcribed to the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity
of the Milk, ſeeing that daily Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
teacheth us, that Milk, Honey, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, may be more, and longer rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
whilſt boyling, than Diſtilled Waters,
Spirits, and other the like things, not having a
Viſcidity.</p>
            <p>According to which, in the ſaid Experiment,
it is worthy of note, That the Efferveſcency
(perhaps by reaſon of the Coagulation of the
Milk) doth not ſo well happen, if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Vitriol be put to the Milk, before the
Oyle of Tartar per Deliquium: Hence
(with the ſafe Opinion of the more Learned)
a Reaſon ſeems to us to be ſought into; why
commonly, in all Animals, the Ductus Biliari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
either firſt, or with the Ductus Pancreaticus,
do enter into the Inteſtine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:64159:43"/>
From hence may be anſwered their Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who ſay, That in ſome Animals the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
between the Ductus Pancreaticus, and
the Ductus Biliatius is too great: It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that this Efferveſcency ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
happen immediately under the Pylorus;
but the Matter may be carryed ſome fingers
breadths further, where at length it may fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
namely, when the Pancreatick Juice,
with the Diluted Bile, is mixed with the
Chyle: becauſe thoſe Animals, in whom ſo
notable a Diſtance is found, have alwayes
(for as much as we have happened to ſee) very
long Inteſtines; as may be ſeen in Coines,
Hares, and very many other Animals. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
neither need it be feared, that our deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
Efferveſcency, by which the profitable
parts of the Aliment, are ſeparated from the
unprofitable, ſhould happen too ſlowly; ſeeing
that in thoſe Animals ſome one Paſſage or
Channel of the Inteſtines, may be over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
ſufficient to receive the profitable Particles
of the Chyle.</p>
            <p>The third Thing which we have obſerved is,
That the natural heat of our Hand would more
increaſe that Efferveſcency, than the artificial
Heat of Fire. After the ſame manner we read
in Chymical Books, That the Heat of Horſe
dung performs many things, which could not
be expected from our Artificial Fires, but with
the greateſt Difficulty.</p>
            <p>Which ſeeing it is ſo, no man ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
that we are not able to Demonſtrate the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64159:43"/>
Efferveſcency, between the Bile and the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice, without our Body, whilſt they
remain in their Temperate and Natural Eſtate;
becauſe neither artificial Fire, nor the natural
heat of our Hand, can ſtir up ſuch a heat as
we know to be excited in the Small Gut, by
reaſon of the Circumjacent Bowels, which are
moſt hot.</p>
            <p>But ſome perhaps, being little content with
theſe Reaſons, will ſay, That to ſee that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Efferveſcency, it behoveth to open a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Dog, ſeeing that as yet in him the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Heat is in its Vigour: the which ſeems to
carry ſomething of force with it, with thoſe
who conſider not that in a Preternatural Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the Body, we cannot know its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Operation; as alſo with thoſe who have
never moved their Hand to the Work; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thoſe things which happen in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,
cannot be ſeen, unleſs they be opened,
and many Veſſels muſt neceſſarily be diſſected
when they are opened, out of which flow
ſuch an abundance of Blood, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
(as we have often experienced) to ſee the
deſired Efferveſcency.</p>
            <p>Add, that the Succus Pancreaticus cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of a ruſhing Torrent haſten it
ſelf into the thin Inteſtine, becauſe this River
flowing as it were from ſo many Springs and
Rivolets, as the Pancreas is environed with
Glandules and little branches, doth by a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
courſe continually ſlide into its own Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel:
So that the cleanſed juyce being now ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64159:44"/>
with the blood, you cannot without a very
tedious delay collect a ſufficient quantity of the
Pancreatick Juyce to be fermented, and which
in the mean time will be ſo altered by the cold
Air, that it will be in vain to expect an Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency
perceptible to the ſight.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For it very much agrees with Vulgar Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
(ſaith the moſt learned <hi>Willis, Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citat.

42. 43. do moſt clearly ſhew Efferveſcencies to
be excited from the Ebullition of diſſimilar par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
or by Corroſion; alſo the Ebullition of
Hot water in a glaſs Sphere to be wonderfully
augmented after the Air is ſucked out, and that
there are ſome things which in a ſpace of time,
are intended in the Air to a great Vacuity,
whoſe action after the air is drawn out, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
extinguiſhed: So that without reaſon
they deſire that the Efferveſcency between the
Bile, and the Pancreatick Juyce ſhould be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
to the Eye without the Body: For it is
plainly ridiculous to be willing to ſee the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency
of thoſe Humours, and to impede
the Humours by which they are performed; or
not to admit of the preturnal conſtitution of
the Animal, and willing to ſee thoſe things
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64159:44"/>
which are performed in the Bowels of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
            <p>If their Pancreatick Juyce who deſire this
thing, were endued with ſuch an Acrimony as
nevertheleſs being deſtitute of Natural helps,
might ferment with the Bile to the Eye without
the Body; with how great pains would not
their bowels be tormented, if being helpt by
thoſe aids in the body, the Efferveſcency ſhould
be performed; doubtleſs they would not deſire
ſuch an aciditie, before they would ſubſcribe to
our ſo often commemorated Fermentation,
but in ſhort, would wiſh for themſelves ſuch
a Pancreatick Juyce, as we have above deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to raiſe up therein a Natural Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The third difficulty which hath been
propoſed to us againſt the Efferveſcency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Bile and the Pancreatick Juyce, is,
that the Pancreatick Juyce being acidly ſalt (as
it is ordinarily found in Dogs) ought not to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the Bile: Seeing that the acidite
thereof, by reaſon of the Salt therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
helping the innervated Liquor will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
            <p>But we may eaſily anſwer this Objection al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
by diſtinguiſhing Sea-Salts, Foſſile-Salts,
and others compounded of a Lixiviate-Salt,
and Acid-Spirit, from the pure Lixiviate Salts.
No man will ever deny, but that the laſt of
Acids doth loſe its Force and Energy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
hinders its Efferveſcency. But that
which appertaineth to the firſt, of whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64159:45"/>
we eſteem that to be which is in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Pancreaticus; (foraſmuch as we can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by the Taſt:) All men will eaſily grant
that that in no wiſe hindereth the Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
of thoſe things, eſpecially, which have
an acid Spirit; as for example, that of Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol,
in which was diſſolved Sea-Salt, mixed with
the Lixivious Salt of Tartar, or Oyle of Tartar
per Deliquium.</p>
            <p>Yea it is ſo far from diminiſhing the Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency,
that it exciteth a greater than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
would happen; as Sal Armoniack diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
in Oyle of Vitriol, ſo highly accuates
it, that it diſſolveth Gold, the which without
it could not be done. Hence perhaps it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to paſs, that Dogs, which devour Bones,
and other Aliments, of difficult Concoction;
which cannot be diſſolved by an acid Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
for, the moſt part have their Pancreatick
Juice acidly-Salt.</p>
            <p>Among thoſe things which we have aſſerted,
concerning the Pancreatick Juice inſipid, acid,
ſalt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is ſufficiently manifeſt, that the
diverſity obſerved therein, excludes not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity
thereof; neither deſtroyes its Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
which we have taught to be made
in the Thin Gut, without any Interruption.</p>
            <p>But we have ſometimes obſerved a pleaſant
Efferveſcency of the Bile, with an acid, in the
Bile of a Dog, cloſed up in a Glaſs Viall, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having poured on about a third part of
Spirit of Niter, and keeping it a while in the
warme Rayes of the Sun.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:64159:45"/>
But that we may come nearer to the matter,
we will declare the Experiments brought by
Dr. <hi>Schuylius,</hi> to demonſtrate the Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
betwen the Bile, and the Pancreatick
Juice, in the preſence of many Students;
in his Treatiſe <hi>Pro Veteri Med.</hi> pag. 88.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Therefore (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) the Abdomen of a Living
Dog being opened, I have bound the Duodenum,
not far from the Pylorus with a Ligament; and
alſo with another a little below the Inſertion of
the Ductus Pancreaticus: then left the Dog
to himſelf, his Abdomen being ſowed up. Three
Houres being clapſed, the Dog, as it ſeemed,
yet living; for he had onely loſt ſome few drops of
Blood: The Abdomen being opened, we found
the Space intercepted between the Ligatures,
vehemently diſtended; ſo that, it would alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
reſiſt the Compreſſion of the Fingers,
and threatned a Rupture. Neither did we find
the Gall Bladder leſs diſtended: Alſo that
that Intercepted Space of the Duodenum was
poſſeſſed, with an Intenſe, and burning heat;
in which making a little Wound with the Lancet,
the contained Wind, with the Humour, broke
forth with a bouncing Noiſe, alſo Vapours and
Exhalations; from whence a certain ſharp
ſtink did ſtrike all our Noſtrils, the which was
greater by the opening of the Inteſtine; ſo that,
none of the Students ſtanding by were able to
bear it; which was a manifeſt Argument not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the large quantity of the Bile, and Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juice, which had flown thither: But alſo of
the Efferveſcency, which had been in them Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64159:46"/>
not only to a Mediocrity or Gentleneſs, ſuch
as happens in Health, but Vehement: For, that
part of the Inteſtine was not only full, but alſo by
a certain Force and Fermentation much diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Neither could that part of the Duodenum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended,
have diſſipated the Wind, Humours, and
Exhalations, with ſo great a Force, unleſs by the
Efferveſcency or Agitation of the Particles of
thoſe contrary Humours. <hi>Qui cupit, Capiet.</hi> A
few dayes being paſt, I repeated the ſame Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Preſence of many Students: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſpace of two Houres, that Portion of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine,
did ſwell in like manner as before, but leſs
hot: But that ſwelling Portion of the Inteſtine,
which before I had bound, being opened, frothing
Bubbles broke forth with a noiſe; the which had
ſo diſtended that part of the Inteſtine, that no
man may further doubt of the Certainty of this
Efferveſcency.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. What this Efferveſcency is both in the
Sick, and in the Sound; and what
Benefit Accrews to the Body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</head>
            <p>SEeing then that it is more than ſufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
and granted by Reaſons and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
that there is an Efferveſcency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Bile and the Pancreatick Juice, in
the Thin Gutt, and that continually, we will
further enquire, what it is in the Sick, what
in the Sound, and what Utility it bringeth to
Humane Bodies.</p>
            <p>In the Sick, we often obſerve, That this
Efferveſcency, either by its Fretting, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Paines, or elſe by Heat or Cold, is
very troubleſome, as ſome Years ſince, we
knew in our dear Kinſman; who ſometimes,
for a whole week together, came himſelf to
us, to perceive a cold Ebullition in his Right
ſide, and that in the place where the Inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Duodenum is ſeated; and the Bile runs
together with the Pancreatick Juice; and that
afterwards, by the meanes of Medicaments,
meanly hot, to be changed into moſt hot, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
a Fortnight, and longer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:64159:47"/>
That both theſe Efferveſcencies, <hi>viz.</hi> Cold
and Hot, may be excited, is proved by the
Thermometry, moſt ingenuouſly contrived by
the Learned <hi>Swammerdammius,</hi> and depicted in
his Treatiſe of Reſpiration, <hi>Page</hi> 108. In the
depreſſed part of which Supream Sphear <hi>A.</hi> if
you mingle together Salt of Tartar, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Vitriol, an Efferveſcency will preſently
be excited; and ſuch indeed as will ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe,
or thicken the Air contained in that
Spheare, that the Water, contained in the
lower part of this Inſtrument <hi>B,</hi> may aſcend
upward: being a manifeſt Experiment of Cold,
produced by that Efferveſcency. But, on the
contrary, if you mingle Spirit of Tartar with the
Spirit of Vitriol, you ſhall obſerve, by the
Efferveſcency excited between them, that the
Water is depreſſed; and the more if with thoſe
Spirits, you conjyne the Oyle of Turpentine;
from whence no man, who is endowed with
the lighteſt Tincture of Philoſophy, but
will judge, that to proceed from the hot Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency,
rarifying the Air contained in that
Sphear.</p>
            <p>Therefore we judge, that in the Sound, that
Efferveſcency happens after a gentle manner,
becauſe then there is no Sence thereof: The
ſame thing is to be ſaid concerning the Motion
of the Heart, and beating of the Arteries;
the which, although they are Continual, are not
perceived by thoſe in Health; but when we are
evilly diſpoſed, they ſometimes manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in diverſe parts of the Body, eſpecially
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64159:47"/>
in Temples, the Pulſation of the Arteries is ſo
manifeſtly moleſted, as if they were contuſed by
ſome hard body. By the ſame Reaſon the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Heart, is ſometime ſo vehement, that as
it hath been obſerved by Practitioners, it might
in a manner be heard to their
Neighbour Houſes;<note place="margin">Surely this is an Hyperbole.</note> yea it hath
ſometimes broke the Ribs; as
in like manner, we have ſeen at
<hi>Leyden,</hi> in a Baker's Son, dwelling in the Fiſh-Market;
whoſe Ribs, by the Vehement Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation
of the Heart, or rather the Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Motion thereof, were Conſpicuouſly dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
outwards; from which Vehement Palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
it was freed in a ſhort time with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments,
preſcribed by Dr. <hi>Sylvius;</hi> yet
not ſo, but that the Ribs ſtill remained driven
outwards.</p>
            <p>But now if any ask unto what end and uſe
this Efferveſcency between the Bile and the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce, being naturally excited, doth
happen? We anſwer firſt of all, that it ſerves
to cut, and attenuate the over viſcous pituity
adhering to the ſides of the Gutts, left they
being ſtufft up, the pores of the <hi>Venae Lactea</hi>
ſhould be obſtructed, or a paſſage be denied to
the Pancreatick Juyce, and the Bile continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſliding into the Inteſtinum Duodenum, or alſo,
leſt by the too great abundance of Phlegme,
the ſence of the Inteſtines might be obtunded,
and their periſtaltick Motion either be diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or aboliſht, by help whereof, not only the
paſſages of the parts neceſſary for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64159:48"/>
of the body may be facillitated, but alſo the
more groſſer Foecies and unprofitable Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may the more commodiouſly be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
which uſe <hi>Gallen</hi> hath aſcribed to the Bile
alone, as not knowing the Pancreatick Juyce,
firſt by us diſcovered, nor the Efferveſcency
excited between it and the Bile: Therefore he
ſaith in <hi>Lib. 5. De uſu partium,</hi> cap. 4.</p>
            <q>
               <p> A
neceſſary Excrement (to wit Phlegme) of
this ſort, is to be found both in the Stomach
and in the Inteſtines, as we have elſewhere
demonſtrated: but that it may be generated,
both Anatomy, and thoſe Diſeaſes to which
men are daily ſubject from the abundance of
the ſuperfluities hereof do declare: The
Cure whereof is ſimple, to wit, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of thoſe things which have power
to divide, to cut and cleanſe viſcous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>For that cauſe therefore Nature hath from
the beginning provided a Defence for them,
that this Juyce being ſharp, might be cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and as it ought be altogether ſeparated
from the body, not into any Inteſtine near the
Anus; but into the firſt Inteſtine taking its
beginning from the Pylorus, neither ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
may it want the external Help of ſome
of the inferiour Inteſtines. Moreover, as
long as the body is rightly governed, the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous
Excrement is daily cleanſed. But
when it is more copiouſly collected by ſome
evil affection of the body, the moſt famous
Phyſicians doubt nothing, but that thoſe moſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64159:48"/>
grievous Diſeaſes which happen to the belly,
as the Ileum, Lienteria, and Teneſmus, may
be occaſioned by it. Neither therefore is
that Tranſlation to be contemned which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath provided for Health, by the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
immiſſion of the Bilious paſſage in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The ſame Office is no leſs to be aſcribed to the
Pancreatick Juyce, then to the Bile hereafter
to be made conſpicuous by the Deſcription of its
acid Qualities. Before we go any further in
declaring the Effects ariſing from this Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
we will premiſe ſome Fermentations,
that theſe things being with all poſſibility in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,
it may become the more obvious,
what benefit the Inteſtinal Efferveſcency bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the Aliments after their propulſion to the
Gutts.</p>
            <p>As many as have mingled filings of Steel with
Oyl of Sulpher, prepared Per Campanum, or
Spirit of Vitriol, having added a ſufficient
quantity of water, they might obſerve an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency
to be excited after a certain manner
by the concourſe of thoſe contraries; by help
whereof, the laudable parts of the Steel are
joyned to the acid Spirits, whilſt the reſt count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as refuſe, do partly go to the bottome, and
partly like Froth ſwim or flote upon the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>
            <p>But I think that the more purer parts of the
Steel, and thoſe moſt exactly mixed, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
joyned to the acid Liquor, becauſe they
have therewith a more greater affinity, becauſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64159:49"/>
of which they ſuffer themſelves to be diſſolved;
but not the other more Impure and leſs mixed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, whether they be more Terrene, and
therefore ſeek the bottome, or whether they
they be more Oleus, and therefore Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>
            <p>The ſame, greater or leſſer, Affinity of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
with the diſſolved Matter, doth further
appear, if in the ſame Liquor more Mettals
be ſucceſſively immitted; Firſt, thoſe which
have a leſſe; afterwards, thoſe which have a
greater Affinity with it: So, when Silver is put
into Aqua-Fortis, and ſo long detained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
till it be all diſſolved; which Efferveſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
is abſolved with its Coagent: hence let
Copper be put to the afore-ſaid Solution, the
Aqua-Fortis will leave the Silver, and begin a
new Efferveſcency with the Copper, whilſt
that the Silver, being gradually neglected by
the Aqua-Fortis, gets to the bottome; which
Mutation, by the Chymiſts, is called by the name
of Precipitation.</p>
            <p>But if afterwards, you caſt Iron to this Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Copper, the ſame thing will again
come to paſs, and by degrees the Copper will be
precipitated to the bottom. Which if again,
to the Solution of the Iron, you affuſe ſome
Lixivium of Calcind Tartar, Vine Aſhes, or
the like, the Acid Spirit will joyne it ſelf
more ſtrictly to the Solution of that, than of
the other Mettalick bodies, and will ſcarcely
ſuffer it ſelf to be ſeparated from the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:64159:49"/>
The Reaſon of this more ſtraight Union is
to be required from the more pure Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that is leſs mixed, and therefore more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
joynes it ſelf with the ſaid Lixiviate fixed
Salt, hitherto alſo more pure and leſs mixed,
than with the ſame Salt; but leſs pure, that is
more mixed: So that, here the purity of the
contrary Parts ought to be underſtood by their
Affinity.</p>
            <p>By reaſon of this greater Affinity, the Oyle
of Tartar prepared per Deliquium, (which is
nothing elſe but the Salt of Tartar, diſſolved
by the Humidity of Air) when it is in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
poured with the Vitriol into Water, it joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
it ſelf to the acid Spirit, exiſting in the
Vitriol, whilſt its Sulphureous part, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a leſſer Affinity with Acidity, by little
and little departs, and gets to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
            <p>Which being permiſed we will conſider,
what things may happen in the Aliments in the
Stomach by its Fermentation, and what alſo
befalleth the ſame; (after the aforementioned
Fermentation) in the thin Gut eſpecially, that
we may conclude ſomething more certain, and
more probable than uſual. Firſt, The Stomach,
being opened, together with the Guts, ſeeing
that the Aliments, by an abſolute Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are wont to be driven from the Stomach
to the Inteſtines, we have obſerved a notable
Change between that which is contained in the
Stomach, and that in the Guts: For, that in
the Stomach hath had a more groſſer, and Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64159:50"/>
Conſiſtence, and by the Diverſity of the
Aliments, and other things aſſumed, a diverſe
Colour, and oftentimes leſs White.</p>
            <p>Certainly, this Mutation cannot be derived
from any other thing than from the Bile, and
Pancreatick Juice: Becauſe thoſe Humours on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flow in a large Quantity to the Superiour
part of the ſmall Gut, and are admixed with the
Aliments.</p>
            <p>The Examen of both the afore-ſaid Liquors,
doth confirm this our Opinion: For, the Bile,
abounding with a Volatile Salt and Oyle, hath
a force of Inciding, Attenuating, and making
Fluid moſt things where-with it is permixed,
eſpecially ſuch as are pituitous; as <hi>Galen</hi> alſo
teacheth, <hi>Lib.</hi> V. <hi>De uſu Part.</hi> Cap. IV. as by
the place above quoted may be ſeen, to which
<hi>Platerus</hi> ſubſcribes, <hi>Cap.</hi> VIII. concerning the
Defect of Hearing by the Repletion of the
Eares, whilſt he breakth out into theſe
Words:</p>
            <q>
               <p>Firſt, he declares that Aqua Mulſa, or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromel,
or if to cleanſe more powerfully, with the
Decoction, or bitter Juice before-mentioned,
of Worm-Wood, Centaury, or Lupines, that may
be effected, adding Honey or Gall, which, above
all other things, as hath been often ſaid doth
make thoſe things, which are Viſcous, Fluid,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>But the Succus Pancreaticus, being pregnant
with a Subacid Spirit, as appeareth by the
Precedent Reaſons, and Experiments, doth
in like manner augment the Viſcidity of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64159:50"/>
Aliments by the Solution of their Fluidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
the which being ſo as it is more than
ſufficiently known, we will not delay time, by
further proofs concerning the Manner, wherby
Acids in the thin Gut, do return to a Liquid,
and Fluxile Motion, or other-wiſe to an Ine<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
and Pituitous Viſcidity; we ſhall only ſay
that in our Judgement it ſo happeneth; for as
much, as by the Tenuity, and Sharpneſs of
the Parts, ſtirred up by the Efferveſcency, the
Phlegme is thereby as with Swords, incided,
and attenuated into very Minute Parts. That
which attaineth a Whitiſh Colour, then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
in the more Fluid part of the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we think it deducible from the Acidity
of the Pancreatick Juice; becauſe we may
note, that many other things, abounding with
a Lixivious Salt and Oyle, do wax White upon
the affuſion of Acids: So, that Vinegar or
Sharp Wine, being poured upon common Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
diſſolved with any Lixivium, and grown
Red, that Reddiſh Colour is ſo changed, that
it is made almoſt like to Milk: Wherefore alſo
it is called by the Chymiſts <hi>Lac Sulphuris.</hi>
The ſame is apparent in the Reſinious Extracts
of Vegitables, as alſo in Spirit of Hart's Horne
or Soot, being Replete with much Volatile
Salt; with which an Acid Spirit being mixed,
acquires a Milky Colour. All thoſe things
being rightly conſidered, we judge, <hi>Secondly,</hi>
That the Efferveſcency, in the thin Gut is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
neceſſary for the right Separation of
the profitable Parts from the unprofitable. But
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64159:51"/>
perhaps ſome, who are altogether wedded to
Antiquity, admitting nothing which to them
is Novel, becauſe they have read or underſtood
nothing, in the Antients, concerning this our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Secretion, by Fermentation, will not
think that ſuch a preparation is required to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
the profitable parts of the Aliment from
the unprofitable; but that the alteration which
is performed in the Stomach, is ſufficient to
this purpoſe; in which, if any thing be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
it may be Conſummated by the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaltick
Motion of the Guts; by the help
whereof its more Fluid parts are thruſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
into the Milky Veines, the Foeces, with
the remaining thicker and leſſer profitable
parts, paſſing away by the Channel of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines.</p>
            <p>To the which we deny not, but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is contributed to this matter both by
the ſaid Fermentation and the Periſtaltick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Guts; nevertheleſs we do not
think that any Phyſitian, unleſs a Slave
to the Antients, amongſt all thoſe things which
are daily obſerved in the diſſecting of Brute A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
and Medical Practiſs; or at leaſt-wiſe
may be obſerved, will reject this cauſe propoſed
by us; If, firſt of all, he diligently conſider, that
in the Coeliack Flux the Aliments, ſometimes
viſcid like a Pultiſs, and every where alike, and
ſometimes mixed with a whitiſh Liquor are
purged out.</p>
            <p>But this Diverſity of Colour happens, by a
Contingent, or Non-contingent, Secretion of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64159:51"/>
profitable parts from the unprofitable, by the ſaid
Efferveſcency; which, who can but in vain, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to expreſſion alone.</p>
            <p>Yet we deny not, that by the Fermentation
of Aliments alone, rightly performed in the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle,
ſomething Fluid may, Spontaneouſly, paſs
away from the reſt of the Aliments more Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious;
nevertheleſs that is but little, if it be
compared with the large quantity of noble
Chyle, which is continually ſtrained through
the Venae-lacteae, or alſo from thence ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
up in the Caeliack Flux; ſo that, then
the more watery part of the Chyle, freely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth by the Compreſſion of the Bowels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
is more without Efferveſcency, than the
other which is more white, or, as we may ſay,
more Milky.</p>
            <p>In that Spontaneous Separation of the parts
wont to happen through Fermentation, the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
indeed firſt go forth with the Watery, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the Reparation of the Animal ſpirits:
We have an example in the Fermentation of
Plants, &amp; other things, abounding with a Volatile
Spirit, in which the Spirituous Particles, alwayes
expanded, and endeavouring to flee through
the Pores of the Stomach and Guts, being looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from their Fetters, ruſh through the Pores:
From whence we are fully perſwaded, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Aſſumption of the moſt Spirituous Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
a ſuddain ſtrength is found in men;
and although it be Inconſpicuous to our Bodily
Eyes, that the Spirits, by the ſame reaſon, are
diffuſed through the Pores of the Body; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64159:52"/>
after a manner, we underſtand it
with the Eyes of our Mind, whilſt we ſee a
Stupendious Vertue in ſome Medicaments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
applyed: The ſame thing is often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by Anatomiſts, when after the Inciſion
of the Peritonaeum, they receive the Foetid Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulencies
paſſing through the Tunicles of the
Guts to the Noſtrils.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Spirituous and Volatile parts
are not ſufficient to ſuſtain Life; but, More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
Acid, Oleous, and Salt parts, are alſo
required; therefore there is need of a new
Alteration of things aſſumed, that thoſe parts,
by a decent Copiouſneſs, might be ſeparated
from the Superfluous and Unprofitable: Which
alteration we call Efferveſcency, and by help
of which, we judge (with our ſometimes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Profeſſor <hi>Franciſ. de le Boe-Sylvius,</hi> from
whoſe Lectures, as well publick as private, we
do not deny to have drawn many Fundamentals
of this Doctrine) that Secretion to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
            <p>We do not only judge by that Efferveſcency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
mediateing the more Subtile and Fluid parts of
Aliments, but alſo the Pituity by the help there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
diſſolved in the thin Gut, part of which is
carryed together, with the better Portion of
the Bile, and Succus Pancreaticus, through
the Vermiculous cruſt of the Inteſtines into the
Milky Veines; from hence to the Ciſterne or
Common Receptacle of the Chyle, and Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,
placed in the Region of the Loynes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Appendices of the Diaphragma; and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64159:52"/>
from thence aſcends through the Chyliferus, or
more rightly the Lymphatick Ductus, Thoraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
(becauſe it continually carryeth the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,
and the Chyle, only by Intervals) to the
Subclavian, or left Jugular Veine, that from
thence it may deſcend, with the Blood, through
the Superiour Trunck of the Vena Cava, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
into the right Eare of the Heart, and
the right Ventricle thereof. And in the right
Ear, and right Ventricle of the Heart, it is
confuſed both with the aſcending and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Blood, and alſo impregnated with the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice, the Bile, Phlegme, and Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha;
from whence it acquires a requiſite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency
of Blood.</p>
            <p>This confirms what we have ſaid; That
any thing acid Coagulates all Fatneſs and
Oyle.</p>
            <p>But becauſe, on the other ſide, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
humours have in themſelves a force of
attempering, we need not fear too great a
Conſiſtency of the Blood; ſo long, as at leaſt
they remain in a Laudable and Natural E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing that the more fluid and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
parts, as well of the Aliments aſſumed,
as of the three nominated Humours, do go to
the Heart; the reſt more groſs, and leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
by the Periſtaltick Motion of the Guts,
gradually without Senſe, are driven forwards
to the thick Guts, where they are diſtinguiſhed
by the name of Alvinary Foeces. Whether al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the Exhalations, excited by this Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64159:53"/>
or even the Juice it ſelf may not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
a natural Fermentation in the Stomach,
we dare not as yet aſſert; although ſome Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
ſeem to perſwade it to us, of both whoſe
Ducts, to wit, the Pancreatick and Bilar, Nature
hath determined a paſſage into the Stomach.
We judge this Pancreatick Juice is not onely
Subſervient to the Functions, already declared,
but alſo by the Sub-acid Spirit with which it
is impregnated by the moſt wiſe God, we
think it to be ordained after a certain manner,
to Incraſſate, and Inſpifate the more fluid
Bile, and alſo to temper its too much Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
This thing is manifeſt in the Bile by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
any acid Spirits thereto, which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
either more or leſs, will be thickned, and
its more groſs part precipitated to the bottom,
whilſt its Thinner part floats on the top like
Phlegme. Hence peradventure <hi>Hippocrates,
Lib. De Victu Accutorum,</hi> Text 29. 8. 9. teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that bitter things are diſſolved, and paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Phlegme, that is, They become ſluggiſh whiles
they are ſpread or mixed with an acid, which
is not only confirmed by the Authority of the
Divine old Gentleman, but alſo by a daily Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency;
whereby it is evident that Acids,
and Salts, being put into a Conflict amongſt
themſelves, do ſo infringe their ſharp Particles,
that they become almoſt temperate: Wherefore
not without Reaſon <hi>Hipp. Aph.</hi> I. Sect. VI.
hath taught us in the daily Levities of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines,
That if an Acid belching ſhould ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervene,
which had not been before, we ought
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64159:53"/>
to hope well: For it is a ſigne that the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juice, by its acidy, will, in a ſhort time, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper
the Acrimony of the Bile.</p>
            <p>We have ſaid that the Pancreatick Juice is
ordained by Nature, after a ſort to incraſſate
the more Fluid Bile; but it may alſo ſo happen
that the Bile, by its Acidity, may be rendered
more Fluid, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Viſcidity of the
Bile dependeth upon the Viſcidity of Phlegme;
therefore in one reſpect Acids may render the
bile more groſs, but in another more Fluid;
for Acids do incraſſate Fats, and Lixivious Salts.</p>
            <p>Among thoſe things which we have now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
it is ſufficiently evident, in the Humours
naturally conſtituted in the ſmall Gut, and the
Friendly Efferveſcency of Nature from thence
occurring, that many Functions in the Body are
rightly performed; which by the ſaid Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
evilly happening, are waſted, and become
Vitious. The verity of which thing, that we
may make it more clearly appear, we ſhall, firſt
of all, declare ſome Vices which happen in the
Subſtance of the Pancreas. Secondly, We
ſhall adjoyne thoſe things which may befall the
Juice thereof.</p>

with other Famous men, alſo Converſant in

Feavers, of Hypocondriack Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
and other Chronick Diſeaſes, do lurk,
or lye hid in the Pancreas. But this buſineſs,
without all doubt, had been more ſucceſsfully
treated of both by theſe, and other men of no
ſmall Merit in Medicine, had the Pancreatick
Juice, with its Generation and Nature, been
known to them: Wherefore we ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
being excited by their Commendable
Examples, to produce ſomething to the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
World for the Common good, by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
firſt, By what Diſeaſes the Subſtance of
the Pancreas may be infeſted. Secondly, By
declaring the Primary Vices, which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to its Juice. Thirdly, By ſearching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Diſpoſition. Fourthly, By inveſtigating the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
which follow thoſe Functions hurt.
Fifthly, and laſtly, By delivering the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
wherewith all of them may be amended.
The Diſeaſes wherewith the Subſtance of the
Pancreas is wont to be moleſted, are Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
and thoſe which follow them, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
Schirous's, Abſceſs's, Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Obſtructions may happen to the Pancreas two
wayes: Firſt, In the Ductus, when the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice cannot freely paſs through it,
into the Inteſtines, even as we ſhall more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Demonſtrate to happen when we ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64159:55"/>
of Intermitting Feavers. Secondly, In
the Subſtance of the Pancreas it ſelf, when
by any cauſe, either Internal or External, the
Circulation of the Blood through it, is hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
from whence the Parenchyma, by the
continual appulſe of blood, is puffed up, and
ſwells, unleſs it be indurated, or by a
previous Inflamation goes into an Abſeeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
            <p>Which, that it may be made known to all, we
will bring upon the Stage the Obſervations of
ſeveral Phiſitians, and Anatomiſts. <hi>Riolanus,
Anthropog. Lib. 2. Cap. 10.</hi> writeth, that he
had obſerved in many people, who were of a
Melancholy Nature, and Habit of Body, that
the Pancreas equalled the weight of the Liver;
and alſo confirms the ſame, by the Example of
the moſt Illuſtrious Auguſtinus Thuanus; <q>Who,
by the Melancholy Habit of Body, did complain
for four Years together of a Collick Pain, about
the Region of the Colon, with a Senſe of a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
or Weight, at his Stomach, while he ſtood
upright, or walked: But his Hypoconders did
not ſwell: At length being taken with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt-for
Gangreen, from his right Foot ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
to the Superiour parts with Horrible and
Direful Pains, in the ſpace of Six Hours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.
His Body being opened, and the Liver
taken out, was round like to a Sphare, ſtuffe
with Fat, and tranſ-fixed with a certain pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
hardned Matter like to Mortar: But the
Pancreas, by its Amplitude and Weight, did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualize
the Liver, wholly Schirhous with many
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64159:55"/>
little Knobs, which were filled with the Species of
a Pigeons Egg; the Spleen was ſo waſted that it
ſcarce weighed an Ounce.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For which reaſon, ſome have called the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas,
the Vicar or Supply of the Spleen; not
conſidering that this Diverſity might happen to
other parts alſo; and likewiſe in Doggs, after
the Extirpation of the Spleen, the Subſtance of
the Pancreas did in no wiſe grow into a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
weight; which, according to them, ought to
happen, if the Pancreas ſupplyed the Office of
the Spleen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aubertus</hi> relates a ſtory of an <hi>Abſceſſus Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gym.</hi>

certain Merchant of <hi>Lyons,</hi> which could never
ſleep, and when he endeavoured to ſleep, he

whole Body, till at length he dyed. His Body
being opened there was only found a putrid
<hi>Abſceſſus</hi> in the Pancreas; the Stomach and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
principal parts being ſafe. <hi>Guilh. Fabric.
Hildanus.</hi> Cent. 1. Obſerv. 71. alſo relates,
that he, in a certain Carpenter, who for the
ſpace of two years, by Intervals, was griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with divers Diſeaſes, laboured under Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
and Cachexy: Found in his dead
Body, among other things, a Schirhous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
ſuppurated like unto a Collection of
Fat, under the skin, about the bigneſs of two
Fiſts; having its riſe from the Inferiour part
of the Pancreas, which incloſed the Inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num

            <q>
               <p>Coming to the Lower Belly, we ſaw that Fleſh
perforating the Diaphragma to be the Pancreas,
which was the length of two Spans, and breadth
of two Hands tranſverſe, being putrid, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
which, by its Coroſive Acidity, did not
only perforate the Diaphragma, but did alſo ſo
corrode the Spina Dorſi, that a Cancer-like <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
was produced, with a light ſtroke the whole
Spina Dorſi might eaſily be broken. Laſtly, it
corroded the very Vena Cava it ſelf, which runs
into the Spine; by which the Blood, flowing
through the Diaphragma, brought Death by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peding
the Motion of the Lungs. This Cancer
of the Pancreas, by creeping further, did alſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
both the Kidneys, and cauſed them to be moſt

was Communicated to us at <hi>Paris, Bona
fide,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Gajen,</hi> a Chyrurgion, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Anatomiſt, by him before obſerved:</p>
            <p>A Noble Man, aged about thirty, being
Melancholy, was Obnoxious to Catthars, by
the intemperate uſe of Wine, and Fruits; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
aſſumed, fell into a Vomiting, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arhaea,
whereby after ſome ſpace, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
a Flux of Blood; from whence, more
and more failing in Strength, the Tenth day
he Changed Life with Death. His body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
opened, he found in the Pancreas, about
the end of the Ductus Pancreaticus going into
the Inteſtines, ſeven or eight Stones, having
the bigneſs of the largeſt Peaſe; ſome of which
being given us by himſelf, we keep among our
Rarities.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, this Obſervation to us, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not ſo wonderful, who believe that Stones
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64159:57"/>
are generated in all the Glandules of the Body,
eſpecially in the pineal Glandule: becauſe in
it we have more than twenty times obſerved
Stones in men, extinguiſhed either by a gentle
Diſeaſe, or a violent Death; which thing
happens more frequently in <hi>France,</hi> than in
<hi>Holland;</hi> a more profitable account whereof,
we do not ſee, than that the Anima of the
<hi>French,</hi> as by Nature more Volatile, may be
bound to a more firm Reſidence in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>We have alſo found in a certain Dog, in
that part of the Ductus Pancreaticus, where
the Aſcending concurs with the Deſcending,
and is only ſimple; a Cartilagineous Excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
about the Ductus and its end, which
like a Nipple, did hang out into the Inteſtine,
to the bigneſs of a Finger, in the middle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a ſufficient paſſage was afforded to the ſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pancreatick Juice. <hi>Riolanus</hi> l. c. found
the whole Pancreas hardned like a Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.</p>
            <p>We might be able to inferr many Diſeaſes
of the Pancreas, were it not already ſufficiently
evident by what hath been ſaid, That the Pancre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
alſo may be afflicted with common Diſeaſes;
neither that its evil Conſtitution followeth the
affections of the Liver or Spleen: For, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the other Bowels being unhurt, the
Pancreas alone, hath been the cauſe of Death,
for Reaſons (already) ſufficiently alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:64159:57"/>
For which reaſon, it is manifeſt that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas
is neceſſary to Life, which is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by an Experiment made by us at <hi>Paris,</hi>
in the Year 1667. when in the Houſe of Dr.
<hi>Bourdelot,</hi> where, every Monday, the moſt
Curious of Phyſitians and Phyloſophers did
meet, we had for three Months together ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
this little Book, in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue,
to publick Examination, ſome being led by Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
alone, aſſerted that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Animals might
live no leſs without the Pancreas, than the
Spleen: For which cauſe, before all that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
we extirpated the Spleen, and alſo moſt
exactly the Pancreas, of a certain Dog: The
Abdomen again being cloſed, Dr. <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi>
commanded his Servants to keep the
Dog moſt diligently, who, notwithſtanding
all their Dilligence, in a ſhort time Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Vices being declared, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
befall the Subſtance of the Pancreas, we
ſhall proceed to thoſe things which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to its juice; from whence, not a few Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Functions depending upon its Natural
Diſpoſition, are waſted and hurt. Firſt of all;
The Pancreatick Juice offendeth when it is
more ſparingly effuſed into the thin Gut, which
ſometimes comes to paſs by the more ſparing
Generation, or Separation thereof in the
Pancreas; or when there is an Obſtruction
in one or more of its lateral Branches; becauſe,
for a time the Juice is therein ſtagnated, till at
length the Obſtruction is opened.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:64159:58"/>
It is more ſparingly generated, when the
Matter thereof is more or leſs deficient in the
blood, and not being reſtored with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Aliments; or when the ſame is carryed
off another way; or when it is more ſtrictly
conjoyned with the blood, that it cannot be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
ſeparated from it. One or more of
the Ducts of the Pancreas are obſtructed by a
pituitous, and viſcid Matter, together with the
Matter of the Pancreatick Juice, ſeparated in
the Pancreas, and tranſlated into, and detained in
thoſe Ducts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Pancreatick Juyce doth alſo
offend, when it is carryed into the Inteſtines
in greater plenty, whether it be generated
more Copiouſly, or for a time being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by Stagnation, in one or more of
the Laterall Ducts, is then more plentifully
Effuſed, when the Obſtruction is Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>It is generated more plentifully by reaſon of
the Liberal uſe of acid Aliments, or at leaſt
of Condited Acids; for example, ſoure Wine,
Vinegar, Pomecitrons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo, by reaſon
of ſome Vice of the Glandules, by which the
Separation of that juice, from the blood is
promoted; as alſo, ſometimes perhaps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of more larger Veſſels tending into the
Pancreas, and as is uſual, affording a larger
Matter to the juyce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When it flows inequally into the
thin Gut, that is, at one time more abundantly,
at another more ſparingly: Which, firſt of all,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64159:58"/>
pens by an Obſtruction of one or more of the
Lateral Ducts, which continuing, nothing
floweth out from them; and therefore a
more ſparing juyce is then effuſed into the
whole:</p>
            <p>By the ſaid Obſtruction, any way removed,
preſently that which was ſtagnant in the middle
Duct, together with the reſt of the juice, is
effuſed into the thin Gut; from whence, on the
contrary, the Excretion of the Pancreatick juice
is then more plentiful.</p>
            <p>That ſuch an Obſtruction may ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the Lateral Ducts of the Pancreas, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
doth perſwade, and Experience it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
even as we ſhall more clearly evince
in the following Diſcourſe of Intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It offendeth when it is more Fluid
and Liquid, than Natural: which happeneth by
reaſon of ſuch blood, or animal Spirits, more
Copiouſly mixed there-with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It offendeth, when on the contrary
it is more Viſcid; by reaſon of the Blood,
likewiſe Viſcid, and abounding with much pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The ſaid Pancreatick juyce of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends;
when the Natural Reliſh thereof is
changed:</p>
            <p>Whence it is one while leſs acid, another
while more acid; one while ſalt, another while
auſtere; ſometimes of a ſimple Taſt, or elſe
Compounded of thoſe before-named.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:64159:59"/>
The Nominated Juice is leſs acid, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beauſe
of the animal Spirits, more plentifully
carried to the Pancreas, or for want of acidity
in the Blood; whether it may come to paſs, by
reaſon of aſſuming things unfit to repair the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity
taken away, or by the uſe of ſuch things
as infringe, concentrate, obtund, or extinguiſh
acidity.</p>
            <p>The acidity of the Pancreatick Juice aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
for the moſt part, is to be aſcribed
to the Redundancy of acid Humours in the
Body; ſometimes to the Impedited Afflux
of the Animal Spirits to the Pancreas; at
leaſt-wiſe, to that part of the Juyce which is
ſtagnant in the Lateral Ducts; or other-wiſe,
perhaps, by reaſon of the Animal Spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Exhauſted. An acid Humour is wont to
abound in the Body, for the moſt part, from
aſſumed Aliments, Sauces, or Medicaments,
which are ſharp, with ſharp Wines, ſuch as
for the moſt part is Reniſh, Moſellanous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
as alſo, becauſe of a more Cold Air, and North
Wind, Sorrow of Mind though not over much,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The motion of the Animal Spirits, to
the Pancreas, is impedited, when the Animal
Spirits are defective; or being more dull or
ſlow throughout the whole Body; alſo, when
the Nerves are obſtructed, diſſecated, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <p>The Succus Pancreaticus is made Salt by a
Marine, or Foſſile Salſitude, in like manner,
becauſe of the Seroſity of the Blood likewiſe
Salt; perhaps by a like Fault of the Glandules
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64159:59"/>
concurring; for which reaſon, the Secretion
of the Saline parts from the Acid, cannot be
abſolved: For, our common Salt conſiſteth of
two parts, to wit, a Lixivious Salt, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
Spirit joyned together. The auſterity of
the Pancreatick Juice ſeemeth to us, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the more groſs, or Terrene Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
with which its acid Particles are invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
which appeareth, not only in Fruits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt ſoure, afterwards, when by the gentle
Heat of the Sun, they are Ripened, they are
made a little more acid; and at length, when
the more groſs Particles thereof, by the Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Heat, are more exalted, they become
Sweet.</p>
            <p>But moreover it is manifeſt, that thoſe things
which are ſower, it is by their Syncriſis and
Diacriſis: So D. <hi>Paiſenus</hi> hath noted in <hi>Theſi.</hi>
XXI. C. that the juyce of Ribes, being
powred to Coral of a grateful acid, becomes
auſtere. Vitriol and Allum diſtilled, yield an
acid Spirit: Likewiſe an acid Spirit may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled
from ſealed Earths, Bole Armeniack, and
the like; but how Bole Armen. may by the help
of Nitre and other things, be made more aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
is to be ſeen in <hi>Le Febre,</hi> in his French Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <head>CHAP. VIII. The Functions which are vitiated by
the Pancreas, or it's Juyce evilly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed.</head>
            <p>HAving declared the more grievous Vices
wherewith the Pancreas and its Juyce are
wont to be affected, every man may ſee, that
from that Fountain very many Incommodities
to Mortals do proceed; all which things,
ſeeing we have propoſed to handle them in
order, we ſhall firſt judge of thoſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the Pancreas it ſelf, by ſubjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe things which are wont to flow from its
juyce.</p>
            <p>If the Pancreas acquire a Schirrous ſubſtance
reſembling Stones, and alſo weighty in the
place where it ſhould defend the Sanguinous
Veſſels, as ſome would have it, leſt they ſhould
be hurt by the Vertaebrae, or other parts, it will
greatly afflict them by Compreſſion, and will
hinder the circular motion of the Blood, from
whence divers Diſtentions, Inflammations, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
and other things ariſe, and ſpring
up, fit to impedite the Common uſe of the
Bowels. Beſides alſo by its weight, it will not
a little hinder the Stomach from performing its
Office by compreſſing it; but when it is inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64159:60"/>
or Apoſthumated, for the moſt part it will
cauſe the ſame Incommodities with the other
Bowels, being afflicted with the ſame Vice.
But ſome may ſay, if ſuch grievous Effects
happen to the Pancreas, how can the uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
be ſo neceſſary, and how do we hitherto live
ſo long with them? Then may we alſo demand
how thoſe men may live, to whoſe Brain,
Heart, Liver, and other bowels neceſſary to
Life, the ſame, or the like things happen, and
we ſhall further enquire of them, by what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſuch may live well or ill? The Hiſtories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
do certainly teſtifie, that ſuch live a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
life, and when the Evil ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
thoſe alſo for no other Cauſe have
changed Life for Death: So that from that
part can nothing be infer'd againſt our Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</p>
            <p>Having unfolded the Incommodities ariſing
from the Parenchyma of the Pancreas it ſelf, it
remaineth, that we alſo run through the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
Hurt, which the evil Qualities, or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Pancreatick Juyce, or other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
exiſting in the thin Gutt, do draw after
them.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Pancreatick Juyce being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Inteſtines in a leſſer quantity, will
not ſufficiently free the Gutts from the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Humidity in them, and ſo will occaſion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Obſtructions, as the Learned <hi>R. Lower,</hi>
who judgeth this juyce to be ordained by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to cleanſe the Chyle; he writeth in his
Treatiſe of the Heart, <hi>Chap. 5. page</hi> 215. that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64159:61"/>
by the defect thereof, he hath obſerved Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
of the Venae Lacteae, in theſe very
words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>It ſeems to me moſt true, that that great Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule
(namely the Pancreas) is ſeated in that
place; and that Ductus to be opened into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines,
that the Lympha (for ſo he calleth the
Pancreatick Juyce) being there ſeparated, may be
mixed with the deſcending Chyle, whereby it may
more readily enter, and more expeditely paſs through
the narrow Channel of the Lactean Veins; and
indeed the Chyle in the Milkey Veſſels, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of its craſcitie, or for want of potulent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
(which ought to be for its Vehicle) may
ſometimes be apt to be ſtagnant, and ſo concrete,
and by the ſame reaſon, to ſtop, and altogether fill
up thoſe Veſſels, as in a Dog, whoſe Pancreas was
obdurated I once obſerved.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Neither alſo will it ſufficiently promote the
Natural, and due Separation of the Chyle from
the Excrements, and that eſpecially if the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be more dry, or of a more difficult Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation:
Hence neceſſarily follows a dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
Nutrition of the whole body, as alſo a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Languiſhing; ſo that, ſuch may rather be
ſaid to draw Life, than to live. But the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice, being ſeparated in a larger
quantity; and brought to the Inteſtines, will, as
it were, pare off, not only their ſuperfluous
Pituity, but alſo that neceſſary part which
ſhould defend them from Injuries like a Curry-Comb;
and beſides, it will ſeparate more
than it ought, from the aſſumed Aliments, ſo
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64159:61"/>
that, ſometimes the unprofitable, and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious
parts, together with the profitable,
may be conveyed to the Maſs of Blood; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
only the profitable Parts, but in a larger
quantity than they ſhould, may be carryed by
the ſame wayes: From whence, if here we
ſay a Pethora will happen, and thence a Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy,
Who can overthrow our Aſſertions?
More-over, we think that the Lancionations, in
the left Hypocondria, firſt moleſted by courſes,
do proceed from too great a quantity of the
Bile and Pancreatick Juyce, ſeparated from
the Blood, by a more vehement Motion of the
Body, and the ſtirring up a greater Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
            <p>For, it is moſt certain, that Running, or
any other vehement Exerciſe of the Body, doth
accelerate the Motion of the Blood, through
the whole Body; which, ſeeing it is the cauſe
of the Separation of theſe or other Humours,
then it is alſo neceſſary, that thoſe Humours
be depoſited into the Guts in a greater plenty;
which, being ſeparated in a Natural Quantity,
and Quality, if, as we have already proved,
they may excite a natural and friendly Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency
to Nature, may not the contrary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
when they are otherwiſe diſpoſed by exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an Efferveſcency, greater, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to Nature? After a wonderful manner
doth that place confirm this our Opinion, in
which thoſe paines are perceived by courſe, and
very ordinarily, though unjuſtly, are aſcribed
to the Spleen; becauſe the Spleen is not in that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64159:62"/>
place, where thoſe pains do in us excite a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation,
but hath its ſeat more down-wards;
becauſe in that place thoſe paines do manifeſt
themſelves in the Anteriour part of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondria,
where the thin Gut <hi>M,</hi> emerging
under the Meſentery <hi>N,</hi> doth lye by the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum,
as is to be ſeen in the firſt Table,
where we have Delineated to the Life the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of that Inteſtine.</p>
            <p>The inequal ſeparation of the Succus Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaticus,
and propulſion thereof, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines,
produceth various Mutations in the
Guts, and elſe-where, concerning the ſuddain
Happening of which, no man will ever aſſigne
a fit Reaſon, who will not give heed to thoſe
things. Hence we think to be deduced the
ſuddain Deliquiums of the Wind ſometimes
advening, erratick Feavers, intermitious of Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pancreatick Juice being more fluid, will
more dilute the Pituity of the Guts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſometimes occaſion the Flux of the Belly;
eſpecially if it be conjoyned with a Salſitude,
by whoſe acrimony the Guts are provoked to
their Contraction; and unleſs that Flux of
the Belly follow the Periſtaltick Motion of
the Guts, it will neceſſarily expreſs a greater
Quantity of Chyle into the Venae Lacteae, from
whence the ſame incommodities will ariſe,
which we have deduced from the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juyce, ſeparated in too large a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:64159:62"/>
The more Viſcid Pancreatick Juice concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by the leaſt external Cold, will occaſion
Obſtructions, as alſo intermitting Feavers, and
likewiſe aſtringe the Belly. Concerning the
ſenſible Qualities, and firſt of the Relliſh,
there is ſometimes produced a Pancreatick
juyce leſs acid; from whence there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a due Efferveſcency in the Duodenum,
and therefore not a neceſſary Separation of the
profitable parts from the unprofitable, nor a
deſired Conſiſtency beſtowed on the Blood:
and therefore they, in whom ſuch Blood is,
have been leſs able to reſiſt Peſtilential Venom,
than thoſe in whom, by the laudable Acidity
of their Pancreatick Juice, have alſo a more
Laudable and greater Conſiſtency of their
Blood. Hence the reaſon is alſo clear, Why
Melancholly Men are leſs afflicted with the
Plague, than thoſe who are endued with a Bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
blood.</p>
            <p>For we think that no man may be infected
with the Plague, ſo long as the Natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency
of his blood is preſerved: We aſſert
this the more freely, becauſe we ſee the blood
in all perſons infected with the Plague to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and obtain a far more fluid conſiſtency:
So that if ſometimes by chance, Negligence,
Ignorance, or any other urging Cauſe; as for
example, too great a Plethory, ſpitting of
blood bringing a preſent danger to Life, let a
Vein be opened, the blood flowing out although
refrigerated; nevertheleſs, is in no wiſe coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
neither can it acquire a due conſiſtency,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64159:63"/>
even as ſometimes is wont to happen to the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits, being looſed from their Fetters, and
diſſipated from the acidity exiſting in the blood,
wherefore alſo ſuch a blood by divers Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
is called putrid.</p>
            <p>We commonly ſay, becauſe it may ſo happen,
that the whole Maſs of blood, not as yet equally
infected, the laudible part of the blood in the
cutting of a Vein, may only flow out, the blood
remaining in the body being depraved; the
which thing Practitioners daily obſerve to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in Venae-Section; we do not only think
with other Practitioners, that the blood remains
fluid, without the bodies of thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the Plague; but do alſo affirm the
like fluidity in the bodies of thoſe extinguiſhed
by the Peſt, as we have learned by Experience,
which perhaps may ſeem ſtrange to thoſe who
know not the Nature of volatile Salts, but not
ſo to us, who have very often mingled it with
the blood, and the blood always remained fluid,
the which cannot be certainly expected from the
commixture of any other thing, with the blood,
then volatile Salts.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, if you mingle any acid
Spirit with the Blood <hi>Dictum Factum,</hi> the
Blood will be more or leſs Coagulated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as that Spirit ſhall be more or leſs A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid;
as for example, if to try the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we take Oyle of Vitriol, Oyle of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
per Campanum, Aqua Fortis, Aqua Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides, that the Blood will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be Coagulated by them, it alſo acquires a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64159:63"/>
Cheſ-Nut Colour. But if we take the Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
Spirit of Salt, Juice of Lammons, Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Vinegar or the like, whoſe acid Spirit is
more Temperate, the Blood will only acquire
the Conſiſtency of a groſſer Syrup, with its red
Colour remaining unhurt.</p>
            <p>From whence it is evident, the uſe of Acids
may preſerve men from the Plague, not, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Opinion of many Authors, that
they cut and attenuate; but as they preſerve
the natural Conſiſtency of the Blood, and do
hinder its being infected, with a more ſharp
Volatile Salt, which we, together with the
Air, ſuck into our Bodies: For this cauſe,
the moſt Famous Dr. <hi>Sylvius,</hi> who likewiſe
hath Conſtituted the Venom of the Plague,
in a more ſharp Volatile Salt; when, ſome
Years ſince, in the great Plague at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi>
which he fore-ſaw, he took a Cruſt of Bread,
imbrued with white-Wine-Vinegar, in which
Mary-Golds had likewiſe been ſteeped; by
which Alexipharmack he ſo well preſerved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that he never was infected with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilential
Venome. But when, through too
much haſt, he omitted the ſaid <hi>Alexipharmack,</hi>
as ſoon as he entred into an infected Houſe, he
was infected with a pain in the Head; from
which, at other times, he was free.</p>
            <p>Which things being rightly conſidered, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one may ſee that the Peſtilent Venome is not
indued with any force of Coagulating, as the
moſt Learned <hi>Willis</hi> hath ſtated it, in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of Feavers, <hi>C.</hi> 13. But ſeeing that Dr. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la-Font</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:64159:64"/>
hath ſufficiently cleared this to all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers,
in his Diſcourſe concerning the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Venome, <hi>Chap.</hi> VIII.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not ſpend any more time, either to
the Reader, or our ſelves, but wave the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diſquiſition of thoſe things; becauſe it
is (beſides) our purpoſe in this Treatiſe, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
to deſcribe the Peſtilence: Wherefore
we will leave the reſt to a further Occaſion,
ſeeing it is time that we return to the Incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
flowing from the more Acid Pancreatick
Juyce.</p>
            <p>The Pancreatick Juyce, being more ſharp,
is the cauſe, firſt, of every Internal Cold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt of all felt in the Region of the Loyns,
and afterwards diſperſed into the whole Body;
as for the moſt part, we obſerve in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Fits of Agues, or Intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Of all Cutting paines, as well
in the Hypocondria's, and whole Belly, as
in other parts of the Body. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Of
all manifeſt paines in the Belly, from whence
the Sick is ſometimes tormented after a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
manner. Wherefore we deduce all the
black and aeruginous Bile from the ſame, more
Acid, Pancreatick Juyce: Becauſe ſometimes
being put into a Pewter Chamber Pot, or
Braſs Baſon, they Corrode the ſame, and ſend
forth a ſharp Savour; and alſo excite a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Efferveſcency; which every man, who
hath ſaluted but the threſhold of Chymiſtry,
knows, cannot happen from any thing but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids:
From whence, they may be compelled to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64159:64"/>
confeſs their Errour; who affirm, That all
black Choler, proceeding from Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or Dejection of the Belly, comes from
the Follicles of the Gall, or the Spleen.</p>
            <p>All theſe things are not a little confirmed, by
the following Experiment, ſometimes made
by us in a Dog; in the Section of whom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alive, having opened the Duodenum, we
found a greeniſh Liquor among the black, ſuch
as the Antients have depicted to us for <hi>Atrabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis:</hi>
that we might purſue a more Intimate
cognition thereof, we examined diligently all the
wayes through which any thing might be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to that Inteſtine; and ſeeing that beſides
the Bilar Duct, the Pancreatick, and the Ventrile,
there was no way perceptible to the ſight,
through which any notable Quantity of Humors
might be afforded to the Inteſtines; we judge
therefore, that in one of thoſe, the matter
thereof muſt be obſcured: Wherefore we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
all thoſe wayes; in the firſt whereof,
we found the Bile, naturally Conſtituted, that
waxing Yellow from a Green: In the ſecond
we found the Pancreatick Juyce moſt limpid,
like to Diſtilled Water: In the third we found
the Aliments half crude, having the Colour of
White Aſhes.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that neither the Liver, nor
the Pancreas, nor alſo the Stomach, carryed
that <hi>Atrabilis</hi> to the Inteſtine, we began to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
whether that <hi>Atrabilis</hi> might not emerge
by the Union of two or three of thoſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
being mingled together by courſe:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64159:65"/>
Concerning which thing, that we might attain
to a greater Certainty, we affuſed Spirit of
Vitriol to the Bile, drawn forth from its Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicle,
and placed it in the heat of the Sun;
from whence there was commonly excited from
the Black, a Greeniſh Liquor, ſuch as we
firſt found in the Duodenum: Hence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the ſaid Humour, called <hi>Atrabilis,</hi> not
to flow from this, or that part, but to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
in the Duodenum. Namely, as the
Natural Colour of the Bile hath been
tranſmitted into Black, and Green, by the
Concourſe of the more Acid Pancreatick
Juyce.</p>
            <p>Seeing that the Pancreatick Juyce, by the
ordinary Law of Nature, may continually be
mingled with the Bile, and the Inteſtinal Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity,
we will a little propoſe the ſame, as
joyn'd with thoſe Humours. If it chanceth
that the more ſluggiſh Pancreatick Juyce,
bounds with a ſharper Bile, and the Inteſtinal
Pituity rightly Conſtituted, the ſtrength of the
Pancreatick Juyce, in that Concourſe, will be
altogether infringed; and the Exhalations,
which are excited by the Efferveſcency of thoſe
Humours, will aſcend, not ſo much with Acid,
as Lixivious Particles; which, when they reach
to the Stomach, by infringing its Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they will hinder the Concoction of the
Aliment, and deſtroy the Appetite: but if it
happen that thoſe Exhalations aſcend to the
Jaws, there, amongſt other Incommodities,
they will induce a Dryneſs of the Mouth, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64159:65"/>
if they infect the Spittle with their Salſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
But if they proceed further, through
the Milky Veines to the Heart, from whence,
with the blood, they may paſs through the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the body, they will alſo produce a
Heat in thoſe, as at firſt in the Inteſtines; and
there more troubleſome, where thoſe Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are moſt ſharp.</p>
            <p>If a more ſharp Pancreatick Juyce concurreth
with a ſharper Bile, there will preſently be a
mighty Efferveſcency excited in the Duodenum,
whereby the Inteſtines are ſometimes ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended,
that they threaten a Ruption; which
thing we have very often obſerved, whilſt we
applyed our ſelves to our Study in <hi>Leyden,</hi> whilſt
we mixed together divers Liquors ſit for Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
in two little Veſſels, in part of the
Inteſtine intercepted by Ligatures, (even as
D. <hi>Schuyl</hi> hath expreſſed it, Fig. <hi>B.</hi> in his Treatiſe,
<hi>De veteri Medicina</hi>) wherefore we judge, in the
firſt inſtant Emiſſion of thoſe ſharp Exhalations
which way ſoever turn'd about, that, that Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency
will excite very many grievous Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities;
many whereof will alſo preſently
ceaſe by the Diſſipation of thoſe Exhalations,
becauſe either Humour being enervated after
that Inteſtinal Conflict layes down its force, and
ceaſeth from further contention; for in ſuch an
Efferveſcency the acid Particles are ſo joyned
with the Saline, that without great difficulty
they are never to be ſeparated; wherefore as
unworthy they are expelled from the body for
Atra-bilis, if the acid over-grow the Salt, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64159:66"/>
get Dominion; in the mean time, they moſt
miſerably afflict the body, no otherwiſe than as
Hoſtile Souldiers, the place through which they
paſs, by Eroding, and Ulcerating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From
whence Fluxes of the belly, Vomitings, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſmus,
Dyſenteries, and ſix Hundred other
Incommodities ſpringing from the Atra-bilis
will proceed, and thoſe the more grievous, or
more gentle, as the acidity of the Pancreatick
juyce ſhall remain more or leſs, intemperate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſaid Conflict.</p>
            <p>If beſides the Bile, and the Pancreatick juyce
offending even now ſpoken of, much Phlegme
ſticks in the Gutts, and if the ſame phlegme be
viſcous, by reaſon of the Incommodities already
declared, there will happen Flatulencies, the
force and energy of which, whereby they are
obnoxious to men, he that deſireth to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
let him read <hi>J. Fiennus,</hi> and others,
who have profeſſedly Written of Flatulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>If a ſharper Pancreatick Juyce concurs with
a more ſluggiſh Bile, it will not excite ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
an Efferveſcency, but by its Acrimony will
ſtir up wringings of the Gutts, Eroſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but if being more intemperate, paſſing through
the little Channels of the Lactean Veins, it
toucheth the firſt and laſt reſidence of life, it
will produce the Auxiety of the Heart, Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope,
and many other Incommodities hereafter
recited, whoſe ſymptoms will be of larger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
than thoſe which we have deemed to
ariſe from Exhalations, and from thence a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64159:66"/>
Intemperance of the Pancreatick Juyce may
be feared, when the Bile, wherewith it is wont
to be attempred, is ſluggiſh and inſipid, as the
moſt learned <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> amongſt other things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that he hath obſerved in his Anatomy of the
Liver, at the end of the 39. Chapter, where he
ſaith: <q>There was with us a Woman Cachectick, in
whoſe Biliar Veſicle we found a ſerous Humour a
little pale, little bitter, or rather inſipid, but next
to a ſweetneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The like to which we have alſo obſerved in

whoſe Bile, whilſt we more accurately examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in the Houſe of D. <hi>Elſner,</hi> in the preſence
of D. <hi>Kohnius,</hi> we found it plainly ſerous, and
ſo little indued with a Yellow colour, that a

            <head>CHAP. IX. The Diſeaſes proceeding from a vitiated
Pancreatick Juyce.</head>
            <p>EVen as from the Vitiation of the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juyce, we have ſhewed that divers
Functions are hurt; ſo from the ſame Fountain
do we judge that various Effects may be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
Amongſt which we ſhall deſervedly aſſigne
the firſt and chiefeſt place to all Agues, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting
Feavours, becauſe we judge the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
thereof to be aſcribed to the Pancreatick
Juyce, being ſtagnant in one or more of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
Ducts, by reaſon of an Obſtruction made
by Phlegme, and by reaſon of the force of the
Acrimony increaſed, one while ſooner, another
while later, prepareth a paſſage for it ſelf
through the obſtructing Pituity, then cauſing a
vicious Efferveſcency in the Duodenum, and
being tranſlated to the Heart, produceth a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
pulſe.</p>
            <p>Which Opinion, ſeeing that hitherto it hath
been known to few, to avoid confuſion in the
end of this little Book, we have ſet a part an
entire Chapter, wherein we will treat of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Feavers, to which we ſend the Reader,
whilſt in the mean time, we go forward to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64159:67"/>
Diſeaſes, ſpringing from this more intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
juyce.</p>
            <p>It ſeems probable to us, that the cauſe of the
Arthritis (or Gout) derives its original from the
ſaid acid Pancreatick Juyce; namely, when its ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
acidity, either with Phlegme, or the Serum
of the blood is carried to the joynts, and lyeth in
them; the ſymptoms alſo concurring, ſeems to
perſwade the ſame thing to us; for thoſe pains
for the moſt part are wont both to invade,
and be exaſperated with a Paroxyſme of a
Feaver, but according to the diverſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
wherewith the Bile and the inteſtinal
Pituity are affected; ſo thoſe paines of the
Joynts do alſo manifeſt themſelves after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Mode, with the reſt of the concomitant
Symptoms.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing is teſtified by the Urine, which
once for curioſity ſake, we taſted with Doctor
<hi>Rooſendael,</hi> in which we found a notable Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
We have alſo obſerved (which ſeems
not a little to confirm this our Opinion) in
theſe Regions, that Wine, eſpecially Reniſh,
is exceedingly adverſe to thoſe who are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to this Diſtemper; the which we
judge to happen from the ſame, becauſe that
Wine contains in it a greater acidity than other
Wines.</p>
            <p>That this more acid Pancreatick Juyce doth
increaſe Hunger, and ſtir up and inſatiable, and
Dog-like Appetite; few hereafter will doubt,
who have conſidered diligently, that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce, and the ſharp Exhalations
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64159:68"/>
thereof do aſcend even into the Stomach, as
is manifeſt by the Sower Belchings, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
breaking forth, and ſometimes by the
Vomiting forth of Humours, more or leſs
acid.</p>
            <p>If they ſay that that juyce which is effuſed
into the Inteſtine, the breadth of four Fingers
below the Pylorus, cannot aſcend through the
Pylorus into the Stomach, it being naturally
ſhut; we may alſo ask how the Bile (which by
all is granted) may aſcend to the Stomach,
which iſſueth into the Inteſtine by the ſame paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage:
If they ſay it comes to paſs by the in
verted periſtaltick Motion of the Inteſtines,
we then ſay, that by the ſame Motion, the
Pancreatick Juyce may alſo aſcend, to which
we ſhall adde that Exhalations do far more
eaſily aſcend into the Stomach than the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
            <p>More acid Exhalations being excited, from
the Pancreatick Juyce, through its Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and altogether with Flatulencies, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
through the Venae Lactae to the Heart, and
from thence to the Lungs, and there ſticking,
do not only cauſe a difficult Reſpiration, but
alſo a dry Cough; the Confirmation of which,
we have not only ſeen in the Hoſpital of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
but elſe-where: For, in the diffecting of
Dead Bodies, we have often found the Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma
of the Lungs, and its Veſſels, as yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended
with Wind. If a Viſcid Pituity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies
thoſe Windy Exhalations, and be
detained in the Lungs, what doth it then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64159:68"/>
but the Species of an <hi>Aſthma?</hi> But if
thoſe Exhalations, and Flatulencies, do tend
further to the Head, the paines thereof will
produce Alienation of the Mind, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
infinite other Diſcommodities; every
man may believe, That the Epileptick Invaſions
of Children, which they call <hi>Stuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">i. e. the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </note>
doth proceed from the ſaid,
more Acid, Pancreatick Juyce, who
hath accurately attended to thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions,
and the Symptomes accompanying
them, and the way of Cure: For, beſides that
Acidity, which doth very often breath through
the Mouth, they ſuffer the Gripings of the
Belly; the Milk may likewiſe be perceived
to be concreted, both upwards, and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
the Excrements of the belly are more
Green, and give forth a ſharp Odour: they
are alſo cured by the tempering of Acidity:
as for Example, with <hi>Aqua Feniculi, Aqua
Lillioru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Conuallium, Spir. Salis Armoniaci,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſame, more Acid, Pancratick Juyce, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
to the blood, through the Lactean Veines,
will give it a greater Conſiſtency; whence the
Blood, leſs Rarifying, will produce a leſſer
Pulſe: From which, Vice highly exceeding, we
judge a Syncope, ſometimes to be produced,
which is not a little confirmed by that Example
which <hi>Lazarus Riverius</hi> relates in <hi>Lib.</hi> VIII.
<hi>Fol.</hi> 358. of his Practice concerning that <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope,</hi>
which <hi>P. Salius,</hi> as he reports, <hi>Lib. De
Afect. Practic.</hi> Cap. IV. obſerved in a Girle
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64159:69"/>
of 14 Years of Age: Who, after a dayes
ſuffering of Heavineſs of the Head, Vertigo,
and grievous Anxieties, the day following ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
dyed: Afterwards her Body being dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
the whole blood in the great Artery
and the Vena Cava appeared to be Concreted,
and ſo changed that it might intirely be drawn
out from the Vein, and Artery, even as a Sword
out of its Scabbard.</p>
            <p>Concerning which thing, if any doubt, either
by ours, or others Examples, let him take an
acid Liquor, and pour it, by degrees, into the
Vein of any Living Dog, and he ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerve the Blood, therein, to be ſo Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated,
and Concreted, that the greater
bloody Veſſels may be tranſverſly cut, without
the Effuſion of the blood; but alſo when the acid
Liquor ſhall come, in a notable Quantity, to the
right Ventricle of the Heart, that it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
extinguiſh, and kill the Dog. Alſo,
no man will deny, that Convulſions, for the
moſt part, proceed from an Internal Cauſe,
from the Acrimony of Humours, irritating the
Nerves, and cauſing, by a greater Influx of the
animal Spirits, into the Muſcles, Involuntary,
and alſo Violent Motions: But when there is
a two fold Acrimony of Humours, <hi>viz.</hi> Acid,
and Salt, ſome perhaps may doubt, which of
theſe do moſt frequently produce thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive
Motions: But, for as much as we can
obſerve, they rather proceed from an acid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony,
than a Salt: becauſe we ſee that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatick
Medicaments, and thoſe abounding
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64159:69"/>
with a Volatile Salt, do very much conduce
to their Cure; which would never come to
paſs, if they drew their Original from a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Acrimony. Beſides, they are accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſuch Symptomes, which are wont to
be the Concomitants of Diſeaſes, ariſing
from an acid Acrimony: Yea, the Effects of
Acids are allowed to be far more powerful,
as is to be ſeen in <hi>Helmont</hi> De Lithiaſi. <hi>Cap. 9.
Pag. 725. §.</hi> 71. where he relates, that he ſaw
a Chymiſt, which, after he had been much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
about making of <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> he fell
into the Palpitation of the Heart, Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and many other Incredible Dolours, by
reaſon of the acid Exhalations, which mingled
themſelves with his Blood. From the ſame
Acidity we ſtedfaſtly believe, That the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury
is very often produced, ſeeing that, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with other Students, we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
found the Urines of ſuch as have labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
under the Strangury, in the Hoſpital of
<hi>Leyden,</hi> to be Acid; and alſo ſeen the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
cured with ſuch Medicines, as temper A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity.</p>
            <p>The which if you are minded to try, ſaith
<hi>Helmont,</hi> De Pleura Furente §. 14. <q>Whether
or no the Strangury may not proceed from Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
mix ſome Drops at leaſt of ſharp Wine, with
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, lately ſent forth without pain, and
inject it again by a Syringe, and you ſhall find,
to your Pain, that what I ſay, is true.</q> Alſo, that
from the more acid Pancreatick Juyce, Ulcers do
ſometimes break forth in the Skin, corroding the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64159:70"/>
ſame, as alſo producing very great paines, they
will not deny, who, following the Opinions of
the Antients, determine them to ariſe from the
<hi>Atra-Bilis;</hi> ſeeing that the <hi>Atra-Bilis</hi> of the
Antients (as we have above Demonſtrated) hath
its Original from the more acid Pancreatick
Juyce.</p>
            <p>We are like-wiſe plainly perſwaded, that
the more acid Pancreatick Juyce, eſpecially
if it hath any Auſterity conjoyned with it,
produceth a greater aſtringency of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>For, if the Bile, by its Acrimony irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Guts (as is granted) may excite the
Flux of the Belly, why may not that, which
is contrary to ſuch a Bile, produce a contrary
Effect? Notwithſtanding, if the belly be bound
by a Viſcid Matter, then we think, likewiſe,
that a Flux may happen from the ſharper Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce, as it hath a power of inciding,
and attenuating, the Viſcid Pituity: From
which it is manifeſt, that the Pancreatick
Juyce, according to the Diverſity of Humours,
concurring with it, doth very often produce
a diverſe and contrary Effect; which thing we
would have well noted, leſt we ſhould ſeem to
contradict our ſelf, in explicating the Effects of
this juyce.</p>
            <p>As yet we think, even as we ſeem to have
already ſaid, that the <hi>Atra</hi> and <hi>Eruginous</hi> Bile
is excited from the more acid Pancreatick
Juyce, and a certain ſharp Bile concurring;
and conſequently all Diſeaſes, which Authors
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64159:70"/>
deduce from them; and therefore they are not
cured by other Medicaments, than thoſe which
are fit to correct the more acid Pancreatick
Juyce: Which, as it is Conſonant with
Reaſon; ſo it will not appear Incredible to
thoſe, who will conſider the things above
ſpoken by us, with a more attentive
Mind.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſome will ſay, after what manner
doth the Pancreatick Juyce produce the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-Bilis,</hi>
ſeeing that we have aſcribed the
Whitiſhneſs of the Chyle, after the Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
in the thin Gut, to the acidity of the
Pancreatick Juyce? To which we anſwer,
That Acids, according to the Diverſity of the
matter where-with they are mixed, do alſo
produce a divers Colour; for example, pour
an acid Spirit to common Sulphur, diſſolved
in a Lixivium, and its red Colour will be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into white. Antimony Calcind, with Nitre
or Chalk, being boyl'd in Fountain-Water,
and any acid thing, being affuſed to its clear
Colature, will preſently acquire a Saffron Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
            <p>A clear Infuſion of Galls, mixed with the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Vitriol, maketh Ink, to which, if you
add the acid Spirit of Vitriol, that Ink will
loſe all its blackneſs, and become clear, like
to Fountain-Water. The Blew Tincture of
Violets, being mixed with Oyle of Vitriol,
will wax into a Purple. The Wood Acanthus
brought from <hi>Braſile,</hi> being infuſed in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Water, doth freely yeild a red Tincture,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64159:71"/>
which put to Diſtilled Vinegar, acquires a
Colour like to White-Wine. A Knife, after
it, hath cut a Pomecitron, in the Middle, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be wiped, and cleanſed, from the Soure
Juyce of the Citron, in a ſhort time will be
reduced to a nigrous Colour. And why from
the ſame acidity too much exalted in Ulcers, the
Cyrurgions Probe may not be ſtained with a
certain Blackneſs, (as we have very often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved)
and ſuch Ulcers be happily cured by
Temperating of the acidity, (as <hi>Helmont</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
<hi>De Blaſe humano, §.</hi> 53. we leave to the
judgment of others?</p>
            <p>It may here ſuffice for us to have proved, that
from one and the ſame acid, permixed with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
things; one while a White, another a
Black, another a Yellow, another a Purple, and
ſo moreover other Colours may ariſe. He
which deſireth to excite many Colours in the
Solution of Minerals and Vegitables endued
with no Colour, let him go to that moſt curious
Treatiſe which D. <hi>Willis</hi> hath written, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fermentation, where <hi>pag. 88. Edit. Ang.</hi>
he may find very many Mutations of Colours
not unprofitable; and being about to aſſigne the
Reaſon thereof, he ſaith in the following page:
<q>If the reaſon of this Phaeno-mena be enquired, it
ought altogether to be deduced from thoſe minute
particles within the pores of every contained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor;
which according to the ſcituation and poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being after a divers manner altered by the Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of another Liquor, do diverſly tranſmit the
beams of the light, and manifoldly break, or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64159:71"/>
reflect it, and ſo cauſe the divers appearances of
Colours, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having now unfolded the Diſeaſes riſen from
the more acid Pancreatick Juyce, we ſeem in
our ſelves to hear ſome in ſhort to ask the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
from whence the acid Humour in the body
may proceed, if we do not uſe any acid things?
To which we anſwer, that we can in no wiſe
want thoſe things which abound with an acidity.
For there is an acidity in the air, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
if the Caput Mortuum of Vitriol be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the air, which from the ſame eliciteth
a new acidity. Alſo, that the air is full of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
particles, <hi>Gaſſendus, Entius, Digbaeus,</hi>
and others, which profeſſedly, or otherwiſe
ingeniouſly treat of this Matter, have proved:
But no man is ignorant, that Nitre containeth
in it ſelf an acidity. There is alſo an acidity
inherent in Aliments: For in Kitchings, if fleſh,
or other Aliments, begin to corrupt, their
Broth doth wax ſower; yea, we have collected
an acid Spirit in quantity ſufficiently large, from
the ſweeteſt of Condiments, to wit, Sugar, by
chymical Art.</p>
            <p>There is alſo an acidity inherent in Drink;
for Beer, or Ale, as alſo Wine, being left to
themſelves, without the addition of any other
thing, do wax Soure: From whence, it is no
wonder, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Lib. De
Vet. Med.</hi> Text. 24 that there ſhould be an
Acidity in Men. But, it being granted, that there
is an acid Humour in our Bodies, ſome one,
more deſirous of Truth, may ask, How it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64159:72"/>
comes to paſs, that it doth not only corrode
the parts of our Bodies, but alſo Copper, and
Tinn, as we have ſhewed above? To this we
ſhall alſo anſwer, That the Fermentations,
continually happening in our Bodies, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for this thing: For, we daily ſee that by
their help, many things are very ſharp, which
before were ſweet, or at leaſt Temperate:
VVhether now this may happen by the Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the animal Spirits, or by reaſon of
any other inward Cauſe, we leave to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others. Likewiſe, Experience teſtifies,
that Men, feeding upon a cold Diet, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
for the ſame Reaſon, and Cauſe, fall into
burning Feavers.</p>
            <p>We have alſo deſervedly aſcribed the Uterine
Suffocation, or Mother-fits, ſo called, to the
Pancreatick juyce divers ways vitiated, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
the Auſtere: The following Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſeems to give us no ſmall light into the Truth
of this Matter, which our Friend <hi>Elſnerus,</hi> in
the Year 1667. ſent to us from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Ande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave:</hi> 
               <q>We opened <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> a Maid, extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Suffocation of the Womb, in whoſe dead
body we found nothing at all, to which death might
be aſcribed, but the blood coagulated in the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles
of the Heart, beyond the order of Nature.</q>
Which too much coagulation of the blood may
not be deduced from any other cauſe, than
from an acid Juyce, as we have ſufficiently
proved.</p>
            <p>But the reaſon why we judge that this Effect
is not produced by the Pancreatick Juyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64159:72"/>
ſimply acid, is, that all women which have
a ſharp Pancreatick Juyce, are not affected with
that Diſeaſe: And therefore we do the more
eaſily believe, that there is an auſterity, or
harſh Sowerneſs preſent with it; becauſe we
have known almoſt the like Diſeaſe excited
from the Pancreatick Juyce, being auſtere, in a
certain Bitch, as alſo in a Famous Man, the
truth of which the following Teſtimony freely
exhibiteth to us; done in the Year 1663. as it
was communicated to me by the moſt expert
Dr. <hi>Sylvius:</hi> 
               <q> I teſted the Pancreatick Juyce,
and found it (firſt) as it were Saltiſh; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
the Reliſh being ſome-what changed, it
ſeemed then to be Sub-acid, with a light Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
There was ſuch a Stink produced in my
Mouth, that two of my Acquaintance, which
were with us, admoniſhed me concerning it: The
Stink was like to that which riſeth from Muddy,
and ſtrinking Water. My Mouth, and Jaws,
were not only exſiccated, or dried, but alſo ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringed,
that I ſeemed to be ſuffoccated; which
like thing, I ſuffer by a Diſeaſe familiar to me:
And all theſe things vaniſhed not ſuddainly, but
remained, and endured for a while, till they
left me by Degrees, and of their own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Bitch's Juyce was brought to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Dr. <hi>Sylvius,</hi> and exhibited to his Taſt,
in our preſence. From this, and the like Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
it ſeemeth not abſurd to aſſert,
That Men may ſome-time be affected with a
like Hyſterick Suffocation; eſpecially, when
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64159:73"/>
its neareſt Cauſe happens, not from the
VVomb, but from the ſmall Gut; in which,
by reaſon of the Vitious Efferveſcency of
concurring Humours excited, Exhalations,
and auſtere Flatulencies are ſtirred up;
which, as often as they ariſe through the
Oeſephagus, or Gullet, and come to the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria-Aſperia,
or Wind-Pipe, they ſo conſtringe
thoſe parts, that the Sick think themſelves
to be in the peril of Strangulation, or Choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>That divers Species of the Hypocondriack
Affection may be produced by the ſaid Pancre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick
juyce divers ways vitiated, the Books of
Practical Phyſitians do teſtifie, and the ſymptoms
confirme. But that we ſtay no longer upon the
more acid, and auſtere Pancreatick juyce, and
the effects from them ariſing; we think fit to
deduce at leaſt one effect from the ſaid juyce
more Salt, imagine a ſerous Diarrhaea, which
by its ſaline Acrimony, produceth a more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and more frequent periſtaltick Motion of
the Gutts.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being rightly conſidered, we
doubt not but that by a diligent tract of time,
by the Obſervation of thoſe who happen to be
converſant about the Sick, many effects will be
made more manifeſt: And if there be more of
Art in knowing than in curing Diſeaſes, who
ſees not that this Pancreatick juyce being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
known, the cure of many Diſeaſes may
be performed more eaſily, more ſpeedily, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64159:73"/>
more profitably. Firſt of all in this Treatiſe,
we have deſcribed the Diſeaſes taking their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
from a more acid Pancreatick juyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they more often occur, and produce
greater trouble, than thoſe which derive their
Original from this juyce by any other way
vitiated, for the acid Humour excelling the

be Corrected.</head>
            <p>SEeing that it is not ſufficient to have ſaid in
what manner the Pancreatick Juyce may
offend, Namely, by exerciſing too great an
Acidity, Salſitude, and Amaritude; we have
not reſtored it, ſaith <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> before that
the ſame be purged, and overthrown by the
admixing of other things, <hi>Lib. de vet. Med.</hi>
Text 34.</p>
            <p>But with what Medicaments the Vices of the
Pancreatick Juyce, above declared, may more
eaſily be tempered, or evacuated we ſhall now
handle in brief.</p>
            <p>The more ſparing Separation, or Excretion,
of the Pancreatick Juyce, happening by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Viſcidity, will be cured by Medicines,
correcting any Viſcidity; ſuch are Volatile
Acids, as alſo Salts, as well Volatile as Fixt;
eſpecially the Volatile Salt of Amber ſeems to
agree with our buſineſs; which, beſides the
Volatile Salt, alſo containes certain Acid Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles:
But, as often as the Pancreatick Juyce
is thought to be leſs acid, then uſe pure Acids,
on the contrary, as often as the Acidity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
exceeds, then Salts are moſt conducible.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64159:74"/>
When the Excretion of the Pancreatick Juyce
is more ſparing, by reaſon of an Obſtruction
happening in one or more of the Lateral
Ducts, the Medicines, but now ſpoken of, are
alſo profitable; for, except they looſen,
cleanſe, and caſt forth the Obſtructing Pituity,
or Remedy the Viſcous Crudity of the Blood,
they will certainly profit nothing, as we ſhall
endeavour, more largely, to explain the ſame
in the ſubſequent Chapter, when we ſhall treat
of intermitting Feavers.</p>
            <p>The more Copious Increaſe of the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juyce, will be Cured, as well by abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from much Drink, eſpecially ſuch as is
ſharp; alſo by uſing ſuch Medicaments as
may expel it from the body by the belly; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
Sweats, and Urines. But, among ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments,
as educe it by the Belly, ſuch as
Purge-Water, are convenient above others;
by help whereof, the Serous Humours are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
more than the Bilious: which, ſome
years ſince, we have obſerved in not a few
Dogs, to whom we exhibited, as well Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragogues
as Cholagues; and, ſeeing that they
excellently deponed the belly, we ſuddenly
opened the Abdomen, at the very time of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
the Dog's as yet living; which done,
we could obſerve, although difficulty, in thoſe
to whom we had given a Cholagogue, <hi>viz.</hi> one
Dram of Diagredium, that the Bile did flow in
a far greater Quantity, from the Inteſtinal biliar
Duct; but in another, to whom we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
a Hydragogue, namely, of Powder
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64159:75"/>
of Jallap two Drams, we obſerved that the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce did break forth in a large Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
from its Ductus into the Inteſtines, although
then the Bile alſo did iſſue forth in a great
Quantity; and in another, to whom we had
given a Cholagogue, the Pancreatick Juyce
did alſo flow forth in a greater Quantity, than
uſuall; nevertheleſs we are able to collect,
that the Bile is far more Copiouſly purged by
Cholagogues, and the Pancreatick Juyce by
Hydragogues.</p>
            <p>In theſe Experiments, performed other
things, did yet occur, worthy of note; for
firſt of all, at the very time of purgation, there
was nothing depoſited through the Meſeraick
Arteries into the Cavity of the Inteſtines; but
what ſo ever of a Liquid matter remained in
them, after expreſſion, was ſucked up by the
Venae Lacteae, or Meſeraick Veines. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
That thoſe Ducts, in whom the Lactean
Veines appeared not: After 3. or 4. Hours
Exhibition of Aliment, we cut the Abdomen in
them; neither the Bile, nor the Pancreatick
Juyce, was carryed to the Inteſtine, in a more
than uſual Quantity. Concerning which, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that other things, as yet remain to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to, we ſhall defer it to another occaſion,
untill by many Experiments, more ſurely
made, we ſhall more perfectly (alſo) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the force of other Medicaments. The
Pancreatick Juyce, over Fluid, will be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the prudent aſſumption of Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
Aliments; ſuch are Pills of Hound's
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64159:75"/>
Tongue, and other things which incraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate.</p>
            <p>In reference to the Qualities of the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juyce, perceptible to the taſt, if it offends
by too much Acidity, Auſterity, or Salſity, it
will be cured, <hi>Firſt,</hi> With altering Medicines,

that will eaſily be abſolved by the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the Medicines, even now ſpoken
of.</p>
            <p>The more Acid Pancreatick Juyce will be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>Firſt,</hi> With a pure Volatile Salt, as an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatick,
by tempering the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It will be cured with a Lixivious
Salt, as well fixed as Volatile, by infringing
its Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It will be cured by Crabs Eyes,
Coralls, Chalk, Shells, eſpecially being Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined,
fileings of Steel, and the like, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrating
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It will be cured, by Oleous Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
as alſo, by diverſe Oyles, made as well
by expreſſion, as Diſtillation, as it were Wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

Feavers.</head>
            <p>BEcauſe we have before promiſed, in the
Nineth Chapter, that we would, in this
place, demonſtrate, that Intermitting Feavers
have their Original from the Preternatural Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the ſaid Pancreatick Juyce, we
cannot but annex their Hiſtory; not becauſe,
the difficulty of Explicating theſe Feavers, is
obſcure to us, nor ſhunneth none of the moſt
Expert Phyſitians; So as, hither-to, they have
not ſatisfied the Curious in their Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
So that, being by moſt paſſed over with
a dry Foot, they have left behind them a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of innumerable Difficulties; but, becauſe
we judge it to be a thing of ſo great moment,
that as many as hither-to have given themſelves
to the ſearch of Intermitting Feavers, have
ſtill deſired to this Labour, the further Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of other Learned Men: For, very many
Diſeaſes do every day occur in our Practice,
wherein that Feaver either proceedeth, is
concomitant, or doth follow; So that, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it requireth an intire Method of Curation,
for it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:64159:77"/>
Which, ſeeing it is ſo, we think our Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and Experiments, not to be ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Curious Searchers of Nature, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if we hold their minds not long in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
by rehearſing the Sentenſes and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of many Authors, as they ordinarily have
done, who have gone before us, in the ſame
kind of Study: or retain thoſe things, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an intire Series of Queſtions, relating more
to Curioſity, than to the neceſſity of the thing
to be known; but we ſhall preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
in a few words, as much as is poſſible,
thoſe things which we judge concerning this
matter.</p>
            <p>Seeing that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath rightly ſaid, <hi>Lib.</hi>
2. Phyſic. <hi>Cap. 13.</hi> 
               <q> That there can be a ſure
Knowledge of nothing, the Cauſe, or Original
whereof, is not known:</q> We, contrary to the
Common Order, ſhall endeavour to purſue the
Nature of Intermitting Feavers, by ſearching
out their Signes and Cauſes.</p>
            <p>Seeing that all Phyſitians, which have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-to
written of Intermitting Feavers, cry
out that their Pathognomick Signe is a more
Frequent, and Preternatural Pulſe; to know
the Nature, altogether of Intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
by ſearching into the Cauſes of the Pulſe,
we judge with the never ſufficiently praiſed
<hi>Fran. de le Boe-Sylvius,</hi> that the Cauſe of
a more Preternatural Pulſe, is either (firſt) the
too much, and Permanent Rare-faction of the
Blood, ariſing from a more Potent Fire,
breaking forth from the Efferveſcency of both
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64159:77"/>
Bloods. Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe of any ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
being at one time Acid, at another Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
another while briniſhly Salt, driven
through the Veines, with the Blood, to the
Heart, and Internally gnawing the Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
of the Heart. Or, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſomething
halituouſly Flatulent, and like-wiſe carried
with the Blood to the Heart, or excited, by
the Efferveſcency, in the Heart; and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Explication of the Ventricles of the
Heart. Or, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> ſomething ſharp, or
hard, either in the Peri-cardium, or elſe-where
exiſting, and externally gnawing, or pricking the
Heart.</p>
            <p>Theſe few things being premiſed, there is
none but may ſee, that the cauſe of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Feavers, is continually carryed to the
Heart, but the cauſe of Intermittents by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.
It is not our purpoſe here to ſpeak of
Continual Feavers, thoſe that are deſirous of
ſearching out, and knowing of the Nature of
thoſe, we recommend them to the Practice of
Dr. <hi>Sylvius,</hi> where, amongſt other things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately
delivered, they may find the exact
Deſcription of thoſe Feavers, <hi>Chap. 29. Pag.</hi>
407. And we, in the mean-time, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to deliver the Deſcription of Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Feavers, ſhall ſay, That ſuch a Focus, or
Minera, of Intermitting Feavers, is required,
which is apt to tranſmit the cauſe of a more
frequent, and Preternatural Pulſe, by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
to the Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:64159:78"/>
Sundry men have ſought this Minera, in
diverſe parts of the Body; ſome have imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
they have found it in the Maſs of Blood,
which, to ſome others ſeemed leſs true, to
whom the Continual Motion of the Blood, was
known; becauſe the Circulation of the
Blood is performed once, twice, or four times
a day: For, the moſt accurate Dr. <hi>Lower,</hi> in
his Treatife of the Heart, <hi>Fol.</hi> 156. proveth,
<q>That the Blood of a Man, well diſpoſed, circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth
through the Heart, in the ſpace of one
Hour, thirty times:</q> But being granted, (which
in no wiſe, may be denyed) that the Maſs
of Blood, of the whole body at leaſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in a Day, doth flow back to the Heart;
part of which, if evilly affected, as often as
it tranſiteth the Heart, would produce a Fit
of a Feaver; and ſo, from the Blood natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
following, neither a Tertian, or a Quartan
Feaver may be deduced, unleſs they ſay that
the Blood doth abſolve this Tragedy, being
preternaturally detained in any part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
which like-wiſe, doth not alike appear
to thoſe, to whom it is known, how eaſily the
Volatile Spirits exhale, by the Detention of
the blood, and the remaining Particles of
the blood being made more ſharp, do ſuddenly
excite, mutually, among themſelves, a Heat
and Inflamation of the Part; to which, if an
Apoſteme be ſubjoyned that will affect the
Blood, paſſing through its Circuits continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and not by Intervals: Whence if a
Feaver follows, it ought not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64159:78"/>
an Intermitting, but a Continuall Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>If they ſay that the obſtruction is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to the generation of intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
but to furniſh the phlegme which is of
that nature that daily, the yellow Bile w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> every
third day, and the Atra-bile which every fourth
day may produce a certain ebullition: many of
a higher ingenuity, may ask firſt whether or
no thoſe humours ſuch as they are deſcribed
in the Schools can be Demonſtrated to be in
the maſs of Blood, ſeeing it is evident by what
is already ſaid the Atrabilis derives its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
from the yellow Bile, and more acid pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce. Secondly, how doth that ſeem
probable that a humour more cold, tenatious,
and unapt for motion, as phlegme, daily, and
a hot humour being more fluid and being fit
for motion as yellow Choler, ſhould every other
day onely excite a feaveriſh Ebullition in the
Blood; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> how intermitting Feavers may
be changed from quotidians into tertrans, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
and the contrary. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> to what humours
they can aſcribe Quintans, ſextans, or thoſe
which have more ſeldome periods (of which
<hi>Fernelius</hi> lib. 4. cap. 14.) if they determine
that each Feavour draws its Original from a
certain peculiar Humour.</p>
            <p>But they which have held the minera of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting
Feavers to be latent in ſome part of
the Body, have moſt of them ſought it in the
Abdomen; for nauceouſneſs, loathing of Food,
Torments, Colds, Horrors, Rigors, and other
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64159:79"/>
preludiums of the fits conſpicuous to none but
ſuch as are more attentively diſpoſed, do ſhew
the Abdomen to be evilly habited. A vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
excited either by Nature or Art, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often, preſently aſſwageing the fierceneſs of
the fits, ſheweth the principal ways or paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
thereof to be evilly habited. The Cure it
ſelf of the Abdomen alſo in the beginning of the
acceſs declareth the ſame according to <hi>Fernelius</hi>
de ſede intermittentium <hi>lib. 4. cap.</hi> 10. for Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
applied to the Hypocondriaes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a remiſſion of horror, rigor, and other
Symptomes.</p>
            <p>But what part of the Abdomen in theſe Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
is evilly affected, hath wearied the brains
of many; for ſo confuſedly have they ſought
their minera, that nothing of certainty can be
concluded from their writings or opinions; for
ſome have ſought it in the meſeraick Veines,
ſome in the Branches of the vena porta between
the Liver and the Spleen, ſome in other Veſſels,
yea alſo in the great Colon, the duplicature of
the Omentum which is under the ventricle,
and in innumerable other things have they
determined the focus of intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
whoſe Clouds of falſity in theſe our
more happy times the ſun of Truth hath ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed
and diſſipated, that they want not our
improvement. Therefore leaſt we conſume our
own, and the Readers time, by writing more
things obvious as well in the Books of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
as in the Moderns, we ſhall willingly paſs
them by: Seeing that the cauſe of all intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64159:79"/>
Feavours ſeemes to us to be contained in
the pancreas alone.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this Opinion is this, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conſidered the parts of the whole Body of
man, which by intervals only may tranſmit the
Cauſe of theſe Feavers to the heart, none can be
found in the whole body to which not only the
Focus of intermitting Feavers, but alſo the cauſes
of all their ſymptomes may be imputed beſides
the Pancreas.</p>
            <p>But ſome perhaps may ſay, that heat, thirſt,
ulcers, breaking forth in the lips of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh,
bitter Vomitings, Cholerick Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and other ſymtomes wont to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tertain Feavers do declare the bile to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
offended, wherefore the Cauſe of all
intermitting Feavers ought not to be aſcribed
to the pancreas alone.</p>
            <p>But truly this objection will fall of its own
accord, thoſe things being known which we ſhall
ſpeak of in the following Diſcourſe concerning
the Reaſons of divers Symptomes; for we
know that in tertians the bile is very often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant,
but it is to be noted that its abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
doth not cauſe an intermitting Feaver;
becauſe that is perceived after it hath excited a
vitious Efferveſency by intervals with the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice, in which if the bile gets Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
the ſigns thereof even now declared do
ſomtimes manifeſt themſelves; but becauſe
this Efferveſcency proceeds from the pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juice preternaturally diſpoſed, that Feaver
is not aſcribed to the Bile, but to the Pancrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64159:80"/>
Juyce, as, by the Sequel, ſhall more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear. We judge the cauſe of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Feavers to be an Obſtruction, made
in one or more of the Lateral Ducts; becauſe
of Pituity, carryed thither in too large a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
and there detained: VVhich thing ſeems
to us to happen for the following Reaſon;
to wit, For as much, as the Pituity, of the thin
Guts, eſpecially that ſticking to the ſides, leſt
they ſhould be hurt by the abounding Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
being in too great a quantity, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the immoderate Exerciſes of the Body,
and perhaps by an over-much uſe of hot Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or by ſome Error, committed in the
ſix Non-Naturals, is diſſolved, and with other
Humours, carryed to the Heart, by the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky
Veines: From whence, by the Order of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
this Phlegmatick Matter, together with
the reſt of the Blood, is driven to the Pancreas;
and being ſeparated in its Glandules, with the
Pancreatick Juyce, it enters the Lateral Ducts
of the Pancreas; in which, either by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Cold, or of that Bowel it concreteth,
and is Coagulated; by which reaſon, it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth
either one or more of the Laterall
Ducts.</p>
            <p>VVe think the acceſſes of intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
ought to be aſcribed to the Pancreatick
Juyce, ſtagnant in one or more of the Lateral
Ducts, by reaſon of an Obſtruction; and one
while ſooner, another while later, preparing
a way for it ſelf, through the Obſtructing
Phlegme, by its Acrimony increaſed; and not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64159:80"/>
only cauſing a Vitious Efferveſcency in the
ſmall Gut; but being every way carryed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to the Heart, produceth a more frequent,
and preternatural Pulſe.</p>
            <p>Which, that it may more clearly appear, we
ſhall ſpend a little time in the unfolding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>That Coagulation, which we have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to happen in the Pancreatick Juyce, we
have ſome-time obſerved in a Dog, whoſe
Juyce we endeavoured to collect in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
time; which, by the cold of the Ambient Air,
was ſo thickned, that only a little would flow
forth, and of a groſs Conſiſtency, untill the
Dog, being placed before the Fire, between
two Pillows began to grow hot; from
whence the Pancreatick Juyce did flow more
Fluid, and more Copiouſly. We have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that the Coagulation of the Pancreatick
Juyce hath excited Obſtructions, in the Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Ducts, of the Pancreas, as in the Year
1663, with the Famous Dr. <hi>Sylvius,</hi> in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Woman, labouring under an intermitting
Feaver, into whoſe Ductus Pancreaticus, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Death, we injected, by a Syringe, a very
Volatile blewiſh Liquor; which, out of the
great Duct, into which it was caſt, did pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
into moſt of the Lateral Ducts, whilſt
in a few, although more near to the Inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
great Duct, by reaſon of an Obſtruction,
it was ſtopped: From whence, by the ſaid
Colour, the Subſtance of the Pancreas it ſelf, was
tinged in one place, and not in another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:64159:81"/>
The Pancreatick Juyce, being ſtagnant in
one or more of the Lateral Ducts, by reaſon
of an Obſtruction, by its delay becometh
more ſharp, and at length, perforating the
Obſtructing Phlegme, prepareth it ſelf a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
through the Obſtruction, into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or middle Duct, until all the detained
Juyce, being effuſed, the Phlegme as yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereing
to the ſides of the Duct, grows toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
again, and by its mutual Reunion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
the Obſtruction: Whence at length, the
Pancreatick Juyce is Collected for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fit; which again, by its delay, being
made more ſharp, doth again perforate the
Obſtructing Pituity, and produceth a new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſme;
which Fits, return alwayes at the
ſame time, as often as the Pituity, cauſing the
Obſtruction, doth occur, in the ſame Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
and Viſcidity, with the Pancreatick
Juyce, of the ſame Acidity, and Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>The Pancreatick Juyce is made more ſharp
by Stagnation, in as much, as the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
do not ſo ſtraightly embrace it, but leave
it obſtructing: Hence therefore, by the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
Spirits, wont to attemper it, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds
a greater Acidity of the Pancreatick
Juyce. Would you have a Simillitude? We
will grant it: New Ale, included in Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
Whether or no, by a certain delay, it
doth not loſe its Sweetneſs? Conſider, that
all Wine turns to Vinegar, the Spirits being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated;
alſo that Vinegar it ſelf, by delay, is
made more ſharp.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:64159:81"/>
For, every heat, diſſipating the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
cauſeth every ſharp thing to be more
ſharp: So that, it ought to ſeem ſtrange to
none, if we ſay, that the Pancreatick Juyce,
by ſtagnation, deſerteth its genuine Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and paſſeth into a more acid Acrimony.
But the Pancreatick Juyce, being made more
ſharp by ſtagnation, and effuſed into the thin
Gut, with the Flegmme and Bile, ſtirs up a
vitious Efferveſcency; and indeed, by reaſon of
ſuch a Pancreatick Juyce, ſtretchings, yawnings,
and horrors are produced, and every-where a
ſence of Cold, eſpecially in the Region of the
Loynes, in which the Fit begins. Neither is
that firſt called a Feaver, which either the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce, it ſelf, vitiouſly Efferveſcing in
the ſmall Gut; or at leaſt, Exhalations from
thence ariſing, and at length, carryed to the
right Ventricle of the Heart; and, after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
manner, irritating it to a more frequent
Contraction of it ſelf. But we judge that the
Pancreatick Juyce, by its acid Acrimony, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
this thing; although nothing hinders, but
that ſomething of a Saline Acrimony, ariſing
from the Bile may concur: becauſe we daily
obſerve, that Exhalations do aſcend in the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency,
between Acids and Salts; which,
being moved to the Noſe, by its Acrimony,
cauſeth Offence. Intermitting Feavers by the
reaſon already given, proceeding from the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce, are divided into Simple, and
Compound; the Simple, by reaſon of their
Fits, returning at divers times, are diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64159:82"/>
into Quotidians which daily, Tertians which
every other day, &amp; Quartans which on the fourth
day, Quintans which on the fifth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do return.</p>
            <p>Thoſe are called Compound which excite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
fits in one and the ſame ſick perſon, and
they are either of the ſame Species: as double
quotidians, double or treble tertians, double or
treble quartans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or they are of a divers
Species, as a Quotidian with a Tertian, a Terti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
with a Quartan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſhall ſay nothing in
this place concerning thoſe Feavers which are
compounded of intermittents and continual, tho
we know they are daily to be obſerved by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners;
for he which hath known &amp; inſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Nature of intermitting and continual
Feavers, may conſider that this complication
carryes nothing of difficulty to our Opinion,
which is clearer than the Meridian Light. They
are alſo diſtinguiſhed by reaſon of an urgent
cold, and heat into cold, and burning Feavers;
although for the moſt part the cold is wont to
go before, and the heat to follow, <hi>Vanhelmont</hi>
in his Treatiſe of Feavers <hi>Chap. 1. §.</hi> 5. Writes
that the ſick are ſometimes troubled with cold
alone, and experience alſo witneſſeth the ſame.</p>
            <p>Hence unleſs we be egregiouſly Deceived,
we may infer with the ſureſt Foundation, that
the eſſence of Feavers conſiſts not in heat (as
many lead by ſpeculation, more than by the
verity of the matter, do boldly maintain) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
then heat would be allways preſent with
the Feaver: neither could the Feaver be
exiſtent without heat, which nevertheleſs,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64159:82"/>
they do, or may obſerve daily, who leaſt of all
attend to the practiſe of Phyſick, do but viſit
the ſick: I ſay they may obſerve in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of moſt intermitting Feavers, when the
bodies of the ſick are terrified and ſhaken with
cold, that cold alone is troubleſome. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
leſt it ſhould ſeem a new and unheard
of thing, which we ſpeak, that the Eſſence of
Feavers doth not conſiſt in heat, beſides experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
we ſhall bring the Authority of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
which ſeems to teach the ſame thing <hi>lib.
De Vet. Med. Text.</hi> 30. 7. where he ſaith:</p>
            <q>I think this to be the greateſt ſign that men do
fall into Feavers not ſimply becauſe of heat, neither is
this ſimply the Cauſe of the affliction; but it is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and hot, and hot and acid, and ſalt and hot,
and infinite other things; and again cold conjoyn'd
with other faculties. Theſe therefore are the
things which hurt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>But if any one notwithſtanding be ſo captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his prejudices, that he denies a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and a horrour to be the beginning of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting
Feavers, let him alſo perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as he muſt, that thoſe who at the time of
that cold do die (as others have often ſeen,
and our ſelf alſo within this eight days) expire
without a feaver; which nevertheleſs to men
converſant in Phyſick, will ſeem no leſs falſe
than ridiculous.</p>
            <p>Perhaps no man will deny that in ſome fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
tertains eſpecially, no Cold being percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and by reaſon of heat alone continually
urging at the time of the fits, they may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64159:83"/>
burning feavers, and although any through
a deſire of Contradiction ſhould deny that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
ſuch feavers will not therefore ceaſe to be
obſerved.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch as no feaver makes its progreſs
alone, but for the moſt part is accompanied with
divers ſymptomes, ſome of which do torment
the ſick no leſs than the feaver it ſelf, they are
diſtinguiſhed, or at leaſtwiſe may be according
to the diverſity of ſymptomes manifeſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with each fit into Syncopals, Hyſtericks,
Colical, Raving, Greedy, Aſtmatical, Arthritical,
Catharral, Emeticks, Catharticks, Salivals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If
any demand a Reaſon, why the fits return one
while daily, another every third day, another
every fourth or fifth day, and that ſo certain as
the hand of a Dial goes not more exactly?
We ſhall ſay that all the diverſity depends,
partly upon the diverſity of obſtructing phlegm,
partly that of the ſtagnant Pancreatick Juice, for
as there is found in the lateral Duct obſtructed
more or leſs pituity, and as it is more or leſs
viſcid, and the Pancreatick Juice more or leſs
ſharp, ſo the pituity cauſing the obſtruction,
will ſooner or later be perforated by the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratick
juice being made ſharp by ſtagnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>And although the beginnings of fits mutually
following one another, are not always diſtant
24. 48. or 72. houres; but ſometimes 18,
ſometimes 24, ſometimes 30, ſometimes 36,
and 40 Houres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nevertheleſs Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
are wont to diſtinguiſh the fits according
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64159:83"/>
to daies; ſo that by quotidians they intend not
only thoſe which return every 24. houres, but
theſe alſo which make their acceſſes in 18. yea,
30 houres; the former of which they call Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents
or going before, the later poſt-ponents.
[which word is generally underſtood] So thoſe
fits which return every 48. houres are truly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
for tertians, but not thoſe only; for
they alſo which are returned every 36. or 40.
houres are called tertians, but anteponents, as
alſo thoſe which are repeated every 50. 55. or
60. houres are called Tertians, and likewiſe
Poſt-ponents.</p>
            <p>The Cauſe of this inequallity of the fits,
ſeems to us to proceed from the obſtructing
phlegme being more or leſs viſcid, or the whole
Pancreatick Juice more or leſs ſharp, and that
by reaſon of the diverſe uſe of the ſix Non-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</p>
            <p>By this reaſon it is not difficult to us to
unfold how Quotidian feavers are changed into
Tertians, and Tertians into Quartans, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
into Quintans, and the contrary; which
thing they find very difficult, who determine
that Quotidians ariſe from Phlegme, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
from Yellow Choler, and Quartans from
Melancholy.</p>
            <p>The Fits return ſo long, as the obſtructing
Pituity is not totally removed from the Duct,
but remaining therein is again compelled to
renew the Obſtruction; But when the Viſcid
Phlegme, either of its own accord, or by art,
is ſo evacuated, that nothing thereof remains,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64159:84"/>
which may be joyned together, whereby the
obſtruction may be renewed; then alſo the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
are Cured. But as often as only one of
the Lateral Ducts is obſtructed, ſo often is one,
and indeed a ſimple Feaver, produced. But as
often, as many of the Lateral Ducts are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
together, ſo often are many and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
Compound Feavers produced; which
are either of the ſame, or of a diverſe Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
Obſtructions are of the ſame Species,
when they are of the ſame Nature, and Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
in diverſe Ducts of the ſame Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
Obſtructions are of a diverſe Species,
when they are of a diverſe Nature, and Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
in diverſe Ducts, in like manner diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from one another in Magnitude. We ſay
in diverſe Ducts of the ſame, or a diverſe Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
ſeeing that as often as the Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ariſeth from a like Pituity, in diverſe Ducts,
of the ſame Magnitude, and Amplitude: So
often the Pancreatick Juyce, being made ſharp
by ſtagnation, will, in an equal ſpace of time,
perforate the obſtructing Pituity; and alſo, in
an equal ſpace of time, will produce the Fit:
But as often as Ducts, of a different Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and Amplitude, are equally obſtructed
by a Viſcid Phlegme, ſo often ſhall we ſee a
Diverſity in the Fits; in as much, as it may
ſooner, and more amply, wax ſharp, in one
Duct, and thence the Fit may ſooner return,
and more grievouſly afflict than in another;
or as often as obſtructions do happen in Ducts,
of the ſame Magnitude, from a Pituity, not
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64159:84"/>
alike Viſcid; ſo often, like-wiſe, may the Fits
invade the Sick at divers times; for as much as
the Pancreatick Juyce, equally waxing ſharp,
will ſooner perforate the leſs viſcid pitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than that which hath a greater Viſcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>From thoſe things, which we have now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
it will not be difficult to explain,
How in a double Tertian, or other Compound
Feavers, one Fit may, unexpectedly, come in
an Hour or two, after another: For, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
may happen in Ducts of the ſame
Magnitude, from a Pituity alike Viſcid; ſo
that, one obſtruction may be excited the firſt
Hour, and another the fourth Hour; the
which, if in Tertians, (unleſs ſome fault, as we
have ſaid, be committed in the ſix Non naturals)
the firſt will again return on the third day, the
firſt hour, and the ſecond at the fourth Hour,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which, in our judgement, affords no
ſmall difficulty to thoſe who hold, that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Feavers, are brought to a Turgeſcency,
by Congeſtion, from an evil habit of the
Blood, or of the Alimentary Juyce, depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
as for example, ſeeing that the Alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Juyce, depraved, doth excite, by its Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſcency,
a feaveriſh Efferveſcency in the Blood,
in the firſt Hour, Why may not that Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the (depraved) Alimentary Juyce,
ſerving to produce another Fit, which like-wiſe
begins to ſwell, in the ſame Blood, being in
the ſame Efferveſcency, be enkindled, and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?
Truly, we favour not that Opinion;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64159:85"/>
neither alſo, can wee conceive how, in thoſe
which are faſting, the Feaveriſh Fits ſo often,
beyond meaſure, could be returned at the ſame
time.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, the reaſon is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
manifeſt, wherefore in a double Tertian, or
Quartane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the fit doth preciſely antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate,
or ſucceed, an Hour; no other-wiſe,
than as they ariſe from one, and the ſame, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
Duct: For, as the whole Pancreatick
Juyce, and the obſtructing Pituity of both,
grows more or leſs ſharp; alſo, the Pituity of
both, more or leſs Viſcid: the Fits of both
do equally return ſooner or later. There are
Feavers, whoſe Species by ſome, are difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſtinguiſhed; as for example, a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian,
from a double Tertian, or Triple Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;
for, of thoſe three Feavers, each dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excite one Fit; which diſtinction, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
creates no trouble to ſuch as are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to the matter: For, a Quotidian doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
invade the Sick, either at one Hour, or
equally ſooner, or later. The double Tertian,
for the moſt part, ſo hath its Fits, that the
firſt acceſs anſwers to the third, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
to the fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in a Triple
Quartan, the firſt Fit anſwereth to the
fourth, and the ſecond to the fifth,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which things being rightly Conſidered, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one may eaſily diſtinguiſh theſe Feavers, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
from one another, unleſs ſome external
fault diſturb the order or frame of the Body,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64159:85"/>
either in whole or in part. The diverſity of
thoſe Symptomes ſo variouſly occurring, doth
not overthrow thoſe things which we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
concerning intermitting Feavers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
of heat and cold ſeeing that diverſity
dependeth upon a diverſe Conſtitution, of the
reſt of the Humours exiſtent in the Body. For
otherwiſe a fit of a tertian Feaver, happening
to a Body repleniſhed with much Bile, and that
ſufficiently ſharp, would laſt far longer than a
fit happening to that Body where but little bile,
and that as yet temperate is remaining. Alſo
a greater or leſſer quantity of phlegme, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
plenty of other humours abounding in the
body, may not a little augment this diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it may not ſuffice to have ſaid,
that the primary Symptomes of intermitting
Feavers are heat and cold, it behoveth that we
here alſo, annex our Opinion concerning their
Cauſe and Original We Judge that the cold
of intermitting Feavers, draws its Original
from the more acid Pancreatick Juice, and heat
eſpecially from a more acrimonions Bile; the
former is evinced by the aſſumption of acid
things, as <hi>Galen</hi> proveth in a thouſand places
from things helping and hurting, that acids are
cold, and do produce cold, and that not only in
the ſick, but alſo in the ſound; in which ſometimes
we ſee alike Cold to have been excited, as thoſe
which are feaveriſh are wont to ſuffer, and any
one may obſerve, if acids be taken by thoſe
which are feaveriſh in the time of the cold fit,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64159:86"/>
that the feaveriſh cold will be encreaſed after a
wonderful manner. He that refuſeth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
theſe our obſervations, let him read <hi>Galen</hi>
De Simp. Med. Facult, where he ſaith:
<q>Every Acid, as it is only acid, is plainly cold; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a Pear or an Apple, the Juice of Grapes
or Rasberies, or Mulberies, punick Apples, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Fruit, or Juice, or Plants, as ſharp poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Dock or Sorrel; for that it appears to the
taſt that there is a vehement Acidity inherent in
it, neither may any thing be prefer'd before it;
for its Acrimony, you ſhall find this Juice alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
cooling, &amp;c.</q>  as alſo in the ſame Book
<hi>Cap.</hi> 7. and in infinite other places he teacheth,
that Acids are cold, and produce cold in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>That the qualities of Humours are to be
known by their effects, <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> Lib. De
Vet. Med. Text. 39. 5. doth diligently incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate:
Know that the chief Forces of Humours
is in their acid Faculty; which likewiſe in the
23. of the ſame, from manifeſt things which
behoveth to be Learned without the Body, he
manifeſtly teacheth. Moreover, <hi>Lib. de Locis in
Homine</hi> Text 56. 10. He ſaith, that Acids are
alſo pituitous, which in <hi>Lib. de Natura Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
Text. 12. 2. He manifeſtly declares to be
moſt cold of all things exiſting in the Bodie:
The which, unleſs it were true, untowardly
would <hi>Galen</hi> in his whole Book concerning
Food in acute Diſeaſes, and thoſe who are his
diligent followers, preſcribe an acid medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous
Diet, in acute Feavers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:64159:86"/>
Although no man perhaps can eaſily deny,
heat to proceed from the Bile, in regard we
ſee that our natural heat is much augmented
by the aſſumption of bitter, and aromatick
Aliments and Sauces, augmenting Choler and
making it more ſharp. Beſides, both is proved
by the Remedies exhibited, diminiſhing or
taking away thoſe Symptomes; For we ſee
clearly, that by medicines infringing the Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
the Cold is attempered and taken away;
and we likewiſe obſerve that by medicines tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
the Bile, eſpecially Acids, the heat is
leſſened, as we ſhall preſently in many things
further Demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>From whence every one may eaſily imagine
the Reaſon, why for the moſt part the fits of
intermitting Feavers, are begun with a ſence
of Cold, and terminated with heat: For the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juice being made more ſharp by ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in one or more of the lateral Ducts; after
which flowing into the thin Gut, there exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
ſuch an efferveſcency with the Bile,
wherein the <hi>Succus Pancreaticus</hi> by its predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
Acidity every way emits or ſends forth
acid Exhalations, affected with a ſenſe of
Cold; which when they touch the Gall-bladder
by their acrimony provoke it to its Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from whence the Bile breaking forth into
the Inteſtine, in a more than uſual quantity o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmes
the Pancreatick Juice, and raiſeth
therewith ſuch an Efferveſcency, in which the
Bile predominating Excites heat, by ſending
every way its exhalations or Emiſſaries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:64159:87"/>
This our Opinion, is in a wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
confirmed by the Vomitings, which very
often happen to the Sick, at one time ſo cold
and Acid, that bringeth a ſtupor to the Teeth;
and again on the contrary, another while ſo
hot and bitter, that they believe they Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nothing but pure Choler.</p>
            <p>But ſome perhaps may ask, why we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Vomitings and acid belchings, rather
from the Pancreas, than from the Stomach?
We anſwer, becauſe it is agreeable to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the Pancreatick Juice is Acid, and
ſeeing that the ſearchers of Nature, do as
yet diſpute concerning the ferment of the
Stomach and its Generation, we judged
that it ought to be determined, rather from
a certain than an uncertain Cauſe: And if it
ſhall be evinced by further ſearch in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
of Men (we ſpeak not of Birds who
require a ſtronger fermentation to digeſt
Stones and other things of a hard conſiſtency
for the Generation of Shells) that any other
ferment is generated, beſides the Spittle conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
ſwallowed, and that to be Acid, then ſhall
we be ſo much the better able to prove an Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency
to be excited in the thin Gut, between
the Bile, and the Pancreatick Juice: Seeing that
the Temperate, or Natural Acidity of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
Juyce, would be helped by the acid
Ferment of the Stomach; and from thence, the
Efferveſcency would be the more powerfully
performed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:64159:87"/>
It is further proved, that the Acidity, caſt
forth by Vomitting, doth not proceed from
the Stomach, but from the Inteſtines, by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitories,
exhibited out of the time of the Fit;
by the help whereof, firſt an inſipid Matter,
afterwards, by further ſtraining, an Acid, and
Bilious Matter, is vomitted up; the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of which would happen, if the Soure, and
Cholerick Matter, did proceed from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.
Concerning the manner by which Acids
may get to the Stomach, no man, of a ſound
mind, will doubt, who determines the Bile,
ejected by Vomiting, to proceed from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines:
Seeing that the Pancreatick Juyce
may, and ought to be driven through the ſame
wayes, as the Bile, flowing to the Inteſtines, by
their inverted Periſtaltick Motion, with the
ſame eaſe to the Ventricle, as we have above
demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>Neither doth the place a little confirm this
our Opinion, in which, a Feaveriſh fit begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
is for the moſt part perceived Cold,
then Hot; as alſo, a moſt fierce pain: We
underſtand the Region of the Loynes, in which
the firſt part of the thin Gut lies, under the
Meſentery, as is to be ſeen <hi>Tab.</hi> I, wherein
the Confſux and Efferveſcency of the Bile, and
the Pancreatick Juyce, is Celebrated; from
which, the Particles of thoſe Humours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
agitated upon the Ligaments of the Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and other Nervous, and Membranous parts,
they daſh againſt them, with an Impetuous
force: So that, that Efferveſcency may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64159:88"/>
be perceived by the Touch in the Sick,
as we have above demonſtrated. Nor does
the Pancreatick Juyce, being made ſharp by
ſtagnation, only exerciſe a tyranny, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Loynes; but alſo ſends forth its
acid Exhalations, both upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
Who doubteth that from the one the
Torments of the Belly, and from the other Acid
belchings, do proceed? But if thoſe Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
penetrate through the Venae Lacteae, to
the Heart, by Incraſſating the Blood, gives
an occaſion of a leſſer Pulſe; which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
by its corroding Acrimony, produceth
one more frequent. The Acid Exhalations,
being ſubdued in manner afore-ſaid, Salt and
Bilious Exhalations do follow; which again,
by attenuating the Blood, do no leſs excite a
great, and ſometimes alſo, a more frequent
Pulſe, by irritating the Heart; and that ſo
long till their Acrimony being ſpent, they can
no longer irritate, or provoke the Heart:
Which done, the Vigour and Natural pulſe of
the Heart is returned: So that, very often the
moſt skilful can hardly judge, whether they have
a Feaver or no.</p>
            <p>We will not here ſpeak (leſt this Chapter
ſhould ſwell too much, with that which we
purpoſed to finiſh in few Words) concerning
ſix Hundred other Symptomes, which are wont
to accompany Intermitting Feavers; ſeeing
we are perſwaded there are none, at leaſt, of
thoſe who with an attent mind, have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the Juyce, or its Emiſſaries, after a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64159:88"/>
diverſe manner diſpoſed, doth perambulate
the whole Body, and may produce diverſe
Symptomes; but may, from theſe things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them by their own proper Induſtry.</p>
            <p>Which ſeeing it is ſo, we leaving thoſe ſmall
Circumſtances, ſhall rightly paſs on to the Cure
of intermitting Feavers, which as it Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
conſiſteth in taking away Obſtructions,
and correcting the Pancreatick Juice, and other
Humours if they be Vitious; ſo it may be
moſt ſuccesfully performed, firſt by Medicines
inciding and attenuating tough Phlegme, and
ſometimes expelling it from the Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By adhibiting Remedies, which
are indued with a force of correcting and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating
the Pancreatick Juice, offending by
its Acrimony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By correcting other Humours in
the Body, this or that way ſo peccant
that they may Cheriſh the Vicious Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency
excited in the thin Gut between the
Bile and the Pancreatick Juice. For the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away the Obſtruction, temperating the
more acid Pancreatick Juyce, and the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
the Cold, from thence proceeding,
theſe following Medicines do much conduce,
viz. <hi>Water of Parſly, Fennel, Baume, Simple
Treacle-Water, Salt of Worm-wood, of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
the leſſer, Syrup of Carduus Benedict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
or the five opening Roots, and the like,
being mixed according to Art, eſpecially if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
halfe an hour before the feaveriſh Cold
invades the Sick, who ought to be kept in
his bed, or other warm place, that Sweat may
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64159:89"/>
be a little promoted, or at leaſtwiſe that the
operation of the Medicine may not be hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>We ſay half an hour before the feaveriſh
Cold invade the Sick, becauſe Reaſon teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and Experience proveth, that cutting and
attenuating, as unobſtructing Medicaments
do then with a far more happy Succeſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
that for which they are Adminiſtred, than
if they were exhibited at any other time;
the Reaſon of which ſeemes to us, becauſe
thoſe Medicines begin to operate at that
time, wherein the Pancreatick Juice by its
Acrimony doth molifie the Obſtruction, and
ſo by a united force, may more ſtrongly and
more happily diſſolve the Obſtruction, than
if either of thoſe only were opperating:
Moreover, It very much diminiſheth the Feave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Cold, which as yet would be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with greater ſucceſs, if to the mixture
even now deſcribed, you ſhall add a drop
or two of Oyl of Cloves, becauſe as yet we
ſee no medicament that doth more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
take away Cold than that Oyle.</p>
            <p>If a great Heat follow the feaveriſh Cold,
to attemper that Medicines called Refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raters,
among which aqueous things diluting
the Bile ſeems to us moſt agreeable, but
eſpecially Acids with which the acrimony and
volatillity of the ſaline Bile exceeding, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Heat and burning is beſt infringed.
For as Doctor <hi>Minrotus</hi> ſaith <hi>pag.</hi> 36. in
his Treatiſe of Malignant Feavers, <hi>Acids do
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64159:89"/>
repreſs the inflamabillity of a Sulphurous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
without the Body, ſo alſo within the Body
they bridle the inflaming Bile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> De Victu Acutor. <hi>Text.</hi>
29. 9. manifeſtly Teacheth that Acids do
infringe and mitigate the Bile. And this is the
Reaſon, why the moſt skilfulleſt Phyſitians do
daily preſcribe Acid Julips for the temperating
of that feveriſh Heat; as for Example, by
the Decoction of Barley, or coolling diſtilled
Waters with Syrup of Limmons, Mulberies,
or Barberies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By adding Spirit of Vitriol,
Oyl of Sulpher <hi>per Capanum,</hi> or other Acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in a ſufficient quantity to give it a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Acidity. For the ſame end they alſo
ſometimes preſcribe Apozems of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Roots, the Herb Sorrel, Lettice, the
greater Houſleek, Tamarinds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by adding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the boyling, ſome Acid Syrrups, and an acid
Spirit ſufficient for a grateful Acidity, that
the ſick may now and then take a ſmall
Draught thereof to temperate the Heat.</p>
            <p>If a great Thirſt afflict the Feaveriſh at the
time of Heat, half a Dram of <hi>Lap. Prunella</hi>
may be conveniently diſſolved in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Apozeme, or in ſmall Ale, or in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Julip, for it excellently extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
Thirſt; and therefore thoſe to whom
Drink is hurtful, may diſſolve the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament
in Water, but in a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
to waſh the Mouth. Here it is well
to be noted, that at the time of the Heat,
it is not neceſſary that the Sick ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64159:90"/>
from moderate Drinking, which at the
time of Cold is altogether required; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we daily ſee, that if Drink be aſſumed at
the time of the Cold fit, that it is augmented,
and the Sick more troubled.</p>
            <p>If the Medicaments, even now mentioned for
Example, do not take away the Feaver, in the
Intervals wherein they are not vexed with
the Feaver, this following mixture will much
avail. <hi>R. Fennel Water three Ounces, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Treacle Water ſix Drams, diſtilled Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
three Drams, Crabs Eyes prepared half
a Dram, Syrup of the five opening Roots, half
an Ounce mixt.</hi> Of which moſt ſimple mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
let one ſpoonful be taken every two
houres; for altering Medicines do operate
far better if they be taken by Intervals, then
if they be taken abundantly together and at
once. If vehement Paines and Watchings
do accompany the Feaver, Mixtures are to
be uſed in the Intervals, to which is added,
one Grain of <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi> which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament
we do believe hath alſo a force of
temperating the accimony of the Humours,
becauſe we ſee that Paines ariſing from the
Acrimony of Humours, remain not after Sleep
procured by the prudent aſſumption of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum
Opiat;</hi> which in our Opinion could
not happen, if that <hi>Laudanum</hi> had not a force
of temperating ſharp Humours.</p>
            <p>If a pain of the Head accompany the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
in ſtead of fennel water, that of betto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or burrage, may be ſubſtituted; and in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64159:90"/>
place of the Syrup of the five Roots, Syrup
of <hi>Diacodium,</hi> or white Poppies. But if the
Stomach be evilly affected, Water of Mint or of
Carduus Benedictus will be uſed with better
ſucceſs. If the menſes flow not, Water of
Peniroyal, Syrup of Mugwort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be
exhibited. If a ſuffocation of the Womb be
preſent, in ſtead of thoſe, may be added
Spirit of <hi>Sal Ammoniack, Tinct</hi> of Caſtor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
if the Sick be tormented with flatulencies,
Spirit of Nitre may be added; which reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
doth greatly help thoſe which are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with a collick Paſſion, or any other
flatulent Diſeaſes; eſpecially if ſome Drops
thereof be prudently mixed with ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatick
Waters, and the aforeſaid Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives.
If the Appetite be proſtrate by
Reaſon of too great a quantity of Bile car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the Stomach, which will be known by
the Appetite ſuddenly Deſtroyed, by bitter
Belchings and Cholerick Vomitings, two Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Elixir <hi>Proprietatis Paracelſi</hi> may be
added to the laſt mixture. But if the ſaid
evil proceedeth from a vicid pituity detained
in the Stomach, which will be known by an
aggravated pain in the Stomach, half a Dram
of the dulcid Spirit of Salt inſtead of Elix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir
<hi>Proprietatis</hi> will be more Conducent if it
be mixed with the foreſaid mixture.</p>
            <p>To the ſame intent may be directed alſo
divers Apozemes, and other medicate Wines,
Powders, Pills, and medicaments againſt the
ſaid Obſtructions: Nevertheleſs you muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64159:91"/>
diligently Note, that Apozemes and other
Medicaments eſpecially refrigerating which
promiſcuouſly they daily compel the Sick to
ſwallow down in a great Doſe, ſometimes ſo
debillitate their Stomacks that the Appetite
is thereby not only Deſtroyed, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fall into a diſdain or Loathing of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
from whence a new Affliction is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Sick, and the latter Errour is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
very often worſe than the firſt. But if
notwithſtanding before the Phyſician hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
his deſired end, he thinketh ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Humour doth offend by too much plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that may be diminiſhed with convenient
medicines.</p>
            <p>The Diet according to the diverſity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting
Feavers, muſt ſometimes be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
becauſe Tertian Feavers accompanied
with the greateſt Heat, do require a Diet
more Cooling than Quartans which very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
afflict the Sick with intollerable Cold and
Trembling: For we ſee the moderate uſe of
French Wine, which we are wont to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
in all Tertians, ſomtimes to be granted
in Quartans. But ſuch a Diet as may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to all intermitting Feavers, every
one may gather from what we have already
ſpoken.</p>
            <p>We would have further propounded ſome
other Remedies as well accomodated to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Feavers as to their Symptomes, had

            <p>I Have taken notice of many People (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of the Poorer ſort) who are afflicted with
tedious Agues, and many more, who labour
under thoſe Deplorable Fits, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Fits of the Mother, and Spleen; as alſo,
the Falling Sickneſs, Grievous Convulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And being well ſatisfied, (as well by the means of
Curation, as the undenyable Experiments, and
valid Reaſons in this Book, confirming the ſame)
that thoſe Diſeaſes, with many more, derive
their Original from the Vitious Alteration of
this Juyce, of the Sweet-Bread: I, for the ſake
of poor People, that they might have help at an
eaſie Rate, hereby let them know, that (amongſt
many other) I have two Medicines, which are
certain in the Cure of the fore-mentioned Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
The one will diſſolve the Conjunct Matter
of all Ague-Fits, with great Celerity; it being
of ſuch Subtile Parts, that it quickly penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
and openeth thoſe Obſtructions in the Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Branches of the Pancreas, or Sweet-Bread,
from whence thoſe Agues proceed. The which
Medicine alone (with the help of a proper Purge,
to carry off the Matter after it is diſſolved, and
attenuated) will, in a ſhort time, Cure the Fits
of any Ague whatſoever. It is put up in Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb facs="tcp:64159:92"/>
and ſold at the Price of half a Crown each
Glaſſe, with Directions for the uſe thereof; one
Glaſſe being ſufficient for the Cure of an Ague
that is but of a ſhort Continuance.</p>
            <p>The other Medicine is a Specifick Remedy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Fits of the Mother, Hypocondriack
Paines, and Melancholy, Vapours ariſing (as is
generally ſaid) from the Spleen, and Womb: As
alſo, againſt Convulſion Fits, Falling Sickneſs,
and Vertigoe, or Giddineſs of the Head: In
which Caſes, thoſe who have made frequent uſe
thereof, have found it to anſwer their Intention.
This is alſo ſold at half a Crown a Glaſs, with
Directions for its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. Theſe Medicines are
ſold at my own Houſe, and at no other Place;
Where alſo may be had all Chymical Medicines
in uſe, truly prepared; ſuch as are ſafe, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
in Operation, and able to abide the Teſt
of the moſt Curious Examiners: This being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
