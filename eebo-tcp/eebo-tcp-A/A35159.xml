         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Lords Spiritual and Temporal
AND
Commons in Parliament Aſſembled.</head>
            <p>THat we have been harras'd and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
begger'd by a tedious and
Expenſive War, needs no Proof;
but how this War came to be
drawn out to this Length, and to drein the
inexhauſtible Well dry (as the Popes uſe to
ſtile this Iſland) is not poſſible for me to
diſcover. However I have here laid down
ſome Remarkable Inſtances how Evil mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men have Clandeſtinely Crept into Places
of the greateſt <hi>Truſt;</hi> whether meerly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
themſelves, or more barbarouſly only to
<pb facs="tcp:65310:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wreck their Cauſeleſs Malice upon their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Countrey; have extreamly contributed to
the Diſcouraging, enſlaving and even totally
ruining her. It hath been no ſmall or uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſtratagem in this Age, to diſcountenance
all manner of Information, and that all ſorts
of Villany might Reign Rampant, the Name
of an informer hath been reputed Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous.
By which means ſome Honeſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who have by accident come to the
Knowledge of Tranſactions, both unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
and of dangerous Conſequence to
the Nation, have conniv'd at all, and ſtifl'd
that affection they had, and ſo fair an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to demonſtrate to their Countrey,
upon the Fear and Terror of being repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Madmen or Informers, and whereas
ſome have broke this Bar, and have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
their Conſciences, yet the little
good they thereby did, or therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
hath been a great Diſcouragement;
Yet notwithſtanding the Author of theſe
following ſheets, knowing how much his
King and Countrey have ſuffer'd, by ſuch
Baſe and Treacherous Practices as are here Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited;
<pb facs="tcp:65310:3"/>
Values not what ſome may cenſure,
ſo that he may acquaint thoſe who have
Power to inſpect and reward according to
what hath been done.</p>
            <p>To give your Honours no farther trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
tho the wicked Practices of Men have
furniſhed me with plenty of matter; I ſhall
only add that Articles ſetting forth theſe
matters, have been by me preferr'd againſt the
Lords of the Admiralty, the Commiſſioners of
the Navy, and the Commiſſioners for the ſick
and wounded Seamen. Yet ſo great have
been their intereſt, and ſo difficult to find a
Zealous Patron of Truth, that all Labour
and Travel in this matter hath been unſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful.</p>
            <p>It's probable the time of War was not ſo
opportune, and ſeeing I was not permitted to
prove thoſe Articles, it's now nevertheleſs
hop'd by all Good Men, this Bleſſed Peace, as
it affords Liberty, ſo it will give occaſion to
this great and moſt Auguſt Aſſembly to look
into theſe Affairs: In regard His Majeſty (of
his innate Goodneſs) in His Late moſt Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Speech to both Houſe of <hi>Parliament, Has

            <p>ALL Men of Senſe and Integrity muſt ſubſcribe
that the Late Revolution wrought the great
Deliverance of theſe Nations (a Mercy not
to be forgotten by this nor ſucceeding Ages);
and notwithſtanding after ſo proſperous a Settlement,
we have been afflicted with ſo tedious a War, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
our diſſatisfied Perſons juſtly charge this War (as
ſome preſumptuouſly do) upon the ſcore of the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
for it's manifeſt to all inquiſitive perſons, that
<hi>France</hi> would never have attempted a War with us, had
they not been encouraged by our Diviſions, ſo I doubt
not but to make it Evident, that ſhe could never have
protracted the War to this time, had not the Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
Cowardiſe, and moſt unworthy dealings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us encouraged and ſupported her.</p>
            <p>He knows not the Conſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> who is
ignorant that our Shipping are our Walls: therefore
in order to what I promis'd, I ſhall firſt ſhow what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
were us'd to weaken them, by diſcouraging and
beggaring ſome, by plain Murthering others, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
not a few of our Saylors to deſert their Native
Countrey (though in the greateſt neceſſity) and ſerve
under Foreign States for maintenance, which was not
to be obtain'd at home. In the year 1695. a ſmall piece
was preſented to the World, under the Title of <hi>Juſtice
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65310:5"/>
perverted,</hi> wherein it was manifeſted that by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of <hi>Queries</hi> and <hi>Runs</hi> (a thing practicable in the
Navy) ſome ſubtle Sophiſters did much abuſe the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by wronging the Saylors; for whereas it fortun'd
that divers Seamen being taken with ſickneſs, ſome
were ſet on ſhore at the Neighbouring Ports: others
were ſent up to <hi>London</hi>-Hoſpitals for cure; it could
not be thought but ſome among ſuch a multitude were
paſt recovery and died: However, theſe poor wretches,
though they had ſerv'd a conſiderable time, yet upon
their dying were for the moſt part prickt <hi>Run;</hi> and
ſuch as Death did pity and ſpare, the Officers, more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
would not; for if they were not recover'd, and on
board within 30 days, they were generally prickt <hi>Run;</hi>
and which is more monſtrous, it's well known, tho ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
as ſoon as Recover'd (the Ship to which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
being ſayl'd) yet were they prickt <hi>Run</hi> from the
firſt Ship where they were enter'd; and whereas it hath
been cuſtomary in many Caſes to remove Seamen from
ſhip to ſhip; as when a ſhip is commanded to Cruiſe,
and is not ſufficiently mann'd for that purpoſe, ſome
men are ſent into her out of other ſhips; by which
means it may come to paſs that ſome particular perſons
for the Opinion of their Valour, Skill and Integrity,
may at times have been remov'd to ſerve on board four
or five ſeveral ſhips, yet if they happen to be prickt <hi>Run</hi>
in the laſt ſhip they ſerved in, both they and their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
generally utterly loſe all the benefit and Wages ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing
by their former Services; and to compleat all this
barbarity upon the poor Seamen, all things have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with that ſecrecy and myſtery, that though they
found themſelves and Families ruin'd, yet could never
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65310:5"/>
learn the Cauſe, or find the Villain that did it. Theſe
and ſuch like unworthy doings were repreſented to the
Publick in the foreſaid Paper, and alſo confirm'd by the
additional Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Hodges,</hi> and I may freely
ſay it did appear by the fatal conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Seamen to be found upon occaſion, and the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs
of ſuch as were found to enter the ſervice; a
thing ſo ſtrange as was never heard of in <hi>England</hi> before
theſe Tricks; and one would think all Honour and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
had deſerted our Coaſts, when theſe things could
be ſo openly acted, yet ſo little regarded by the Navy-Board,
whoſe place it was, and care it ſhould heve been,
to have protected and encouraged our Seamen. But it's
no wonder the Commiſſioners ſhould be ſo averſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
and do juſtice to the Seamen, when they ſuffer'd ſo
great injuſtice to the King in falſe Contracts, and in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezling
his Naval Stores, as was fully prov'd (by many
Depoſitions) they did at <hi>Portſmouth;</hi> which Notorious
Crimes being brought by Mr. <hi>Trevor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
before the Lords of the Admiralty, the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
became Advocates of the Villains, and not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors,
and did ſo far manifeſt their Reſentment againſt
the Diſcoverers, that they immediately ſuſpended Mr.
<hi>Graham,</hi> Clerk of the Checqne of <hi>Portſmouth-Yard,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Trevor,</hi> Clerk of the Rope-Yard and others, and not
ſatisfied therewith, eudeavoured their utter rnin. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſo great diſcouragement, yet theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Mr. <hi>Trevor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Graham,</hi> and the reſt, proceeded in
their diſcovery, and made the Crimes ſo fully appear,
that Three of the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Navy</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
did in the name of the whole Board, acknowledge
to their Lordſhips that there were baſe and adominable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65310:6"/>
Practices in <hi>Portſmouth-Yard,</hi> and ſo put as good a Face
as poſſible they could upon ſo bad a Matter. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
Mr. <hi>Trevor</hi> to their Lordſhips, as a perſon
deſerving Encouragement for this honeſt diſcovery.
Their Lordſhips embraced the motion, and order'd Mr.
<hi>Trevor</hi> to manage the Proſecution againſt the Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who accordingly brought the buſineſs to <hi>Wincheſter-Sizes</hi>
following, where it was expected that the Mayor
of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> who had bound over the accuſed perſons,
ſhould have return'd the Recognizance, but to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Court had not; whereupon the Judge thought
fit to fine him <hi>200l.</hi> However, the Commiſſioner of
<hi>Portſmouth-Yard</hi> procur'd an Attorney to poſt after the
Judge to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who by ſubtle, but falſe pretenſions,
did ſo work upon the Goodneſs of the Judge, that the
Fine was taken off. And that the ſaid Commiſſioner
of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> was thus engaged in ſaving thoſe Rogues
that had wrong'd the King, from Juſtice, is eaſily to be
collected from the Note of Charges, in relation to that
Journey, being drawn upon him from the aforeſaid At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney;
which Note is now to be ſeen in the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Office. Information of the ſame Matter was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
brought to the <hi>King's-Bench-Bar;</hi> ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which, by cunning Intrigues, it was brought about
that Mr. <hi>Trevor</hi> ſhould be no farther concern'd in the
Proſecution; but another perſon was found out fit for
that place, who was both wholly ignorant of the Facts,
and eaſie to be wrought upon; and then when the Tryal
came on, the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Navy</hi> appear'd in a
Body on behalf of the Criminals; where it was moſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
aſſerted, that the Goods that had been embez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
were but Loans out of His Majeſties Stores; whenas
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65310:6"/>
the perſons in whoſe hands thoſe Goods were found, were
private Traders, and no ways concern'd in ſhipping. At
this time it fortun'd, but how is not yet known, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Gentlemen, who were ſubpena'd, in order to prove
the Facts, were forgot, and never called; and having
this advantage the Commiſſioners made their moſt on't,
and prevail'd with the Jury to acquit the Actors, though
themſelves had formerly own'd the Crimes before the
Lords of the Admiralty. There being ſuch apparent Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in matters ſo foul, what wonder was it that perſons
of untainted Honour and Loyalty, withdrew themſelves
from ſerving longer at the Admiralty-Board, where they
were in danger of ſeeing their own Reputation ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreckt
by the Injuſtice of ſome in the ſame Commiſſion!
Or what wonder was it that ſubordinate Officers grew
fearful of complaining and informing, when their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
did ſo openly Encourage, Uphold and Protect Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
and with ſuch earneſtneſs and violence Perſecute
the Diſcoverers; nor was it any wonder that Rogues and
Villains took heart, believing this their proper time to
proſper and be ſecure in.</p>
            <p>A farther Inſtance how well his Majeſty has been ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and the Intereſt of the <hi>Nation</hi> promoted, during
theſe Wars, we may find in the Caſe of <hi>Everett</hi> the
Shipwright: This man having detected many Frauds
and Embezzlements in the <hi>King's Yards,</hi> Voluntarily
made a Propoſal to the <hi>Lords of the Admiralty,</hi> whereby
to ſave His Majeſty 100000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> in mattters
relating to Building and Repairing the <hi>Royal Navy.</hi>
The <hi>Propoſal</hi> was afterwards publiſh'd, and Dedicated
to His Majeſty and both Houſes of Parliament; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65310:7"/>
was highly approved by many <hi>Noble Perſons,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
his Grace the Duke of <hi>Leeds,</hi> as alſo by the Lord
Mayor and Court of Aldermen, by <hi>Sir Ralph Delaval,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Barkley,</hi> and the then Lord <hi>Danby,</hi> &amp;c. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Maſter and Aſſiſtance of the Company of Free
<hi>Shipwrights</hi> did approve the ſame Propoſal. <hi>Nay,</hi> the
Lords of the Admiralty, though not at firſt diſcerning
the advantage of the ſaid Propoſal, did ſtrenuouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it; yet in concluſion ſignified their approbation
thereof; but before they complied they did occaſion <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verett</hi>
to wait near Three Years. For albeit <hi>Everet</hi>
gave in his Propoſal to their Honouts <hi>March</hi> 1692/3. yet
he was not permitted an Hearing till the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
following; at which time the <hi>Commiſſioners of the
Navy</hi> being preſent, did ſo ſtiffly oppoſe the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
that <hi>the Lords of the Admiralty</hi> thought fit to
throw it out. Being thus diſappointed, <hi>Everett</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Intentions to be Honeſt, and being unwilling
to be hinder'd from ſerving his King and Countrey,
humbly preſented his ſaid <hi>Propoſal</hi> to His Majeſty in
Council; and His Majeſty was pleas'd, by Order of
Council, bearing date the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 169<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

that ſaid Order of Council, with the <hi>Propoſal</hi> of <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rett,</hi>
was laid before the Lords of the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> the
<hi>26th ditto.</hi> After that Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> paid his attendance
on, and made ſeveral Motions to their onours to be
heard upon his <hi>Propoſal,</hi> he was, <hi>April</hi> 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1694. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to the <hi>Commiſſionors of the Navy;</hi> upon whom
waiting, was told <hi>his Propoſal was Nonſenſe;</hi> and was
likewiſe threaten'd with an <hi>Action of Defamation,</hi> if
he did not ſpeedily depart from it. Moreover, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65310:7"/>
the <hi>Navy-Board</hi> the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1694. upon the
Reference from the Lords of the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> they began,
as he thought, to banter and baffle him; and order'd
him to give them in writing a Demonſtration of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Heads laid before them: with which Order <hi>Everett</hi>
complied, and the <hi>30th ditto</hi> did Preſent them with
ſuch a Demonſtration. Then they order'd him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
them again <hi>May 2d.</hi> at which time he attending,
was told, <hi>the Surveyor was out of Town, and therefore they
muſt reſpite his buſineſs till his return:</hi> which hapning to
be on the <hi>8th</hi> of the ſame Month, and the ſaid <hi>Everett</hi>
having no Summons to pay his attendance, waited till
the <hi>14th,</hi> and then Preſented the Navy Board with a
Scrowle of near Fifty Names, by which Perſons he
could prove the ſeveral Crimes by him mentioned to
be committed in his Majeſties Yards; at which time
the anſwer given him was, <hi>The Controuler was gone down
to the Fleet, and that a matter of that conſequenceas Mr.</hi>
Everett<hi>'s was, could not be diſpatch'd as it ought without
a full Board; and that he need not be ſo preciſe in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance;
for they could and would conſider of his matter
without his appearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>June 11th</hi> 1694. Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> having as yet heard
nothing of his matter, went to the <hi>Navy-Office,</hi> where
obſerving no great buſineſs ſtirring, he took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to move the Board twice or thrice, but was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful
in all; and after many Hours waiting, went
home unſatisfied. The following day he indeed recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a Letter from the Board, intimating that <hi>they now
had his Propoſal under conſideration, and would proceed
to make a Report thereof: and that he need not give
himſelf any further trouble about it.</hi> He therefore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65310:8"/>
waited till the <hi>19th,</hi> but finding then all was no more
than Words, he applied himſelf to the Lords of the
<hi>Admiralty,</hi> and Preſented their Lordſhips with a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of his Proceedings with the <hi>Commiſſioners of the
Navy:</hi> whereupon the day following <hi>Everett</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a freſh Letter from the <hi>Navy-Board;</hi> dated
<hi>June</hi> the <hi>20th,</hi> whereby he was order'd to attend
their Board the 23d of the ſame month, with Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to prove the Abuſes complain'd of by him.
Accordingly in time, and at the place appointed he
did attend, and Twelve Maſter <hi>Shipwrights</hi> with him,
Two of which Maſters were called in, and before the
Board did aſſert and prove ſeveral of the <hi>Abuſes</hi>
and <hi>Baſe Practices</hi> committed in <hi>the King's Yards.</hi>
However, while theſe <hi>Maſters</hi> were giving in their
Evidence on behalf of their Sovereign Lord the King,
the Commiſſioners were ſo impudent and inſolent as
both to Diſcourage and Terrifie them in a ſcoffing
manner, ſaying, <hi>How could it he poſſible to ſave His
Majeſty 100000 l.</hi> per annum, <hi>in Building and Repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Royal Navy, when the whole Charge did not
amount to ſo much;</hi> and that Worthy Captain <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw</hi>
did aver, <hi>That the Charge of the whole did not
amount to 25000 l.</hi> and ſo they brake up abruptly,
leaving <hi>Mr. Everett</hi> and his Evidence in the Board-Room,
without the leaſt Order for withdrawing
or further attending.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June 27th.</hi> the Commiſſioners of the Navy did
make their Report to the Lords of the Admiralty
concerning <hi>Everett</hi>'s Propoſal; in which Report they
inſerted divers falſe Reflections upon <hi>Mr. Everett</hi> and
his Proceedings; of which whole matter the Reader
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65310:8"/>
may be fully ſatisfied if he have recourſe to the Book
before mention'd, <hi>Viz. Juſtice Perverted,</hi> p. 12. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> the 6th, Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> again attended the Lords of
the Admiralty, having before given a Narrative of his
proceedings at the <hi>Navy Boards</hi> and pray'd to be heard
thereupon, as alſo that he might be favoured with a
Copy of the <hi>Navy Boards</hi> Report, but could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
The 7th and 9th of the ſame Month he attended
again, and was inform'd by Mr. <hi>Southern,</hi> then Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
to the Admiralty, that their Lordſhips Report
was drawn up and would be delivered the next Council
Day, <hi>Viz.</hi> The 12th following, but was not, wherefore
<hi>Everett</hi> attended their Lordſhips the Day following,
<hi>Viz.</hi> The 13th and laid Eight Heads before them rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to his Propoſal, and humbly craved their Honours
would take it into conſideration and exſpedite their
Report, but all to no purpoſe; So likewiſe <hi>Auguſt</hi> the
14th Day, but had no Anſwer. So the 17th he gave
in a freſh Memorial, but without effect, the 21ſt he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
Petitioned their Lordſhips, humbly reminding
them of the great charge and dammage he had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd.
And was then ordered to attend <hi>Fryday</hi> the
24th, when they would conſider his caſe, ſo as to make
a full Report thereof. At which time he gladly and
in great hopes attended the <hi>Admiralty Board,</hi> but was
inform'd by the Secretary, that Sir <hi>Robert Rich</hi> was
out of Town, and that therefore their Lordſhips had
referred his matter till his Honours Return.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> the 5th <hi>Everett</hi> again attended their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
when the Secretary inform'd him that Sir <hi>John
Lowther</hi> was out of Town, but when he return'd, the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65310:9"/>
Admiralty would proceed to a final determination of
his matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> the 18th, he again attended and was then
told Admiral <hi>Rook</hi> was out of Town, but that the next
Board of ſix, would without farther delay determine
his matter: He was then directed to attend at Four in
the Afternoon, the 20th following, which he did; and
then part of his Propoſal being Read, the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
of the <hi>Navy's</hi> Report was read alſo, in order to
confute <hi>Everett;</hi> but he ſtill inſiſting, that he was able
to make good every particular whereof he had given
information, with much ado their Lordſhips were
pleas'd to give him leave that he might produce his
Witneſſes. The <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> following <hi>Everett</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moved their Lordſhips for a Copy of the <hi>Report</hi>
from the <hi>Navy-Board,</hi> as alſo for Summons for his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;
The latter, with ſome Reluctance, they gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but by no means would condeſcend to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nov. 2d.</hi> Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> according to order, attended
the <hi>Admiralty-Board</hi> at Ten in the Morning with Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Witneſſes, and about Eleven was called in, where
he found only Mr. <hi>Prieſtman,</hi> who told <hi>Everett</hi> that he
believed the reſt of the Members had forgotten his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
and therefore he muſt have patience to another
day: <hi>Everett</hi> thereupon intreated his Lordſhip, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the great charge and trouble he had been at in
getting his Witneſſes together, and to order that they
might now being together be examin'd upon Oath, he
having breviates of their Depoſitions ready drawn.
Sir <hi>George Rook</hi> then coming in, Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to attend with his Witneſſes at Four in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65310:9"/>
which he did; they were called in about Six,
and being ſeverally and ſtrictly examined, did plainly
prove the matters alledg'd by <hi>Everett—</hi> About Ten at
Night their Lordſhips order one of their Clarks to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
them over again; and to take their Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the aforeſaid breviates, but the ſaid Clark, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo directed or no is not known, did Browbeat and
Banter the ſaid evidence, and would not ſuffer them to
Subſcribe their Breviates. The 27th of the ſame
month, Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> delivered to their Lordſhips the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of Seventeen Witneſſes who were Sworn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Juſtice of Peace. Whereby the Frauds and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezzlements
alledged to be Committed in His Majeſties
Yards were ſufficiently prov'd, he then Sollicited for a
Report from their Lordſhips, but could obtain none till
the 29th of <hi>January,</hi> 1694/5. In all which time, he could
no ways obtain a Copy of the <hi>Navy-Boards</hi> Report.</p>
            <p>In the Lords of the Admiralties Report, they were
pleas'd to allow of that part of <hi>Everetts</hi> Propoſal, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the ſaving of ſo great expences. And expreſs
themſelves as very deſirous, that the preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the State could Comport therewith, but
there's not the leaſt Notice taken of the many Crimes
prov'd before them, to have been Committed in His
Majeſties Yards. However this Report being given in
at the <hi>Council-Board;</hi> the matter was referred to ſuch
of the Lords of His Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy
Council, as belong'd to the Committee of Trade and
Plantations, who forthwith granted Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of the <hi>Navy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Boards</hi> Report.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>February</hi> following, <hi>Viz. 25th</hi> 1695 Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their Lordſhips with a Memorial, in Anſwer to the
Report of the <hi>Navy-Board.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 27th 1695. Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> prov'd before their
Lordſhips, by the Oaths of Divers Credible Witneſſes,
many great Crimes to be committed by ſeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and others in His Majeſties Yards, at which time
the Commiſſioners of the Navy did, notwithſtanding
ſo great and plain evidence, inſinuate to their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
that their Officers were Juſt and Innocent, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as was thought, that <hi>Everett</hi> had nothing but Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
and was not ſufficient to prove any Crime upon
any particular Perſon, <hi>April,</hi> 1695. Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> upon a
full hearing (before the Lords aforeſaid) face to face
with the Commiſſioners of the Navy, did prove the
Report of the <hi>Navy-Board</hi> to be falſe and ſcandalous,
which was alſo by their Lordſhips acknowledged to be
ſo; again, <hi>April</hi> the 6th, Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> did preſent to their
Lordſhips two Papers, recounting the Various Frauds
and Abuſes committed in His Majeſties Yards of <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
Chattam,</hi> and <hi>Deptford,</hi> which their Lordſhips
inſpecting, told Mr. <hi>Everett,</hi> that they were too well
ſatisfied of ſuch practices to doubt them; However,
<hi>Everett</hi> perſiſted for Freedom, to prove his Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
upon which he was told by their Lordſhips, they
would refer the matter to the Lords of the Admiralty;
ſubmitting, to this reference, Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> did on the
13th, 16th, 19th, 27th, 29th of <hi>April,</hi> and on the 6th
and 7th of <hi>May</hi> enſuing, by near Forty Witneſſes prove
before their Lordſhips the matters of Fact, charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Officers and others belonging to His Majeſties
Yards aforeſaid, and their Lordſhips were ſatisfied in
the Proof, at which time Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> concluded his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65310:10"/>
Teſtimony in this Caſe; Yet could by no entreaties
procure a Report to be made till <hi>September</hi> following,
by which Report His Majeſty being made acquainted
with the Faithful Services of Mr. <hi>Everett,</hi> was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
pleas'd to order the Lords of the Admiralty to
put him into ſome employ in the Navy, or other ways
to beſtow upon him a Reward ſuitable to his Merits.
Hereupon their Lordſhips directed the Commiſſioners
of the Navy to pay unto the ſaid <hi>Everett 100 l.</hi> and
they accordingly iſſued out their Order <hi>Morch 7th,</hi>
1695/6. In which Order they were pleaſed to take notice,
<hi>This Benevolence of His Majeſty's was for the Faithful
Services of Mr.</hi> Everett. But yet there was no news
of Puniſhing the Offenders. Mr. <hi>Everett,</hi> willing to
ſatisfie the World, he ſerv'd his Majeſty purely out of
a Principle of Loyalty, after this <hi>100l.</hi> received, which
not to mention his Deſerts, did nothing nigh counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
the Charge he had been at, did ſollicite the Earl
of <hi>Rumny</hi> for a Commiſſion enabling him to ſeize
<hi>Embezled Stores;</hi> his Honour being very zealous and
forward to encourage ſo good a Work, the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
of the Navy could not well oppoſe, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
and granted Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> a Commiſſion, in
purſuance of which Commiſſion Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> in a little
time made One Hundred and Thirty Seizures, as of
<hi>Anchors, Cables, Cordage, Timber and Amwunition;</hi>
and of <hi>Ordinance</hi> Four, each containing Nine Hundred
Weight, which he delivered into the King's Stores;
but inſtead of being encouraged in ſuch his Faithful
Service, he hath been ſlander'd, abuſed and ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both by Navy-Board, and the Commiſſioners of
the Victualling-Office while, in the mean time, ſuch
as he detected in their Baſe Actions, were cheriſhed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65310:11"/>
and reſcued from Juſtice; an Inſtance whereof fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> having ſeized on Board Ship Three
Puncheons of Salt, value <hi>6l.</hi> the Commiſſioners of
the Victualling Office refus'd to pay him his Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which, according to the King's allowance, ought
to be the Third Part; but inſtead thereof would
have fobb'd him off with Ten ſhillings. It is true
they promiſed him an Hearing at their Board, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſeizure; where they engaged the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the Ship ſhould be preſent; but he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heard a word more of them, nor received any
Reward for this Service. Again, near an Hundred Empty
Casks being Embezled, were carried by Mr: <hi>Euerett</hi>
and return'd into the Stores; but the foreſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
refus'd to take any Cognizance of this
Matter; alſo alledging, that <hi>Purſers, and others, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
therewith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are obliged to diſcount for what they
do not return, after the rate of 12s. per Tunn.</hi> And
well they may, when they themſelves own they ſtand
the King in 34s. <hi>per</hi> Tunn. When Mr. <hi>Everett</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
upon this laſt Deſign of ſeizing all the Embezled
Stores he could meet with, the Commiſſioners of the
Navy appear'd ſo forward in his Encouragement,
that they order'd him the Third of all ſuch Purchaſe:
but after a while, hearing the Diſcoveries he daily
made, they themſelves did declare at the Board, <hi>That
they believed all the Merchants Ships were furniſhed out of
the King's Stores.</hi> And at this rate they made but a
Jeſt of the King's Expence, and the Nation's Loſs.
Soon after, minded to pick a Quarrel with Mr. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verett,</hi>
they refuſed to pay the Third Part till ſuch time
as the Offenders were convicted.</p>

In the beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1695. the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
of the Navy hired a Veſſel for the ſaid <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verett</hi>
to proceed in his Deſign of ſeizing Embez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Stores; and he having ſeized ſeveral Parcels of
<hi>Naval Stores</hi> at <hi>Harwich,</hi> particularly a Parcel of
Cordage, value <hi>60l.</hi> the Mayor of the Town op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
him with great Violence; ſo alſo did Juſtice
<hi>Smith,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wyldbore,</hi> Collector of His Majeſties Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,

produced, and read before them the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
the Earl of <hi>Rumnys</hi> and <hi>Navy-Boards</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for his Authority. Yet all was ſlighted by theſe
Perſons, and conſequently the Cordage taken was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued
by open force; Nay, the Veſſel of Mr. <hi>Everett</hi>
was ſeized by Mr. <hi>Wyldbores</hi> order.</p>
            <p>A complaint of theſe <hi>evil doings</hi> being laid before
the <hi>Commiſſioners of the</hi> Navy, the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi>
1695. they refuſed to take Cognizance thereof, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the <hi>Perſons herein accus'd, were not under their
Juriſdiction.</hi> Nay, they refus'd their Warrant, tho
often deſired, for the Releaſe of the Veſſel; nor
would they take any Courſe that the Cordage before
ſpoken of ſhould be receized, though it was ſeveral
times deſired. Nay in <hi>September</hi> following, viz. the
30th, though <hi>Everett</hi> laid before the <hi>Lords of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty</hi>
Nine <hi>Depoſitions</hi> relating to <hi>this Matter,</hi> and
fully prov'd the Cordage before ſpoken of to be <hi>His
Majeſties Stores.</hi> Nay, ſo prov'd it, that the Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the Navy did acknowledge it ſo to be. Yet,
though <hi>many Petitions</hi> have been preferr'd, no inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
can as yet be obtained into this Matter.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65310:12"/>
The <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the Navy deſigning to defraud
the King, did order about Two Hundred and Forty
Tunn of Good Hemp; that is, <hi>Bands and Ribbs,</hi> to
be brought from <hi>Chattam,</hi> Sixteen Tun, and Twelve
Hundred Weight whereof they ſold at Thirty Shillings
<hi>per</hi> Tunn, under the Name of <hi>Rakings and Flyings:</hi>
But they were ſo kind, as fearing their Chapman had
had a bad Bargain, to deliver him for that ſixteen Tunn
and Twelve Hundred Weight, between Seventy and
Eighty Tunn. A certain Gentleman hapning to ſee
the Hemp, <hi>did bid the Commiſſioners Fifteen Pound a
Tunn for it.</hi> But they fearing the Matter might
come to light, refus'd his Offer, and with all Secrefie
and Diſpatch imaginable, huſh'd up the Matter;
by which means the King was cheated about Three

refus'd to do; and ſo Induſtrious were they to make

condeſcended to make this Gentleman a viſit,

            <p>Nor are we beholding to the Commiſſioners of the

have been fully out as kind, for it has been a uſual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice

Wars (which I may well ſo call ſince they have

ſo much help to make them ſo) to delay and detain
Ships by Embargo (as is preſum'd partly upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the profit, accruing by Protections and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits)
till many of them have been damaged in their

moreover, the many Ships reputed by them to be ſent
out a Cruzing to Guard the <hi>Seas:</hi> Yet loſt we above
One Hundred Ships of War, and ſome Thouſands of
Merchants Ships, it was well lookt after the mean
while: But in Truth it could not well be expected to
be other ways, for not a Journal of theſe pretended
Guard-ſhips (or any that went as Convoy) were ever
examined when it was the only means whereby to
know, whether they performed their Duty or no, ſo
that if their Lordſhips did not know they were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
employ'd, than was pretended. Yet hereby they
gave them as ſecure an opportunity as they could deſire,
of lying in Port, Trading, or Roving up and down
at Pleaſure: All which can hardly admit of any other
Conſtruction, then that they extended thereby to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the People and Ruin the Trade of the Nation.</p>

1696. Tho not any of the particulars thereof were ever

never be ſuppos'd to have been done to any good intent;
moreover it was prov'd, that they were converſant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to a ſcandal, with profeſſed Papiſt. And others too
much averſe to the preſent Government, nor can they
ever perſwade the World that the ground of their great
Familiarity with theſe Perſons was the Wit, or the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality,
or good humour they found in them and their
Company when it does appear, it was to ſerve ſome
great, tho ſecret end as witneſſeth, theſe Perſons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their Letters every Poſt deliver'd to them two hours
before the King had his: Which was of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
in thoſe times. For if they receiv'd intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
their deſign was under any Likelyhood of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
they had time to eſcape the hands of Juſtice, or
if any thing was to be attempted againſt the Kings
Life or Government, they had the opportunity to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
him before his intelligence could prevent. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
it was fully prov'd, that after His Majeſties Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
came into the Poſt-Office in order to be carried out.
It was Cuſtomary to ſtop the Mails for an hour or
more, of which no tollerable Account can be given.
But it gives occaſion to ſome to think, they took that
opportunity to inſpect the Kings ſecrets. And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for this ſuſpicion is, they ever wrote their Letters
to their Correſpondents beyond <hi>Sea,</hi> after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
His Majeſties into their Office, as if they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
what to write before, farther it was prov'd, that
the ſaid Officers did ſend every Poſt great quantities of
<hi>Gazzets,</hi> &amp;c. As alſo great Numbers of Letters <hi>Frank,</hi>
and at the cloſe of the hearing, Mr. <hi>Blackhall</hi> gave in
to the Lord Juſtices an Account how the Kings Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65310:15"/>
in that Office has been ſunk, or impar'd 30000 <hi>per
Annum,</hi> and ſo far were men of this temper from being
ſatisfied herewith, that according to Mr. <hi>Samſons</hi>
Proof, they purloyn'd near one half of the Peny Poſt-Office
income: And that none may queſtion this,
the turning out the Controuler and Receiver of that
Office, upon that Proof is a ſufficient Teſtimony, and
that which muſt certainly make theſe Crimes the more
Notorious, is, that for Divers year ſucceſſively, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
had been made from time to time to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of the Poſt-Office of theſe matters, and by
whom they were done (as when enquir'd into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
could not deny before the Lords Juſtices.) Yet
they made no Reformation, but were ſo reſolute, that
when the fouleſt matters of this Nature were prov'd
upon Mr. <hi>Leaſon,</hi> the Controuler of the Forreign Poſt-Office.
Yet he was continued till the Third Letter
from His Majeſty, with much a due got him remov'd.
But on the other hand, they let ſlip no opportunity to
turn out ſuch of their Members as they found had been
Inſtrumental in making this neceſſary diſcovery, as
they did one of good Parts, and good Principles; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
begger'd another (by evil and indirect means)
that diſcover'd the wicked Practices of <hi>Leaſon</hi> and the
Peny Poſt-Office.</p>
            <p>I had thought of ſtopping my Pen here, but a Tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
ſo deſperately miſchievous to the King and Nations
intereſt occuring to any mind, I can in no wiſe excuſe
my ſelf from the Relation, which is as follows, Mr.
<hi>Woodgate</hi> Late Poſt Maſter of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> did by Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65310:16"/>
or Nineteen Depoſitions given in upon Oath, make
it appear unto the Mayor and other Magiſtrates of the
City of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that for Divers years together dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Late War with <hi>France.</hi> Some Hundreds of
Horſe were privately placed upon the Road, between
<hi>London, Canterbury, Dover,</hi> &amp;c. For carrying on an
under-hand Correſpondence with <hi>France,</hi> and by which
means not only Papers, but Perſons were convey'd to
and from <hi>France.</hi> Of this matter the Commiſſioners
of the Poſt-Office were Divers time inform'd by the
ſaid <hi>Woodgate.</hi> Yet were they ſo far from putting a
ſtop to ſuch a dangerous deſign, that it appears by a
Letter under one of the Commiſſioners hand, it was
abetted and encouraged by them; the Depoſitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mention'd (as likewiſe the ſaid Original Letter)
relating to this affair, did for ſome conſiderable time lye
in the hands of Mr. <hi>Blackhall</hi> in order to a Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
But his Zeal was ſoon cool'd by being made
Receiver of the Penny Poſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Office, he had then no
heart farther to Proſecute the Evil Actions of the Poſt-Office.</p>
            <p>Now, whoever impartially weighs the preceeding
matter, and duly conſiders what foul Crimes have been
prov'd againſt the Officers of the <hi>Mint,</hi> &amp;c. Can do no
other ways then conclude all other Offices, have taken
