         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Have principally endeavoured in this Sermon to
ſearch, What that is, to Which we may Truſt our
Soules; and What Foundation we are to Lay in our
Religion.</p>
            <p>If we were once Eſtabliſhed in this maine Point
concerning the Next World, we ſhould Enjoy our ſelves with
much more Setledneſs, and Security in This World. For how
quietly ſhould we repoſe our Selves for this Outward, Short Life
in the Body on that Power, to Which we commit the Care of our
more Excellent, and Immortall Part?</p>
            <p>What Difficulty would there be in Truſting to Him for our
Preſervation from Death, to whom we truſt our Selves in Death,
for Eternity?</p>
            <p>Our Lord Jeſus ſeems to this End to be Shaking Heaven, and
Earth, Church, and State, all Outward Powers, and Inward
Principles in Both; that the True Foundation of Heaven, and
Earth may be Diſcovered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi> Other Foundation can no Man lay, than
that which is laid, Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Cor. 3. 11.</p>
            <p>God Hath laid no other Foundation; neither May we, neither
Can we.</p>
            <p>On This alone hath God built the World, His Church, His Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<hi>He hath made All Things by Jeſus Chriſt, Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
            <p>On this alone muſt we build our Belief, and Obedience in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Things; our Wiſdome, and Power in the Things of Man.
For <hi>All Power is given to Him in Heaven, and Earth, Mat.</hi>
28. 18.</p>
            <p>Whoever raiſeth any Outward, or Inward Frame of Things
<pb facs="tcp:116091:4"/>
upon any other Ground-worke, he makes a Lie, he works the
Works of the Devill, whoſe End is to be Diſſolved; to Vaniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Ayre, or Periſh in the Fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> Paul <hi>Divides Man into Three Parts;</hi> Spirit, Soule, <hi>and</hi>
Body, 1 Theſſ. 5. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Body <hi>is an Outward Image made of Duſt,</hi> Gen. 2. 7. God
formed Man of the Duſt of the Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Soule <hi>is a Breath of Life Incloſed in This Image, Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with It, and Giving Life to It:</hi> He breathed into his
Noſthrils the Breath of Life, and Man became a Living Soul.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spirit</hi> is the Fountain of Life, which flowes forth from
God, to Feed, and Maintain the Breath of Life in the Body.
When the time of Death Comes, This Spirit draws back to Their
Head again Thoſe ſtreams of Life, by Which It went forth into
the Body. Then the Outward Image falls to the Ground, and
moulders away. Thus doth <hi>the Duſt return to the Earth, as it
was; and the Spirit returns to God that gave it, Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 7.</p>
            <p>Now of Theſe Three the Higher lives In the Lower, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
It. The Lower lives by the Higher. And the Higheſt of
all Three, the Spirit of Man hath a Higher than That, by which
It Self lives, even the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, who is the King,
and Father of Spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Saviour reaſons after this manner,</hi> Is not the Life More
than Meat, and the Body than Rayment? Mat. 6. 25.</p>
            <p>My Lords! We are all well aſſured of This: that, Nothing
can Give More, than It Hath. Theſe Bodies of ours, which
have a more Noble Image, and Life, than any other part of this
Outward World, in which they are; cannot receive Either, or
continue in Either by any Inferiour, and Outward Thing; but
by a Soule, which dwells in the Body, as a Silk-worm in her
Work; which lives in the Body, as a Fire in the Flame. Food,
and Rayment may be the Fuell, by which the Soule maintains the
Flaming Appearance of this Bodily Image. But the Vertue goes
forth from the Soule.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:116091:2"/>Our Saviour again teacheth us; that, Nothing, which comes
from Without, can make the Soule Miſerable, or Happy; Clean,
or Unclean.</p>
            <p>This is done by that which comes from a more Inward, and
Higher Principle; from the Spirit of Man.</p>
            <p>In like manner this Spirit it ſelf derives Its Life from the
Right, or the Left Hand of Jeſus Chriſt; His Love, or His
Wrath. From Hence our Spirits convey Life into our Soules,
and thorow them into our Bodies.</p>
            <p>Thus our Bodies live not by Bread alone, but by that Vertue,
which comes forth from our Soules. Our Soules live not by their
Counſels, and Courages alone; but by every Stream of Life,
that deſcends from our Spirits upon them. Our Spirits live
not by their own Eminencies; but by Every Word, that comes
forth from the Mouth of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid,</hi> The Head of the Woman is the Man; The
Head of the Man is Chriſt; The Head of Chriſt is God,
1 Cor. 11. 3.</p>
            <p>So the Head of the Body is the Soule; the Head of the Soule is
the Spirit; the Head of the Spirit is Jeſus Chriſt, as He comes
forth to us in the Miniſtery of Angels.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us have a Covering over our Heads, a Power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our Soules, and Spirits, holding them in Subjection; for
theſe Angels ſakes, Amongst Which, and By Which Jeſus Chriſt
the Head of our Soules, and Spirits doth now raigne over us.</p>
            <p>Our Lord Jeſus calls Himſelf <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſſe.</hi> O
that men did once Know; that there can be no Right Judgment
made, no true Diſtinction, or Diſcovery of Things; but by the
Shining out of Jeſus Chriſt in their Hearts!</p>
            <p>Are there not Inviſible Things, as well as Viſible? Have not
They alſo Their Sun?</p>
            <p>The Sun, the Brighteſt Body, is the Foundation, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of all Light, Vertue, Forme, and Being in this Globe of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb facs="tcp:116091:3"/>
Subſtances. If the Sun be quite hid, all Shapes are loſt in an
Utter Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>The Lord Jeſus among Spirits, and Spirituall Things is the
onely Foundation of Truth, Life, and Power. All Truth, and
True Life is loſt in Doubt, Uncertainty, and a Spirituall Death,
to thoſe Spirits, in which He withdraweth Himſelf.</p>
            <p>Why is the Heaven of our Religion darkened with Clouds of
Diſpute, with ſo much Diverſity, ſuch Uncertainty of Opinions;
that he begins to ſeem the Wiſeſt among us, who is moſt of all a
Sceptique, that is, a Scorner, or an Atheiſt?</p>
            <p>How comes our Reaſon to ſuch a Loſſe, that She cannot Find,
or Know Her ſelf; She can give no Cleer, or Conſtant Account
of Her ſelf, in any One Man, or in any One Particular Thing?</p>
            <p>Doe not Theſe things manifeſtly declare not only a Negation,
but a Privation of ſome Great Light, which ſhould by It's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Preſence rule the Day of our Religion; and by Its Beams
falling upon our Reaſon, as the Leſſe Light, rule the Night of
of Nature, and Civill Affairs?</p>
            <p>The Watch-men watch for the Morning, ſo doth my Soule
wait for the Riſing of the Lord Jeſus upon Her, and upon the
whole Earth. He is the Image of the Invincible God; the Light,
that is Sowne even in This our Darkneſs. But He ſhall breake
theſe Chains of Darkneſs. For it is not Poſsible, that He ſhould
be Holden by them.</p>
            <p>I have onely One Thing more to ſay, which is this; that, There
are Some things, which I could not ſpeake before your Lo<hi rend="sup">ps</hi>,
though I had prepared them. Theſe things I have now taken the
Boldneſs to preſent to your Lo<hi rend="sup">ps</hi> Eyes, together with thoſe,
which I had formerly offered to your Lo<hi rend="sup">ps</hi> Ears.</p>
            <p>That Jeſus Chriſt may diſcover Himſelf a Living Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone

Eternall Peace to your own Perſons, and Preſent Peace to This

The Lord notes <hi>Three things</hi> in theſe men:
<list>
                     <item>1. Their Practice.</item>
                     <item>2. Their Principle.</item>
                     <item>3. Their End.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. Their Practice. <hi>This is</hi> Two-fold.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Practice. Impoſalls</hi> upon men. They require Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Obedience. Men muſt Believe all, that they Say;
though Themſelves Believe it not. Men muſt Obſerve their
Rules; though themſelves neglect, and break them: <hi>v.</hi> 4.
<hi>They bind heavy burthens, and grievous to be borne, on men's
ſhoulders, but they themſelves will not move them with one of
their fingers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it is for the moſt part: They are ſuch, as have too
little in them, who take too much upon them.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Practice: Induſtry</hi> among men, <hi>v. 15. Wo unto you
Scribes, and Phariſees, Hypocrites; for ye compaſſe Sea, and
Land, to make one Proſelyte, and when he is made, you
make him two-fold more the Child of Hell, than your ſelves.</hi>
They ſpare no Care, Coſt, or Pains to make a Convert; but
it is to themſelves; by a <hi>Blind obedience,</hi> and <hi>Implicite Faith.</hi>
While they promiſe to bring a man to Heaven, they make
his heart like Hell; full of bitter zeale, a violent <hi>heat,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>light</hi> at all. This was their <hi>Practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Their Principle,</hi> which is <hi>Hypocriſie. Wo unto you
Scribes, and Phariſees, Hypocrites! v.</hi> 13. They pretended
to come in the Name of God, as ſent forth from God: yet
they had nothing of the <hi>Divine Preſence</hi> reſting on them,
working in them, or going forth by them: but were, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men.</p>
               <p>It is a vain thing to hope to put Life into the Dead child
by the <hi>Staffe,</hi> without the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Eliſha;</hi> or to divide the
Waters with the <hi>Mantle,</hi> without the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Elijah.</hi>

Whoever attempts to conjure down any Devill by the
<hi>ſound</hi> of Chriſt's name, without his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and Preſence;
let him take heed, leſt the Devil flie in his face more enraged.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>ſecond thing,</hi> which our Saviour notes in theſe
men.</p>
               <p>3. Their End. <hi>This is</hi> Two-fold:</p>
               <p>1. Vainglory, v. 5. All their Works they doe to be ſeen of
men.</p>
               <p>2. Covetouſneſſe, v. 14. Ye devoure Widows houſes, and
for a pretence make long Prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> are the <hi>baites,</hi> which the Devill layes for
men. He hath eſcaped the <hi>hooke</hi> of the Devill, who cares
not for theſe.</p>
               <p>He that cares not to have any <hi>Poſſeſsion,</hi> or to make any
<hi>Appearance</hi> in this World; he is already in Heaven, and
dwells with God.</p>
               <p>This is the Way of theſe men, whom the Lord <hi>reproves,</hi>
and <hi>condemns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He warns his own Diſciples <hi>to take heed, that they follow
not their Examples.</hi> He gives them <hi>two Cautions</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> firſt Caution <hi>is in the Verſe before my Text:</hi> And call
no man your Father upon the Earth; for one is your Father,
which is in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> ſecond Caution <hi>is my Text:</hi> Neither be ye called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters:
for ye have one Maſter, which is Chriſt.</p>

               <head>THE TEXT.</head>
               <p>THeſe words, with thoſe foregoing them are to be opened
by a <hi>two-fold Diſtinction:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> between <hi>Naturall,</hi> and <hi>Spirituall</hi> things.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116091:6"/>
Theſe <hi>Cautions</hi> concern the Latter of theſe; but reach not to
the Firſt. <hi>The Heaven, even the Heavens</hi> (the true Heaven
of <hi>Spirituall</hi> things) <hi>are the Lord's: but the Earth</hi> (all things
of <hi>Nature) hath he given to the Children of Men, Pſ.</hi> 115. 16.</p>
               <p>Naturall things are ſhadows of Spirituall. The Naturall
man is an Image of God, and no more. An <hi>Image</hi> may
raigne, as Father, and Maſter among <hi>ſhadows.</hi> But in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
things, which are <hi>ſubſtantiall,</hi> God himſelf, who is the
only <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> will <hi>be,</hi> and <hi>appear All</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Diſtinction.</hi> The ſecond Diſtinction is a <hi>two-fold</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of man: <hi>one,</hi> as he is <hi>in God;</hi> the <hi>other,</hi> as he is
<hi>in himſelf.</hi> As man is <hi>in God,</hi> ſo he may be owned, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
for a <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Maſter</hi> in Spirituall things
themſelves. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> attributes ſo much to himſelf; but
marke, how he doth it. <hi>For though you have ten thouſand
Inſtructers in Chriſt, yet have you not many Fathers: for in
Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you thorow the Goſpell, 1 Cor.</hi>
4. 15. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hedgeth in his expreſſion on both Sides,
with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell;</hi> that the Glory might be all
given to God.. <hi>In Jeſus Chriſt I have begotten you thorow
the Goſpell. I, as I am, not in my ſelf, but comprehended in one
Spirit with Chriſt, in one Myſticall Perſon, which is Chriſt:
thorow the Goſpell,</hi> that is, <hi>thorow the preſence, power, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Chriſt Jeſus in me. Paul</hi> is ever carefull to ſpeak
with abundance of caution in things of this nature. <hi>Now I
live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, Gal. 1. 20. I wrought
more abundantly, then they all: Yet not I, but the Grace of God,
which was with me, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 10. So here, <hi>I have begotten
you; yet not I, but a man in Jeſus Chriſt; yet not I, but the
Goſpel, the power of Chriſt, which was in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Man in this ſence is but the <hi>Garment,</hi> and God is the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
that comes cloth'd with this garment.</p>
               <p>While we call any man Maſter, or Father in this ſence, we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116091:6"/>
do, as <hi>Thomas;</hi> who put his hand upon the fraile, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
part of Chriſt, his wounds; and cried, <hi>My Lord, and
my God;</hi> his <hi>eye</hi> being on the <hi>Divinity,</hi> while his <hi>hand</hi> was
upon the <hi>Humanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he, that attributes any thing in Spirituall things to
man in the other conſideration, as he is <hi>in himſelfe:</hi> he
makes him a member of that <hi>man of ſin,</hi> who ſets himſelf
up <hi>in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf: 2 Theſſ.</hi> 2. 4.</p>

theſe Offices, to be our <hi>onely Maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Chriſt hath the Office of a <hi>King, Pſal.</hi> 2. 6. God ſaith,
<hi>I have ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion.</hi> Chriſt is a King
of God's making, and appointing; the King of Saints; a
King in his Church, which is the true mount Sion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> the firſt King of the Jewes, was taller by the head,
than the reſt of his Brethren. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is higher by the
head, than all the Creatures; his head is ever above all
Clouds in the light of the Divine nature. <hi>The head of Chriſt
is God, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 3. Thus is Chriſt crowned King by the
Godhead. And by this Title hath he the Law of all Truth,
and Goodneſſe in his own Breaſt. For he is an abſolute, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream

               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath the Office of a <hi>Prieſt, Pſal. 110. 4. Thou
art a Prieſt for ever after the Order of Melchiſedech.</hi> Some
Divines tell us from the 7. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that this <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech</hi>
was the Holy Ghoſt, or Jeſus Chriſt in the Spirit, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Form of a Man. Both are much
at one. But however this be; it appears clearly from the
Chapter; that <hi>this Order</hi> of Prieſthood was <hi>abſolute, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable,
immortall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prieſthood, and Kingdome of Chriſt are both pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to himſelf. For he hath a peculiar <hi>anointing</hi> to them
both, <hi>Pſal. 45. 7. God, thy God hath anointed thee with the oyle
of gladneſſe above thy Fellows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>anointing</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt hath is the powring
forth of the Divine nature upon the Humane. This makes
him both <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King</hi> after an eminent, and ſingular
manner.</p>
               <p>Now it was one of the Principall works of the Prieſt, to
teach men the Knowledge of God. So you may read <hi>Mal.</hi>
2. 7. <hi>For the Prieſts lips ſhould keep Knowledge, and they
ſhould Seek the Law at his Mouth, for he is the Meſſenger of
the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> This was the <hi>duty</hi> of Prieſts under the

the Goſpel, as the <hi>Truth</hi> to that Type. <hi>He is the Meſſenger</hi>
(the Angel) of the <hi>Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the living Spring of Knowledge, which is ever full,
and flowes forth upon thoſe Soules, that hang on his lips;
even the Spirit of our Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>The Office, and aptneſſe of Chriſt to Teach; his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative

5. 13. <hi>His Lips, like Lillys, dropping ſweet-ſmelling Myrrhe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Appearances, and Diſcoveries of Chriſt to the Soule

               <p>
                  <hi>Lillys</hi> are Flower-de-luces, Flowers of Divine light.
<hi>Myrrhe</hi> is an Embalming ſpice of ſweet ſavour, preſerving
from corruption.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lips</hi> of Chriſt, his layings forth of himſelf to the Soul

They <hi>drop</hi> upon the Soule in the pretiouſneſſe, and power of
thoſe Truths, like Myrrhe, carrying the ſweet ſavour of Life

               <p>This is the ſecond Office of Chriſt, his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> by

He is <hi>like</hi> Moſes, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of this riſing
Sun, which went before him. Yet he is <hi>unlike,</hi> becauſe he is

<hi>God hath ſpoken in theſe laſt times by his Sonne.</hi> Glorious
truths laid up in God, concerning Himſelfe, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
eſtate of things are revealed firſt to Jeſus Chriſt, and
by him to us.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus is God-man, God and Man in Vnion.
As God, he poſſeſſeth eternally all Divine Truths in Himſelf:
then by vertue of the Vnion he drawes forth theſe Truths
out of the Depth of the Divine nature into the Humane, as
it were to the top of the water, that they may be viſible
there.</p>
               <p>Divine Truths can live no where, but in the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
neither can they appeare <hi>to us,</hi> but in the Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Therefore can there be a Spirituall Diſcovery no
where, but in Jeſus Chriſt, where he goes along with it,
and carryes it on in his owne Perſon: Becauſe in Him alone
is the Vnion betweene both Natures.</p>

have the Teſtimony of</hi> JESUS, <hi>worſhip God, For the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Jeſus is the Spirit of Propheſie. Propheſie</hi> is a Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of Divine things by a Divine light. This is that which
is called a <hi>Revelation, Epheſ. 1. 17. The Spirit of Wiſdome, and
Revelation in the Knowledge of Him,</hi> that is, Jeſus Chriſt.
And 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 30. If any thing be revealed to another, let the
firſt hold his peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing can come to us in a Divine light, except it come
in Chriſt, and his Appearance. For this is that which makes
the <hi>Day</hi> in Divine things. <hi>Ye are Children of the Light, and
of the Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are to take nothing for a <hi>Divine Light,</hi> a Propheſie, or
a Revelation, except the Lord Jeſus give his Teſtimony to
it by his Appearance in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Worſhip God,</hi> ſaith the Angel, I am a ſervant, who beare the
Image of the Living God, which is the Appearance of Jeſus
Chriſt in me. I am no more than the Precious Stones were
under the Law, on which a Light from Heaven ſhone forth,
to give anſwers from God. I am onely the Lanthorne, that
carry the Light in me, which ſends forth its Beames to
you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Prophet ſaith,</hi> To the Law, and to the Teſtimony, if they
ſpeak not according to theſe, they have no Light in them. Eſay
8. 20. <hi>This he ſpeaketh of the Prophets.</hi> No Light, <hi>that is,
no Morning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All Propheſies, or Spirituall Diſcoveries, before Chriſt
appeared, were, as <hi>Morning light,</hi> which flowes from the
Sun, though that be not yet ſeene it ſelfe. All ſince Chriſt
are as <hi>Beames</hi> falling from his Face. S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls all Goſpel-diſcoveries,
<hi>The Glory of God in the Face of Chriſt, 2. Cor.</hi> 4. 6.</p>

               </p>

ſets us ſerious Leſſons of Sorrow.</p>
               <p>Let us raiſe our Spirits to their Watch-tower, to a wakefull

Kingdomes in a view, as three <hi>Wine-preſſes,</hi> Himſelfe tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Yet his anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched

               <p>Still he ſeemes to be gathering together under his feet the

from the darke, and fiery corners of hell below, to enter into
theſe <hi>Pot-ſheards;</hi> that they may make a more confuſed, and
crueller Warre, each with other.</p>
               <p>Are theſe things Dreames, and Fancies? or are they ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly

               <p>We reade of a Law, which God made among the Jewes,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 29. that if any one afflicted not himſelfe on a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne

being a <hi>living member</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, or a <hi>naturall member</hi> of

               <p>We reade of him, <hi>Mar. 14. 33, 34. He began to be heavy, and

               <p>It is witneſſed of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 18. He was put to death

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who calls himſelfe a Chriſtian? and yet can forbeare in
theſe times to ſigh forth ſuch language as this:</hi> Lord Jeſus!
thou art our Maſter, we will learne of thee, to die with thee.
Make thou theſe Calamities, which our eyes ſee, our eares
heare, our hearts feele, and feare on every ſide of us, to be
our Croſſes, ſet up by thy Croſſe; on thy right hand, like that
of the good Thiefe. We have had power, pompe, pleaſures af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fleſh: But now let all theſe languiſh on theſe Croſſes,
till they bow downe the head; and we give up the Ghoſt of all
earthly ſtrength and hope. Thus we will dye, and our death
ſhall be ſweet unto us, as the Spring of a better, and more bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My ſoule! breathe thou forth thy griefes, and feares into
the boſome of thy JESUS, after this manner:</hi> My deareſt
Lord! All theſe miſeries round about me, ſhall be thy Croſſe to
me. Here will I lay me downe on this Croſſe, in thine armes, who
haſt been crucified upon it before me. This ſhall be my reſt in the
day of trouble: For here will I lay me downe, and dye, for ever
to the world, that I may riſe againe in thy boſome to a new hope;
to ſweeter, and ſurer Joyes.</p>
               <p>But, for <hi>what</hi> ſhall we mourne? We reade in the Goſpel
of a people, that ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>We will not have this man to
rule over us.</hi> For this the Lord Jeſus determines to go up, and
ſlay them.</p>
               <p>Have not we refuſed the Lord Jeſus, for a <hi>Maſter,</hi> to rule,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116091:11"/>
and guide us? Is it not for this, that he hath made theſe
ſlaughters upon us?</p>
               <p>Let us try our ſelves concerning theſe <hi>foure Maſters,</hi> Out
<hi>Humour;</hi> Our <hi>Luſts;</hi> Our <hi>Paſsions;</hi> The <hi>Examples</hi> of men.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Our Humour.</hi> God complaines, <hi>Eſay 52. 3. My people
have ſold themſelves for nought.</hi> How often have we ſold
our ſelves, our ſoules, our Saviour <hi>for nought,</hi> for a <hi>Humour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us thinke, and weepe; that many a time the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
hath dropt upon our ſoules the precious diſcourſes of life,
peace, and immortality, like the <hi>dew from the wombe of the
morning,</hi> that is, from the eternall Fountaines of light, and
truth: Yet we have caſt it off, without conſideration, meerly
becauſe our <hi>Humour</hi> lay that way, to be careleſſe of theſe
things.</p>
               <p>O ſtiffe-neckt ſpirits! Jeſus Chriſt hath come to us, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and drinking, that is, filling himſelfe with immortall
ſtrength, and truths, with divine ſweetneſſe, and joyes; that
he might flow forth on us, and feed us with the ſame bread,
and wine of Heaven.</p>
               <p>O hard-hearted Spirits! He, who is the Beloved of God,
the Beauty of the Godhead comes to us, neither eating nor
drinking; but weeping and dying; teſtifying the greatneſſe
of his love by the greatneſſe of his ſufferings; teaching us to
hide our ſelves from griefes, and death in his wounds, and
through them to paſſe into Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>Yet, we ſuffer all this to run waſte, making no entrance
into our eares, or hearts; and that for a weak, empty Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
for an inclination without reaſon; becauſe we are liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
to ſuch things, and have no pleaſure in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now let us fall downe before Jeſus Chriſt, and ſay,</hi>
Lord! thou art the Wiſdome of the Father. None Teacheth
like thee. Thy love, and wiſdome have overcome me. Many
Maſters, many Hamours have reign'd over me, beſides thee.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116091:11"/>
But I bring my ſtiffe neck to thee with a halter upon it; till thou
pleaſe to take it off; and put on thy yoke, which is light, and eaſie.
I bring my hard heart to thee, and lay it broken at thy feet; till
thou gathereſt it into thy breaſt, and make it whole there.</p>
               <p>2. Our luſts. <hi>Theſe are our ſecond</hi> Maſters. Pſal. 12. 13.
<hi>God ſaith of Iſrael,</hi> I gave them up to their owne hearts luſts.
<hi>And then afterwards,</hi> O that my people would have heard my
voice!</p>
               <p>Luſts lead us away from Jeſus Chriſt, and ſuffer us not to
heare his voice.</p>
               <p>Let us try our ſelves concerning this thing. What in all
the courſe of our life hath put us on the frequenteſt, or chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
actions of our life? Have the Spirituall appearances of
Jeſus Chriſt within us, conſpiring with his Word before us,
been the Oracle, with which we have conſulted? Or have
our luſts prompted us, and thruſt us on?</p>
               <p>Have our eyes been upon the Eye of Chriſt to guide us;
or on ſome Wedge of gold, or the Babyloniſh garment of
ſome power, office, or honour?</p>
               <p>What is it in the great action of this Reformation, that
hath put us to travaile ſo far about by <hi>the way of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
of a Warre? to meet with ſo many <hi>fiery Serpents?</hi>
What is it, which now hath caſt us into this feare, that we
ſhall waſte a weary life, and drop our Carkaſſes in this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
before we ſee the Land of Reſt?</p>
               <p>Have <hi>we</hi> not loath'd <hi>Manna;</hi> and luſted after <hi>Quails?</hi>
We have found no Savour, or Reliſh in the diſcoveries of
Beauty, Sweetneſſe, Reſt in the Spirit, and Perſon of our
bleſſed Saviour: But have been longing for the Bravery,
Eaſe, and pleaſures of the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Doe we thus requite Jeſus Chriſt? He hath ſpared no
loſſe, trouble, or paine, to make his way to us, to make
known Himſelf, his Father, and the Glory of Heaven to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:116091:12"/>
Yet now every motion of Ambition, Vanity, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or foule Deſire, hath more power to perſwade with
us, than the Life and Death of Jeſus Chriſt, than all his
Words, Teares, and Blood.</p>
               <p>Let our Saviour ſpeak by his <hi>Providence,</hi> as loud as
<hi>Thunder;</hi> let him ſpeak by his <hi>Promiſes</hi> with the tongue of
an <hi>Angell,</hi> to our eares and affections; let him ſpeak by the
power of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> with the voice of <hi>God</hi> to our Spirits; we
cannot heare him. But let a Luſt whiſper onely from out
of the ground of our ſenſuall part; we heare it with eaſe and
ſpeed.</p>
               <p>Shall we not be aſhamed, and grieved for theſe things?</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Our paſsions.</hi> You have an admonition from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<hi>Epheſ. 4. 27. Let not the Sun goe downe upon your wrath:</hi>
To that he addes, <hi>ver. 28. Neither give place to the Devill.</hi>
Paſſions are Devils come up into our ſpirits, with the fire
of hell burning hot upon them, and flaming from them.</p>
               <p>Theſe are uncleane Spirits, which for the moſt part
haunt the high places of Power, and the deſolate places of
Warre.</p>
               <p>When Paſſions are loud, God himſelfe cannot be heard
by the beſt men; as we ſee in the example of <hi>Jonah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What griefe is it to thinke, that we ſhould refuſe the <hi>Prince
of Peace</hi> for a <hi>Counſellour,</hi> when we take our paſſions in his
ſtead? that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come with his <hi>wounds</hi> upon
him, and not be able to quench the heat of our enflamed
blood with his blood, that was poured out for us? that
Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come with all the <hi>joyes</hi> of heaven upon
him, and not be able to put out the helliſh fire flaming in
our hearts, by theſe heavenly Beames? that he ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſome
to us all his conſolations, and yet not aſſwage ſome
carnall griefe in us?</p>
               <p>O how deepe a wound doth this make, if the time have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116091:12"/>
been, when Jeſus Chriſt in our ſoules hath been heard to
ſay, <hi>Spare;</hi> when our Paſſions have cryed, <hi>Ruine, Kill;</hi> and
have been obeyed!</p>
               <p>It is good for us to take words to us, and pray, <hi>Lord Jeſus!
thou canſt make this Heathen, this Rebell, my Paſsion, thy Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
Thou canſt cut her nayles, and haire, thou canſt take off
her earthlineſſe, and extremity. Doe this, and then make her
thy Spouſe. Let my Paſsion be ſubject to thee, beare thy Image,
bring forth to thee the fruit of a true repentance, and humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for my Paſsion. O! that anger, griefe, revenge, which have
been as the fire of hell upon my heart, may hereafter be as fire
upon thine Altar to make my heart a Sacrifice to thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Examples of men:</hi> This is the <hi>third Maſter.</hi> Wee

The <hi>Power</hi> of Man is a <hi>Beaſt:</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi> of Man is a <hi>Whore.</hi>
Which of us hath not worſhipt this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and taken his mark

this <hi>Whore,</hi> and bred up children of adultery by her, while
we have received opinions, or engaged in actions, as they
have had the ſtampe of ſome perſons, or partie, which hath
been the moſt, the moſt potent, or the moſt excellent in our
eſteeme?</p>
               <p>Are not the greateſt part of all caſes of Conſcience in

               <p>
                  <hi>Have not the faith of Chriſt in reſpect of perſons,</hi> ſaith S.
<hi>James, c. 2. v.</hi> 1. The Apoſtle layes the weight of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on a Contradiction cleerly implyed.</p>
               <p>That is not the <hi>faith of Chriſt,</hi> which we have in reſpect of
perſons, but the <hi>faith of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any one among us would take an impartiall account of
thoſe Principles, which his head hath taken in, or thoſe
paths, in which his feet have trod; and would ſet, as <hi>ſheepe</hi>
at his right hand, thoſe, which he hath had commended to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116091:13"/>
him by the life of Chriſt bringing them forth from his
Word in his Spirit, and confirmed to him by the cleere
light of Chriſt ſhining in them upon his ſoule: and then ſet
as <hi>Goats</hi> on his left hand, thoſe, which have manifeſtly, or
inſenſibly prevailed with him, becauſe they have the Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Man's <hi>power,</hi> or Image of Man's <hi>Glory</hi> upon them:

               </p>
               <p>But hath God the Father <hi>ſealed</hi> any man with the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his owne Glory, to be an Author of Truth to us;
as he hath done Jeſus Chriſt? <hi>Him hath the Father Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
John</hi> 6. 27. Hath any man ſealed his Truth, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
to us, by his blood, as Jeſus Chriſt hath done?
<hi>was Paul crucified for you? 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
               <p>Let us be aſhamed of this double neglect of our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
and our <hi>Soules;</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> that we have thruſt him out
of His chaire in our Spirits, and ſet up Man in it: of our
<hi>Soules,</hi> that we have made a man, who is a ſlight, and vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Shadow;</hi> our Maſter, and Meaſure; when we reject
Him, who is the eternall <hi>Image</hi> it ſelfe, of all Truth.</p>
               <p>Let Heaven bluſh, let the Earth tremble; if men bluſh,
and tremble not at theſe things.</p>
               <p>God is come downe into our ſhape, our Saviour comes
downe into our Spirits, to inſtruct us, and ſhew us what is
good. And we will have none of our God for our Guide,
but our fellow-wormes, which crawle on their bellies upon
the ſame earth, and feed upon the ſame duſt with our ſelves.
The Clouds are a covering between Him and us, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
learn of Him.</p>
               <p>He, who is the Image of God would ſhine upon us, and
goe before us in his Glories, as a Pillar of cleere, and ſweet
Light. But He ſhall not rule over us. Our luſts ſhall leade,
and our Paſſions drive us. We ſavour, and reliſh theſe
things. But the light of Chriſt is too myſterious, high,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116091:13"/>
and glorious for us; we cannot ſee, or follow it with our eyes.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt hath put himſelfe out of the boſome of the
Father, into the hand of men, death, devils, to make known
to us the things of our peace, hope, deſires, and happineſſe.
Yet we ſtop our eares without conſideration, whether he
ſpeak right things, or no; whether it be reaſon to refuſe, or
receive his words; being carryed to it onely by an humorous
careleſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Have you any ſenſe of theſe things? I beleeve, I know,
you have, if you have any ſenſe of your Saviour.</p>
               <p>I have two ſad words yet to ſpeak for a double cloſe to
this Vſe.</p>
               <p>1. Cloſe. Theſe refuſals to hearken to the Lord Jeſus, have
been the ruines of theſe Kingdomes thus far. <hi>I intreat you
to reade a few words with me from the Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 81.
13, 14, 15. O that my people had hearkned unto me, and Iſrael
had walked in my wayes! I ſhould ſoone have ſubdued their
enemies: but their time ſhould have been for ever.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. that <hi>no Scripture is of
private interpretation;</hi> but hath an univerſall concernment
for all eſtates, and times.</p>
               <p>I now pray, that each of us had a ſpirituall eye to ſee, a
ſpirituall eare to heare ſpirituall things. Then ſhould we ſee
Jeſus Chriſt hovering in his Spirit over theſe Iſlands; we
ſhould heare him making this lamentation over them in his
owne language:</p>
               <p>O that the Princes and people of theſe Lands had knowne me
in my ſecret wayes of converſe with the ſpirits of men! O
that they could have heard, and would have hearkned to what
I have ſpoken by my appearances in the depths of their ſoules!
O that the Rulers and people of theſe Nations could have ſeene
that path, which I have pointed out to them from heaven, by
my light, invibſile indeed to fleſhly eyes, but viſible to the eye
of Faith! How ſoone would I have ſubdued their enemies,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116091:14"/>
and enmities? But their righteouſneſſe ſhould have appeared
as the Sunne: the time of their peace ſhould have already
been, and have been for ever. O that when I had ſpoken of
the Law of my lips, and the Light from my face; theſe had
not been, as ſtrange things to them! But now they have
walkt, as men, and taken to themſelves the counſailes of men.
For this their feares are increaſed, their troubles are multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as the waves of the ſea. For this paleneſſe is upon every face,
bitterneſſe upon every tongue, upon every heart a ſad expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of greater evills yet, of thoſe dayes, when the Cities, that
yet flouriſh, ſhall be laid waſte, and a blacker, a more overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtorme ſhall ſweepe away all thoſe comforts, that have been
hitherto left them.</p>
               <p>Let us ſtand, and firſt looke <hi>backward</hi> on ſo much of this
our day of viſitation, as is already paſt, which hath been a
day of blackneſſe, and clouds. Then let us look <hi>forward</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the evening more terrible, and full of horrour, which is
too likely to conclude this Day. Let us ſay, <hi>Becauſe we have
followed our owne counſailes, and not our Saviour's; we have
brought all theſe evils upon theſe Kingdomes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let our hearts within us ſay this, then let them break, and
dye, that Jeſus Chriſt may revive them.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>firſt Cloſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Cloſe. Becauſe we have been no ſooner, no more humbled;
our calamities are growne greater. <hi>Give me leave to pick
ſome ſad paſſages out of that thundring Chapter,</hi> Levit. 26.
21. If ye will not hearken unto me, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. I will doe this unto
you, I will bring upon you terrour and conſumptions. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. If
ye will not for all this hearken unto me, I will puniſh you ſeven
times more. <hi>ver.</hi> 19. I will break the pride of your power.
<hi>ver.</hi> 20. Your ſtrength ſhall be ſpent in vaine. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. If ye
walke contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will
bring ſeven times more plagues upon you. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. If ye will
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:116091:14"/>
not be reformed by all theſe things, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. I will bring a
ſword upon you, (to avenge upon you the quarrell of my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:)
When you are gathered together within your Cities, I
will ſend the peſtilence among you, and you ſhall be delivered
into the hands of your enemies. <hi>ver.</hi> 27. If ye will not for all
this hearken unto me, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. Then will I walk contrary unto
you in fury. <hi>ver.</hi> 29. You ſhall eate the fleſh of your ſons, and
the fleſh of your daughters.</p>
               <p>Theſe are words to make the eare of Man tingle, and his
heart ake. Why are all theſe dreadfull menacings? For this,
<hi>If ye will not hearken to me; if ye will not be reformed</hi> by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſufferings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It were happy, if each man of us, when he comes home,
would retire into his Cloſet; or preſently retire into himſelf,
and ſay,</hi> Hath the Lord made ſo many breaches upon theſe
Lands, and ſo few upon my heart? Muſt he bring a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to abſolute ruine, before he reach my heart, to break
the pride of my power, wiſdome, honour, and confidence?
Muſt I be brought to the extremity of publike evills, to the end
of the Creature, before I will be brought to the end of my wits,
to meet with Jeſus Chriſt, that my eye may ſee my Teacher?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have the ſtory of a dreame, which</hi> Nebachadnezzar
<hi>had, and the Interpretation which</hi> Daniel <hi>made of it,</hi> Dan. 4.
<hi>Part of the Interpretation is expreſt</hi> ver. 23. They ſhall drive
thee from men, and thy dwelling ſhall be with the beaſts of the
field, and they ſhall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
times ſhall paſſe ever thee, till thou know, that the most
High ruleth in the Kingdome of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſay in our caſe, as</hi> Daniel <hi>ſaid to the King,</hi> This dreame
be to our enemies, and the Interpretation of it to thoſe that
hate us.</p>
               <p>Yet I very much feare, leſt we be driven out of all forme
of a Common-wealth, into a Wilderneſſe of Confuſion;
that our nayles will grow longer, and ſharper, like the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116091:15"/>
clawes of birds of prey; that our haire will turne into fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of flight, and fury; that we ſhall have our dwelling
among beaſts, not men; that ſeven times more will come
upon us, to wet us with the diſpleaſure of heaven; before
we know, that the moſt high God, the Lord Jeſus, hath
wiſdome, and might, that his hand diſpoſeth of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the earth, his lips alone utter knowledge, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
truth to Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doe we not yet groane for the plague of our hearts, that
they are ſo long ſo hard? Doe we not cry,</hi> O the ſlowneſſe of
our hearts to know the voice of our owne Shepherd, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the teachings of the Lord Jeſus!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shall we now all joyne with an unutterable, and irreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
groane to aske one thing of our Saviour? even this:</hi>
That we may be ever in thy Temple, O Jeſus! Thy preſence
makes our ſoules thy Temple: That we may be ſtill beholding
thy face, and ſtill ſearching out thine appearances within us,
to make theſe the men of our Counſaile.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the <hi>firſt Uſe,</hi> which is for <hi>Humiliation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

There is then no teſtimony, on which we can build
our Religion, our Beliefe in Divine things; ſave onely that
Teſtimony of that moſt high Spirit, which is God, and
Chriſt ſhining in our Spirits.</p>
               <p>It is one of the names of Chriſt, <hi>Revel. 1. 5. The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

ſo to be the <hi>Witneſſe of Witneſſes.</hi> Every Teſtimony is ſo
far to be believed, as it hath him teſtifying <hi>to it,</hi> and <hi>in it,</hi> who
is the <hi>faithfull Witneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is onely the greateſt Light, the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> the
Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, that can enlighten, and informe us in
the greateſt things, which are the things of God.</p>
               <p>The whole world, eſpecially the Chriſtian part of it, is fill'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116091:15"/>
with violent, and voluminous Diſputes, concerning this
thing: <hi>What ſhould be the Rule of our Faith, how we ſhould
diſtinguiſh the true Religion from the falſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are five Competitours for this <hi>Maſter-ſhip</hi> over our
Spirits:
<list>
                     <item>1. Reaſon.</item>
                     <item>2. The Authority of the Church.</item>
                     <item>3. Miracles.</item>
                     <item>4. The Letter of the Scriptures.</item>
                     <item>5. The Spirit.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>We will briefly examine all theſe, each apart by it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Maſter, Reaſon.</hi> This it ſelfe needs a Maſter. For it is
corrupted, and depraved in all Man-kind. Where then ſhall
we find <hi>right Reaſon?</hi> Who ſhall refine, and define it? By
what <hi>light</hi> ſhall we diſcover? by what <hi>fire</hi> ſever the ſilver
from the droſſe; Reaſon from the irregularities and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Reaſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who can draw a cleane thing out of an uncleane?</hi> ſaith
the Scripture. And naturall Reaſon it ſelfe in its Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie
teſtifies, That nothing can bring forth it ſelfe out of
<hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Potentiality,</hi> into act; out of an <hi>imperfect</hi> ſtate into
<hi>perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> determines the ſtate of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reaſon. Rom.</hi>
3. 12, 13. <hi>They are all gone out of the way.</hi> The path of
Reaſon was their way. <hi>Their throat is become an open Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inward parts of Man are now no more a <hi>Temple,</hi>
in which Reaſon ſits in its purity, and Power, as the Image
of God, giving forth its Oracles: but a <hi>Grave,</hi> in which
the dead, and rotten carkaſe only of Reaſon lies, without any
true light, or life.</p>
               <p>But Reaſon at firſt, in its height, was not, could not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:116091:16"/>
be a <hi>ſuitable,</hi> a <hi>ſure</hi> Judge in Spirituall things.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Reaſon at beſt is no ſuitable Judge in ſpirituall things.</hi>
There muſt be a <hi>proportion</hi> betweene the <hi>faculty</hi> and the
<hi>Object</hi> to <hi>unite</hi> them. Reaſon is but a <hi>humane</hi> light: Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
things are <hi>Divine.</hi> Reaſon is a <hi>naturall</hi> Power: Spirituall
objects are <hi>Supernaturall;</hi> of another <hi>rank,</hi> and <hi>kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spirituall things are ſpiritually diſcerned, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 14. Can
<hi>Senſe,</hi> which is the <hi>light of Beaſts,</hi> trace the workings, and
flights of <hi>Reaſon</hi> in her Contemplations; or diſcerne the
things of <hi>men?</hi> Can we ſee a <hi>ſoule,</hi> or an <hi>Angel</hi> by the light
of a <hi>Candle?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divine things muſt have a Divine light to diſcover them,
a Divine power, and principle to comprehend them.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Reaſon at firſt was no ſure Judge.</hi> It never was <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
It was deceived. It may then be ſo alwayes. If it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
perfect, it might againe be deceived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Man being in honour continueth not, but becomes like the
beaſt that periſheth. Pſal.</hi> 49. 12. The rectitude of Reaſon, was
the Image of God, the Crowne, and Glory of Man. By this
he grew up ſtreight in the midſt of the Creatures; uniting
them, heightning them all by a Harmony into the ſame
Image. So he ſubdued them to himſelfe, himſelfe with them
aſcended into, and reſted in the Divine Image.</p>
               <p>Thus Man was the true <hi>Orpheus</hi> with his Divine Hymnes
in the midſt of Beaſts, Trees, and Stones dancing to his
Muſick.</p>
               <p>But vaine Man continues not in this Honour. Reaſon
proves a degenerating thing. It is quickly tempted, eaſily
overcome; ſo it ſinks downward firſt into a <hi>brutiſh,</hi> then a
<hi>deviliſh</hi> ſtate.</p>
               <p>Reaſon was the glittering, and circling <hi>Serpent</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
<hi>more ſubtle then all the beaſts of the field,</hi> or, <hi>ſubtle above
all the beaſts of the field,</hi> Gen. 3. 1.</p>
               <p>Yet this <hi>Serpent</hi> was the firſt <hi>ſeate,</hi> and <hi>inſtrument</hi> of that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116091:16"/>
deceit, by which the Devill ruined our firſt Parents.</p>
               <p>But, if Reaſon were undeceived, uncorrupt, and ſhould
remaine ſo; yet could it give us no aſſurance. For it is a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
ſubordinate</hi> Principle.</p>
               <p>Reaſon may indeed be conſidered in a <hi>two-fold ſtate:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>State;</hi> As <hi>Reaſon</hi> is <hi>ſupreame in God.</hi> So it is no other
then Jeſus Chriſt. For He is the <hi>Image,</hi> the <hi>Harmony,</hi> the
<hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John 1. 1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God.</hi> Inſtead of <hi>Word</hi> you
may reade <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as properly, according to the Greeke:
for it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Reaſon;</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Speech.</hi>
Chriſt is that <hi>Reaſon,</hi> in which all things are knit together,
and appeare to God; that <hi>Reaſon, by,</hi> and <hi>for</hi> which God
made all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> in this ſenſe is the <hi>Spirit.</hi> For Chriſt, and the Spirit
are One; not two Maſters, but One.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>State:</hi> as Reaſon is <hi>ſubordinate in Man.</hi> Thus it is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Maſter, and Light from the Spirit. In this ſenſe we have
hitherto ſpoken of it, and doe ſo ſtill.</p>
               <p>Vpon this ground we ſay, that Reaſon in Man, if it were
pure, and could abide ſo, could have no full aſſurance in it
ſelfe, could give us none; becauſe it is a <hi>derived, ſubordinate</hi>
Light.</p>
               <p>It is ſubject to another, and depends upon another above
it. So it cannot have any Certainty, or perfect Cleerneſſe,
but in that other Light. Neither can it eſtabliſh us in any
Certainty, but as it holds forth that other Light in it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>That was the true Light, which lightneth every man that
commeth into the world, <hi>ſaith Saint</hi> John <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi>
John 1. 9. <hi>Reaſon hath ſo much of a</hi> true light, <hi>as it hath
of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reaſon in Man is an <hi>inferiour Light,</hi> and therefore <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:116091:17"/>
                  <hi>If we receive the Teſtimony of Man, the Teſtimony of God is
greater, 1 Joh.</hi> 5. 9. As <hi>God</hi> is above <hi>Man,</hi> ſo is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Light, by which God ſees, which is His <hi>Sonne,</hi>
and <hi>Spirit,</hi> above that Principle of Light, by which
Man judgeth all things, which is his Reaſon. For this is the
Teſtimony of Man <hi>his Reaſon;</hi> this is the Teſtimony of God
<hi>His Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So far then, as the Light of Man falls ſhort of the Light of
God; it muſt of neceſſity fall ſhort of perfection; have a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi>
though not a <hi>privative</hi> want: be mixt with darkneſſe,
uncertainty, doubt, feare. Though theſe in innocency were
tempered with their contraries, reduced to a harmony; and
ſo had not deformity, or torment: yet even then the <hi>morning</hi>
of light, and the <hi>evening</hi> of darkneſſe made the <hi>day</hi> of man's
knowledge.</p>
               <p>God is light, and in him is there no darkneſſe, 1 John 1. 5.
<hi>Reaſon at firſt, at beſt is but a</hi> Twi-light.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>Reaſon</hi> in Man, an <hi>inferiour, imperfect, dependent</hi>
Principle; <hi>unſuitable</hi> at beſt to Divine things; <hi>unſure</hi> at firſt,
<hi>apt</hi> to be deceived; <hi>deceived;</hi> now <hi>depraved</hi> in all men.</p>
               <p>This is that, which at firſt betrayed us, and caſt us out of
Paradiſe: ſhall we truſt it now, when it is corrupt? can it
now bring us into Paradiſe againe?</p>
               <p>We have examined the <hi>firſt Maſter,</hi> and found him unfit
for the Schoole of Chriſt. Let us now try the <hi>ſecond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Maſter. The Authority of the Church.</p>
               <p>What doe you take a <hi>Church</hi> to be? A Combination of
<hi>men?</hi> If you cannot truſt your owne Reaſon, or that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man; becauſe Reaſon hath a worme at its root, is adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
in its Principle: O then doe not truſt your foules, your
immortality to a Councel of all mankind, if it were met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one. For all men are acted by the ſame Principle of
<hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>

In vaine you worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will ſay, A <hi>Church</hi> is a Communion of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi>
men in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It is the Vnity of the Spirit, that binds men up into a

Epheſ.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is the</hi> preſence <hi>and</hi> power <hi>of Chriſt, who is the</hi> Image,
<hi>and</hi> glory <hi>of God, that gives to any the</hi> Authority <hi>of a</hi> Church.

1. 1. Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 4. In the name of our Lord Jeſus,
when ye are gathered together, and my Spirit, with the power of

               <p>Thus he deſcribes a <hi>Church-meeting</hi> by the <hi>Name,</hi> which is
the <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of Chriſt upon them.</p>
               <p>

Chriſt, and his Spirit through any ſort of men, that muſt
diſcover the true Church to me, and diſtinguiſh them from
every falſe, and pretended one.</p>
               <p>I will know, <hi>ſaith Saint</hi> Paul, not the ſpeech, but the power of
ſuch, 1 Cor. 4. 19. For the Kingdome of God (<hi>that is, the
Church</hi>) is not in word, but in power, (<hi>that is, in the power of
Chriſt working with them,</hi>) ver. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The woman is the Glory of the man,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Chriſt
is my <hi>Maſter.</hi> The Church ſhall be my <hi>Miſtris,</hi> ſo far, as ſhe

of his Spirit in any ſociety of men.</p>
               <p>See how S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in whom the authority of
the whole Church lay, commends, and juſtifies himſelf.</p>

2 Cor. 3. 1. Need we Epiſtles of Commendations to you, or

               <p>Theſe are the <hi>Commendatory Letters,</hi> which a true Apoſtle,
the true Church carry about with them: theſe are the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion,</hi>
by vertue of which they challenge their authority:
The <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> that is the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> that is the <hi>Diſcovery</hi> of Chriſt
ſhining thorow them into the hearts of men by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the onely life, power, authority, diſcovery of the
true Church; <hi>the Manifeſtation of Chriſt;</hi> and the <hi>Ministery
of the Spirit</hi> to the <hi>hearts</hi> of men.</p>
               <p>We reade <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 25, 26. of <hi>two Hieruſalems, one above,</hi>
the <hi>other below, that now is,</hi> ſubject to temporary appearances
in this world: or, that <hi>now is,</hi> whoſe time is now, whoſe <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and glory is of this world.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the <hi>Two Churches; one</hi> in the <hi>outward forme;</hi> the
<hi>other</hi> in the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be ſubject to the <hi>Hieruſalem below,</hi> to the Church in the
outward forme for the outward forme's ſake, is a <hi>bondage.</hi>
For that Church is in <hi>bondage with her children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Church is but our <hi>Mother-in-law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> which is <hi>above,</hi> the Church in the unity of
the Spirit is the true <hi>Mother of us all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Church is our right <hi>Miſtreſſe,</hi> which is our true <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
This is the <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> that <hi>cannot be toucht,</hi> that is
not obvious to ſenſe, or ſubject to a carnall diſcerning. Here
is the <hi>great Congregation of the firſt-borne,</hi> the meeting of all
good Spirits in this one Spirit: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>To be ſubject to the authority of this Church, is to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
free. For this Church is ſeene onely in the Spirit, and in
that Spirit juſtifies her ſelfe. This Spirit is the ſeale of the
living God upon her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:116091:18"/>
Thus the <hi>Authority of the Church</hi> is none, or tis that of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> in her.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Maſter: Miracles.</hi> Divines diſtinguiſh between <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum,</hi>
and <hi>Miraculum,</hi> a <hi>thing to be admired,</hi> and a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is <hi>to be admired,</hi> which is <hi>unuſuall,</hi> or <hi>unknowne;</hi>
which proceeds from ſome <hi>unwonted,</hi> or <hi>undiſcovered</hi> cauſe
in nature.</p>
               <p>That onely is a <hi>Miracle,</hi> which is above Nature, which
tranſcends the courſe, and power of Nature; which hath the
Divine Nature putting forth it ſelfe in the vigour of its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
Being.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You have</hi> Miracles <hi>deſcribed,</hi> Mark 16. 20. They went
forth, and preached, the Lord working with them, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word by ſignes following.</p>
               <p>That onely is a <hi>Miracle</hi> or a <hi>ſigne</hi> from heaven for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the truth, which hath the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> working, and
appearing in it joyntly with ſome creature.</p>
               <p>There is no way of <hi>confirming</hi> the Appearances of Chriſt,
but onely by the <hi>multiplying</hi> of thoſe Appearances.</p>
               <p>How then ſhall I know, which is a <hi>Miracle?</hi> I muſt have
a Spirit large, as the ſand of the Sea, that can put a Girdle
about the whole Compaſſe of Nature, in her wideſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
I muſt fathom her in the utmoſt of her Power, before
I can ſay of any thing, This is <hi>ſupernaturall,</hi> this is a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or elſe, he that ſaith, He ſees a Miracle, muſt ſay, he ſees
God as he is above all creatures, comming downe in his
owne likeneſſe, into ſome particular Creature, and making
a change of it, by that Diſcovery of himſelfe in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The waters ſaw thee, O God, and were driven backward,</hi>
ſaith the Pſalmiſt of the Miracles wrought in the paſſage of
the Children of Iſrael out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:116091:19"/>
No man can diſcerne a <hi>Miracle,</hi> 'till he diſcover <hi>God,</hi>
which can never be done, but by the Eye of God in the Soul
of man.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>Head-miracle.</hi> For in him firſt the Face
of God is ſeen in union with the Creature, as in a <hi>glaſſe.</hi> Each
Miracle is the ſame Appearance over again in ſeverall ſhapes,
as the ſame Soul, which ſhines out in the Head, ſhewing it ſelf
in the various Members, and parts of the body.</p>
               <p>Therefore is the Working of <hi>Miracles,</hi> a <hi>Gift of the Spirit:</hi>
and the working of a <hi>Miracle</hi> is by the <hi>faith of Chriſt, 1 Cor.</hi>
12. 9, 10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 20.</p>
               <p>But let us paſſe from <hi>Miracles</hi> to the <hi>Letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>Maſter: Letter of the Scriptures.</hi> Nothing is to be
ſaid of theſe, but reverendly. They are to be ſet below the
<hi>Spirit alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is in compariſon with this <hi>Spirit,</hi> that themſelves under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
themſelves, and teſtifie of themſelves theſe things.</p>
               <p>1. The Scriptures in the Letter are Dead.</p>
               <p>But now we are delivered from the Law, that being dead,
wherein we were held, that we might ſerve him, in the newneſs
of the Spirit, and not in the oldneſs of the Letter, Rom. 7. 6.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Letter</hi> are every where made of equall
dignity, power, and extent. <hi>Both,</hi> as they are <hi>alone,</hi> are <hi>old,</hi>
and <hi>dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scriptures thus taken ſignifie nothing, except you
bring ſome living Power, or Principle to them, to quicken
them. Lay them before a dead man, and they are, as dead,
as he.</p>
               <p>2. The Scriptures in the Letter are Killing.
2 Cor. 3. 6. The Letter Killeth, but the Spirit quickneth.</p>
               <p>The Letter of the Scripture Kils two waies, by <hi>confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
and <hi>condemning</hi> us. It hath ſo much darkneſſe upon it,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116091:19"/>
ſo much difficulty in it; it is ſubject to ſo many diſputes, to
ſuch variety of interpretations: that it troubles, and diſtracts
our Vnderſtanding, making it able to ſee nothing, to ſettle no
where.</p>
               <p>This indeed is the proper end, and beſt effect of the <hi>Letter,</hi>
to put out quite all <hi>our Light,</hi> that we may wait for a higher
Light from Heaven, which may reſtore the <hi>Letter</hi> without
us, and <hi>Reaſon</hi> within us, as by a <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi> I by the Law am dead to the Law: Galat.
2. 19. <hi>Happy is he, who can ſay in like manner,</hi> I by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
am blind, and dead to the Letter, that the Spirit may ſhine
thorow the Letter upon me, and fulfill the law of the Letter in
mee.</p>
               <p>3. The Letter of the Scripture is an Outward thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 1. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us, that he is not a <hi>Jew,</hi> who
is one <hi>outwardly,</hi> in the <hi>Letter:</hi> but he that is one <hi>inwardly,</hi> in
the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Letter,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> are oppoſed, as <hi>inward,</hi> and <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
The Spirit is called a <hi>Sword, Epheſ.</hi> 6. 17. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are the <hi>Scabbard,</hi> in which that Sword is laid up, and
out of which it is drawn.</p>
               <p>The Spirit in the ſame place is called the <hi>Word of God.</hi> This
is the <hi>inward</hi> Word, the Scriptures are the <hi>outward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Spirit is a <hi>Perſon:</hi> the Scriptures are a <hi>Garment</hi> fitted
to that <hi>Perſon,</hi> and receiving their warmth from him, before
they can give any to us.</p>
               <p>Yet every Principle, and Power of falſhood, as well, as
truth can cloth it ſelf with this <hi>Garment. He is not a Jew, that
is one outwardly in the Letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Each Principle, and Spirit makes the Scriptures appear to
it ſelfe in its owne Likeneſſe. Spirituall wickedneſſes can ſet
themſelves up in the higheſt places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>4. The Scriptures in the Letter are but a Shadow.</p>
               <p>The Law having a Shadow of good things to come, but not the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116091:20"/>
very Image it ſelf, Hebr. 10. 1. <hi>I have already ſaid, that the</hi>
Law, <hi>and the</hi> Letter <hi>are much one thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt in the Spirit is the <hi>Image</hi> it ſelf
of all good things. The Scriptures are the <hi>Shadow,</hi> which
this Image caſts from it ſelf in the Light of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>All creatures are Shadows of thoſe good things, which are
in God, and Chriſt. The Scriptures are the largeſt, the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteſt,
the neareſt, the beſt Shadow; and ſuch a one, as is
rightly ſeen only in the Eternall light of Chriſt. It vaniſhes
into a confuſed ſpot, when he withdraws; and is clear again,
when he appears.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> puts <hi>Timothy</hi> in mind of ſtudying the Scriptures;
but then leſt he ſhould miſtake them, he gives him this Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Caution, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 19. Knowing that every Scripture
is,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>given by inſpiration of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vnhappy is he, that truſts himſelf to any thing, as <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
any further, than it carries a <hi>Divine inſpiration,</hi> the
<hi>breathings</hi> of God, or his <hi>Spirit</hi> along with it.</p>
               <p>That is <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is the <hi>Word</hi> of God: and that the
<hi>Word,</hi> which is in union with the <hi>immortall Word.</hi> This <hi>Word</hi>
hath <hi>the words of everlaſting life, John</hi> 6. 68.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this particular <hi>head</hi> of the Scriptures, with
an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to an Objection, which the Papiſts make againſt
us. So ſhall we fall upon the <hi>laſt Maſter,</hi> the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> They ſay, we run in a Circle, while we make not
the <hi>Church</hi> the ground of our belief. For we pretend to Know
all things by the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> But, how the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> by the
<hi>Spirit.</hi> And, how the <hi>Spirit?</hi> by the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Thus we
run round.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But if a man ſay, he converſeth with my <hi>body</hi> by
my <hi>ſoule,</hi> and with my <hi>ſoule</hi> by my <hi>body:</hi> doth he run in a
circle, or ſpeak vainly? No: for both are true in a diſtinct,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116091:20"/>
and proper ſenſe. The <hi>Body</hi> is the appropriate, and immediate
<hi>Inſtrument</hi> of the <hi>Soule:</hi> the <hi>Soule</hi> is the <hi>Breath</hi> that fills that
<hi>Inſtrument,</hi> and gives it a diſtinct ſound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Spirit quickneth.</hi> As the Humane nature to the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Chriſt: ſo the Scriptures are a kind of <hi>Incarnation,</hi> or
as a <hi>Body</hi> to the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which alone is their proper
Soule.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures are the <hi>materiall object</hi> of our Faith; the
Spirit the <hi>formall;</hi> both the <hi>ultimate,</hi> the laſt object in their
kind.</p>
               <p>The Truths, which I am to believe, lie in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours</hi>
in the wall, or in a Picture. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is, as the <hi>Light.</hi>
I ſee the <hi>coloured wall</hi> by the <hi>Light,</hi> for that enlightens it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuates
its ſhape, and colours, brings them, unites them to
my eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enlightning, and actuating that alſo. I ſee the <hi>Light</hi>
by the <hi>Wall,</hi> for <hi>it</hi> reflects, and directs it ſelf from <hi>that</hi> to my
eye.</p>
               <p>So the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Colours</hi> on
a Picture are mutually ſeen <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>by</hi> one another; without
any Maze, or endleſſe Circle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy Word is a Light to my feet, and a Lanthorn to my paths,</hi>
ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. The Eternall Word in the Written
Word is the <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Lanthorne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scriptures are my <hi>Spectacles,</hi> though the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
Chriſt be my <hi>Light,</hi> or my <hi>Eye;</hi> and his Perſon, the <hi>Word</hi>
which I read.</p>
               <p>My God! Let me not want thee in the <hi>Humanity,</hi> while I
am a <hi>Creature.</hi> Bleſſed Spirit! let me enjoy thee in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
while I am in the <hi>fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Maſter, <hi>the</hi> Spirit. <hi>This is the</hi> Chriſt, <hi>the true</hi> Maſter,
1 Tim. 3. 13. Great is the myſtery of godlineſſe, God manifeſted
in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their Divine appearance,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:116091:21"/>
as they are inviſible to carnall eyes, <hi>pure, ſimple, perfect in

               </p>
               <p>All <hi>Fleſh</hi> is a <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of God; and each <hi>Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which is not the <hi>Subſtance</hi> it ſelf, is but <hi>Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is, the <hi>Spirituall appearance</hi> of God in
Chriſt, tries, and juſtifies, or condemns all Appearances of
Truth or Falſhood.</p>
               <p>This is the onely Judge, at whoſe Bar every Manifeſtation
of God in the fleſh receives its Juſtification; even the <hi>Spirit.
The Lord</hi> Jeſus <hi>is that Spirit, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>John 5. 6. The Spirit is Truth,</hi> that is, the Higheſt
Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſaith, There muſt be <hi>One,</hi> there can be <hi>only One firſt,</hi>
and <hi>laſt Truth,</hi> from which all Truths primitively derive
themſelves; into which they all ultimately reſolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for <hi>certainty,</hi> and <hi>evidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſaith, This Truth can be no other than the Higheſt
of all, the <hi>only true God,</hi> as he is, in his own Spirit, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
appearance.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is above <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and can reveal it
ſelf at pleaſure without <hi>Reaſon,</hi> is witneſt to by <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Spirit</hi> is the moſt high <hi>God.</hi> This <hi>God</hi> is our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as
he ſtoops into our Natures, as he puts forth himſelf in our
Perſons to become the Fountaine, the Glaſſe of <hi>truth, love,
life, joy</hi> within us.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>He,</hi> who calls to our fluttering, wandring Spirits,
and points them to himſelf, and ſaith, <hi>Here ſhall be your Reſt,
build your neſts on this Rock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Name</hi> is, <hi>I am that I am.</hi> I am <hi>Certainty.</hi> I am <hi>Truth.</hi>
All other things are ſo far certain, and true; as they have
a Certainty, and Truth in him; being comprehended in his
Appearance; or carrying forth his Appearance in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Come then all, that hunger and thirſt after <hi>Truth;</hi> ſit
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:116091:21"/>
downe at the feet of this Maſter, as <hi>Mary</hi> did.</p>
               <p>There are many <hi>Objections</hi> made againſt theſe inward Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings
of Chriſt by the <hi>Evidence of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Object. How ſhall I know this Spirit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you ask me, how you ſhall ſee other things: I
anſwer; by the <hi>Light.</hi> But if you ask me, how you ſhall ſee
the <hi>Light:</hi> I have nothing to ſay, but the ſame thing again;
by the <hi>Light. That which makes manifeſt is Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Light</hi> comprehends the <hi>object</hi> in it ſelf, flowes with it
into my eye, unites it ſelf to my eye, informs it immediately
with it ſelf, and with all ſhapes, and colours in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus if you ask me, how you ſhall know Divine things: I
anſwer; by the <hi>Spirit.</hi> But you reply; how ſhall I know the
<hi>Spirit?</hi> Still I anſwer; by the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis the rule of School-Divines, when you come to <hi>obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,
quo; ſiſtendum eſt:</hi> when you come to the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of <hi>ſeeing,</hi> or <hi>knowing;</hi> you muſt ſtop there. For that

               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> joynes them two: a <hi>Spirit of Revelation:</hi> and

               <p>Anſw. <hi>Saint</hi> John <hi>ſatisfies you in this doubt,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 20.
The Son of God is come, and hath given us an underſtanding,

               <p>Looke upward to the Mountaine of the Godhead, from
whence Salvation comes. Jeſus Chriſt will come by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

               <p>Doe, as the Father hath done, leave all judgment to the

               <p>So <hi>judge not, that ye be not judged.</hi> Judge not the Spirit by

               <p>What ſtrange thing is there in this? Hath not Saint <hi>Paul</hi>

               <p>The Counterfeiting of Mony brings confuſion upon a

                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:116091:23"/>
1. <hi>Leſſon: The Lovelineſſe of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I do not now
wiſh, that I had the skill of a powerfull Oratour, to write the
Lovelineſſe of my Saviour upon your fancies, with well-cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
words. But I pray, that He, the Lord Jeſus himſelf would
write with the <hi>Spirit of the living God</hi> upon your hearts ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
any thing, one <hi>Iota,</hi> one tittle of his own Lovelineſſe:
then I am ſure, you would go from this place, as the <hi>Eunuch</hi>
did from <hi>Philip; rejoycing, and praiſing God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 27. 8. Seek ye my face.</hi> Divines well
interpret this of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Face</hi> is the beauty, and majeſty of man. Jeſus Chriſt
is the naked <hi>face</hi> of the Godhead.</p>
               <p>He is called, a <hi>Branch,</hi> or a <hi>Flower, Zach.</hi> 3. 8. Jeſus Chriſt
is the Godhead <hi>branch'd</hi> forth into its diverſities of glories:
the <hi>Flower</hi> of the Divine nature ful-blown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John 1. 1. The word was with God: Prov. 8. I,</hi> ſaith Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<hi>was, as one bred up with him,</hi> that is, God, <hi>I was his
delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Saviour's Perſon is the <hi>Word,</hi> in which all things are
expreſt: the <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> in which all things have their form,
and fulneſſe.</p>
               <p>God is a Spirit of an infinite capacity; yet he entertains
himſelf eternally with the muſick of this <hi>Word,</hi> and the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this <hi>Wiſdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God pleaſeth himſelf to the <hi>heighth</hi> with the lovelineſſe, in
the Perſon of Chriſt, and ſatisfies himſelf to the <hi>full,</hi> with the
Varieties in that lovelineſſe.</p>
               <p>Do you not now begin to perceive ſomething extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
in the Perſon of the Lord? Could you not exchange
the whole world for a Sight, a taſt of him?</p>
               <p>When the Sop, and the Devill were entred into <hi>Judas,</hi>
Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Now is the Son of man glorified, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is glorified in him, John</hi> 13. 31.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt deſcends into the darkeſt ſhape, the loweſt ſtate
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:116091:24"/>
of things among the Creatures. Yet by His preſence He puts
a glory upon it, he makes it fit for the Father to glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with it; becauſe he finds himſelf, and his own Heaven
in it.</p>
               <p>1 Cor. 6. 11. <hi>We read of</hi> abuſers of themſelves with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
Idolaters, Extortioners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such, <hi>ſaith the Apoſtle,</hi>
were ſome of ye. But ye are waſh'd, but ye are cleanſed, in the
Holy Ghoſt, and the name of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>You that have the moſt foule and loathſome ſouls, heare
this: The <hi>name</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, is the Image of his beauties.
Doe but caſt your ſelves into the embraces of theſe beauties:
(You are alwaies embraced by them.) Let but this Perſon
ſpread his armes about you: you ſhall immediately be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and cleanſed; you ſhall ſhine forth fairer than any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by His comelineſſe; you ſhall be made a ſit Spouſe for
God.</p>
               <p>Doe you not feel the eyes of your underſtandings to open,
and take in a Glory? Doe you not now learn, that it is more
honourable, and more pleaſant to be in a Priſon, on a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,
on a Sick-bed, in a Grave with Jeſus Chriſt; than to be
in a Palace without him? Were it not a happineſſe to be
dead, that we might be for ever with him?</p>
               <p>My Lords! I beſeech you to receive a ſhort ſentence from
the mouth of a Worme, and lay it up in your hearts. When
the houre comes, in which all your comforts ſhall forſake
you, it will be of ineſtimable Vertue, and value to you. It
is this:</p>
               <p>The Perſon of Chriſt ſatisfies the Father; beautifies the blackeſt
Soule; glorifies the baſeſt, and bittereſt condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is the</hi> firſt Leſſon, <hi>the</hi> Lovelineſſe of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Leſſon: The Love of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> We read of
Chriſt's ſending his Spirit, to <hi>convince the world of Sin, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
and Iudgment, John</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:116091:24"/>
If the Lord would have you learn his <hi>Love,</hi> he muſt ſend
his Spirit into your hearts, to convince you <hi>of Sin,</hi> that you
may know, how much he bears with you; <hi>of Wrath,</hi> that you
may know, how much he bears for you; <hi>of Righteouſneſſe,</hi>
that you may know, how much he beſtows on you.</p>
               <p>He muſt ſend his Spirit into your Hearts to ſtretch them all
waies, to the utmoſt heighth, depth, breadth, and length;
that they may take in His Love. And yet then they will not
take in the thouſandth part.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> praies for the Saints; that they may know, the
<hi>heighth, depth, breadth, and length:</hi> and all this, but as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;
that they may <hi>know the Love of Chriſt;</hi> and yet
then, he ſaith of it, <hi>it paſſeth Knowledge, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>I will give you ſeverall places of Scripture, to be as Hints
to you of the <hi>Love</hi> of Chriſt, and His <hi>Teachings</hi> of it in the
Soule:</p>
               <p>Revel. 1. 5. Who, <hi>that is, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> hath loved us, and
waſh'd us in his bloud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4. Jeſus Chriſt complains from Heaven, <hi>Saul,
Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> 17. 1. Our bleſſed Saviour praies to his Father for his
Diſciples, <hi>that, that Love, wherewith thou loveſt me, may be in
them, and I in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come you, that yet wallow in your Luſts, and think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo ſweet, as they are to you: Come you, that Welter
in deſpair, as in your bloud; and think, nothing can be ſweet
to you: Learn the love of the Lord Jeſus, as He teacheth it.</p>
               <p>When thou haſt polluted thy ſelf with the greateſt Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe;
then feel the drops of thy Saviours bloud trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
apace from his Wounds down upon thy Boſome, to
Waſh off that Staine: then heare the Voice of thy Saviour
ſweetly ſpeaking forth theſe words in thy Spirit, <hi>Thus I die
for thee; yet thus thou Killeſt me, all the day long.</hi> Will not
theſe words break your hearts, and kill your Luſts?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:116091:25"/>
When you are at the loweſt ebbe of grace, or comfort;
when your feet ſtick in the <hi>myre of clay:</hi> then look upward,
ſee Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven, heare him in the midſt of all his
joyes, ſpeaking to his Father concerning thee, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>O my father, why doeſt thou ſtill perſecute me with thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure?
My joy is not full, while this man's ſins, and ſorrows
are upon him. I ſuffer ſhame, fear, want, woe in him. Here
ſhew, that love, which thou beareſt to me, on this poor ſoule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you ſeem to your ſelf moſt neglected of God, and
man, moſt afflicted from both: then look inward, ſee Jeſus
Chriſt in your own Spirits; hear him thus comforting thee,
<hi>Yet have I my Heaven here in thee: Yet haſt thou thy Heaven,
thy Righteouſnes, thy Joy, thy Jeſus hidden in the midſt of thee,
ready to be made manifeſt upon thee in their own Seaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doe not your Souls pant within you after this Jeſus, now,
that you hear ſo much of his <hi>Love</hi>? Now let each one ſay,
<hi>Depart from me, ye fruitleſs Delights, ye cauſleſſe Deſpairs. For
now I know that the love of the Lord Jeſus towards me excells
all things, that ever were. His loving kindneſſe is ſweeter than
life it ſelf. Skin for skin, and all, that a man hath, will he give
for his life; ſaid the Devill. But skin, luſts, life and all will he
give for this love, that hath once had any taſt of it. All my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
are in this and in thee, ô Jeſus!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the <hi>two</hi> principall, and moſt difficult Leſſons in
the ſchool of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There are many other beſides theſe, of which I will cull
out <hi>ſix:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Loath the World, and live in Heaven.</hi> Chriſt teacheth
us to ſeek a <hi>City,</hi> not of <hi>this Creation,</hi> whoſe <hi>Builder,</hi> Building,
and chief Inhabitant is God. He teacheth us to find this <hi>new
Hieruſalem,</hi> which is <hi>above</hi> us, <hi>within</hi> us, and there to dwell.
He <hi>diſcovers</hi> this City with its Citizens in our Spirits, and
<hi>draws</hi> us into it.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Hate Sin, and be Holy.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt teacheth with a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:116091:25"/>
                  <hi>tongue of Fire</hi> in the Heart of man, which melts, and makes
new; which as it <hi>teacheth, toucheth,</hi> takes hold, conſumes the
droſſe, and refines the gold.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Caſt off your ſelves, and abide in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings
of Chriſt run much upon <hi>two Creations,</hi> the <hi>one, Old;</hi>
the <hi>other, New;</hi> and a <hi>dying</hi> to the one, that we may <hi>Live</hi> in
the other. Take away the <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> is every where.
Take away the old appearance of the Creature, and Chriſt
with God appears. One Appearance is the <hi>Garment ſpotted
with the Fleſh;</hi> the other is the <hi>White Rayment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>Have a beautifull Converſation among men.</hi> The rule of
Chriſt is; that good men ſhould <hi>ſhine, as Lights</hi> in the world.
Light is clear, the ſame in every poſture, and motion. It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens,
and cheers; It draws, and directs. It is of the ſame
<hi>ſtuffe,</hi> and <hi>appearance</hi> with Heaven.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Be a Servant to all in Humility. Learn of me, for I am
lowly,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 11. 29. The Son of man came not to be
ſerved, but to ſerve, Mat.</hi> 20. 28. He is likeſt to the moſt
High, that can deſcend loweſt to ſerve, and pleaſe others in
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Be a Father to all in Charity.</hi> This is a Myſtery of
ſweetneſſe, which the Lord Jeſus infuſeth into the Soules of
his Hearers; to comprehend all things in <hi>one Spirit</hi> with
themſelves, by being themſelves comprehended in <hi>one Spirit</hi>
with God; to look upon all things as <hi>their owne,</hi> and the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings</hi>
of their owne Spirits, while they are <hi>one Spirit</hi> with
Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Many ſuch leſſons Jeſus Chriſt teacheth us; but they all
are eaſily learn'd and practiſed, when we thorowly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
thoſe two <hi>great Leſſons</hi> of the <hi>Lovelineſſe,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of
Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He that looks upon the <hi>Lovelineſſe</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, as he
looks, will feel himſelf by degrees transform'd into the ſame
Spirituall beauties, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 1. Beholding the glory of the Lord,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:116091:26"/>

               </p>
               <p>He that dives into the <hi>Love</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt will feel himſelf
irreſiſtibly drawn, and forc'd by it, to anſwer, and imitate it,
2 <hi>Cor. 5. 14. The Love of Chriſt conſtraineth us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Lovelineſſe,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of the Lord Jeſus fall both into

the words, which I have ſpoken outwardly to your ears, with
his words ſpoken inwardly to your hearts: then I know,
your Hearts have been powerfully touch'd: and ſome one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

of my life, in the pleaſures of this world. But doe thou thus

ſound of thy Lovelineſs, and Love in my Spirit. Then ſhall I
have more joy in theſe things, then ever I have had, when my
Corne, and Oyle have abounded; the treaſures, and delicacies of
the Fleſh.</p>

               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Property: Love.</hi> The <hi>teachings</hi> of Chriſt fell upon the
Soul, like the <hi>Soft rain upon the tender graſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Touchings of men have much of their own humours,

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>breathings</hi> of Chriſt are ſoft, and gentle, not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:116091:26"/>
quenching any heat, though never ſo weak, and dark; but
fanning the leaſt <hi>ſmoke,</hi> till it be a <hi>flame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Eagle bears her yong ones upon her Wing, and ſo
teacheth them to flie: thus doth the Lord Jeſus train us up
to Spirituality, bearing our infirmities.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Property: Life.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks <hi>quickning, creating</hi>
words. As he inſtructs, he <hi>infuſeth</hi> a Principle ſuitable to his
Doctrine. He holds forth a <hi>Light,</hi> and makes a <hi>ſeeing Eye.</hi>
He utters divine Myſteries, and makes a <hi>hearing Eare.</hi> He
preſents love, riches, joy, ſtrength; and gives a <hi>heart</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it.</p>
               <p>3. Property: Power. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks not</hi> Words, <hi>but</hi>
Things. You have not ſo learn'd Chriſt, if you have been taught
of him, and have learn'd the Truth, as it is in him, Epheſ. 4.
20, 21.</p>
               <p>Chriſt doth not teach by <hi>ſignes,</hi> but the <hi>ſabſtance</hi> it ſelf. He
<hi>preſents</hi> the Excellencies, of which he <hi>diſcourſeth;</hi> He ſhews
them to the <hi>life</hi> in his own <hi>Perſon.</hi> He <hi>plants</hi> them, and <hi>ſets</hi>
them in the Soule, to grow there.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſo teacheth, that he makes his words, <hi>Spirit</hi> and
<hi>Life, Iohn</hi> 6. 63. one Spirit, and Life with Himſelf, and you.
He makes theſe <hi>three, one Spirit;</hi> the <hi>Teacher,</hi> the <hi>Truths</hi>
taught, the <hi>Diſciple,</hi> that learns them.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Property: Perpetuity.</hi> 'Tis ſaid of God, that <hi>His work is
for ever, Eccleſ.</hi> So are the <hi>teachings</hi> of Chriſt for ever. He
gives us his Spirit to be a Treaſury, and a Remembrancer of
all Truth to us. <hi>He ſhall bring all things to your mind, Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou hast the words of everlaſting life, Iohn.</hi> The words
of Chriſt will live in your Spirits, as long as ye live; in your
death; eternally.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:116091:27"/>
5. Property: The infallibility of his Perſon. Let God be
true, and every man a lyar, Rom. 3. 4. <hi>Nay, man is not onely
a</hi> Lyar, but a Lie.</p>
               <p>Surely men of low degree are Vanity, and men of high degree
are a Lie: to be laid in a balance, they are altogether lighter
than Vanity, Pſal. 62. 9.</p>
               <p>Man is nothing more than an empty appearance. If he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be, or appear any thing, he makes himſelf a <hi>Lie.</hi> The
wit, ſtrength, excellency of man ſerve only to make a <hi>ſtrong
deluſion.</hi> Man hath <hi>infallibity</hi> no more, then he hath <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Jeſus Chriſt is more than <hi>man.</hi> He is <hi>God</hi> too. <hi>God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tempts any man, nor can be tempted, James</hi> 1. 13. Jeſus
Chriſt cannot deceive any man, nor be deceived. If He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
His appearances are true.</p>
               <p>If Jeſus Chriſt ſay, <hi>It is I:</hi> the <hi>winds</hi> of temptation, the
<hi>waves</hi> of doubt obey, and the greateſt ſtorm in the Soul is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced
into a Calme.</p>
               <p>There remains now only the <hi>laſt Property</hi> of Chriſt's tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings,
which is the Principall one. I ſhall therefore be
ſomewhat the larger upon it.</p>
               <p>6. Property: Demonſtration of his Doctrines. <hi>Saint</hi> Paul
<hi>teſtifies of himſelf,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 4. And my Preaching was not in
the enticing words of man's Wiſdome, but in the Demonſtration
of the Spirit, and of power.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> preached with an infallibility, it was not <hi>Paul,</hi>
but the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> that ſpake, and gave a <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> of
that, which he ſpake, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes a <hi>three fold Oppoſition:</hi>

to beget a <hi>humane faith</hi> to the higheſt.</p>
               <p>The Demonſtrations of Chriſt in his <hi>teachings</hi> are above,
not the <hi>Rhetorick</hi> only, but the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of man. They are
more then <hi>words, fancy, wit, reaſon,</hi> or <hi>wiſdome</hi> it ſelf; ſo far,
as man, or any meer Creature is capable of them.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>four Queſtions,</hi> which being propounded, and

               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>A</hi> Demonſtration <hi>is the</hi> Evidencing of things by an
irreſiſtible light, and clearneſs of conviction.</p>
               <p>The Philoſopher teacheth us from the Principles of <hi>reaſon,</hi>
and <hi>nature;</hi> that a Demonſtration muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
by ſuch <hi>Truths,</hi> as are the <hi>Firſt</hi> truths in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and moſt <hi>immediate</hi> in reſpect to us.</p>
               <p>The <hi>truths,</hi> by which you will <hi>demonſtrate</hi> any thing
muſt be,
<list>
                     <item>1. Firſt truths.</item>
                     <item>2. Immediate truths.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Firſt truths:</hi> Such as have none <hi>above,</hi> none <hi>before</hi>
them, on which they depend for <hi>Certainty,</hi> and <hi>Clearneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demonſtrating truths</hi> muſt be <hi>abſolute, unqueſtionable,</hi> ſuch,
as no underſtanding can reſiſt, when they are preſented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which manifeſts is Light, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 13. That which
makes clearly manifeſt without any <hi>deniall,</hi> or <hi>doubt,</hi> is <hi>Light,
in which there is no darkneſs,</hi> as S. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>God, 1 J.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:116091:28"/>
Such a Light muſt that be, which carries a Demonſtration
along with it. It muſt be the <hi>originall,</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> of all
Truth, as <hi>Light</hi> is of <hi>colours.</hi> It muſt have <hi>pleni-potency,</hi> an
<hi>all-ſufficiency,</hi> a <hi>Divinity</hi> of certainty, and clearneſſe, <hi>in,</hi> and
<hi>of</hi> it ſelf. No other thing can ever make the ſoul <hi>fully ſure,</hi>
without trembling, or wavering.</p>
               <p>A man muſt be of neceſſity <hi>double-minded,</hi> and like a <hi>wave
of the Sea,</hi> as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. till he come to the
<hi>Corner ſtone,</hi> the <hi>Bottom reaſon</hi> of truth, becauſe the whole
<hi>Building</hi> of truth ſtands on this.</p>
               <p>That only is a <hi>Demonſtrating Principle,</hi> an <hi>aſſuring,</hi> a <hi>quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
truth, which is ſo <hi>firſt</hi> of all, that there lies no appeale
from it to any: it ſelf being the <hi>Fountain,</hi> which gives teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to all truths, but receives, or needs a teſtimony from
none.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Immediate truths.</hi> Theſe are ſuch, as have an immediate
Vnion with the Soul, that there may be no <hi>diſpute</hi> about their
Evidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <hi>diminution,</hi> or danger of <hi>corruption</hi> by any <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls it a <hi>Demonſtration of power,</hi> when the firſt
Light, the firſt Truths communicate themſelves <hi>nakedly,</hi> to
the <hi>naked</hi> ſoule of man, both being uncloth'd of any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
repreſentations, or reports.</p>
               <p>Thus the Soul receives the Light of truth in the <hi>dignity of
its ſtrength,</hi> in the <hi>excellenty of its might,</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſpeaks of his
Firſt-born.</p>
               <p>The <hi>power</hi> of Truth is the firſt, and higheſt Appearance,
which is proper, perfect, ſubſtantiall. All inferiour appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
are Truth in its <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and ſhadowy.</p>
               <p>God made man, and woman One, that they might have a Holy
Seed, (<hi>a Sead of God, in the Hebrew</hi>) Malac. 2. 15.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt Truth,</hi> as the <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Soule,</hi> as the <hi>Woman</hi> muſt
be eſpouſed, and married, joyn'd without a Deputy, or a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:116091:28"/>
                  <hi>Third;</hi> they muſt be immediately, entirely One; that they
may have a <hi>Seed of God,</hi> a race of <hi>Truths</hi> cleer, and Sure, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the full brightneſſe of a <hi>Demonſtration</hi> ſhining in their
faces.</p>
               <p>If any thing come between your <hi>underſtanding,</hi> or <hi>belief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
and the <hi>firſt Truths:</hi> you doe not truſt to their Teſtimony,
but to the report of ſome other thing concerning them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The men of</hi> Samaria <hi>ſaid to the Woman,</hi> Now we believe,
not becauſe of thy ſaying. For we have heard Him our ſelves,
and know, that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the
world, Iohn 4. 42.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If thy Soul will have any one truth in the demonſtration of
power: it muſt be able to ſay to the Principle of Truth, the
higheſt Truth,</hi> Now I believe, not becauſe of any other teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
proof, or evidence. For I have heard, and ſeen, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
thee in my ſelf; and ſo I know, that thou art indeed (<hi>in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and power</hi>) the anointing Truth, the only Light and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
of all truths.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is the <hi>Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> is a name of <hi>eſſence,</hi> or <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> in God;
of the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> or <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>three divine Perſons.</hi> I wil
ſpeak of it now, as it ſignifies the <hi>eſſence,</hi> or <hi>nature</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>God is a Spirit, and they, that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him
in Spirit, and Truth, Iohn 4. 24. <hi>The</hi> Spirit <hi>is God unveil'd,
and ſhining out in his</hi> true Appearance, <hi>above all the ſhadows,
types, and Images of him in the Creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Fleſh profits not, but the Spirit quickneth, Ioh.</hi> 6. 63.
Thus our Saviour oppoſeth the <hi>Created</hi> and <hi>Uncreated</hi> part of
things in his owne Perſon under the names of <hi>Fleſts,</hi> and
<hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divines ſay that every Creature, even the higheſt A<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>el
hath ſomething of <hi>materiality,</hi> darkneſſe, groſneſſe, compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:116091:29"/>
carnality; and ſo it is <hi>Fleſh;</hi> compared with God, who
only is a Spirit; as the <hi>Spirit</hi> is a name of <hi>unity, ſimplicity,
purity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Spirit</hi> then is God in the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of his own Perſon,
abſtracted from all mixture, or compoſition with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is the <hi>Demonſtration of the Spirit?</hi> God
in his Spirituall appearance to the Soul is the <hi>firſt Truth.</hi> For
He is above All. He is the <hi>Immediate Truth.</hi> For he alone is
moſt intimate with all things. Nothing can unite it ſelfe to
the Soul, ſo inwardly, ſo immediately, as God: For all things
are <hi>by Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the onely <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of every, of any Truth,
the Spirituall appearance of God in the Soul, holding forth
that Truth in his own Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When Saint</hi> Paul <hi>had ſpoken of the</hi> Demonſtration of the
Spirit, <hi>he adds,</hi> that your faith might be not in the Wiſdome of
men, but in the power of God, 1 Cor. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>The Demonſtration of the Spirit is above nature, reaſon,
and all Principles of Wiſdome, or Truth in any Creature.
It is the <hi>power of God, as</hi> God; bringing forth the diſcovery of
himſelf; and all Truths, as particular diſcoveries in that V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall
One; like <hi>branches</hi> in the ſtock of a tree; or <hi>beames</hi>
in the body of the Sun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In thy light ſhall we ſee light, Pſal.</hi> 36. 9. In the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God within us ſhall we ſee the manifeſtation of each
Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You are Light in the Lord, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 8. Every Perſon, every
appearance is Light, hath a power of evidencing, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting
it ſelf, ſo far only, as it is in the Light of God.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Queſt.</hi> How is the Demonſtration of the Spirit <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>

               <p>The Lord Jeſus received this <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of God in the
Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>immediately.</hi> We all receive it, or
wait for it in the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt by His Mediation.</p>
               <p>This Spirit, or this Spirituall ſhining out of the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
is the onely <hi>Seale</hi> of truth, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 13. Ye were ſealed
with that holy Spirit of promiſe:</hi> in the former part of the
Verſe were theſe words, <hi>after that ye received the word of
truth.</hi> They were <hi>ſealed,</hi> that is, the truth of the Goſpel was
ſealed <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>to,</hi> and <hi>on</hi> them by the <hi>Seale</hi> of the Spirit, which
is, the <hi>Ingraving</hi> of the <hi>firſt Truth,</hi> upon each truth, or heart.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus is the <hi>Angel,</hi> that hath this <hi>Seale of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God in his hand, Revel.</hi> 7. 2. For He himſelf is firſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with it, and all other <hi>Members</hi> of this Truth, or <hi>Diſciples</hi>
of this Maſter are ſealed <hi>by</hi> and <hi>in</hi> Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Him hath the Father ſealed, Joh.</hi> 6. 27. The Father is the
<hi>Sealer</hi> primitively, by <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>authority.</hi> The Son, as he
is the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity is the <hi>Image,</hi> which the
Father ſets on, when he ſeals, <hi>Heb. 1. 3. the expreſſe Image of
his Perſon:</hi> the <hi>Sealing</hi> Image. The Holy Spirit is the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion</hi>
of this Image <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>by</hi> the Father. In this ſenſe the
Holy Ghoſt is ſaid to be <hi>received;</hi> as the Wax receives <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion</hi>
of the <hi>Image</hi> in ſealing. So he is called the <hi>Sealing,
wherewith</hi> we are ſealed, in that fore-quoted place of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Perſon of the Lord Jeſus, as he is <hi>Mediatour,</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
is the <hi>Sealer</hi> by <hi>place,</hi> and <hi>office,</hi> or deputation of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:116091:30"/>
Father. He is the <hi>Seale,</hi> as he is <hi>God.</hi> He hath the <hi>Sealing
power,</hi> for he hath the <hi>Spirit.</hi> He is the <hi>Sealed one,</hi> as he is
<hi>Man</hi> in union with God. Every <hi>perſon,</hi> or appearance is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
onely, as it is in union with him, <hi>In whom ye were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>The Glorified Humanity of our Saviour is, as fine <hi>Gold:</hi>
his Divinity, the <hi>Image:</hi> the Holy Spirit, the <hi>Impreſsion,</hi> the
ingraving, the union of this Image on the Gold, and on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
other <hi>piece,</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> from <hi>that Gold</hi> by fixing <hi>it</hi> ſtrongly,
and immediately on each Piece.</p>
               <p>Thus are Truths <hi>coyned,</hi> that they may be currant; thus are
they <hi>ſealed,</hi> that they may be ſure: thus doth Jeſus Chriſt
demonſtrate his doctrines in the ſoule, by ſhewing <hi>himſelf</hi> in
<hi>them;</hi> and the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>firſt glory</hi> of the Godhead in <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
2 <hi>Cor. 4. 6. God hath ſhined into our hearts the light of the
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for this Vſe, the way of <hi>diſcerning the teachings</hi>
of Chriſt, and diſtinguiſhing them from all other teachings
in the Soule.</p>

                  <hi>Conſolation.</hi> I will conclude all briefly with four <hi>Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
for the Diſciples of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Conſolat: Your Maſter teacheth the ſweeteſt, and ſureſt
things by afflictions, Job 33. 16. Elthu</hi> ſpeaks of God's <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
(or <hi>uncovering, unveiling) the ears of men, and ſealing
their inſtruction.</hi> He tels you that God doth this by <hi>dreams,</hi>
or <hi>viſions,</hi> when men <hi>ſlumber on their beds, v.</hi> 15. He reckons
up another may be <hi>chaſtenings,</hi> and <hi>ſtrong pain, v.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt makes one <hi>darkneſſe</hi> to cure another: the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of <hi>affliction,</hi> the darkneſſe of a <hi>fleſhly mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our heavenly Maſter teares that vaile, which lies on our
ears, and hearts, by the ſharpneſſe of our ſufferings; then he
lets in upon us the ſweet diſcoveries of God, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:116091:30"/>
He ſeals theſe in the night of our trouble by the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
of the Godhead breaking from his own face; and
makes them ſure by ſetting upon them the <hi>Image</hi> of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
day in his owne Perſon. He makes the <hi>defacing</hi> of all
worldly Images, the <hi>darkning,</hi> and putting out of all earthly
Light; his bleſſed advantage for the bringing into our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<hi>this Image,</hi> and <hi>Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Conſolat: Your Maſter teacheth you a Conformity to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by your Croſſes: <hi>nay, not onely ſo, but a</hi> Fellowſhip <hi>alſo
with Him,</hi> Rom. 6. 5. If we have been planted together (<hi>that is,</hi>
with Jeſus Chriſt) into the likeneſs of his Death.</p>
               <p>What comfortable cordialls are thoſe <hi>teachings,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
us ſo in a right, and ſweet underſtanding of all our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings;
that we enjoy them, as a <hi>repreſentation</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and a <hi>partnerſhip</hi> with our Saviour, in our ſelves?</p>
               <p>3. Conſolat: Your Maſter teacheth you to ſee your Conqueſt
over the World by the Croſſe. Heb. 12. 27. This once more, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
the removing thoſe things, which are ſhaken, as of things,
that are made; that thoſe things, which cannot be ſhaken, may
remaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt readeth ſuch a Lecture, as this, upon the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
or ruining of any of our earthly comforts:</hi> Be of good
cheer; this fleſhly appearance tempts you to folly, betraies you to
fears, and miſeries. It lets the Heavenly appearance of things
from diſcovering it ſelf to you, and it will let, till it be taken out
of the way. But if this fleſhly Image go away by being crucified;
then will the Comforter come, the Spirituall manifeſtations of
God, which ſhall continue with you for ever.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Conſolat: Your Maſter teacheth you to read a Heavenly
glory, in Earthly troubles, Joh. 13. 32. If God be glorified in the
Son of man</hi> (that is, by forming upon thee thoſe Images in
fleſh, of the utmoſt, and laſt varieties of higheſt Glory, which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:116091:31"/>
are Afflictions:) <hi>then ſhall he glorifie thee in himſelfe, and
ſtraight way he will glorifie thee,</hi> that is, then is God now fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
thy Pilgrimage thorow this Inferiour, fleſhly Image,
and even preſently taking thee out of it into the Glory it
ſelf. There thou ſhalt ſee that dark Image, <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
in that Light of its primitive Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in the meane time thou ſeeſt it,
as an Image of that Glory.</p>
