            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN this small Book you are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented with a long Prospect of an Opulent Kingdom, not only in its Dimension and Description, but Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically treated of from the time it was first known to be peopled, to this present Year <hi>1691.</hi> as well before the <hi>English</hi> had any knowledge of it, or so much as navigated the rough <hi>Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Seas, as after it allured them to its Conquest in the Reign of <hi>Henry II,</hi> since which time it has been a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Kingdom by Right of Conquest, and now inseparably annexed to the

Imperial Crown of <hi>England.</hi> To shake off which Soveraignty it has often strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in vain, and smarted under the many Wars and Rebellions that have been raised on that Account; yet, as if infatuated, those Warnings have been little available to the Natives, as will appear in the Relation we give you of what has happened worthy of Notice, in the Reigns of our Kings and Queens since its Subjection, but more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in the Transactions for Three Years past, as relating to Councils, Policies, Skirmishes, Sieges, and what else mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially happened. A History so full of variety, that we cannot conceive but it will give ample satisfaction beyond what has been published of this kind: And so not doubting but upon that score it will find Acceptance and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the hands of the Impartial and Vnprejudic'd Perusers, I make bold to subscribe my self the Candid Reader's Well wisher, and</p>

            </head>
            <p>THat <hi>Ireland</hi> has been very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inhabited, it appears not only by their own, but many other Historians, to whom a greater Credit is to be given; and tho' (the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives being little given to Navigation) its Fame has not much spread into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter parts of the World; yet for its Situation and Fertility, if the provident Care and Frugality of the <hi>Irish</hi> would but have help'd the Soil in any reasonable degree, it might be compared with most Islands in producing things necessary not only for the supplying its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, but such as could command the most valuable Commodities of <hi>Europe</hi>; yet the People of the ancient Stock not accustoming themselves to Labour, but rather to Spoil and War, desirous to live
<pb facs="tcp:47135:4"/>
idly upon the Product of the Country, and Manufacture of the industrious <hi>English,</hi> by such unlawful ways as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity has put into their hands, have in a great measure neglected their own Patrimonies, and suffered them in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places to become of no considerable value, as being eaten up by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment of Boggs, and over-grown with such Excrements of Nature as hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Fertility; and this mainly out of not altogether so much sloth and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, as their irreconcilable hatred to those of the <hi>Brittish</hi> Nation that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit amongst them, that they should get nothing by their Lands, tho' by their friendly Instruction and Conversation they might have been exceedingly bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in their Fortunes and Manners, and such Manufactures of sundry kinds improved, as might have redounded, not only to their particular Interests, but to the Inhansment of the value of the Island among the neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for it not only abounds in Iron, but other useful Minerals, and many other things that might, if well impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, set the poorer sort on work, and not only put an end to that Poverty that too much pinches the Natives, but
<pb facs="tcp:47135:4"/>
likewise make their Traffick abroad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable enough to be taken Notice of, and bring them a Trade, that in a short time would much contribut to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of a greater Plenty, and prove a comfortable Maintenance to some thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, who for several yearts past have been destitute of such a Livelyhood as might render them capable of subsisting, and for want of which they have been forced to travel abroad and serve other Nations, where they are for the most part treated little better than Slaves, as well in War as other Employments, many of them, if we impartially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Merits, as to Education, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Endowments, deserving better u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage; for it must be confessed by all unbiafied Persons, that the <hi>Irish</hi> Gentry are qualified sufficiently (at least the greatest number of them) for great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, if they would, according to what they understand, labour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their own advantage, by putting themselves forward in the World to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire those Preferments and Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings they are capable of, and might be very serviceable to the Government, but that most of them being <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> and so superstitiously zealous in
<pb facs="tcp:47135:5"/>
their way, that they are absolutely swayed and guided in all their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings by their Priests, who labour all that in them lies to keep up their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Traditions, and themselves in esteem to their great advantage, in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Wealth of the Kingdom, and as they see their opportunity, stir them up to a disesteem of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which has been the occasion of much Bloodshed, and brought Misery and Desolation upon the Land, that at sundry times has made it uneasie for many years; and we are not insensible that in the last Revolt, which has been a smarting one to the <hi>Irish,</hi> the Priests hurried them, especially the meaner sort, into a fruitless Rebellion by Threats of Excommunication, and all the bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Fulminations of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church. Tho' at last it is hoped, seeing the Stream of Blood is now so kindly stopped in the Kingdom, that the Natives will see their former Errors, and stick to their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, notwithstanding any Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or under-hand Dealings that may hereafter be inculcated, or clade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinely carried on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47135:5"/>Never had the <hi>Irish</hi> Nation a better opportunity to lay hold on, for settling a lasting happiness to themselves and their Posterities, under the Auspicious Reign of a King and Queen, who make it their utmost Endeavours, and think it their greatest Felicity, to do their Subjects good, sparing no Charge, nor shunning any Hazard or Danger that may conduce to the Settlement of a glorious Peace, not only in their own Dominions, but in all <hi>Europe,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store thereby, as far as lies in Human possibility, the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> wherein all appeared serene and calm, whilst uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Joy spread her downy Wings to shelter the delighted Nations from the Storms of Discontent and Trouble. From all which we may conclude, That if <hi>Ireland</hi> ever was desirous to be in a prosperous state, the time is come that puts that Opportunity into the hands of her Inhabitants to become a happy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When on the other hand, had things succeeded, as too many of them unadvisedly wished some few Months since, they might, instead of being at perfect Liberty, been the Sons and Daughters of Slavery, and the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest of Bondages, under the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:47135:6"/>
Tyranny; which how easie that Yoke is to bear, the Subjects of <hi>France</hi> have fatally experienced in the Reigns of many of their former Kings, but more especially under <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. to avoid which, the more discerning part have undergone a voluntary Exile, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a scattered People over the Face of the Earth, finding better usage in barbarous Nations.</p>
            <p>This, I hope, may suffice to warn the <hi>Irish,</hi> to consider where their Interest lies, and to embrace their Majesties Protection, as their true <hi>Asylum.</hi>

Troubles arose in his <hi>French</hi> Territories, that required his Presence; yet by his Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents he gave Leave, with Encouragement to his Nobles, and such others as were willing to go for <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <hi>Dormat</hi> impatient of his Exile, mainly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Concession, solicited <hi>Richard</hi> the King's Son, promising not only his Daughter, a very beautiful young Lady in Marriage, but great Possessions in the Country, when he should be restored, and all his Territories after his Death.

carried all before him; which made King <hi>Henry,</hi> who feared the Prince's aspiring upon such Successes, and willing to have the honour of Conquering so large a Kingdom himself, sent his Mandate to recall the <hi>English</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> so that but a few being left with the Prince in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and they reduced to a great streight by the <hi>Irish</hi> that had taken heart, they nevertheless Sallied upon an Army of 30000 with not above 1500 Men, and utterly routed them, taking great Spoil; and then coming for <hi>England,</hi> he surrendered all the Cities and Forts he had taken into his Father's Hands, for <hi>Dormat</hi> by this time was dead; and in the Year 1172. King <hi>Henry</hi> landed with a Royal Army, which brought such a Terrour upon <hi>Ireland,</hi> that <hi>Roderick,</hi> and most of the Petty Princes that were Independent, or his Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, came witn their humble Supplications to intreat him, <hi>That he would take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him, as their Supream Prince and Lord:</hi> So that at <hi>Christmas</hi> he made them a Noble Feast in <hi>Dublin</hi>; and settled the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Civil and Ecclesiastical Matters, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Abuses and Barbarities: And soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter those that held out in <hi>Vlster</hi> were brought to submit, from which time we may Date the Conquest of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the <hi>English,</hi> under which Soveraignty it has ever since remained as a conquered Kingdom, and now annexed to the Crown: yet the Natives who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hot spirited, uneasie, and restless under Restraint, have often strugled to break this Chain, though to the Loss and Disadvantage mostly of themselves.</p>

whom he likewise requited with Death before his Fall, and the dead Bodies fell by that means on each other, which happened in the Year 1320.</p>

            <p>In the Year 1329. during the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, the <hi>Irish</hi> in <hi>Leinster</hi> and <hi>Meath</hi> rebelled; against whom the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> drew out what Forces he could, but being over-poured in number, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and the <hi>Irish</hi> made great Spoils of the <hi>English</hi> Possessions, and amongst other Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, burnt eighty of them in a Church where they had fled for Refuge; but at last the <hi>English</hi> fortified themselves in <hi>Wexford,</hi> and upon their approach to besiege it, sallied out upon them with such Courage, that Success crowned it, and 4000 of the <hi>Irish</hi> were killed, most of them that fled being hotly pursued, were drowned in the River <hi>Slane</hi>; which with some other Encounters, where Victory decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on our side, so quelled them, that in this King's Reign they rebelled no more.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47135:11"/>
that nothing memorably occurs in History, till the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, when the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> being Deputy, one <hi>Richard Symons</hi> a Priest, wheedled him into a belief, that one <hi>Lambert</hi> a Youth, whom he had brought up as his Scholar, was really the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> Son to <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Brother to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, that had escaped out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and was come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for protection; and the young Spark ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been well tutored; and of a graceful Carriage, so well acted his part, that not only the Lieutenant, but a great many of the <hi>Irish</hi> Nobility sided with him, raising considerable Forces to espouse his Quarrel, Crowning him King in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and not content to keep him there, they brought him with a considerable Army into <hi>England,</hi> landing in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and Proclaiming him.

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47135:11"/>
Sister to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and then being publickly punished, was sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> from whence endeavouring to escape, he was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and with him the real Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who had been kept a Prisoner there a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time: all that was alledged against him was, that he attempted to make his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape with <hi>Perkin,</hi> to raise new Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, great Commotions were stirred up, which were at first suddenly appeased, but the Earl of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare</hi> being Deputy, the People exhibited their Complaints against him to the Court of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as the cause of many Disturbances by his severe using them, and amongst other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles they had this, <hi>viz. All</hi> Ireland <hi>is not able to Rule this Earl. Then,</hi> said the King, <hi>this Earl is the fittest Man to Rule all</hi> Ireland: and thereupon he continued him Deputy; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared this hatred against him proceeded only from the strict hand he had over them to keep them from rebelling. And another was, <hi>That he had caused to be burned the Cathedral Church of</hi> Cashal. The Archbishop of that place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his chief Accuser, and when every one would have denied it, he humbly replied, <hi>By Chreest I would never have done it, had I not byen told the Archbishop was in it.</hi> Which plain dealing made the King smile, and the Archbishop storm and fret: however, the Earl was ordered to rebuild it at his own charge, and so continued in his Deputyship; but often fell into displeasure by reason of his

plain downright dealing; and Cardinal <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> now ruling all at Court, for speaking too plain to him upon his Examination at the Council-Board, where <hi>Wolsey</hi> sat as President, he sent him to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and ordered a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for his Execution without the King's Knowledge; of which the King having No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by the Lieutenant, was mightily incensed at <hi>Wolsey,</hi> and that great Favourite soon after falling into Disgrace, the Earl was released and sent to <hi>Ireland,</hi> with one Sir <hi>William Sheington,</hi> who was made Deputy: however the <hi>O Moors</hi> fell into Rebellion, but being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by Forces drawn out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> they were dispersed, and many of them killed, and for that time the Tempest blown over; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it lasted not long, for the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi>'s Enemies, having again upon many grievous Complaints prevail'd to have him sent for to <hi>England,</hi> he was committed to the <hi>Tower</hi>; whereupon his Son, the Lord <hi>Thomas,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Perswasions of the Chancellor to avert him from it, fell into Rebellion, and drew great Forces after him; yet driven at last to extream Necessities, he was perswaded by the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> then Deputy of the Kingdom, to submit himself to King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Mercy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of Pardon; but some of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers having killed <hi>Alen</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> he was upon his Arrival committed to the <hi>Tower</hi>; and King <hi>Henry</hi> being informed, That the <hi>Geraldine</hi> Family had vowed never to have Peace with him, he sent for the Earl's five Brothers in Custody; when one of them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

Nor did the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> escape, for being countermand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and accused of holding Correspondency with this Family, though without any notable Proof, he was Condemned for High-Treason, and beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi>

               <hi>England</hi>; yet upon his humble Submission re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased and sent over, upon promise of keeping the Country in quiet; which he pretty well observed during the short Reigns of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> only some petty Commotions happened that were soon quieted.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1566. being the Seventh year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, one of the chief Lords of <hi>Ireland,</hi> named <hi>Donald Mac Carti More,</hi> upon some little stirs that happened, came over, and not only cleared himself to the Queen, but delivered up to her all his Territories, vowing perpetual Fealty; but she in gratitude restored them again, and made him Earl of <hi>Glencare,</hi> giving him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Sum to bear his Expences; so that by his great Authority amongst the Natives, it was thought the Kingdom would be kept quiet; but it proved otherwise: for after some private Conspiracies, that never broke out, were defeated, the Earl of <hi>Desmond,</hi> the Eleventh Earl of that Title, who had great Territories and abundance of Followers broke into open Rebellion, and did great damage to the <hi>English,</hi> driving them out of many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, killing divers Gentlemen in Revenge, as he said, of the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being put to death; and amongst others, one with whom he had contracted a strict Friendship, and usually called Father, who when he saw him with his drawn Sword breaking into his Chamber, and relying upon his former Friendship, cried out, <hi>What is the

matter,</hi> Desmon, <hi>my Son?</hi> to whom the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Earl sternly replied, <hi>I am no longer thy Son, nor thou my Father; but thou shalt surely die</hi>: and thereupon they put him, and all they found in the House to the Sword.</p>
            <p>These Outrages allarmed the Lord Deputy, who drawing out his Forces, after divers Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes put the Earl to the Rout, who being forsaken of his Followers, lurked for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the Bogs and Mountains; but misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble want driving him thence among the Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, he was there found and slain by a private Souldier, when his Head being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to <hi>England,</hi> was set upon <hi>London-Bridge</hi>; and so fell this Eleventh Earl of <hi>Desm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Second was by the timely Notice the Deputy had of Two thousand <hi>Scotch Highlanders</hi> land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to joyn with the <hi>Irish,</hi> and knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that they had laid down their Arms, as to their greatest number, they came on with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47135:14"/>
such as fell in with them by the way, in hopes to joyn the rest, breaking into the Province of <hi>Connaught,</hi> where indeed a great many of the Country Peasants took Arms on their part; but the Lord-Deputy by speedy Marches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and finding they were got into Bogs and Fastnesses, after he had encamped within sight a-while, feigned a Retreat, and they, by reason of their over-numbring him, supposing he had fled, immediately followed; but were no sooner trained on the firm ground, e're the <hi>English</hi> fac'd about, charged their Front and Flanks, piercing the Array of their Battel, and put them to utter rout and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so that not above eighteen of them esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of upwards of Three thousand, which crushed the <hi>Scots</hi> attempting to help them in their Rebellion.</p>
            <p>These bad Successes shewing plainly, the Hand of Heaven against them, did not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever make them sensible of their Misfortune, in taking up Arms against a powerful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for perceiving themselves too weak to struggle in the Lyons Paws, they began to tamper with other Nations, alledging after the Reformation, <hi>Religion,</hi> as a ground to justifie their Rebellions, though they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver starting from their Allegiance, when both Nations professed that of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Communion; but now taking this for a plausible pretext, the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> began und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thoughts appear to be elevated above what was reasonable, till the Death of the King. But when King <hi>Iames</hi> the Second ascended his Brother's Throne, and declared himself a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> then it was the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists began to prick up their Ears, and to expect Advantages beyond their Abilities, publickly declaring, <hi>The Day was their own, and that the Protestant Religion must go down.</hi> But it seems in this, as in their other Aims, they took such Measures as made them shoot wide of their Mark.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> who had been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by King <hi>Iames,</hi> when Duke of <hi>York,</hi> from a mean to a considerable Figure, was looked upon as a fit Instrument to carry on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in that Kingdom; and therefore upon the re-calling of the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> he was made Lord-Lieutenant, and soon gave the <hi>Irish</hi> great Hopes of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over the <hi>English</hi> in that Kingdom, by first Cashiering the Protestant Soldiers and Officers that were in Arms, and then the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Ministers of Justice: And though there were Complaints made against him at the <hi>English</hi> Court, yet they were not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he the rather encouraged in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes; insomuch, that things run so high that many feared a fatal Event, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers left thereupon the Kingdom; some going for <hi>Holland,</hi> others for <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi>: and in such a method Matters continued to be pushed violently on, till News came of a purposed Invasion of the

And indeed, the whole <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Revolting in a manner from King <hi>Iames,</hi> and what was more remarkable, a great part of the Army he had been so long Training up at a vast Expence. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Landing of the Prince with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the <hi>Irish</hi> Forces that had been sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in expectation of Mountains, found that they were not only dwindled into less than Mole-hills, but themselves in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Condition, not only at the point of starving when Disbanded with the rest of the Forces, by the Earl of <hi>Feversham,</hi> but almost exposed to the Fury and violent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment of the People, who had conceived a Hatred against them; so that at last, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, they were taken care of, and most of them shipped for the Emperour's Service a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Turks.</hi>

            <p>The Prince and Princess being proclaimed King and Queen of <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> on the 14th of <hi>February,</hi> 1688. upon the Humble Address of both Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, great care was taken for the speedy succouring the oppressed Protestants of <hi>Ireland</hi>; and that the Papists in Arms against them, might be left without Excuse, a Proclamation was sent over, offering, among other things, a Pardon and Indempnity for all that should in Obedience to it lay down their Arms and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to their respective places of Abode, and there peaceably behave themselves as obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Subjects ought to do, upon which Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they should in full Freedom enjoy their Estates according to Law, and that the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> upon such a Consideration should have all the Favour that the Law allows for the private Exercise of their Religion; with a further Promise, That a Parliament should be speedily called in that Kingdom: But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on refusing to comply with the Royal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, to be esteemed as Rebels and Traytors to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. their Lands and Possessions to be Forfeited, and disposed of by way of Distribution among those that should be Aiding and Assisting in the Reducing the Kingdom to its Obedience.</p>
            <p>This Royal Concession, though <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured what in him lay to hinder its being dispersed, wrought some good Effects, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that Earl, to counter-ballance it,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47135:21"/>
put forth a Paper which he termed his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, not only therein insinuating what great Advantage the Kingdom would reap by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out. But that their Fears might be dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he promised speedy Aids and Succours from <hi>France,</hi> and that they should not want for either Money or Provision; and moreover, the better to encourage them, gave hopes of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s speedy landing there with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army. And the better to secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and keep up the Courage of his Party he sent out Detachments to secure divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Gentlemen in the Country, and make Garrisons of their Houses. But the greatest part of them having timely notice, made their Escapes; by which the Protestants grew stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the <hi>North</hi>; however their Goods and Possessions were destroyed and harassed. The Priests being the greatest Incendiaries to stir up those that were actually in Arms to Spoil and Rapine, as being sure of a share, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to Arm the madding Multitude; so that one might see Droves of the latter, some half naked, others tattered, and all in miserable Rags, armed with Pitchforks, Bills, Staves, and what other merciless Weapons they could get on the suddain, running like so many Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to spoil and plunder, and in their gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness of Prey, not many times distinguishing Papists from Protestants. And it was strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported, That there was a great Debate in the Council, to which some Popish Bishops were admitted, about a General Massacre, as the best Expedient to clear the Country of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47135:22"/>
Hereticks: But <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> (let it be to his praise) had the Generosity to oppose and detest it, and put a stop in some measure to the mischievous progress of the Rabble, yet when some of the Chiefs who had got Protections from him, made their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: <hi>That they were notwithstanding plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi>: He only shook his Head, and told them, <hi>It was Necessity that made his Men to do it; and he could no ways help or restrain it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These violent proceedings made those that thought upon the Earl's Protection, they might have some confidence in their continuance as to safety, begin to make away for the Sea-coast; and although the Masters of Ships were commanded on pain of Death to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport none, yet many escaped to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they were well received, and Provision made for them by way of Publick Brief and Collection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the latter end of <hi>March</hi> the Abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted King landed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> with a great Train of Officers, but very few Forces, and was received at <hi>Dublin</hi> with a mixture of Joy and Sorrow, bringing with him as his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervisor Monsieur <hi>D'Avaux,</hi> with some <hi>French</hi> Generals. The <hi>Recorder</hi> of <hi>Dublin</hi> made a long Speech to him upon his Arrival, extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him for Courage, Conduct, and all the Heroick Vertues imaginable, above the Skies; and a general Joy spread in the faces of the Roman Catholicks, thinking now the day was all their own, and not doubting to carry
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47135:22"/>
every thing by force or submission; and more Soldiers were Listed and Regimented under the <hi>French</hi> Officers that came over, and care taken to lay up Stores. Money was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where extorted, and the plundered Cattel, Corn and Hay brought in, and sold at incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Rates; insomuch that they soon ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered an Army of between Forty and Fifty Thousand Men.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were doing at Land, the <hi>English</hi> Navy being out at Sea with a strict Charge to hinder Correspondence between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Squadron under the Command of Admiral <hi>Herbert,</hi> had Notice by their Scout Ships, that part of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was abroad, and stood away to the <hi>Irish</hi> Coast: Whereupon he made all the Sail he could after them, and the next Day found they stood into <hi>Bantry Bay,</hi> a very spacious bearing in of the Sea, and though for fear of the Shallows, and other Difficulties that might offer, it proved a work of Difficulty to enter upon them, for they seemed no ways willing to come out to an Engagement; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they were much superiour in number; yet the Admiral drawing his Ships into a Line, and lying upon the stretch, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them extreamly from Ten in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till Five in the Afternoon, at what time the <hi>French</hi> Admiral tacked from us, and stood farther into the Bay. We killed them a great many Men; and some of our Men declare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, they saw one of their great Ships go to the bottom. On our side we lost Captain <hi>Aylmer</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:47135:23"/>
of the <hi>Portland,</hi> with a Lieutenant, and about Three hundred Seamen killed and wounded, and could our Fireships have entred upon them, most of their Ships, which were Forty four in number, to about Twenty eight of ours, might have been destroyed.</p>
            <p>Our Fleet after this Engagement came back to <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> and there refitted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King of <hi>England</hi> went to take a view of them, and Dining aboard the Admiral, created him Earl of <hi>Torrington,</hi> &amp;c. and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed about Six thousand pound among the Seamen.</p>
            <p>And now the <hi>French</hi> having violated the Peace, and undeniably begun the War in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading <hi>Ireland,</hi> the King delayed not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the War against them by a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that purport, bearing Date the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>May,</hi> 1689. and great Preparations were made for passing over to <hi>Ireland,</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were Levied in all parts of <hi>England,</hi> and Money prepared for defraying the Charge of the Expedition; which was the more facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, upon the Estates of <hi>Scotland</hi> submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Crown to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and taking of them upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing owned and invested King and Queen of that Kingdom, which they did by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, who waited upon Their Majesties to that purpose, in the <hi>Banquetting-House</hi> at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> And the Viscount of <hi>Dundee,</hi> who had headed the Rebel <hi>Highlanders,</hi> and others in that Kingdom, being killed in a fatal Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel near St. <hi>Iohnstown,</hi> things began to go
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47135:23"/>
better, and the Success of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Affairs gave way to a more speedy prosecuting those in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the <hi>Inniskilling-men</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, pierced the Enemies Quarters, and got great Booties, defeating divers Parties, and making themselves terrible to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>Upon News brought that <hi>Maccarty</hi> was in those Parts with a strong Party, plundering and ravaging the Country. Lieutenant-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Berry,</hi> with three Companies of Foot, eight Troops of Horse, and three of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, marched towards them; but upon their approach, found they were made stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than they were reported, by another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that had joyned them, and were much su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to him in number; which obliged him before he found himself sufficiently strong to attack them, to send to Colonel <hi>Woolsey</hi> at <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niskilling,</hi> for a Re-inforcement; which he no sooner obtained, but he charged them with much bravery, killing a considerable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, taking some Prisoners, and putting the rest to flight; but the Flyers in their way being greatly re-inforced, rallied, and came to second Encounter, which for a time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued bloody and doubtful, they by reason of their advantageous Post, much galling our Horse with their Cannon; but the Defiles, or dirty narrow Passages being resolutely passed by our Foot and Dragoons, they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Masters of the Cannon, which gave our Horse the advantage to charge the Enemies Horse, who thereupon deserted the Foot and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47135:24"/>
fled, and the Foot after them, a great many being killed, and some taken Prisoners, by which Defeat the Country was freed from great Incumbrances. This part of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Army that had a long time lain heavy upon it, being by this means, and in this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, fell of the Enemy by the Sword, and those that were drowned in desperately throwing themselves into the Lough to escape the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suers, about Three thousand.</p>
            <p>There happened likewise divers other Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters of lesser note, wherein the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants for the greatest part gained the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were doing, the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, with King <hi>Iames</hi> at the Head of it, marched towards <hi>London-Derry,</hi> promising themselves, the Terrour of their Arms would oblige it to a Surrender upon their first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; but found they were extreamly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken; for although Colonel <hi>Lundy</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and the two Regiments sent from <hi>England,</hi> under the Colonels <hi>Cunningham</hi> and <hi>Richards,</hi> had withdrawn and slighted it, as a place not tenable against an Army of Forty thousand Men, with a Train of Artillery and divers Mortars; Providence so ordered, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Bulwark of the sinking Nation, and gave the Enemy their first considerable check; for divers Troops that were abroad, mostly composed of undisciplined Soldiers, throwing themselves into it, they, together with those that were found there were Regimented, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the multitude seizing the Keys, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47135:24"/>
with great alacrity to defend it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving chose Mr. George <hi>Walker,</hi> Minister of an adjacent Village, their Governour, and Major <hi>Baker,</hi> his Co-adjutor, or Assitant-Governour during the Siege. And now those in Arms in the Town consisted of 117 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and every Company contained sixty Men, being in all 7020 Common Soldiers, and 341 Officers. The next thing taken in hand, was to view the Stores, and ordering their better Security from any Embezling, as resolving to defend the place to the last extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, having already rejected the Offers the Enemy made them, in case they would readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly submit, which consisted of much promised Favour and Protection; but the hard dealings others had met with, who had put themselves into their hands, made them deaf to all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals, and their great Guns being mounted on the Wall, they fired upon the Advance-Guard of the Enemy, who had been promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be received with open Arms, by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> and others, who undertook to bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the besieged, which much consternated King <hi>Iames,</hi> then within the reach of their Cannon, and obliged him to remove to a place of more safety.</p>
            <p>However, seeing fair Words and Promises could not gain it, they resolved to reduce it by force, beginning within a day or two after their appearance before it, to break Ground, and run their Trenches, drawing up a Demi-culverine, within a Furlong of the Town, with which they battered the Market-House,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47135:25"/>
and did some damage to other Houses; but the Cannon from the Town playing among them, did considerable Execution; and to hinder their nearer approach, the Besieged sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied, and beat them out of their Trenches, killing about Two hundred Men, amongst whom was the <hi>French</hi> General <hi>Mamow,</hi> and others of Note, with little loss on our side, and of Note, only Lieutenant <hi>Mac Phedris</hi> was killed.</p>
            <p>The Besiegers finding this way little availed them, drew four Demi-Culverine into an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard adjoyning to the Town, and kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Firing, which hurt many People in their Houses, and made some Impressions in the Walls: Nor was the damage left unrequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Cannon of the Town, which killed them a great many Men, and some considerable Officers, and a sudden shot took off two Fryars in their Habits, as they were exhorting the Besieged to press on the Siege.</p>
            <p>And now to do their Work more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, they placed two Mortar-pieces, and threw in divers Bombs, which did some damage to the Houses and People, whereupon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged sallied, and killed several of the Enemy at <hi>Penburn-Hill,</hi> losing only two of their own and eighteen wounded. The same day a Shot from the Town broke and dismounted one of their Pieces on the Battery, and killed the Gunner, whereupon they drew a Trench a-cross <hi>Windmil-hill,</hi> from the Bog to the River, and there raised another Battery, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47135:25"/>
the Hedge with Dragoons; but at the same time the Besieged sallied in a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number, and dividing one part, made them Masters of the Trenches and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Ground, killing about two hundred; whilst the other Party beat the Dragoons from the Hedges. Which reiterated Losses so enraged the Enemy, that having Captain <hi>Cunningham,</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Douglass</hi> upon some Sallies, they, after Quarter given, put them to the Sword, which served to confirm the Besieged in the belief of the Mercy they were to expect if they fell into their hands, and made them more obstinate in a resolute Defence: and alluring the Governour out, under pretence of Treaty, they fired a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Shot at him, yet none of them had the power to hurt him, by reason upon their first presenting, he sheltred him behind the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of an old House, and retired into the Town, cautious how he trusted them any more.</p>
            <p>The Besiegers by this time grown weary of continual Duty, and the danger they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to, drew off their main Body, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped on a Hill about two miles from the Town, yet left it entirely besieged.</p>

            <p>On the part of the Besieged, the loss was very inconsiderable, only Captain <hi>Butler</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing too eagerly after the Enemy, was taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and a few killed by a great shot coming over the River.</p>

            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Rosen</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Marshal, by this time arrived in the Enemies Camp, and understanding the little progress they had made in carrying on the Siege, fell a swearing, <hi>By the Belly of God, he would not only demolish the Town, but bury the Besieged in their own Ruins.</hi> But upon the Attacks he made, found no better Success than the rest: and the Lord <hi>Clancar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now there being several Prisoners in the Town, who had several Relations of Note and Command in the Enemies Camp, the Governour, and the rest, caused a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to be set up in the sight of the Enemy, threatning to hang the Prisoners thereon, if those miserable People were not suffered to return to their Habitations, yet leave given them to write to their Friends, to know what they would do on their behalf. <hi>Rosen</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them no Answer; but <hi>Hamilton</hi> returned them a slight one.

            <p>Another Stratagem they had to shoot Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Town in the dead Shell of a Bomb, <hi>viz.</hi> not filled with Powder, as imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Governour, and other Superiour Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers kept their Proposals from the Soldiers; but this enraged them the more, and it was ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

About the Thirtieth of <hi>Iune,</hi> Major <hi>Baker</hi> died; yet the Defence continued as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous as ever, and divers Sallies were made, though the Garrison through Famine, Diseases and Loss was lessened near one half, and the Famine increased so fast, that Horse-flesh was fold for Eighteen pence the pound, and but little of that to be had: A Quarter of a Dog, that fead upon the dead <hi>Irish,</hi> at Five shillings
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47135:27"/>
and six pence, his Head at half a crown, a Cat at four shillings and six pence; Rats, Mice, Tallow, Greves, and all noysome things that could be possibly eaten, proportionably; so that in the whole Town there was but nine lean Horses left, and a pint of Meal, and a little Tallow to each Man, when Providence so ordered, whilst they were at their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, News came that Ships were making their way up the River; which to their great Joy and Comfort proved true: for Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Kirk</hi> having notice that the Town could hold out no longer, ordered the <hi>Mountjoy</hi> and <hi>Phoenix,</hi> and <hi>Mountjoy</hi> guarded by the <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> to force their way at any hazard, which they did through the Showers of the Enemies Shot, and found the Boom broke; one of them however struck upon a shelve, yet the Stock of her Guns set her free again, and they came safe to the Town, bringing Life to a dying People: which the Enemy perceiving, thought it to no purpose of staying longer before it, least they should receive worse disgrace, but in some confusion raised their Camp, firing <hi>Culmore,</hi> and divers other Places in their Retreat, breaking for haste some of their great Guns; and had a Party of the <hi>Inniskilling</hi>-Men, and some of the Garrison up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Rear, who cut off, or took Prisoners the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Town in a Siege of one hundred and five Days, for so long it lasted, between 18 and 19000 Men, and among them 100 of their best Officers.</p>
            <p>And now pardon me, Reader, for insisting so long upon this particular, which I could not slightly pass over, since (if we consider the Weakness of the Place, few of the Men that defended trained up in War, and Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city it endured, and the time it held out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a powerful Army, backed by almost a whole Kingdom) it may very well compare with the most famous Siege that ever was mentioned in History.</p>
            <p>Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi> soon after these Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours got in, came to <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and was received with all the Demonstrations of Joy a People in so ruinous a Condition, could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow; and having viewed the Walls and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, blessed himself to think that such slight Works could ever have been defended so long against such an Army.</p>
            <p>Things in <hi>London-Derry</hi> being settled as well as the shortness of time would permit, it was agreed that Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> should go for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and present his Majesty with an Address in his own, and the Names of the principal Persons that had been in the Town during the Siege; where he was very graciously recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and his Majesty, as a Mark of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, for the signal Services he had done him, ordered him 5000 pound, and a Promise of his further Regard. Whilst this Siege lasted, the <hi>Inniskilling</hi>-Men and others of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

One fatal Instance of which take for many:</p>
            <p>It happened that the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with a Party, took Captain <hi>Dixie</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner

This was well accepted, and <hi>Guerrie</hi> was sent, but <hi>Galmoy</hi> thereupon ordered the two Young Gentlemen to be tried by a Council of War, for receiving a Commission from <hi>England;</hi> and being sentenced, had orders to prepare to die the next day, but in the mean time great Endeavours were used, and Promises made them of Life and Preferment, if they would turn Papists, and adhere to King <hi>Iames.</hi> But they generously rejected the Offer, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their Religion before the saving their Lives; and although <hi>Mac Gurrie</hi> interceded mainly for them, and reproached the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi> with the Stain of his Honour after his solemn Promise in Writing; yet he would hear nothing on their behalf, but caused them to be hanged upon one <hi>Russel</hi>'s Sign Post; whilst he made merry there; and not content with their Lives, he ordered their Heads to be cut off, and tossed to the Soldiers to play at Foot-ball with, which when they had mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used for a time, he caused to be set up on the Market-Cross at <hi>Belturbet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This made, I say, the rest more cautious to trust their Mercy; whereupon the <hi>French</hi>

General <hi>Rosne,</hi> resolute to subdue them, came within the shot of their Cannon to encourage the Soldiers that were gathering in those parts against them, but a shot had spoiled his Undertaking, had it not fallen a little too short, yet it beat up the Stones, which wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the Leg, and his Horse in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and killed two Troopers, insomuch, that frighted with this Disaster, he gave over the Attempt: But greater Actions than these at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Fate of <hi>Ireland</hi>; the <hi>English</hi> Army so long expected was embarqued, and came on with a fair Wind, being discovered some Leagues at Sea, by the longing People who watched for it on the shore, and proclaimed its arrival by their loud Shouts and Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Joy: and on the Thirteenth of <hi>August,</hi> 1689.

Cannon and Mortars were planted against it whilst the Trenches were opened, and no sooner they heard the <hi>English</hi> speak to them in a Dialect of War, from the mouths of their Cannon, but they beat a Parley; but the main import of their Request being to send to King <hi>Iames</hi> to have his leave to Surrender: it was rejected, and the Mortars and Cannon began to play against the Town very furiously, they answering us with their Cannon in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, especially anoying our Men with two Pieces advantageously planted in the Lord <hi>Dungale</hi>'s House; yet our Bombs did great Execution, beating down and setting many Houses on fire.

            <p>The Duke finding the Plains of <hi>Dundalk</hi> commodious to Encamp on, and the Winter Season approaching, caused the Tents to be pitched, whilst the Enemy's Army between 40 and 50000 fortified and entrenched about <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee.</hi>

            <p>The General went out with a Party to view the Enemies Posts, and Situation of the Country, and upon his return to <hi>Lisburn,</hi> where now his Head-Quarters were, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the welcome News, That Colonel <hi>Woosley</hi> marching from <hi>Belturbet</hi> with Seven hundred Foot, and Three hundred Horse, notwithstanding his being discovered by the Centinels, who gave the Alarm, and the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Weather, he got thither half an hour after break of day, and there, contrary to his expectation, found the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> arrived with Twenty five hundred Men, which with the Garrison made up about Four thousand, and these were drawn up in good order near the Fort; yet the Colonel took Courage, resolving to Charge them, ordering his Men as the ground gave opportunity, and soon they joyned in a fierce Encounter, the <hi>Inniskilling</hi>-Men standing to it manfully; so that notwithstanding the great odds, in two hours time they beat the Enemy out of the Field with considerable slaughter; in which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47135:34"/>
Action the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> had his Horse shot under him, and Colonel <hi>O Rely,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Cavan</hi> was killed, as also two Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonels, and divers other Officers of Note.</p>
            <p>The Enemy beaten out of the Field, our Men too eager of Plunder, entered the Town before they had gained an entire Victory; which the <hi>Irish</hi> perceiving, rallied, and those in the Fort sallied upon them; so that in the scattered disorder they were in, they had been mostly cut off, had not the Colonel with a Reserve of Two hundred and fifty Foot, and Eighty Horse hasted to their rescue, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them leave to get to their Arms, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he beat the Salliers into the Fort, and made the others retire; yet the Town being a Magazine, and full of Plunder, he could not get his Men out, till he was forced to fire it about their Ears, whereby great Stores, of Provisions were consumed; for most of the Houses were filled with Bread, Meal, Oats, and the like, being a Six Months Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for the Garrison: and by this Defeat and the Ruine of the Town, the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> was disappointed of his Design, which by his Orders, was to Post there with Ten Thousand Men, to be composed of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of all the Regiments, and so to keep the Country in awe, and make Incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as he perceived it advantageous.</p>
            <p>In this Action, on our side were only Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men killed, of which number were Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Armstrong,</hi> Major <hi>Trahern,</hi> Captain
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47135:35"/>
               <hi>Mayo,</hi> and Captain <hi>La Maugere</hi>; but the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy lost above Three hundred, and Two hundred taken Prisoners; many that fled threw away their Arms and Baggage for haste.</p>
            <p>Upon this Success, Sir <hi>Iohn Lanier</hi> being at the <hi>Newry</hi> with a strong Party, advanced to <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Bedlow</hi> Castle, where was a Company of Foot, consisting of between Thirty and Forty Men; but the Dragoons soon stormed it, killed divers of them, and set the Castle on Fire, and upon their return attacked <hi>Dundalk,</hi> wherein the Enemy had a Garrison; but they kept close and would not venture to sally, and our Men not being strong enough for a formal Siege, plundered the Houses thereabout, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with a considerable Booty.</p>
            <p>About this time the Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> landed with the <hi>Danish</hi> Forces under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for their Majesties Service, and in a short time joyned the Army.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Callimot</hi> attempting to surprize the strong Fort of <hi>Charlemont,</hi> but being too soon discovered, he was obliged to Retreat; which he did with the loss but of one Man.</p>
            <p>Spring coming on, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth was not altogether unmindful of his Promise, but sent Five thousand <hi>French,</hi> with some Cloaths and Ammunition, in lieu of which Succours, as many <hi>Irish</hi> were sent to <hi>France,</hi> under the leading of Lieutenant General <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carty,</hi> who having been taken Prisoner by the <hi>Inniskilling</hi>-Men upon the great Overthrow,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47135:35"/>
had by this time made his escape, for which Colonel <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Governour of <hi>Inniskilling,</hi> where he had been detained Prisoner, was questioned; but upon Trial, producing a Letter from his Superiour Officer, for what he had done, the matter passed over.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Woosley</hi> about this time had the Castle of <hi>Killesandra</hi> delivered to him upon Summons, the Garrison being terrified into a compliance, upon Notice he was about to spring a Mine under it, the Garrison consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 160 Men, were conducted to <hi>Cavan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and many other Castles and advantageous Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were frighted at the approach of our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or compelled to Surrender; and great Plenty abounded in the <hi>English</hi> Camp, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son those that brought it received Silver Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: when on the other side King <hi>Iames</hi> had caused Brass Money to be coined, and an Order to pass it at certain Rates, though it was not a Twentieth part of the value; yet prohibited it in Payments in his Custom-house and Exchequer: and having called a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Irish</hi> Parliament, they anulled the Act of Settlement, and all other Acts favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Protestants, relating to Matters Civil or Ecclesiastical; so that Protestant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Ministers were out, and Popish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Priests advanced to their Benefices, and great Oppressions used on all hands: but whilst this was doing, <hi>Charlemont,</hi> a strong Fortress of the Enemies, that had been all the Winter blocked up, finding no Succours of Provision, though some of our Men got in over
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47135:36"/>
the Morass, which hastened the consumption of their Provision, beat a Parley, and after some debate about Articles they were agreed upon, they being in their Orders as followeth:</p>
            <p>That all the Garrison, <hi>viz.</hi> the Governour, Officers, Soldiers, Gunners, and all other Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, the Deserters who run from our Camp, since the first of <hi>September</hi> precedent, only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and all other persons in the said Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, shall have their Lives secured, and march out with their Arms, Bag and Baggage, Drums beating, Colours flying, Match lighted, and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let in Mouth, each Officer and Soldier Twelve Charges of Powder, with Match and Ball pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable, and their Horses without any mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station in their Persons and Goods now in their possession, not belonging to the Stores upon any pretence whatsoever, that the said Garrison may march the nearest way to <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and not be compelled to march above 8 or 9 miles a day.</p>
            <p>That all sick and wounded Officers, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther persons that are not able to march at present, may remain within the said Garrison, till they are able to march, and then to have a <hi>Pass</hi> to go to the next <hi>Irish</hi> Garrison.</p>
            <p>That none of the Army under his Grace the Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s Command, shall enter the said Fort, except such as are appointed by him to take possession, till the Garrison be marched clear out of the Gates.</p>
            <p>That there shall be a sufficient Convoy appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the said Garrison to conduct it to the place before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:47135:36"/>That they shall deliver fully and wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Embezelment or Diminution, all the Stores belonging to the said Fort; and that an Officer shall be immediately admitted to take an Account of them.</p>
            <p>That the Fort shall be put into the possession of such Forces as his Grace shall think fit at Eight of the Clock on <hi>Wednesday</hi> the Fourteenth of <hi>May, 1690.</hi> and the Garrison shall march out an hour before the outward Gate shall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to such Forces as the General shall appoint in case a supply of one Months Provision for 800 men be not brought into the Garrison for Relief between the signing of these Articles, and the time the place is articled to be delivered up.</p>
            <p>That the above-mentioned Articles shall be inviolably performed on both sides, without any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation, Mental Reservation, or Fraud what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, according to the true Intent and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</p>
            <p>Lastly, That all Acts of Hostility shall cease between the said Garrison and Army, so soon as Notice can be given on both sides.</p>
            <p>Thus after a long holding out, this strong Place was forced into a compliance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Enemy had put such confidence in it, that many of those abroad proposed it as a last Refuge, if things came to a greater Extremity, its Scituation and Strength giving them Incouragement to hope it was Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; and indeed, it had baffled our Men in some Attempts they made on it and held out so long, contrary to expectation; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47135:37"/>
at last; we find that was agreed to be Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred, and accordingly it was Surrendred, and the Governour <hi>Teague O Regan,</hi> and the Garrison, who had near consumed all their Provision, marched out in number 800; they left 17 Pieces of brass Cannon, 2 Mortars, and a considerable quantity of Ammunition. And this Place by Nature and Art being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding strong, greatly availed to the keeping all that part of the Country in awe. And what more exceedingly heartned the Soldiers, was the News that the King of <hi>England</hi> had left <hi>Whitehall</hi> on the fourth of <hi>Iune,</hi> and was coming for <hi>Ireland</hi> with a considerable Army, great Sums of Money, Stores of Ammunition, and all things necessary for the vigorous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on and expediting the War. Nor were they deceived in the Report; for on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Iune</hi> he landed at Carickfergus, and went from thence to <hi>Belfast,</hi> where he was waited on by Duke <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and many of the great Officers, and with him came not only some of the <hi>Irish</hi> Nobility, but a great many of that Country, who had fled for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to avoid the Danger that threatned from the Papists; and great was the Joy of the Protestants for his Arrival, and as much on the other hand the Terrour and Consternation of the Papists.</p>
            <p>His Majesty, soon after his Landing, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 200000 1. to be brought on shoar, and fifteen Tun of Half-pence and Farthings of the new Tin coin, and gave notice to all the Agents of Regiments to bring in their Accompts within
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47135:37"/>
three days, that they might receive the Moneys due to the Soldiers; and care thereupon was taken to clear their Quarters, and discharge the Country.</p>
            <p>The King thus landed, to the great Joy of all the Protestants, every one laboured who should be formost in shewing their humble Gratitude for his Exposing his Royal Person to so many Dangers for their Safety, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Gentlemen of the County of <hi>Down,</hi> &amp;c. presented this Address.</p>

               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:47135:38"/>On this Occasion likewise the Clergy of the Churches in the Province of <hi>Ulster</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Address, as did the Presbyterians, and those of their Perswasion in the North of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The like from the Mayor, Aldermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>London-Derry</hi>; and another from the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Burgesses and Inhabitants of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,</hi> which created a high Satisfaction and more general Rejoycing. And here it was that Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> that so bravely defended <hi>London-Derry</hi> accompanied with divers of the Clergy, waited upon his Majesty, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated his happy Arrival in the Kingdom. And Parties were sent out to observe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>The King, intent upon the great Affair he came about, stayed not for many Ceremonies and Complements; but being well refreshed, went to <hi>Hilsbourgh,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Newry,</hi> where a great part of the Army that had been under the General lay, of which he took a view, and ordered all things to the best Advantage for carrying on the War, nor was the Measures taken slow in Executing. And now whilst this is doing, let us turn a little towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> and see how Affairs stand in the Metropolis of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It was not to be doubted, but upon the King's landing with an Additional Army, the Papists would have been more concerned than they were, but I know not upon what false Topick they grounded their Hopes, their Concern was not so great, as might have been
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47135:38"/>
expected from so eminent a Danger; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was to abate the Courage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, and startle them into a Mistake of some private Design they had against the King; or that they had some old Prophesies, which they too much relied upon for their Success; or that they trusted to the number of their Army, remains doubtful; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they kept up their Courage beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. The Protestants in <hi>Dublin</hi> guessed it proceeded from the false News that 100000 men were ready to rise in <hi>England,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call King <hi>Iames,</hi> or declare for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet being very powerful at Sea, would not fail to intercept the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Return, and so they fancied they had him as it were in a Trap. And indeed in this immergency, the Affronts the Protestants every where received, without any hope of Redress, made them not know what to think of their Condition; nor was it long e're the Chief of them were imprisoned; and the rest were told, <hi>They would be glad e're long to go to Mass in a short time.</hi> And they were put into frequent frights of having their Houses fired about their Ears, or at the least to be plundered of all they had. And it seems it was debated, <hi>That if it came to a Battel, and the</hi> Irish <hi>were worsted, the City should be set on fire, if not the Protestants massacred.</hi> But it is said King <hi>Iames</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it; and on the 16th of <hi>Iuly</hi> marched out of <hi>Dublin,</hi> to joyn with about 5000 Foot sent from <hi>France,</hi> and one Regiment of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47135:39"/>
               <hi>Dutch,</hi> and mostly Protestants, great care was taken to keep them from startling, and the whole <hi>Irish</hi> Army was composed of about 40000 men, besides 15000 that remained in Garrisons, and 6000 of the Militia, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Luttrel</hi> and <hi>Mac Gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuddy,</hi> who was ordered as his Assistant in the Government of the City. And hereupon a hasty Order came out, that all who walked the Streets without Bayonets or Swords, should be seized. And thereupon a great many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, who could not get such Weapons, were taken up, and many of them Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And another Order, That upon pain of Death, not above five Protestants, besides the Family, should meet together: So that the Churches, which had till this time been kept open, were shut up, and Dr. <hi>King</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s imprisoned: Yet such was the Zeal of the Protestants in these dangerous times, that they gathered considerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions for the Maintenance of the dispos sest Clergy, and for such as were Prisoners, till they were forced to desist; all the Goals and many of the Churches, being crowded with Prisoners, not only Citizens, but such as had been brought from <hi>Galloway, Kilmainham,</hi> and other places; many of them were stifled by crowding and wanting of Air, and others almost famished for want of Sustenance. It would be too tedious to enumerate all the particular Sufferings of the Protestants, their frequent Allarms, Fears and many other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances. Therefore let it suffice, that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47135:39"/>
though sorrow lasted for a night, Joy came in the morning, as by the Sequel will be Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>The two Armies being now in the Field, the <hi>Irish</hi> however declined fighting all they could; and it was given out, That King <hi>Iames</hi> designed to lead them about the Banks of the River <hi>Boyne</hi> to weary out the <hi>English,</hi> as thinking they could not pass that Stream, if defended on the other side; and after he had so done, to cross the Country and go for <hi>Limerick.</hi> However, least the <hi>English</hi> should push on, and give him Battel, he resolved to provide for the worst, and therefore ordered Sir <hi>Patrick Trant,</hi> the first Commissioner of his Revenue, to have shipping ready at <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> to carry him off, if things came to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; for at last he found, unless he aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned <hi>Dublin,</hi> which was proposed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, he could not avoid fighting above ten days; for the King of <hi>England,</hi> impatient of delay, possessed himself of almost all the Passes and Posts that were advantageous to bring the Enemy to a Battel; and many Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes happened between Parties abroad, wherein our men gained the advantage.</p>
            <p>The Enemy by this time being Encamped near <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and strongly guarding a Pass, call'd <hi>Four-mile-Bridge,</hi> which was very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to force, it was resolved that our Army should march to <hi>Market-hill,</hi> and therefore to fall into the great Road that leads from <hi>Armagh</hi> to <hi>Dundalk</hi>; whereupon Major <hi>Scravenmore</hi> was sent out with a Detachment of 300 Horse
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47135:40"/>
and 20 Dragoons, to view the Road and Passes, and find a convenient place to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>mp in, and discover, if possible, the posture of the Enemy; which was so well performed, that a small Party of theirs, seeing this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment betimes in the Morning marching towards <hi>Market-hill,</hi> supposed it to be the Vauntguard of the whole Army, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave the Alarm to their Camp that our Army was almost upon them, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sending to know the certainty, put them into such a fear, that they fired their Camp, and marched away; which being certified to the King, it appeared so strange, that it could not presently gain credit: But being in a short time confirmed from all hands, the order of the March was changed, and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch sent to the Forces at <hi>Armagh</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nargee,</hi> that they should immediately march by the great Road towards <hi>Dundalk.</hi> But a Detachment of 200 Foot and 50 Dragoons going from the <hi>Newry</hi> towards <hi>Dundalk,</hi> were incompassed by an Ambush of 500 of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Horse; and though our Men fought desperately, yet above 20 of them were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and wounded, and the Enemy lost as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, with the Officer that commanded them, whose Horses our Men in their Retreat brought away with them.</p>
            <p>On the 31th of <hi>Iune</hi> the King marched ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Morning from his Camp at <hi>Ardee</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Drogheda,</hi> and found the <hi>Irish</hi> Army Encamped along the <hi>Boyne</hi> above the Town; but the Foot not coming up before it was late,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47135:40"/>
and with them the Artillery; nothing could be done that Night, but visiting the Posture of the Enemy, and the Fords of the River; which appeared very difficult to pass. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the King Encamped within shot of the Enemies Cannon, which had like to have proved very fatal to these Kingdoms, by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death so near a precious Life that is so dear to them; for as his Majesty was taking a view of their Posture, a six pound shot brushed his shoulder, and razed the skin, making a large though not a deep Wound; yet he nothing daunted thereat, only caused it to be dressed, and mounting again, kept on Horseback for several hours after; and toward the dusk of the Evening, he commanded Count <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> with the right Wing of the Horse, two Regiments of Dragoons, and <hi>Trelawney</hi>'s Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, to take five Field-Pieces, and go early in the Morning to try the Fords some Miles above the Enemies Camp, and if he found an Opportunity to pass over and Attack them in the Flank, or oblige them to Decamp. And almost beyond expectation, he passed with good Success, beating off 8 Squadrons that stood ready to oppose him; and having gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firm ground on the other side the River, drew up his Men in Battalia, sending to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the King what he had done, and to receive his further Orders: But the King no sooner received the News, and perceived the Enemy were drawing up to Charge the right Wing, but he caused an Attack to be made in three places; the first before a small Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47135:41"/>
at a very good Ford; at the Second the Foot waded the middle; and at the Third the Horse were forced to swim. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot-Guards that first passed over, sustained the shock of the Enemies shot, whilst they were in the Water, not firing till they came up close, and then pouring in their Bullets. Those that were in the Village, and behind the Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es gave way; but five of the Enemies Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions came up to charge them, before the Third Battalion of that Regiment had passed the River, yet ours maintained their ground, and made them retreat in disorder, leaving one of their Colours, and many dead men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place; but our men pressing eagerly on, and advancing beyond the Village, were twice vigorously attacked by the Enemies Horse, but received no great Damage; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Danish</hi> Forces advanced to the left and the Brigadiers <hi>Melionere</hi> and <hi>Hanmore</hi> came on the Right, one being attacked by the Dragoons, and the other by the Horse, but neither did any great matter, by reason they had no Pikes. And now the thundering of the Guns, clashing of Swords, and the Cries and Shouts made a confused noise; so that the <hi>Irish</hi> trembled at the Din of War.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi> having passed the River with a few Forces, at what time about thirty Officers, and others of the Enemies Life-Guard, had desperately charged the King's Battalion, and were all killed except Five, and those attempting to escape through the Village, unhappily met with the Duke, who
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47135:41"/>
in the Firings that were made, received a shot in the Neck, doubtful whether from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or accidentally from his own men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he fell from his Horse, and died without speaking in Arms of a <hi>French</hi> Captain, who alighted to relieve him, and as he had been trained up in War almost from his Youth, so now he ended his days in the Bed of Honour. He received in this Action likewise two Cuts over the Forehead, but not ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The King all this while discharging the part of a great General and a valiant Soldier, was every where at hand to give Orders, and succour those that stood in need, marching with Seventeen Battalions of Foot, and the Horse he had about him, to inforce those Troops that had engaged the Enemy, though they had not much advanced towards the Right Wing; which he did with Nine Squadrons of Horse, and Twelve Battalions of Foot, and so marched them against the Enemy; who upon their approach fled, without staying to be charged, retiring in much disorder; but our Horse pressed on to overtake them in such haste, that the Foot could not keep pace with them; they took with them likewise five small Field-pieces; and our Dragoons supported by the Horse, charged the Rear of the flying E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and killed a great many of them; so

that for the more speed they threw away their Arms, and what else was cumbersome; yet finding themselves hard pressed by so small a part of our Army, some of the <hi>French</hi> faced about, and made as if they would stand the Charge; but the King appearing on the Hills with his Troops, they fled faster than before, many of them scattering and making their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scapes through the Bogs and narrow Passes, our Foot pursued them but to <hi>Duleek,</hi> yet our Horse had the chase of them four Miles further, till Night came on, and then the King sent them Orders to return to the Foot, and sent for Tents and Baggage from his Camp at <hi>Drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heda,</hi> that the weary Soldiers might repose themselves that Night.</p>
            <p>The greatest part of the Enemies Baggage fell into the hands of our Army, as their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, Tents, Arms, Cannon, Ammunition, Provision, and some Money; and what was more remarkable, a great many Arms were found laid down in Rank and File, those that owned them being run away, without so much as staying to Recover them. About Three thousand were slain, and divers Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Note taken, amongst whom was Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who deserted the King, the Trust he reposed in him; yet he was used very kindly, notwithstanding his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ingratitude: And upon this Defeat the strong Town of <hi>Drogheda</hi> surrendred, as did many other Places thereabout.</p>
            <p>The late King <hi>Iames,</hi> who had stood at a distance to view the Fight, as soon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47135:42"/>
his Army in Rout, fled with all speed towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> with a very few Attendants, where he immediately called a Council, and acquainted the Magistrates of the City with the misfortune that had befallen him, declaring never to trust himself more at the Head of an <hi>Irish</hi> Army, who would not stand a single Charge, and then told those about him, they must shift for themselves as he intended to do; but strictly commanded the Papists not to fire the City, saying, <hi>Though he left it, he did not quit his Claim to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Horse under Monsieur <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zun,</hi> having stood the hottest of the Fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst ours, were extreamly broken and shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; of between Five and Six thousand, there not remaining above Three thousand five hundred. King <hi>Iames</hi> having slept very ill upon his Loss, was the next Morning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed with the News that King <hi>William</hi> was on his way to <hi>Dublin</hi>; which put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a fear, that accompanied with the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King upon this Notice immediately sent thither a Troop of Dragoons, and the next day the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Overkirk</hi> were sent with Nine Troops of Horse, and joyfully received. Whereupon the Papists, especially such as had been over-active in oppressing the Protestants, got away with such things as they could carry either by Land or Water, as fearing to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to account for their Misdoings: so that they who had a little before tyrannized over the Protestants, found the Scene changed, and the Stream turned against them; some indeed the Rabble had seized, and prevented from Flight; but such was the Clemency of the King upon his coming to that City, most of them were not only set at liberty, but that the Kingdom might be quieted, he published his Declaration in these words:</p>

And soon after his Majesty came to that City, and heard a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Church, preached by Dr. <hi>King,</hi> suffering only his Guards, and some of his great Officers, to enter the City with him, and went that day back to his Camp to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when he had given the Magistrates such necessary Orders as he thought conducing to the happiness of the place, and was Addressed by them, and by the Bishops and Clergy, wherein they expressed their abundant Joy and Gratitude for his Majesty's having been the Instrument, in the Hand of Heaven, for their great Deliverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Town and Castle of <hi>Wexford</hi> being deserted by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who fled amongst others to <hi>France,</hi> it declared for the King, and a Garrison was put into it.</p>

People, who plundered and made great Spoil, especially in the Countries where the King's Forces were not at hand to quell them; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Militia frequently met with them, and many of their Ring-leaders being taken, were hanged up as Thieves and Robbers. And that the Counties might be the better settled and guarded, his Majesty made his Progress into divers of them, and appointed Sheriffs and other Officers, as he passed, conferring upon Count <hi>Menard,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Schemberg</hi>'s Son, in respect of the great Affection he bore his Father, the place of great Master of the Artillery, and soon reduced <hi>Wexford</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places.

            <p>The King having pretty well settled the Affairs of those Counties where his Army had passed, and those that put themselves under his Protection, took it into his Princely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, That his Subjects had, during this War, been very much imposed upon, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused by Moneys coined in the Enemies Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by the Order of the late King, of no value, in competition of its Premium di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Exhibitors, for the Relief of such Abuse to the Subject, issued out his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation

            <p>Whilst the Army prepared to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and his Majesty to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at that Siege, had put off his intended passing over from <hi>England,</hi> 50 of our Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons approaching the Town of <hi>Youghall,</hi> the place surrendred: To bring it to which, the Contrivance was in this manner; The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison that marched from <hi>Waterford,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by those Dragoons under the command of Captain <hi>Pownal</hi> to <hi>Youghall,</hi> who telling the Governour of the Place, who was the same
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47135:48"/>
that Surrendered up <hi>Carickfergus</hi> the precedent Year, the certain Ruin he would bring upon himself, if he thought of holding out; and thereupon advising him to a Surrender: he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some further Debate, only desired him to expect his Answer till Ten at night, at which time he privately marched out with Three Companies of Foot, giving the Captain an unexpected possession of the Town, where he found 14 Guns mounted, and 2 without Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, 350 Barrels of Oats, 215 stone of Wooll, and several other sorts of Provisions, but neither Powder nor Ball.</p>
            <p>The King being thus far on his March, a Deserter came out of <hi>Lymerick</hi> to our Camp, and gave Information, <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>had marched out of the Town with eight Field-pieces, and took their way towards</hi> Galloway, <hi>there, if urgency required it, to be ready for Imbarcation to</hi> France; <hi>and not only those in the Town were unsettled and discontented, and that others, displeased at</hi> Tyrconnel<hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, were retired to the Mountains of</hi> Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; <hi>and such Fear the Approach of our Army brought upon the Enemy, made them break down the Bridges to retard their March.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that hindered but little, for where they found them in that Condition, they forded the Rivers; and that the People might be still assured of his Majesty's Clemency towards them, another Declaration was published; and also that a Blessing might attend his Arms, a Fast was proclaimed to be observed through all the Provinces of the Kingdom under their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47135:49"/>
Majesty's Obedience on the 15th of <hi>August,</hi> and to be observed constantly, during the War, on <hi>Friday</hi> in every Week; which was Religiously kept, as well out of a due sense of God's Mercies and Favours already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended towards the late languishing Kingdom, in a wonderful Deliverance, as what they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expected.</p>
            <p>The Approach of our Forces was no sooner known to <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and <hi>Lauzun,</hi> but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired further into the Country, leaving Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Boisteau</hi> Governour in the Town, with a very good Garrison, and store of Provision, the <hi>French</hi> retiring under the Walls of <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>; but the Inhabitants not liking such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly Guest, who sought their Master's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest more than the welfare of <hi>Ireland,</hi> shut their Gates, and denied them Entrance. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at last being received into the Town at the Instance of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and others, they shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Resentments by dealing very severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Inhabitants; and we had an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that they hanged up two of those that were most active in opposing their Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>The Army approaching <hi>Lymerick,</hi> found the Enemy strongly posted about a Mile from the Town, and that they had lined the Hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, from whence they fired upon our Men, but were soon dislodged, and obliged to fly to their Main-guard; and the <hi>English</hi> passed the River <hi>Shannon</hi> without any considerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, the Enemy that guarded the further shoar flying at their approach, and for haste
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47135:49"/>
left behind them several Tents and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and encamping within the reach of their great Guns, they raised Works to secure them from the shot, though some were killed by random Bullets. The Army was no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Encamped, and Entrenchers made some Advance, but the King sent to Summon the Governour to Surrender, withal, offering him very good Conditions, but he utterly refused it; returning answer, <hi>That he was resolved to defend the place to the last Extremity.</hi> Upon which the Trenches were opened, and the great Guns being on their way to the Camp, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> with a strong Party, taking a great Compass, set upon those that had them in Charge, and over-powering the Convoy, killed divers of the Waggoners, not sparing their Wives, with their Children in their Arms, burning some of the Waggons and Carriages of the Cannon, Nailing up part of the great Guns, and breaking others. But upon the approach of Captain <hi>Coningham</hi> with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Inniskilling</hi>-men, they made a hasty Retreat; yet the Captain fell in with their Rear, killed some, took other Prisoners, and recovered a considerable Booty. So that these, and other great Guns, being brought to the Camp, <hi>Clonmel,</hi> a small Fort near <hi>Lymerick</hi> Surrendred upon Discretion, and the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son made Prisoners of War. And now the Batteries being raised, the Cannons spoke <hi>English</hi> Language in Thunder against the Town, and the Trenches were Advanced within 300 Paces of the Wall, and two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47135:50"/>
taken, the which, and other Successes of the like nature, made them Advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another Redoubt. Whenas Colonel <hi>Douglas</hi> mounting the Guard, and the sign appointed given by firing 8 Guns for Attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, those that were Detached for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice being 150, besides Officers, fell on with extraordinary Bravery, and Entering the Fort, drove out the Enemy, killing about 40, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed themselves of it, though the Enemy from the Town made a vigorous Sally with Horse and Foot; and the new Batteries being level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against the high Towers, soon laid them in Rubbish; also the Bombs and Carkasses thrown in set a great many Houses on fire: So that under the favour of these Consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Enemy were put unto, our Men made their Advances within Thirty Paces of the Ditch, and the Cannon still playing, not only widened the Breach, but beat down part of the Counterscarp and Palisado's; so that an Attack was made on the Counterscarp, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by a detached Party of Granadiers, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by other Detachments, who soon gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; as also a Fort the Enemy had under the Wall; but instead of lodging themselves as they were commanded, thinking Fortune was altogether now on their side, they pushed on to enter the Breach in pursuit of the <hi>Irish</hi> that ran thither, but the Cannon being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, charged with Cartridge-shot, the greater part of those that were Advanced were cut off, and some blown up by the springing of a Mine in the Ditch; so that by
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47135:50"/>
computation 100 Men were killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet they came not off without leaving the Marks of their Valour upon the Enemy. But by this time, the Army having the Elements to contend with, as well as the Enemy, by reason of the stormy Winds and incessant Rains, which not only made the River over-flow, but filled the Trenches knee-deep with Water, and would in a short time, in all probability, have cut off the Communication, and hindered the Forrage from coming in, his Majesty, upon mature deliberation, thought fit to raise the Siege, and refer it to a more seasonable opportunity. So that on the 30th of <hi>August</hi> the heavy Cannon and Baggage were sent away, and the next day the Army decamped and marched off in good Order, strong Detachments being sent towards <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Kingsale</hi>: And the King having appointed the Lord Viscount <hi>Sidney</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningsby</hi> Governour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon the King's departure, the <hi>Irish</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons thought themselves safe for the Winter at least, but found in a short time they were deceived, for other measures were taken. The <hi>English</hi> Fleet had orders to stand away to the Coast of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and soon arrived in <hi>Cork</hi> Harbour; and upon notice of their Arrival, the Land Forces drew down to joyn them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Landing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:47135:51"/>Upon which the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> who stiled himself Lord General of <hi>Ireland,</hi> drew off, <hi>Lauzun</hi> and <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gone to <hi>France.</hi> Lieutenant-General <hi>Douglas</hi> followed after the Duke with a strong Party, to fall upon his Rear, but he Encamped so advantagiously behind the Bogs, that it was not thought feasible to attempt the forcing his Camp.</p>
            <p>A Battery of 8 Guns was raised to hinder the Landing of our Men, but two or three armed Boats forcing ashoar those that were to manage and guard the Guns fled, and our men dismounted them, throwing the Carriages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea; so that on the 24th of <hi>September,</hi> 5 or 6000 Seamen, Gunners, and Carpenters were detached to be employed in raising the Batteries and mounting the Cannon against the Town of <hi>Cork</hi> and divers Boats of arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap> Men were sent to assist the taking it by water; so that upon the approach of the Army, the Enemy set fire to the Suburbs, and the Earl of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> who commanded the King's Forces in chief, having taken a view of its Scituation, and finding the Enemy had quitted a Post called <hi>Cats-Fort,</hi> sent a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to take possession of it, and then advanced his Camp within Musquet shot of the South-side of the Town, which occasioned the Enemy to set fire to the Suburbs, for fear our Soldiers should lodge themselves in it; yet our Men advanced to the Ruins, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Old Fort from two Batteries they had raised, and the next day made a Breach
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47135:51"/>
in the Wall so wide, that the Besieged fearing our Men would Enter by Storm, and dreading the consequences of Delay, they beat a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and sent out an Officer to Capitulate, and Hostages were Exchanged; but the besieged standing high upon Terms, four Regiments under the Command of Brigadier <hi>Churchil,</hi> were ordered to get into the Island near the Wall, where the Breach was made, which they performed by fording it to the middle, the Granadiers, commanded by the Lord <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> leading the Van, being exposed to all the Fire of the Enemy: Amongst those that attempted this were a great many noble Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers, as the Duke of <hi>Grafton,</hi> the Lord <hi>O Brian,</hi> Colonel <hi>Granvil,</hi> Captain <hi>Leighton,</hi> Captain <hi>Cornwal,</hi> Captain <hi>Nevel,</hi> Captain <hi>Fairborn,</hi> and others; but it proved fatal to the Duke, for by a shot he received, he soon after died, and his Body being carried for <hi>England,</hi> was there honourably interred.</p>
            <p>The Besieged finding that our Men would not enter, as not being above 20 Paces from the Breach, beat another Parley, but could have no other Conditions than to be Prisoners of War; to which, with some difficulty, they agreed, and the Capitulation was signed which in the Articles was to this purpose, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That upon the Garrisons being received as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners of War, no prejudice should be done to the Officers, Soldiers, or Inhabitants, but that the General should make it his Endeavour to obtain
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47135:52"/>
his Majesty's Mercy and Favour towards them.</p>
            <p>That the Old Fort should be delivered up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an hour, and the two Gates the like, by 8 in the Morning the next day.</p>
            <p>That all the Arms of the Garrison and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants should be put into secure places, and the Protestant Prisoners immediately released.</p>
            <p>That a due Account should be given of the Magazines as well of Provision as Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And the same Night 200 Men took posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Old Fort, and the next Morning of the Town; the Garrison, between 4 and 5000 being made Prisoners of War; and of note amongst them were the Earls of <hi>Clancar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Tyrone,</hi> Colonel <hi>Macgillicot</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and divers others.</p>
            <p>This place thus taken and put into trusty hands, the Army immediately marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Kingsale,</hi> and took their Posts about the New Fort, whilst Major General <hi>Teteau</hi> was Commanded with 800 Men to make an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon the Old Fort; whereupon passing the River in Boats, he on the 3d of <hi>October,</hi> gave an Assault, and Entered it by Storm, making at the same time, to divert the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, a false Attaque; and our Men at one and the same time giving the Bastions, some Barrels of Powder took fire, and destroyed about 50 of the Enemy, and in the heat of Fury many were killed. Those that Escaped, some fled unto the Old Castle in the midst of the Fort, and some endeavouring the New Fort, by the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47135:52"/>
help of a Boat, the Tide being against them, they were mostly killed by the shot of our Men, from the shoar, the Governour and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Officers were killed in defending the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, and found dead in the places where they fell, and the Soldiers got considerable Plunder.</p>
            <p>The Old Fort thus Entirely won, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sent a Summons to the New Fort to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand its immediate Surrender; but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour sent back word, <hi>That it would be time enough to talk of that a Month after.</hi> But the General, not to be dallied, caused the heavy Cannon to be mounted, and two Attacks were ordered to be made by the <hi>English</hi> on the right, and the <hi>Danes</hi> on the left; and the more to amuse the Enemy, a false Attack was made, and on the 15th of <hi>October</hi> the Cannon played all the Morning, and the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries were preparing to lay over the Ditch, when about One of the Clock the Enemy beat a Parly, proposing that Hostages might be Exchanged in order to a Treaty; which done, Articles were agreed on, and signed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Midnight; and pursuant thereto the middle Bastion was to be delivered up the next Morning, and about 1200 men, of which the Garrison consisted, were to march out the day after. And the principal of the Prisoners taken here, and at <hi>Cork</hi> were ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for <hi>England</hi>; but some of them met with a sad Disaster on the Coast; for being put on Board the <hi>Breda,</hi> by what means is uncertain, her Powder taking fire, she blew up, and most
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47135:53"/>
of those who were on Board were desteoyed; the rest of the Fleet returned in Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Irish</hi> that yet kept the Field, were not above 10000, yet they promised themselves great Recruits against the Spring.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Protestants concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved great Joy at this Success, and in a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acknowledgment to his Majesty, who had been so signally instrumental in the Hand of Heaven for their Deliverance, his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day being the Fourth of <hi>November,</hi> Old stile, was observed in the reduced Places in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner, but especially at <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the Militia, consisting of 2500 Foot, and two Troops of Horse, and as many of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons were drawn out, and gave several Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; and in the Evening there was very fine Fireworks before the Lords Justices House on <hi>Colledge-Green,</hi> and by their Order Claret was distributed to the People, who drank their Majesty's Healths with all the Expressions of Duty and Loyalty; and most of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Gentry in and about the City, were invited by the Lords Justices to a splendid Entertainment and Banquet, the Day conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with ringing of Bells, and the Night with Bonefires and Illuminations, as also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Publick Demonstrations of Joy and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
            <p>The Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> being the Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary of the Popish Powder-Plot, the Lords Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices attended by the Nobility, Judges, and other Persons of Quality in the Town, with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47135:53"/>
the King and Herauld at Arms and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of Honour carried before them, went to St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Church, and after their Return the Lords Justices gave the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try another splendid Entertainment, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Titles being at the second Course pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in <hi>Latin, French,</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> by the King at Arms, the great Guns in the Castle continually thundring the general Joy in their roaring Language. And that the Common People might not be wanting in sharing of their Bounty, a whole Ox, and an Hogshead of strong Bear was dealt out amongst them, and at Night the general Joy was concluded with Bonefires, and other Demonstrations of Publick Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Soldiers being now mostly in their Winter-Quarters, that they might have good usage, and the Inhabitants of those Towns where they were quartered at the same time receive no damage, the Lords Justices thought it neccessary to give their Orders concerning those Matters, and accordingly issued out their Proclamation for regulating the Quarters of the Army, and ascertaining the Rates to be allowed for the Soldiers Diet, the Prizes of Provisions, and the manner how the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants that trusted them should be paid for what they delivered out to them.</p>
            <p>The Rapparies having already been fairly warned to desist from their Ravages, and Burnings in the Countries under Obedience; they notwithstanding enterprizing the like, Captain <hi>Archer</hi> upon Notice that a Party of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47135:54"/>
them were abroad, marched against them with about Twenty of the Militia; but upon his approach finding them much stronger than he had been informed, after a hot dispute he found himself obliged to retire with the loss of four of his Men; however, not giving it over, he immediately raised more of the Militia, and the next Morning by break of day fell upon them a second time with better success for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put them to rout, he killed about Twelve of them, and took Twenty Prisoners, enriching his Men with such Booty as those People had scraped together, in those Countries where they had been for a considerable time doing much mischief.</p>
            <p>And now the Lords Justices and Councel having reason to suspect that several dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Persons coming to the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> as Spies from the Enemies Quarters, and upon other wicked Designs, were sheltered in that City by Papists, Natives, who kept Taverns, and other Publick Houses, and there frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly met to continue as much as in them lay, the Subversion of Their Majesties Government, and the Ruin of their good Subjects of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> thought fit to put out their Proclamation, to prohibit and forbid all Papists, Natives of the Kingdom, to sell any Wine, Beer, Ale, or other Liquors by Retail, after the 25th of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1690. upon pain of being proceeded against as Retailers of Wine and other Liquors without License.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:47135:54"/>By this time one <hi>Mac Finnan</hi> having got together about Four hundred Men, being a mixture of the <hi>Irish</hi> Army and Rapporees, marched towards <hi>Castle-town,</hi> to surprize thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Dragoons, commanded by a Lieutenant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached thither from their Quarters at <hi>Iniskeen,</hi> and although they had all the advantage they could wish, yet the Lieutenant and his Men behaved themselves so bravely, that they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Ten of their Enemies, but having spent their Ammunition, and five of their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being killed, they found themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to Surrender, and had Quarter given them, yet the Lieutenant, his Serjeant, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Men were put to the Sword in cold blood: however the Alarm reaching <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skeen,</hi> Major <hi>Culleford,</hi> who commanded there, Advanced with another detached Party, and falling upon them in the height of their Success, put them to the rout killing about 12 on the place, took 5 Prisoners, without the loss of a Man on our side.</p>
            <p>Nor were the Commanders his Majesty had intrusted less watchful on all parts; for Major-General <hi>Tettau</hi> marching from <hi>Cork</hi> to <hi>Killcreagh,</hi> and on his way being joyned by others, so that he made up a Body of 2200 Men, he entred the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> where the Enemies Troops retired before him, and coming into a Fortification at <hi>Scrovolard,</hi> he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked it, and in two hours took it with little difficulty; when advancing along the edge of the Mountains, and sustaining the Rapparees fire, without receiving any considerable da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47135:55"/>
they discovered towards <hi>Brewster</hi> field, some of the Enemies Scouts, whereupon 70 of our Dragoons and Horse having the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, came up with a Party of 160 of the Enemies Horse, who not enduring the Fire of our Men, upon the first Charge retreated, and falling by degrees into confusion, at last came to plain running, though there were several <hi>Irish</hi> Nobility, and some considerable Officers amongst them; yet such as our Men had not yet attacked, put, by this time, the Country round about in a flame, and our Forces not being far from <hi>Killarny,</hi> hasted thither with all the speed they could to save that place; and notwithstanding the Enemy upon their approach left it, yet about twenty Cabbins were burnt by two Troopers that stayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind for that purpose, who as a Reward of their Undertaking, were killed by our Men, and <hi>Brewster</hi>'s Forge saved, and put divers of the Enemies Parties, then abroad, to the rout, clearing the Country in a manner on that side whilst the <hi>Irish</hi> only bore up the little Courage they had left, relying much upon the further Aid they expected from <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>However, though the Season was far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, our Men gave it not over as yet, but for the better securing Winter-Quarters, and preventing the Country from Plunder, they took in several Castles, as the Castles of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of our Army went into Winter-Quarters, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving some flying Parties abroad to keep under the Rapparees, who thought it now their time to rob and steal; and indeed they not only burnt the Lord <hi>Orrery</hi>'s House at <hi>Charleville,</hi> but committed many other Outrages, though divers of them came short home; for this kind of Black Guard not being looked upon to be Soldiers, plundering sometimes as well the Papists as the Protestants, were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut off in their Attempts; and now when Force began to fail, the Enemy had recourse to Stratagems; but in this they failed, by a timely discovery, by Letters that were dropt by some Persons as they were flying to the Woods or Mountains; one of them written by one Mr. <hi>Hogen,</hi> who had been a Colonel in the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, acquainting him, <hi>That the Protestants were secure and supine in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and that her Friends had lately done seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral strange Feats in the places that were under the</hi> English <hi>Obedience, and especially in the County of</hi> Wicklow, <hi>and that the</hi> French <hi>in the Kingdom were very industrious to take all advantages; that</hi> Tyrconnel <hi>would soon return with Forces from</hi> France; <hi>that the Soldiers, in</hi> Dublin <hi>were poor and miserable, and would do any thing for Bread; so that if</hi> Sarsfield <hi>had a mind to come over the</hi> Shannon <hi>with his Forces, not only the Army, but the Militia would be drawn out of the City, and then every Papist fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his own House or Lodging, whilst the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation lasted, they might destroy the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants and secure the City, and that which had

            <p>This, and the diligent search made after sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Persons, startled the Caballars and Conspirators in such a manner, that they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dispersed or concealed themselves. So the pernicious Design of laying the Metropolis of <hi>Ireland</hi> in Ashes, and mixing those Ashes with the Blood of its Inhabitants, was frustrated. And indeed this appeared not to be grounded upon light Suspition, but upon substantial Reason; for the Enemies Troops abroad were about that time moving nearer towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> then any other Occasion but such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence

               </gap>ring these Transactions, those Troops we had abroad were not idle, but often marching many Miles into the Enemies Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not only beat them from their Posts, and killed a great many of them; but gave the Villages opportunity to rest in quiet under their Majesties Protection, and freeing them from those Ravagements wherewith before they were distressed; so that many, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stood out for fear of being plundered or destroyed, came in, and joyfully laid hold of the gracious Pardon offered them; so that the face of things seemed to put on a Calm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Tempest that a little before had in a manner disjointed and put them out of Frame.</p>
            <p>The Enemies Regular Troops missing of the Advantages they expected, now gave way to the Outrages of the Rapperees more than ever, having before a little restrained their Insolencies, that the Advantage of Plunder might accrue to themselves; so that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many barbarous Murthers in Villages and Loan-houses, where their Force prevailed, being mainly incited thereto by the revengeful Priests, who shared with them in their Booty which made our Troops, though the Season was very incommodious for marching, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

of the rains and quagginess of the ground, and incroach upon them, and frequently sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them in their Randezvous, beating them out of their Cabins, and firing them over their Ears.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So that now the face of things began to look pleasant; however, though it was in the dead of Winter, our Troops abroad found some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for one of our advanced Parties, setting upon the Enemy near <hi>Castle-Town,</hi> they killed 22 of them, and took 5 Prisoners, and Colonel <hi>Foulks</hi> gave a considerable Defeat to about 1500 Rapperees and trained Soldiers, killing many of them, and taking some Prisoners near the Bogg of <hi>Allen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst these Successes were carried on with a high hand, Colonel <hi>Brewer</hi> possessed himself of the Forts and Town of <hi>Lansborough,</hi> and defeated about 3000 of the Enemy. Soon after Major-General <hi>Tetteau,</hi> heightned with his frequent Success, and the beating some small Parties of the Enemy, he marched his Forces towards the strong Town of <hi>Ross,</hi> which had in it a Carrison of 600 Men, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Maccarty,</hi> the Lords <hi>Coursey</hi> and <hi>Slane,</hi> and others of Note were also in the place, upon the approach of our Men, but not thinking themselves secure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, they poasted away for <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and thereupon our Approaches being made, 50 <hi>Danes,</hi> and 50 of the Detachment out of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale,</hi> were ordered to storm a Fort cut out of a Rock, which they did with so great a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47135:59"/>
that they froze the Enemies Courage, and soon made themselves Masters of it, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting most they found therein to the Sword, and many of those that endeavoured to swim from thence to another Rock, were killed in the Water; and marching thence to <hi>Tralee,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Sheldon</hi> abondoned it with such speed, that they had no time to set it on fire, and so it fell entire into our hands; and we having a small Fort at <hi>Fermoy-Bridge</hi> in the County of <hi>Cork,</hi> the Enemy advanced with about 2000 Horse and Foot, under the Command of one <hi>Carrol,</hi> who upon his Approach sent to have it Surrendred, Declaring that he knew the strength of the Place, and that it was not tenable. But upon his approach found such a warm Reception, that after divers firings, he being kill'd upon the place, his Men took to their heels, and that they might glory of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they burnt one House in their return.</p>
            <p>Soon after this Defeat, and the routing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Parties of the Rapparees, Colonel <hi>Brewer</hi> and Major <hi>Board</hi> went out with a detached Party of 150 Horse, and about 200 Foot from <hi>Mullengar,</hi> to relieve <hi>Marescourt</hi> and <hi>Mayvore</hi> with Provision; and that done, they took their way towards <hi>Ballymore,</hi> and dislodged the Enemy on those Passes, opening and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Country, and then returned to their Stations, without the loss of any Men; and soon after this Lieutenant <hi>Taylor</hi> defeated 400 of the <hi>Irish</hi> near <hi>Endery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lieutenant-General <hi>Ginkle,</hi> upon notice that a great Body of the <hi>Enemy</hi> was gathering, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47135:60"/>
some of them advancing towards <hi>Athlone,</hi> he and Sir <hi>Iohn Lanier</hi> drew out a Party to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them; who upon their approach, retired in great confusion, but being pursued by our Horse and Foot, they were beat from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments they had made, as their last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge; and the Chace being continued, about 200 of them were killed and wounded, and several taken Prisoners, and our Men got a great Booty of Horses; for the Enemy in their flight, being hard pressed in the Rear, quitted them, and got into the Woods.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Hamilton</hi> being abroad, meeting with a Party of the Enemy as they were Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaging the Country, near a place called <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi> set upon them, and at the first Charge put them into Disorder, and soon after to open flight, killing about 70 of them, and taking some Prisoners with Booty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Captain <hi>Derby</hi> defeated another Party of them at <hi>Birre.</hi> And now the Rapparees being more terrible to the Country People than the Enemies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Forces, a Party was sent out to suppress them; so that being frequently met withal, a great many of them were killed, and some that were taken Prisoners were Executed; and lighting on a Party of about 400 <hi>Irish,</hi> though he had then 100 Foot, and 34 Horse, having lessened his number by Detachments, sent to find out the Rapparees; he however drew up, and Charged them with such Bravery, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Action some more of his Men coming in, he put them utterly to the Rout, killed and took Prisoners most of their Officers, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

a great Booty. And indeed the Winter, not fit for the motion of great Bodies, was spent in the piquering of Parties, and settling the Civil, as well as Military Affairs of the Kingdom, and so continued till his Majesty went to Head the Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Sarsfield</hi> having a great Command among the <hi>Irish,</hi> many of the Enemies chief Officers being gone for <hi>France,</hi> under pretence of bringing fresh Recruits early in the Spring, he drew together part of the shattered Army, and some of the Militia, at <hi>Knockany,</hi> with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to attack some of our Troops that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageously posted; but was so warmly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that he found his Attempts very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous to himself, and thereupon pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most serviceable Men out of the Militia Troops, sent them to joyn the Forces he had ordered to encamp in the Province of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,</hi> and put some of his Troops into Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison and Winter-Quarters.</p>
            <p>Notice being given to Lieutenant <hi>Spencer,</hi> that a hundred Men of the Enemies Troops were advanced within a Mile of <hi>Copperquin</hi> in the County of <hi>Waterford,</hi> with a design to surprize and carry off the Recruit Horses sent from <hi>England,</hi> for Brigadier's Regiment, he immediately marched with a Corner and 12 Troopers, most of his Men being gone a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, and finding the Enemy in some disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Charged them with his small Party, and pressed them so hard, that they retired into a Wood within a Mile of the place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

18 more of his Men coming up, part of them dismounted, entering the Wood, whilst the rest on Horseback secured the Pass, the Dispute lasted without firing on both sides for several hours, in which they killed 40 of the Enemy, and took the Captain that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, with 7 Soldiers Prisoners, also their Arms and Accoutrements, only one of the Lieutenant's Party being killed, and two or three wounded.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant <hi>Purcel</hi> being abroad with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, fell in with the Rapparees, and in several Encounters with them killed about 100, but attempting to burn their Cabbins in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Longford,</hi> was way-laid by Sir <hi>Daniel O Neal</hi>'s Regiment of Dragoons, part on Horse-back, and part on Foot; but 35 of the Royal Regiment of Dragoons, broke their whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy upon a furious Charge, killing 10 of them, and taking 4 Prisoners, with a Lieutenant, and pursued the rest to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> a Garrison they held in those parts, yet in the hasty flight ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them quitted their Horses, and took to the Bogs, where some were lost: These Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses were followed with others no less advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to us, and unfortunate to the Enemy; for Colonel <hi>Lillingstone</hi> being gone from <hi>Ros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creagh,</hi> joyned by another from a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Garrison, marched to <hi>Nonagh,</hi> where he found the Enemy strongly posted; yet charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with great Resolution, he dispossest them of those Posts, and beat them into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, burning the Town where they had laid up great store of Provision, and brought off a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47135:61"/>
Booty of 300 Head of Cattel, with the loss of 2 Soldiers and a Trooper's Horse, the manner of the Attack being thus:</p>
            <p>The Colonel detached 18 Horse, and as many Foot, and having them on Garrans, or <hi>Irish</hi> Horse, made all the haste he could to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Bridge of <hi>Nenagh,</hi> about half a Mile from the Town, whereupon the whole Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son came out to make opposition; but he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Pass till his Foot came up, and then leaving them at the Bridge, he advanced with his Horse towards the Enemy, who made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny firings, but so soon as our Men came near, began to retreat, and by degrees disordering themselves, fell to running, but being hotly pursued, about 20 of them were killed, and a Cornet taken Prisoner; after which he sent a Detachment to secure the Pass on the other side of the Town towards <hi>Lymerick,</hi> whilst the rest of his Men entred with the flying Enemy; however, many of them got into the Castle, but our Men burnt the Town, and got considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Plunder.</p>

Providence been lately discovered near this City, to have been committed by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the place where the said Soldiers were quartered, for which some of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals have received just and deserved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and the Lords Iustices being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied that such Offences cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted within the open and well-planted Counties of this Kingdom, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance and help, or at least the conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the protected Inhabitants; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received full Information that there is a Confederacy among many of the said pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected Irish, to give all Aid and Relief in their power to Their Majesties Enemies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions, and to take all opportunities to destroy the Officers and Soldiers of Their Majesties Army, and other Their good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, their Lordships being resolved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent as much as in them lies such their cruel and malicious Designs, and to punish with all necessary severity those who shall be guilty, or justly suspected of the same, do publish and declare, That if any such Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall hereafter be committed in any place within Their Majesties Quarters, if the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Inhabitants of that Neighbourhood shall not use their utmost endeavour and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to apprehend the Malefactors, and immediately discover all they know of such

            <p>And soon after another Proclamation was published on the occasion of these Murthers, setting forth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THat whereas by Examination of divers persons, it does appear that a Romish Priest, calling himself Father</hi> Christopher Brown, <hi>who has lived many Months in several places within his Majesties Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Power, without being molested on account of his Orders or Religion, has been, if not the first Contriver and principal Director and Counsellor, yet a main Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Encourager of the late barbarous Murthers of Their Majesties Soldiers near this City; and whereas several others have been found to have been guilty of the said Murthers, who are fled from Iustice, their Lordships do promise a Reward of Five

pounds to such persons, not guilty of the same, as shall apprehend and secure the said</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher Brown, <hi>and Ten pounds for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the other persons, and a Pardon to such, though privy to the said Murthers, as shall apprehend any of the said Offenders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This proceeding stopped the Issue of Blood that way, and rendred the Soldiers more secure in their Quarters and other Places where they came, the <hi>Irish</hi> for fear of being taken notice of, giving them every where, in the places sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Their Majesties, better Usage.</p>
            <p>About the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> Lieutenant-General <hi>Ginkle</hi> came from <hi>Kilkenny</hi> to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and many of the General Officers, to consult with the Lords Justices about the Affairs of the Campaign, and concert Matters advantageous to their Majesties Service; and the <hi>Monmouth</hi> Yatch arrived with Money to that purpose, as likewise several Ships with Recruits of Horse and Foot. So that the Train of Artillery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this time drawn out, the Soldiers began to draw from their Winter-Quarters nearer <hi>Dublin,</hi> and Waggons and Carriages were provided on all hands, and Parties were sent out to remove the Enemies Posts, that the Spring being come, the Forage might not be wastfully destroyed.</p>
            <p>Some of Captain <hi>Green</hi>'s Militia Dragoons, marching into the Enemies Quarters, killed divers of the Rapparees, and set fire to the place that harboured them: And Quarter-Master
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47135:64"/>
               <hi>Chalagan</hi> with a Party, beat the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Party abroad, took divers Prisoners, and some of note, with a considerable Booty; and by lying in the Marish Fields, a great many of the Enemies best Horse died, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision grew very scanty, which occasioned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to desert, some going to their Habitations, and others coming over to us, where such as were able were received.</p>
            <p>About the middle of <hi>April,</hi> 1691. one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> of the Enemies Party, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out with about 700 Men of the standing Troops, to attack a strong Stone-house called <hi>Croghan,</hi> near <hi>Philips-Town,</hi> which although it was guarded only by a Corporal and 8 or 9 Soldiers, made a resolute Defence, killing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 12 of the Enemy, and had done them greater damage, had not their Powder failed, at what time they were constrained to Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate, and give up the place. However, we were not long behind-hand with them, for on the Fourth of the next Month a small Party of our Troops was marched by Major <hi>Wood,</hi> from <hi>Mountmelick</hi> to <hi>Castle-Cuff,</hi> with 300 Foot, being Detachments of Colonel <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s and the Lord <hi>George Hamilton</hi>'s Regiments, and 50 Horse of Colonel <hi>Bierly</hi>'s, and dividing his Foot into several Parties, in order to surprize the Rapparees in the Bogs and Woods, and with his Horse kept along the skirts of the Bogs, to hinder their getting off, by which mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s about 70 of them were killed, and a Booty recovered, which he sent away, and a Guard of 30 Men, and in the mean while, with 30 Foot and 34
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47135:64"/>
Horse, beyond the <hi>Toger</hi> of <hi>Mallyhone,</hi> when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Ten in the Morning he discovered two Bodies of Men of the Enemies Army, each a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 400, marching silently between the Woods and the Mountains, but when they found our Men had espied them, they beat up their Drums.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Major drew up his Horse and Foot in a ploughed Field, and bid them Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; so that the Enemies Granadiers, thinking that our Men, discouraged at their number, would have run, came over the Hedge, but finding they stood firm to expect them, they stood, not advancing any further: In the mean while, a Detachment of the Enemy charged those Men on the side of the Wood that were sent away with the Booty; whereupon the Major wheeled off by the Skirts of the Wood, to succour them, who defended themselves by firing very briskly on the Enemy, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Lieutenant <hi>Ellis,</hi> and having got the Horse and Foot over the Bog, 80 more of his Men came to him, and thereupon he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Foot to march in two Divisions on each side the River, he marching between them with the Horse, when being advanced some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what near the Enemy, and thinking the Horse might do most Service, in taking a Compass about, and falling on the Rear, wheeled about with an Intention to Surround them, which they perceiving, and at the same time being pressed very hardly by the Foot, began to make an orderly Retreat; which the Major percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, broke in upon their Flank with the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47135:65"/>
Horse, which put them to rout and disorder, and soon after to open flight, whilst our Horse and Foot pursued them through the Woods, and down to the Bogs killing about 150, and among them Captain <hi>Charles,</hi> and 2 Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, taking Prisoners Major <hi>Iohn Fitz-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,</hi> who commanded them, and 5 Captains, 9 Lieutenants, and 2 Ensigns, belonging to the several Regiments of Colonel <hi>Butler,</hi> Colonel <hi>Robert Grace,</hi> Colonel <hi>Luttrels</hi> Dragoons, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Moor,</hi> and Sir <hi>Maurice Eustace,</hi> and about 150 private Soldiers, among which were 6 Serjeants, 17 Corporals, an Adjutant-Major, a Chyrurgeon, 3 Drums, and about 150 Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets. Which Victory is to be accounted the more brave and great, because the Courage and Resolution of our Men carried it against such odds, we having only a Corporal killed, and Adjutant <hi>Robinson,</hi> with two Foot Soldiers and a Trooper wounded.</p>
            <p>Nor was this all the Success about this time, for 110 Foot, commanded by Captain <hi>Clayton,</hi> being sent for from <hi>Cork</hi> to relieve the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Ballymaggooly</hi>; they were in their march observed by a considerable Body of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horse, but they durst not Attack them; yet those that were relieved, marched out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Twelve in the Evening, commanded by Captain <hi>Thorncroft</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Hays</hi>; and about break of Day they were discovered by about 300 of the Enemies Horse and and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, who it was thought lay in wait for them; as also a considerable number of Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parees: and our Men being all Foot, thought
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47135:65"/>
not the open Fields secure against the Horse, but for their better Defence, drew into an old Pound, having a Wall about it Breast-high; when by this time the Enemies advance Party coming up offered them Quarter; but they answered only by the firing of their Musquets; however, all the Enemies Troops being come up, they made many Attacks upon our Men, to force them from their Strength, yet they sustained their firings with little hurt; but in returning it, killed a great many of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who were commanded by Brigadier <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol</hi> and Sir <hi>Iames Cotton,</hi> which so discouraged them, that after they had offered our Men Quarter upon Surrendring, and it was refused, that they marched off, carrying away the wounded and most noted of those that were killed; yet they left behind 3 Captains and 10 Troopers slain, and Major <hi>Slingsby</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately wounded, which they thought were too near our shot to be carried off; and in all they had between 40 and 50 killed and wounded, and of ours 10 were killed, and 5 wounded, and Major <hi>Slingsby</hi> was carried Prisoner to <hi>Cork.</hi> And much about this time one <hi>Walter Brown,</hi> who had been High Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable of the Barrony of <hi>Delwin,</hi> being taken as a Spy, was Executed, and Captain <hi>Pallasor,</hi> being abroad with a Party of our Men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of about 40 Firelocks of the Army, and 20 of the Militia, was by the subtil Insinuation and Treachery of one <hi>Terence Megral,</hi> drawn into an Ambush of two of the Enemies Regiments of Foot, and some Troops of Horse,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47135:66"/>
which in that Exigency made him betake to the Ruins of an old Castle, where he caused his Men to fortifie and defend themselves, which they did, continually firing upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, till all their Powder was spent, and then prayed for Quarter; and having it grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, they were carried Prisoners to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagh</hi>; yet the Militia and others under the Command of Col. <hi>Piper,</hi> had good success in clearing the Country in dispersing the Rappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rees, and dispossessing the Enemies Regular Troops of such advantageous Posts, from whence they might annoy By-Inroads, the Countries under Their Majesties Obedience, so that they began to shrink together into a narrower Circumference.</p>
            <p>Now great Stores coming daily from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and a Recruit for our Army every day expected. The time for Action drawing near, the Lords Justices (that nothing might be wanting that was conducing to Their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Service) caused their Proclamation to be published for the Armies better Accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Substance being in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>viz.</hi>

And that the Forces may be more plentifully supplied, and and those unnecessary Persons prevented from following the Camp, who are only an Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to it; and it being found by experience, that the Country has suffered extreamly by them, they have not only robbed and plundered it themselves, but have inticed the Soldiers to do the same; for the preventing of it for the future, and that the Quarters may be the better secured, whilst the Army is in the field, from Rapparees and other disaffected People, the Lords Iustices do hereby order and direct all their Majesties Protestant Subjects, as well as Papists, to stay at, or repair to their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive

            <p>These Proceedings made many of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists stir to prevent the mischief, who before stood laughing in their sleeves at the Damages their Protestant Neighbours sustained, though to curry favour in a dissembling manner, they often shewed them a fair Countenance, and seemed to pity their Losses. And Major <hi>O Neal</hi> and some others, came over from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and took the advantage of their Majes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Protection.</p>
            <p>But whilst these things were transacting, one <hi>Mark Baggot</hi> apparelling himself in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Clothes, made it his business to spy into our Quarters, and the manner of Affairs; but his too much inquisitiveness discovering him, he was seized, and being sentenced by a Court Marshal, he was executed at <hi>Dublin</hi> on the 20th of <hi>May.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Season thus far in a forwardness, gave a favourable Invitation to the Army, for their taking the field, when a Party of the <hi>Irish</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, consisting of 150 Men, thinking to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at it, and do some notable Exploit to be talked on, came to <hi>Castle-Lions,</hi> and took thence a few of the poor peoples Cows; but Colonel <hi>Donep</hi> with about 20 <hi>Danes,</hi> and a like number of the Militia Dragoons pursued, over-taking them at <hi>Ballyderdawn,</hi> where a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant with 8 <hi>Danes,</hi> and 6 <hi>Dragoons,</hi> beat off
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47135:70"/>
60 of them who had lined the Hedges, in which Action the Lieutenant was killed; but the Colonel coming up with his Party, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reinforced with 50 fresh Men, he still pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued them, killing about 50 of them, of which 2 were Commission Officers, took 40 Horses, and his Men got indifferent store of Plunder.</p>
            <p>This was followed with other Successes of the like nature, nor could any great Actions be expected, by reason the Armies were not as yet in the field, our staying for the arrival of more Ships from <hi>England;</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi> upon the like account from <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And about the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> 8 Ships with 500 Carriage-Horses, and other Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the Army came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General <hi>Scravenmore,</hi> Major-General <hi>Mackay,</hi> and Major-General <hi>Ruvigny</hi> came likewise on Shoar. And now the Train of Artillery consisted of 39 Pieces of Cannon, 12 Field-pieces, and 6 Mortars.</p>
            <p>And in the mean while the <hi>French</hi> General St. <hi>Ruth</hi> proceeded to model the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, and give Commissions in his Master's Name, ordering things with an Absolute Power, where their Troops drew together at <hi>Loghera</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the beginning of <hi>Iune</hi> all things on our part was in a manner in a readiness, the Soldiers by this time being well recruited of the hardships, found many of them in their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Quarters; and being often out in Parties.</p>
            <p>The Army indeed lay still longer than the <hi>Irish</hi> expected, which made them promise

themselves more success than they were like to meet withal, for the General intending to make a vigorous War, and push on for speedy Victory, and the reducing all places that yet held out, and had refused to submit to their Majesties Obedience, took care so effectually to provide for all things necessary for enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing so great an Undertaking, that nothing might be wanting to retard in the least the progress of their Majesties Arms; and because the Stores laid up the Year before as to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and other things of that nature, whereby the Army might subsist in its March, it was prudently taken into Consideration, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should have time to do her part, in furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earth with such a sufficiency as might supply what was wanting, if any delays by cross Accidents should happen, that so every thing that could be expected might contribute to the sudden and effectual reducing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and putting an end to so chargeable a War; whereby the Forces upon so happy a Conclusion, as must be at leisure to oppose the grand Disturber of <hi>Europe</hi> in a more sensible manner; seeing it was concluded his main Policy in assisting the <hi>Irish,</hi> was only to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert those Troops he otherwise could not without reason expect, would make him an unwelcome Visit upon his own Frontiers, and joyntly labour to plant the Rightful Monarch in the Field of Golden Lilies.</p>
            <p>These Considerations, I say, being of weight, presaged the unparallel'd Success in a great

And indeed, had they had to do with any other Nation but the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> they might have come off better than they did in the oppositions they made; but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>British</hi> Valour revived in so short a War, took again its insuperable vigour, resolving to overcome all Difficulties, and stick at no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but furiously press on where the least glimmering of Victor presented, and so like a rapid Torrent forcing the opposing Dams, carrying all before it, and Crown their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs with sprouting Laurels and Triumphs.</p>
            <p>But not longer to detain the Reader from matter of Fact, which is mainly the intended Scope of this History: The Supplies expected from <hi>England</hi> being seasonably arrived, and every thing that was thought necessary in a readiness, there wanted but Orders to march; which were not delayed; for now, as is said, the Army being ready to take the field, our
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47135:72"/>
Forces were commanded to Decamp, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Decamped from <hi>Mullingar</hi>; and the same day the Army was joyned by Lieutenant-General <hi>Douglas,</hi> with the Northern Troops, and on the Seventh of <hi>Iune</hi> came before <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymore,</hi> seizing upon all the Enemies Out-posts, which they quitted upon the approach of our Men; but being taken, the Serjeant was hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for firing after the Communication was then cut off between him and the Town.</p>
            <p>In the Afternoon a Battery of four Field-pieces was bent against the Fort, and five Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries were raised the Night following, from whence our Cannon rent the Walls and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and the General sent to the Governour to let him know, <hi>That if he and the Garrison would Surrender within two hours, he would save their Lives, and make them Prisoners of War; if not, they must expect no Quarter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which the Governour made no direct Answer; but reply'd, <hi>He hoped to get better Terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Cannon having made two great Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and four Boats brought from <hi>Mullingar,</hi> put into the Water, the fear of a present Storm made the Besieged hang out a white Flag, and Colonel <hi>Bourk,</hi> with several Officers, came and submitted to the General at discretion: So that Colonel <hi>Earl</hi> with 400 Men marched in and took possession of the place; in which there was a Garrison of 780 Soldiers, besides 259 Rapparees well armed, and about 1000 Women and Children.</p>
            <p>In this Action we had 8 Men killed, and the Enemy above 150.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:47135:72"/>This important place thus reduced, and the Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> having joyned the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with about 12000 Horse and Foot, the March was directed towards <hi>Athlone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the Nineteenth our Men came before the place, where they had put up the <hi>French</hi> Colours in four parts of the Town, to make us believe there were a great many <hi>French</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garrisoned in it: but this hindred not; for by Ten in the Morning a Battery of Ten eighteen Pounders was finished; and playing upon the Great Bastion, in a short time the Face-flank and Curtain were laid in Rubbish, and the General ordered the Assault to be made in this order.</p>
            <p>First there advanced 300 detach'd Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>Then 50 Pioneers with more Faggots.</p>
            <p>Then 200 Feusileers, supported by two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Foot.</p>
            <p>After them 200 Pioneers with more Faggots.</p>
            <p>Then 20 Men with Axes to cut the Barro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades, if any opposed.</p>
            <p>So that about Six in the Evening, on the Twentieth of <hi>Iune,</hi> the Signal was given to fall on, which was the Discharge of all the Cannon in Battery.</p>
            <p>At first the Enemy seemed resolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Breacb; but upon the first flight of the <hi>English</hi> Granadoes, they scattered and fled in much confusion over the Bridge to the <hi>Irish</hi> Town on <hi>Connaught</hi> side, some leaping into the <hi>Shannon</hi> for haste, and there perished in the Waters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:47135:73"/>Our Men immediately entred the <hi>English</hi> Town; but lying somewhat open to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies shot on the other side the River, some few were killed, and others wounded; but the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers soon raised Blinds to shelter them.</p>
            <p>On our part of note, Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Goar,</hi> and Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Villier</hi>'s Regiment were killed, one entring the Breach, and the other surveying the Town from a Hill.</p>
            <p>The Siege was carried on against the other Town with great Resolution; so that having battered it till the Walls and Castle were part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beat down, and perceiving it saultable, order was then given for the storming of the place.</p>
            <p>On the 28th of <hi>Iune,</hi> about Seven in the Morning, much in the same order as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Attack was made, yet the Detachments were greater, as being a stronger place: but before our Men could be in a readiness, a small part of the Enemy came and set fire to a close Gallery laid over the Arch of a Stone-bridge, they had broken down, but were many of them killed in the Attempt; yet it deferred the Attack till the Thirtieth.</p>
            <p>However the Cannon and Bombs ceased not to play, and do terrible Execution, setting the Houses on fire, and beating down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
            <p>About Six in the Afternoon the Signal was given to fall on by ringing the Church-Bell; whereupon they entred the Ford below the Bridge, and pressed with such vigour upon the Enemy, that they forced them to quit the Trenches, and within the space of half an
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47135:73"/>
hour made themselves Masters of all their Outworks, and the Ruins of the Castle where they had fortified themselves with Sconces; and Major-General <hi>Maxwell</hi> with 200 Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and divers Officers of note, were made Prisoners.</p>
            <p>Yet in the Soldiers over-running the Town in the first fury, a great many were killed; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, 2000 are computed to be slain from the beginning of the Siege, till the <hi>English</hi> were entire Masters of the Town.</p>
            <p>The place was taken in the sight of the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, who, when too late, were sending a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to their Relief. There were found only 6 Pieces of Brass Cannon, and 2 Mortars, but little store of Provision and Ammunition.</p>
            <p>The Principal Officers kill'd of the <hi>Irish</hi> were Brigadier <hi>Mackellicuddy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Colonels <hi>Mac Mahon, O Neal, O Gard,</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lieutenant-Colonels, <hi>Mac Genis</hi> and <hi>Barnwell,</hi> also Major <hi>Murray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Enemy had all the advantage imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to Relieve this important Place, as lying with their whole Army on the other side, but a little distance from it, where we had no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; or if any, none capable of opposing them at that time; yet so infatuated they were, that relying on its strength, they still had a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the Town beyond the River would baffle the <hi>English</hi> Courage, notwithstanding they saw the other Town was taken with a very little resistance.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>St. Ruth,</hi> and other of their chief
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47135:74"/>
Commanders, were reported to be often in it, viewing its Works and Fortifications, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured themselves it would at least be a great part of the Summers Work to reduce it, if they were not in the end obliged to draw off from before it; and the rather, because some part of our Army had been before it, and gone off without any considerable Success, or doing any great matters against the Place.</p>
            <p>But their Imaginations answered not, as it has appeared. Their Expectations, and those Supplies, as is said that they sent, came so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably late, that all the advantage they had, was to put a stop to our Mens pursuing too far such as got out of the Town, and fled for shelter towards their Army. This sensible Blow greatly damped the Courage and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Enemy, who before had promised to do great things, and made them bethink themselves of taking new measures; insomuch that some took the opportunity, as they found occasion, to desert.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> seemed discontented with the weak Resistance of the <hi>Irish</hi>; and every thing appeared more and more dreadful to this nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army.</p>
            <p>When several Consultations were held what was best to be done, whether to remove or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the <hi>English</hi> in that Camp; for they could not propose any thing less to themselves, than that after this Success our Forces would give them a nearer Visit, and attempt the dislodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from a place so near a Town newly taken, now very weak in it self by Battery.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47135:74"/>
And though they talked high, yet in all their Debates it did not, it seems, appear they had any great mind to come to a fight; but rather to delay our Army, till the Season should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to put a stop to any considerable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, or till they might find some great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to further their purpose.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Enemies Considerations run to this purpose, our Men were gathering the Plunder of the Place; which was not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable as in so strong a Town might have been expected; for besides what had been burnt in the Fires that had happened by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Bombs, and destroyed in the beating down of Houses, some of the chief Inhabitants early apprehending this Siege, had removed what was valuable, together with themselves, to distant places, where they thought them more secure; though by the way part fell into the hands of the Rapparees, who distinguished not between Friend or Foes, where they found opportunity to get Booty. But to come nearer.</p>
            <p>The Enemy, after several Debates, perceiving our Men were absolute Masters of the Place, which was in a manner laid in Rubbish by the throwing in 600 Bombs, and the force of 1200 great Shot, they came to a Result; and it was concluded immediately to raise their Camp, and march some Miles further; which they did: and to increase their number, drew the Garrisons of <hi>Sligo, Iames-Town,</hi> and <hi>Lanes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> quitting them to those that would come and take possession.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Walls of <hi>Athlone</hi> were a little
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47135:75"/>
repaired, the General left a Garrison there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of Colonel <hi>Lloyd</hi>; and drew out to observe the Enemies motion.</p>
            <p>The Enemy, to amuze us, gave out, they were resolved to come to a Battel; when for the supply of our Army, divers Vessels with Ammunition and other Stores, arrived from <hi>England,</hi> and bringing over likewise the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi>'s Regiment of Horse, who soon joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Army.</p>
            <p>It was now resolved to dislodge the Enemy, or oblige them to fight.</p>
            <p>Their Majesties Forces on the Tenth of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> passed the River, the Foot over a Bridge of Boats below the Town, and the Horse over a Stone-bridge that had been repaired for their more advantagious passage, and marched to <hi>Ballinsloe,</hi> a place on the River <hi>Sac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Enemy lying three Miles distant, very advantagiously encamped at a place called <hi>Aghrim,</hi> a small Town, stretching their Left towards <hi>Kilconnel</hi>-Abbey, and their Right up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hills of <hi>Kilcomodon,</hi> having two very difficult Bogs before them, through which the Roads go to <hi>Galloway</hi>: And on the Left was the Ruines of an old Castle, where an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment was made and lined with Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; and on the Right likewise were several Retrenchments for the Security of their Camp.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Army passed the River <hi>Sac,</hi> the Foot and Artillery over a Stone-bridge, and the Horse by two Fords, forcing the Out-Guards to retreat, whilst our Left Wing of Horse advanced beyond the Bog that covered
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47135:75"/>
the Enemies Right, and made way for the Foot to come in, between them and that.</p>
            <p>Our Cannon fired upon the Enemies Guards at the end of the Defile or dirty Lane that leads to <hi>Aghrim,</hi> dislodged them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it, whilst our Horse and Foot took their Posts, pouring in their Shot.</p>
            <p>The Enemy drew down a great Body of Horse towards our Left, and were so strongly possessed behind the high Banks of the Ditches, that they held our Foot in dispute for 2 hours, before they could gain any thing considerable upon them; but at last we prevailed, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to give way, notwithstanding fresh Recruits of Horse and Foot were sent to sustain them, as they were pushed back; and although three Battalions of Foot advanced on the Right, over the Skirts of the Bog, and a small Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let that discharged it self into the <hi>Sac,</hi> where in a Corn field others of the Enemies Battalions and Squadrons stood firm to the Charge; yet they notwithstanding maintained their ground, till more of our Regiments and Squadrons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to support them; and then Charging up the Hills where the Enemies Squadrons were posted, gave them a warm Entertainment.</p>
            <p>In the mean time our Left had opportunity to beat the <hi>Irish</hi> from their Ground; and at the same time the Right pressing upon them, disordered them to that degree, that a general Rout of their Horse ensued; and their Foot thereupon being hotly charged, fell into disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and though they had made a resolute Resistance, they were obliged to quit the field,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47135:76"/>
and were pursued by our Army four Miles; but then Night coming on, and the difficulty of the ways hindred the further pursuit, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 6 in the Evening when the Armies enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and near 9 before they broke and fled.</p>
            <p>The Enemies Army was superiour to ours, consisting of 20000 Foot, and 8000 Horse, and had by their Encampment all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; yet our Men gained an entire Victory, 7000 of the Enemy being killed upon the place.</p>
            <p>Among the slain of note were the Lord <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway,</hi> Colonel <hi>Moor,</hi> Colonel <hi>Baker,</hi> Colonel <hi>Gourdon,</hi> a great many Captains, Lieutenants, Ensigns, Cornets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and more particularly Monsieur <hi>St. Ruth,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> General, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived here his Reward for the many Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he used towards the Protestants in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many of note were wounded, of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mortally, and soon after died of their Wounds.</p>
            <p>About 100 Officers and 500 Soldiers were made Prisoners; and all the Enemies Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Tents, Baggage and Cannon fell into the hand of our Men, with a great many Colours and Standards, and most of the Arms of the Foot, which to help their speed in flight, they threw away.</p>
            <p>This great and entire Victory was obtained with the loss of 600 Men on our side; and of note Major-General <hi>Holstable,</hi> Colonel <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats,</hi> Colonel <hi>Charles Herbert,</hi> Major-General <hi>Petit,</hi> Major <hi>Davenish,</hi> Major <hi>Colt,</hi> Major <hi>Cornwal,</hi> Major <hi>Fox,</hi> with divers Subalternate Officers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:47135:76"/>The wounded of note were the Prince of <hi>Hesse Darmstadt,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> the Lord <hi>George Hamilton,</hi> Colonel <hi>Earl,</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Burdwell,</hi> with several Subalternates.</p>
            <p>The Enemy in this flight and total rout scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their Arms and Baggage all the way they fled, thinking as it may be by that means to stay the pursuit: but it availed them little; for such Trifles were not regarded, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the Great Work that was in hand, to subdue and bring the Kingdom under their Majesties Obedience by an entire Conquest; insomuch, that urged by the Sword behind, and not finding way to escape through the press and throng that was before them, a great many cast themselves into the Bogs and Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plashes, and of these not very many escaped.</p>
            <p>Others that were more nimble of Foot, and had got the start of the press, scampered by known ways, and never left running when the pursuit was given over, till they got to the Woods or Mountains, or into such Bogs where they thought it was impossible to follow them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French,</hi> who were not so nimble as the <hi>Irish,</hi> or if they had, yet but very little acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Country, came mostly by the worst on it, where they were broken and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, throwing away their Arms, and crying for Quarter, which in the heat of the Soldiers fury could not be always obtained.</p>
            <p>Some of the Enemies Horse indeed retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pretty indifferently, keeping together as well as the Confusion would permit; but thought it not safe to stay in the Countries
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47135:77"/>
thereabout, for fear of being attacked by some of our Detachments the next day; but being got at a great distance, and those that were scattered coming to their Rendezvous, they made a small Body under the Command of Colonel <hi>Sheldon,</hi> and some other Officers; but the Foot was so entirely dispersed, that we heard little of them afterward, unless such as got into the Places that yet held out, and even there many of the Fugitives were refused, the Garrisons being already filled up and straitned for Provision, so that for a time lying under the Walls, and hankering about without any thing wherewith materially to subsist, many disbanded of themselves, and others by the leave of their Officers, as finding this great Blow had broken their Hopes and Interests in the Kingdom so far, that they even despaired of piecing it together again by force; and withal knowing no doubt, that this would be such unwelcome News to <hi>France,</hi> that although the late King resided in that Court to solicite on their behalfs, they could expect but little Succours, seeing all that had been already sent had turned to so little account; and that the <hi>English</hi> heightned by this Success, knew well enough how to take the advantage, and push on to the Walls of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> wherein, as their last Refuge, they had placed some hopes.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were employing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies serious Consideration, care was taken of our wounded Men; and such Prisoners as had been secured, who received very good Usage, and what else was requisite, till they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47135:77"/>
should be disposed of as Prisoners of War.</p>
            <p>The Victory thus entirely gained, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my encamped beyond the place of Battel, and Brigadier <hi>Eppinger</hi> going out with a strong Party, possessed himself of <hi>Portumney,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Fort and Castle of <hi>Bavaher</hi> surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and many of the scattered Forces fled to <hi>Galloway</hi> and <hi>Lymerick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the greatest part of the Standards and Colours taken in this Battel, they were sent to <hi>England,</hi> and there exposed to the publick view of the People, as eminent Trophies of so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal a Victory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Army upon the former Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, resolute to push on for the entire reducing the Kingdom to their Majesties Obedience, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some refreshment, marched towards <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being before the place, the General sent a Trumpet to the Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> Governour of the Town, to offer him advantagious Terms in case he Surrendred before the Cannon were planted against the Walls.</p>
            <p>But he returned for answer, <hi>That Monsieur</hi> Ussone <hi>the</hi> French <hi>Lieutenant-General, who commanded, was of the same Opinion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and the rest of the Officers; and that they were resolved to defend the place to the last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which the Approaches were made, and on the 20th of <hi>Iuly</hi> by break of day, a Fort or Ravelin on the Hill was attacked, and our Granadiers that were ordered for that purpose, marched with great silence; insomuch that they were not discovered till they were at the Foot
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47135:78"/>
of the Glacis, where they delivered their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado's, and went on to the Pallisado's, entring the Fort.</p>
            <p>The Enemy perceiving all was lost, cried for Quarter, leaving our Men Masters of it; so that they strongly retrenched themselves: but hearing that <hi>Baldorick O Donnel</hi> was on his March to throw himself into <hi>Galloway,</hi> the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was bridged over with the Tin Boats, over which passed 6 Regiments of our Foot, and 4 Squadrons of Horse to oppose his Attempt: so that finding he could not effect his Design, he retreated into the County of <hi>Mayo,</hi> burning and plundering in his way.</p>
            <p>The taking this Fort so Alarm'd the Town, that the Governour desired a Parley, and leave to send some Persons to the General to treat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Articles of Surrender; so that three of their Lieutenant-Colonels came out, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ours-entred the Town, by way of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stage; and after some debate it was agreed, <q>That the Town should be delivered to such Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers as the General should appoint; and in the mean time five Hostages should be sent for the due performance of the Agreement on the Articles; and all the Outworks of the Town put into the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals hands, the Enemy forbearing to fortifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in the mean-time; and to withdraw all their Cannon from the Walls; but that our Men might be permitted to work and post themselves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s they saw convenient, provided they came not within three yards of the Wall, or placed any Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non on the Batteries that should be made: And that the Garrison and Townsmen should have the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47135:78"/>
benefit of the Lords Iustices Proclamation of Indempnity, which gives them their Estates and Liberties. And further, that those who were desirous to depart, might be conducted to <hi>Lyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> with their Arms, Drums beating, <hi>&amp;c</hi> and six pieces of Cannon; and have liberty to send to <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> and acquaint him with what they had done, and invite him to do the same at <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That pursuant thereto they sent the Lord <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> with four Officers of note as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages, and allowed two Persons sent from the General to enter the Town, and take an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Stores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Treaty upon these Considerations co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to a final Conclusion, the Garrison march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out on the 26th of <hi>Iuly, D'Vssone</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Lieutenant-General having leave to be on his way to <hi>Lymerick,</hi> three hours before the rest marched out.</p>
            <p>On the 28th of <hi>Iuly</hi> Matters being settled, and the Place garrisoned, the Army marched away towards <hi>Lymerick</hi> the only strong Place the <hi>Irish</hi> held in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things passed, Sir <hi>Teague O Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> delivered up <hi>Slego</hi> to Colonel <hi>Mickleburn,</hi> and divers other Places of no considerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence were Surrendred by others.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47135:79"/>
and that some place might be assigned him and his followers, till his Majesty was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Proposals for coming over; which was in part allowed him, and he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was received into their Majesties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
            <p>Now our Parties being abroad, entred those Counties that held out, and brought away great Booties of Cattel, defeating divers of the Enemies Detachments that were abroad, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Country.</p>
            <p>Upon the approach of the <hi>English</hi> Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lymerick,</hi> the Enemy, who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped near it, no sooner perceived the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced Parties, but their Foot entred the Town, and their Horse drew off further into the Country.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> finding the Thread he had spun grew too fine, and ready to break in sunder, vexing at the crosness of Affairs, fell sick and died, as 'tis reported, of Grief, being buried in <hi>Lymerick,</hi> the place where he died.</p>
            <p>On the 11th of <hi>August</hi> our Army marched from <hi>Nenagh</hi> to <hi>Shalley,</hi> about two Miles from the Silver Mines.</p>
            <p>The next day to <hi>Tusla,</hi> where to refresh them they remained one day.</p>
            <p>But the next day the General being resolved to push on and prosecute the Success, they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to march to <hi>Larrick-en-Lysh,</hi> about 4 miles from <hi>Lymerick,</hi> the only place wherein the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy reposed their last hopes, as having yet some small glimmering of hope, which they reposed in a continual expectation of some fresh Succours from <hi>France.</hi>

               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:47135:79"/>From <hi>Carrick</hi> the next day the General went with 1500 Horse and Dragoons within sight of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> beating in their Out-guards, and taking a view of their Out-works from a Hill that over-look'd the City where our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery encamped the last Year; and upon his being there, sev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Further informing, That upon <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Death, a Commission was produced under the late King's hand, which Mr. <hi>Plowden</hi> (former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of the Commissioners of the Revenue) had brought lately from <hi>France,</hi> impowering Sir <hi>Alexander Fitton,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Neagle,</hi> and the said <hi>Plowden,</hi> Justices of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a further Account was given, That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Persons were seized and made Prisoners in <hi>Lymerick,</hi> by the order of the <hi>French</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Vssone,</hi> for having made some Proposals in order to a timely Surrender. Upon which the General sent them word by a Trumpet, <hi>That if they put any Man to death for having a mind to come over to him, he would retaliate it on the</hi> Irish <hi>Prisoners that had been lately taken, and were now in his power.</hi> Of which indeed there were a great many, and some of no mean qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Titles, besides Officers of considerable note, upon the account of their late Commands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The same day Major-General <hi>La-Forest</hi> was sent out with a strong Detachment to meet the Cannon, but with some impatience had been expected from <hi>Athlone,</hi> under the Convoy of Colonel <hi>Loyd</hi>'s Regiment; and though in the mean time a great deal of Rain fell, yet it nothing abated the Courage of the Officers and Soldiers, to go on in prosecuting the intended Siege of <hi>Lymerick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To further whose purpose, a Squadron of <hi>English</hi> Ships were in the <hi>Shannon,</hi> who made themselves Masters of a <hi>French</hi> Ship of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Burthen, which had taken in <hi>St. Ruth</hi>'s Horse and Equipage, in order to carry it for <hi>France</hi>; after which they braved the City of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> by coming almost within Cannon shot of it.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were doing and the Lord Justice <hi>Coningsby,</hi> who had been to concert Matters in the Army, was returning from <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Militia were in a readiness to keep those Parts in quiet, consisting of 1000 Foot, and 500 Horse and Dragoons, having with them 3 Field-pieces; whilst others of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the neighbouring Counties were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to augment their Number, and make them up 3000 effectual Men, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Earl of <hi>Granard,</hi> their business be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewise to secure such Places as might fall into their hands by force, or being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Enemy.</p>

            <p>Now whilst the Siege went successfully on, upon Advice that a great Party of Rapparees were drawn together in the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> mixed with some of the Enemies Horse, the General ordered Brigadier <hi>Levison,</hi> with 1500 Horse and Dragoons to march against them, of which they had no sooner notice, but they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two Parties for their better Retreat; and the Brigadier did the like, and with part of his Detachment pursued one of the Parties, whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47135:84"/>
which they had got in ravaging the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Colonel did the like by the Party he pursued; which gave the Villages rest from their fears of burning and plundering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Cannon and Bombs continuing to play against <hi>Lymerick,</hi> the former beat down thirty Yards of the Wall of the <hi>English</hi> Town on the <hi>North-east</hi> side, dismounting the Enemies Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and laying them in Rubbish, whilst the latter set fire to three of their Magazines, one of Brandy, and two of Biskets; the Fire last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till Morning, and doing great damage, so that to save their other Provisions, they hastily removed them to more distant places; and their Horse that Encamped along the River, being removed by the Guns of our Frigats, encamped between the Town and <hi>Killaloo,</hi> that they might be at hand to defend the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the <hi>Shannon.</hi> And now the General resolving the Army should pass the <hi>Shannon,</hi> in order to attack the <hi>Irish</hi> Horse in the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> and to streighten the Town on that side, the better to conceal the Design, a shew was made, as if he intended to ship away the heavy Cannon, and quit the small Castles and outward Fortifications; which the Enemy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for his being about to raise the Siege gave a great shout for Joy. But that Night our Men laid the Pontons over the River, about a Mile above the Town, and early the next Morning the Royal Regiment of Dragoons, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of Horse and Foot, had passed over undiscovered by the Enemy; but as soon as Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier <hi>Clifford,</hi> who lay with 4 Regiments of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47135:84"/>
Dragoons to guard the Passage, perceived our Troops had gained the Banks, he brought down his Men on Foot, their Horses being at Grass; but at the first Charge they fell into disorder, and from that to open flight.</p>
            <p>Being pursued by our Men, a great many of them were killed, some taken Prisoners in the flight, most of them flung away their Arms, and left their Tents, Baggage, Saddles, Bridles, and other Accoutrements to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongst our Men, with 2 Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and the Standard of <hi>Maxwel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Enemies Horse that encamped higher near <hi>Killaloo</hi> taking the Alarm, drew out; but it was only to get time to take down their Tents, and cover their Baggage; for as soon as our Troops advanced towards them, and had passed the first Defile, they hastily marched away in some disorder towards the Mountains.</p>
            <p>On the 15th of <hi>September</hi> the Lord <hi>Lisburn,</hi> as he was quitting the Trenches, was killed with a Cannon Bullet; and the next day Capt. <hi>Taaf</hi> came over from the Enemy, giving an Account, That the Town was almost ruined with our Bombs and great Guns; and that they had not above ten days Bread for Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the Garrison not consisting of above 600 able Men.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were doing, Col. <hi>Michel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> marched with a Detachment of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 500 of the Militia, 2 Troops of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, and 6 Field-pieces, encamping at <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefle,</hi> and then advancing towards <hi>Slego,</hi> which again was in the Enemies hands, beat
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47135:85"/>
in their Out-guards, and being joyned by the Lord <hi>Granard,</hi> who a little before had redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Castle of <hi>Balymont,</hi> that Garrisom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of the danger they were in, capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated almost upon the same Articles that were allowed to <hi>Galloway,</hi> including in the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the Castles of <hi>Bellaby, New-Town,</hi> and <hi>Castle-Bourk,</hi> which were to be taken care of, provided they Surrendred within 4 hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Summons. And hereupon the Fort on the 15th of <hi>September</hi> was delivered up, and 600 Men marched out under the Command of Sir <hi>Teague O Regan,</hi> and left in the place 16 pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Cannon, and Col. <hi>Michelburn</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Governour: And now to return again to <hi>Lymerick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst the Siege was yet carried vigorously on, the General, with Lieutenant-General <hi>Scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venmore,</hi> being an the other side of the <hi>Shannon</hi> with 5000 Horse and Dragoons, and a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Detachment of Foot marched into the County of <hi>Clare</hi> with 12 Field-pieces and 7 or 8 days Provision, to oblige the Enemies Horse to fight, or drive them further from <hi>Lymerick</hi>; whereupon they not only avoided coming to Action, but many of them dispersed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, so that their number daily lessened.</p>
            <p>Brigadier <hi>Levison</hi> with 250 Horse and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons had fallen upon the Enemy in <hi>Kerry,</hi> where they were about 3000 strong, and rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, killing a great many, and taking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Officers Prisoners; by whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Clare</hi> side of <hi>Lymerick</hi> with a strong Body of Horse, 10 Regiments of Foot, and 14 Pieces of Cannon; the rest of the Army remaining under the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> for the Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Works on the other side, on the 22d of <hi>September</hi> about Noon, our Troops drew up before the <hi>English</hi> Town, though the Enemies Cannon played upon them all the while from the Cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le and several Towers, as also the small shot from the Flankers and Outworks.</p>
            <p>About four in the Afternoon the General or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Detachment to attack the Fort near <hi>Thomond</hi> Bridge. Whereupon the Enemy sent two great Detachments out of the Town, to support and defend those that were in the Fort: but our Men marched on with such Courage and Bravery, that notwithstanding this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement, they bore down all before them, pursuing with hot Execution the flying Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my over the Bridge, and brought such a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour upon the City, that Monsieur <hi>D Vsson,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Governour of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> durst not lower the Draw-Bridge to let in his own Men, dreading least ours should enter with them; so that crouding on the Bridge in great numbers, our Men by perpetually pouring their Vollies of shot amongst them made a miserable slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; insomuch, that from the foot of the Bridge to the Draw-bridge, nothing was to be seen but heaps of dead Bodies discolouring the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with Blood, and 600 were computed to be killed in this Action, and about 130 taken Prisoners; amongst whom was Col. <hi>Skelton,</hi> who being very much hurt, died soon after of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47135:86"/>
of his wounds; and our Men during this hot dispute, being very much exposed to the fire of the Town, were about 300 of them killed and wounded, but none of note.</p>
            <p>This resolute Enterprise of our Men brought such a Terrour upon the Garrison, that in the Afternoon a Parley was beaten round the Town, and notice was given, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were very much enraged against the <hi>French</hi> Governour for suffering so many Men to be cut off, by keeping them out of the City, that they had insulted, and could hardly be kept from using violence.</p>
            <p>The beating this Parley was to desire a Cessation of Firing and casting in Bombs; which was allowed till 9. the next Morning, when the Colonels <hi>Sarsfield</hi> and <hi>Wahop</hi> came out, and desired the Truce might continue a day longer, and that they might send to the 1500 Horse commanded by <hi>Sheldon</hi> in the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> to know whether they would be included in the Capitulation; which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: And on <hi>Septemb.</hi> 25.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47135:86"/>
sent out their Proposals; but they were such as the General could not approve of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore instead of answering them, he sent in twelve Articles which he would allow; and not to be unready to speak his mind in another Language, in case the Truce should be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by their refusal, he ordered the Cannon and Mortars to remain charged on their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, ready to fire upon the first Command; whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h made the Besieged more reasonable in their Demands: so that the Commissioners for the Treaty coming forth again the same day, had a long Conference with those ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to treat with them by the General, and became more moderate.</p>
            <p>A very good prospect of Accommodation presented at this time; for we had of their Prisoners taken in the last Action, 2 Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Colonels, 2 Majors, 9 Captains, 7 Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, and 6 Ensigns. And this being likely to be a general Treaty for the Settlement of the Kingdom, the Lords Justices set forward from <hi>Dublin</hi> to be assisting at it, and arrived in the Camp the first of <hi>October,</hi> and after some Conferences with the Commissioners on the part of the Garrison, and their Troops in the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> the Articles of Surrender of the City of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and the Castles of <hi>Clare</hi> and <hi>Ross,</hi> with all other Places and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles that were at that time in the hands of the <hi>Irish,</hi> were on the Third of <hi>October</hi> concluded and agreed on, and signed by the General and Lords Justices on the one side, and by the <hi>French</hi> Governour, and the Persons deputed by
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47135:87"/>
the Garrison on the other; and thereupon a Stone-Fort, and one of the Gates was put into the General's hands the same Evening; and the next day five of our Regiments marched into the <hi>Irish</hi> Town, it being among other things agreed, That the <hi>French,</hi> and such as are willing to go beyond the Seas, may continue in the <hi>English</hi> Town and the Island, till they can be Transported, and Shipping are to be got ready for that purpose.</p>
            <p>And seeing upon the Articles of this Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, the quiet and settlement of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try consisted, and upon signing which, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>As for the Civil Part, it gave the Roman Catholicks the Exercise of their Religion, as far as was consistent with the Laws of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and as they enjoyed it in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in general that had been in Arms, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise under King <hi>Iames,</hi> except forfeiting Persons out of the Kingdom, should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possesed of what they could justly Claim, or were lawfully Entituled to in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and at any time since, by any Law or Laws that were in force in his Reign.

            <p>Merchants, and reputed Merchants, that were beyond the Seas, and had not born Arms since their Majesties Declaration of <hi>February</hi> 1689. were included, and to have the same benefit if they returned within the space of Eight Months after the Date of the Articles. As also were several Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> Colonel <hi>Simon Lutterel,</hi> Captain <hi>Rowland White, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice Eustace,</hi> and others who were gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, upon the account of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments remaining in <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning in the space of Eighth Months, and taking the Oath above-mentioned; and those comprised and so submitting to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have General Pardons of all At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainders, Treasons, and other Crimes and Offences against the Government, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted since the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> the Second. And that all things that have happened since the War, whereby Troubles, Suits, or Vexations may arise, should be passed over and indempnified to those comprised in the Articles to the Date thereof, to be mutual and reciprocal on both sides.</p>
            <p>Every Nobleman and Gentleman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised is allowed to ride with a Sword and Case of Pistols, and to have a Gun for the Defence of his House, or for Recreation; and that inhabited the City of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> or other Garrisons, might depart with their Goods,

And if any Person or Persons, at any time break any of these Premisses, he shall shall not cause any other, not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in such Breach, to forfeit the benefit of them; and that such Persons as are included, shall have the favour of the Lords Justices and General, to use their Endeavours to have them protected from Arrests, Execution, Debts and Damages for the space of Eight Months. That Provision be made to enable Colonel <hi>Iohn Brown,</hi> by restoring so much of his Estate and Effects as were taken away, to pay his Debts: The Matter to be stated, and agreed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus things proceeded of this kind advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous for the quieting of the Minds of the People, and settling in Peace and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>As for the Military Articles, the Substance of them were:</p>
            <p>That any Persons willing to leave the Kingdom, might pass with their Goods and Families, except into <hi>England, Scotland</hi>; and for the Officers and Soldiers, and those called Rapparees, that are minded to go, Ships should be prepared to transport them, and days and places appointed for those that were
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47135:88"/>
willing to go to declare their Minds to that purpose, and be reduced under their Officers that are to conduct them: And the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers that serve in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be included in the Capitulation, for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Estates and Effects in the Three Kingdoms, if they are content to remain here, or for passing freely into <hi>France,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Country to serve, and Land-carriage and Shipping to be furnished for those of all Conditions that are not Prisoners of War, that have a mind to be Transported, and they to be protected from all Wrongs and Injuries: And the Ships that are to Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, to be furnished with Neccesaries for Horse and Men, to be paid for by those Transported upon their safe arrival in <hi>France,</hi> and Hostages were to be left for the safe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Ships, the danger of the Sea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and till their Embarkation Quarters to be assigned them, they having Liberty to transport <hi>Gratis,</hi> including those of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers Nine hundred Horse; and for the Troops remaining behind, to dispose of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as they thought convenient, delivering up their Horse and Arms to such as the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals should nominate to receive them. Horse-Provender for those that were to be Transported, to be bought at the King's Rate, and all Necessaries to be had without mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station. And all those Prisoners of War on both sides, that were in the Kingdom of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> on the 28th of <hi>September,</hi> to be set at Liberty; the General promising his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47135:89"/>
for the Release of those likewise in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi>: And Medicines and other Necessaries be furnished for the sick and wounded. And that Notice of these things upon signing, be sent to <hi>France,</hi> and those that are to pass thither not to be stopped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Debt, or any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: And that <hi>French</hi> Ships for Transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation shall freely resort to any Parts, and have Passports; and upon the arrival of such Ships a free Communication shall be between it and the said Troops, more especially for those who have Passes from the Fleet, and Monsieur <hi>de Tumeron</hi> the Intendant; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of which the Town of <hi>Lymerick</hi> was to be put into the Hands of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or whom he shall appoint; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> Town, except the Magazine and Hospital, upon the Day of signing: But the <hi>English</hi> Town, with the Island and free Passage to <hi>Thomond</hi>-Bridge, to be in the Hands of the <hi>Irish</hi> Garrison, or those that shall come from <hi>Clare, Cork, Kerry, &amp;c.</hi> till a Conveniency offer to Transport them. And that no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders might happen between the Garrisons, the <hi>Irish</hi> Troopers were to remain in the <hi>English</hi> Town and Island, until they should Embarque on the Fifty ships that should first go to <hi>France,</hi> and to keep from any Injury on either side, under pain of Punishment. And when they are to march, they may march out together, or at sundry times, as opportunity of Embarking requires, with Arms, Baggage, Beat of Drum, Lighted
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47135:89"/>
Match, Bullet in Mouth, Colours flying, Six Brass Guns and Two Mortars, with some Ammunition and other Stores, and that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory of the Ammunition shall be given to that end, the Day after the signing.</p>
            <p>The Magazines and Provisions to remain in the Hands of those appointed for their care, for the subsistance of the <hi>Irish</hi> that are to pass for <hi>France,</hi> and they to be further fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, if occasion required. And a Cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Arms at Land and Sea to be had, in respect to the Ships, either <hi>English, Dutch</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> to be used in the Transportation, until they are returned to their Harbours; and that sufficient Passports shall be on both sides as to Ships and Men; and that any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Cessation shall be punished, and Satisfaction made for the wrong; and that Persons should be sent to give the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Ships notice of this Cessation of Arms for the time; and Hostages be given on both sides: And if there happen any Change in the Government, or Command of the Army; before the Capitulation be fully Executed, it shall yet stand in force.</p>
            <p>This being briefly the Heads and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of these famous Articles, I shall now proceed to what ensued upon so happy a Juncture, in which the Nation had so great a Promise of Peace and Tranquility; which has since raised its drooping Head from the Dust.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:47135:90"/>About the time of this Agreement, News came that divers <hi>French</hi> Men of War, with Transport-Ships, were on the Coast, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to put into some places, though very distant from <hi>Lymerick</hi>; but either not well knowing the Harbours, or being fearful, as having no certainty of what had happened, they continued cruizing, being seen sometimes off one place, and at other times off another, as being doubtful and uncertain of their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing any thing to the end for which they came; as perhaps, having intelligence that a Squadron of our Men of War, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval,</hi> was making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ireland,</hi> to prevent any evil design they might have, notwithstanding the Capitulation, considering on our part, that the <hi>French</hi> Maxim is much the same with that of the <hi>Ottomon Port, viz.</hi> To consider nothing against their Interest; but in the firmest Peace to take all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of open Hostility, where any thing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers that may render their Attempts successful. But whether they sooner or latter had an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what had happened at <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and that with the rendering up that important place, all their Measures had been broken, considering in those Articles, the few places of no considerable strength were included, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine not; but certainly so it happened, they attempted nothing worthy of note on the Coast of that Kingdom, but kept out at Sea as well as they could.</p>
            <p>

            <p>We beseech Your Majesty to Accept this Recognition as the first Fruits of our Redemption, till we are able to make a more Solemn and Parliamentary Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment to Your Majesties Iust Title to our Allegiance, not only in Right of this Crown, but in Gratitude to our great Deliverer and Conqueror of Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Enemies.

            <p>On the Two and twentieth of <hi>December, Sarsfield</hi> having got together Two thousand six hundred Men, Women and Children, set Sail from <hi>Cork</hi> for <hi>France</hi>: he thought to have carried a greater Number, but was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by their Deserting him; as did the whole Regiments of <hi>Mac Dermo, Brian O Neal,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Felix O Neal,</hi> upon the Advice they received of the ill Treatment of the <hi>Irish</hi> that were already Landed in <hi>France,</hi> where the Officers were generally displaced, or made to serve in lower Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even to Common Soldiers, and <hi>French</hi> Men set over them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ireland</hi> being now in a fair way to a Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, Colonel <hi>Foulk,</hi> Governour of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> had Orders to Disband the <hi>Irish</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that came over to us upon the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> except Fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred which were appointed for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Service; the which, though they prosessed a great willingness to serve their Majesties, they submitted to, and had Two Cobs a Man given them <hi>Gratis,</hi> most of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47135:95"/>
them going to their Habitations or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>On the Three and twentieth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> being the first day of the Term, the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Charles Porter,</hi> Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, and <hi>Thomas Conningsby</hi> Esquire, Lords Justices of the Kingdom, came to the Court of <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> accompanied by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Privy Council, and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Quality; where they took the Oaths, and Subscribed the Declaration required by the late Act of Parliament made in <hi>England:</hi> After which the Judges of other Courts, and Persons of different Quality and Employments did the like.</p>
            <p>About this time there happened an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Storm, which did much Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage at Land, but more by Sea: The <hi>Adventure of London</hi> was cast away on the Coast and all her Men drowned. A Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel laden with Corn was driven from her Anchor in the Road, and beaten to pieces, but her Men saved, and divers other Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks were driven on shoar in the Ports of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And now the Poor being very numerous, by reason of Losses in the War, care was ordered every where to be taken of them till they could better provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves having conveni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

for their shelter. And the Militia of the Country was reviewed, to know in what Condition it stood. And the Lords Justices issued out a Declaration, Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any Officer, Clark, or other Person or Persons whatsoever, depending upon their Majesties Treasury, either by himself or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, to use in part, or in whole, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly, to buy any Arrears or Debenture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This saved a great many Officers and Soldiers much Money, who to supply pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant need, would have taken a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for what was after paid them to the full. And now though it had been stipulated and agreed by several Articles made with the Garrison of <hi>Lymerick, Galloway, &amp;c.</hi> That all Arms were to be delivered up, unless such of the Nobility and Gentry as were allowed them for Defence of their Houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:47135:96"/>And this not being punctually observed, a Proclamation was issued out by the Lords Justices, to command all Persons who had any to Surrender, or cause to be Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the Sheriff of the City, Town, or County, or to the next Justice of the Peace, all their Fire-Arms, Swords, Pikes, Half-Pikes, Halbards, Partisans, Skenns, Bayonets, and all other Arms, Offensive and Defensive. And upon failure or contempt, to be prosecuted to the utmost Severity of the Law: a Reward of Ten shillings was likewise proposed to any Person who should, after the Tenth of <hi>March,</hi> discover any Arms; and the Concealer to be prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the next Assizes as a Contemner of their Majesties Royal Authority, to be looked upon as Disturbers of the Peace, and to forfeit the Benefit of the said Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
            <p>This made a great many of the Papists bring in their Arms, for fear of a Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which they had kept till now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to so sinister an end: so that by this means the Peace being better assured, the Protestants found themselves out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; the Husbandmen manured their Ground with cheerfulness, as not doubting to reap the benefit of their Labours, which they had been long debarr'd, to the undoing of many Thousands.

            <p>Whilst these things were doing, Admiral <hi>Russel,</hi> with the Red Squadron, stood with the Enemies Ships, who were got into the Bay of <hi>La Hogue,</hi> and sent Vice-Admiral <hi>Rook,</hi> with a Squadron of Light Frigats and Fireships, and all the Boats he had with him, well arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to burn the Ships he had there penn'd up; which succeeded so well, that Six were burnt that Night, and with the same Resolution Six more were burnt the next Morning, Three of them being Three-deck'd Ships, carrying a great Force of Men and Guns, and the other Three from sixty to seventy Guns: and one of Fifty six Guns was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, and utterly lost: So that the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in that Bay was destroyed; the Men in the Boats on this occasion behaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with much Bravery and Resolution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that they took possession of several
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47135:101"/>
of the <hi>French</hi> Ships; and turned the Guns upon the Platform that fired upon them from the Land, in the sight of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Camp that lay near the shoar. Many of the <hi>French</hi> Seamen perished with their Ships, those on shoar refusing to fetch them off; and a great many were taken Prisoners. So that in the main we destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about One and twenty of their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Ships, and of other Frigats, Crafts, and Transport-ships, to the number of Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and this without the loss of any Ship on our side, unless Fireships that were spent on the Enemy.</p>
            <p>For this Signal Victory the Admiral cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a Solemn Thanksgiving to Almighty God to be held on Board the Fleet; and had the Wind been more timely favourably, few of the <hi>French</hi> that engaged had escaped. This happy News caused great Rejoycing in all their Majesties Dominions, and in the Courts of the Confederate Princes.</p>
            <p>And now to shew God's more signal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Mercy towards us, a Hellish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy was discovered, that had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to destroy his Majesty beyond the Seas by Assassination, influenced by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Persons in the <hi>French</hi> Court, to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Infamy, as it was deposed upon Oath; and this was undertaken by one <hi>de Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual,</hi> a Captain of Dragoons in the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:47135:101"/>
Service, and one <hi>Dumot</hi> a <hi>Walloon,</hi> who had the last Year agreed together to kill the King; and for that purpose went to <hi>Loo,</hi> whilst his Majesty was there, but missing of their wicked purpose, they went back to <hi>Paris,</hi> and there remaining during the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they engaged one <hi>Leefdale</hi> in the same pernicious Design, agreeing to Attack the King, either upon a March, or when he should ride out to see the Troops; but an Almighty Hand held them from their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting what they so wickedly intended, and saved his Anointed to be a Joy and Comfort to his People, and a Scourge to the Common Enemy, who, though good at close Villanies, and purchasing of Towns, yet not to stand in Competition at fair Valour and Heroick Bravery, as has all along appeared by Retreats and strong En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments, when urged to Battel in a fair Field; yet, no doubt, a short time will let us see the difference between true Manhood and Politick D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Ireland</hi> is now waiting to Receive her Right Honourable Lord Deputy with all the Demonstrations of Joy that a willing Nation can express, sutable to the great Expectations she has to be yet more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py under the Auspicious Conduct of so worthy a Hero, and wise Dispencer of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; and an Encourager and Propagator of the Protestant Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
