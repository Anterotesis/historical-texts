            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Christian READER.</head>
            <p>MAster <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Second disputation of right
to Sacraments,</hi> begins thus; <hi>It may seem strange that
after 1625. years use of Christian Baptism, the Ministers
of the Gospel should be yet unresolved, to whom it doth
belong; yet so it is. And I observe that it is a question,
that they are now very sollicitous about, and I cannot
blame them, it being not onely about a matter of Divine
appointment, but a practical of such concernment to the Church.</hi> The true
reason hereof seems to be, that Ministers have for many Ages left the
true Baptism of believers which Christ appointed, and like <hi>Michal,</hi> instead of
it have substituted an Image or Idol of their own, to wit, Infant Baptism,
Which being quite besides the rule of Christ, <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Mark</hi> 16. 15. and
the Apostles practice throughout the Acts of the Apostles, they have been at a
loss about the ground of it, and almost at Daggers drawing about the use of it.
As it happens to fellow-travellers, when they are all out of the right way, one
conjectures this way they should go, another that, aud sometimes they are at
hot disputos and contentions about their way, and many by-ways are attempted,
yet still the farther they go the more out of the way, till they come into the Road
again: So it hath been with Baptizers of Infants; they are fallen into many
new devices to maintain Infant Baptism, the ancients with the <hi>Papists</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
that by it Gods grace was given, and that it was necessary to save the
child from perishing, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> that by Baptism a seed of faith and some
relative grace was given to Infants (to which Doctor <hi>Samuel Ward,</hi> Bishop
<hi>Davenant,</hi> Doctor <hi>Cornelius Burges,</hi> Master <hi>Thomas Bedford,</hi> Master <hi>James
Cranford,</hi> and others have of late much inclined) others opposing these have
fallen into as bad conceits of the Covenant of Gospel grace, as made to a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and his seed, Baptisms succession to <hi>Jewish</hi> Circumcision, and fetching a
rule from thence, as others from the <hi>Jewish</hi> Baptism. Master <hi>Baxter</hi> having
found these unsafe to rest on, sub they will bring the assertors to the avouching
<hi>Jewish</hi> tenets, hath devised another (as he conceives) more refined and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
way, making Infants Disciples of Christ mediately by the parents, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parents
(as his new term is) faith (which he never proves) and an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
ordinance or law of Infants visible Church-membership (no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant)
<pb facs="tcp:100458:3"/>
unrepealed, and in following these by-ways, they have been at variance
among themselves. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> onely allowing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
Baptism in case of manifest danger of imminent death, others to take away
original sin, Baptizing all, weak or strong, believers or unbelievers children;
which had almost quite thrust Baptism of believers out of the World, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of Christening, (as they fasly term their Infant Baptism) and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Christian</hi> souls by throwing water on them, they have so polluted the
Churches of God with the dregs of the nations, I mean, innumerable ignorant,
scandalous, prophane, superstitious haters, scorners, and persecutors of
Christianity, that nothing but the mighty power of God is sufficient to purge the
Churches of God of that loathsome and infectious filth, which these have brought
into it. The <hi>Papists</hi> themselves do in a sort confess that Infant Baptism is an
aberration from the first rule, in that they count it not perfect till their Mimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and ludicrous Sacrament of Confirmation be added, which was used with
some reformation in respect of the right, and disclaiming of some errours affixed
to it, and with the appointment of Catechizing by the late Bishops, and from
them termed Bishopping, though without any remarkable emendation of the
intrusion of ignorant, ungodly, unchristian persons into the society of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and the Lords supper. Some of those who of late have sought reformation
herein, begin to devise how they may remedy this evil, and yet keep the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
in their Communion, by refining that which is called Confirmation.
To this purpose, lately is published by Master <hi>Jonathan Hanmer, An exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Confirmation,</hi> to which Master <hi>George Hughes,</hi> Master <hi>Richard
Baxter,</hi> and Master <hi>Ralph Venning,</hi> have prefixed their Epistles; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which, how he is mistaken in the laying on of hands used by the Ancients,
and the application of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. to Confirmation after Infant Baptism, is
perceptible by <hi>Sect.</hi> 23. of the second part of my <hi>Review,</hi> and sundry passages in his
own book, in which many things besides are vented without proof, about difference
between the Church of Infants and Adult members, of the effect of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of compleat and incompleat visible Church-members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the errors of
which it is unnecessary to refute, there being no proof of them offered, but
his own and other Divines mistakes, and the main of the design being to set up
another humane inventi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, which hath no precept or promise of God, that he
may uphold or colour over an old corruption. It pleased God lately to begin to
bring the truth concerning Baptism of believers to light in this Nation, which
stirred up many to contend for Infant Baptism, and having, as they imagined
(though the three parts of my <hi>Review</hi> now published do sufficiently shew they are
deceived) made that sure, they have of late fallen to dispute whose Infants are to
be Baptized. Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cobbet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Firmin,</hi> and others, pleading
against the Baptism of the Infants of the national and parochial Church-members,
and some of them restraining it to Infants of inchurched Church-members, and
those who are judged to be real visible Saints, have been opposed by Master <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford,</hi>
Master <hi>Cawdery,</hi> Master <hi>Blake,</hi> and others. Master <hi>Blake</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his tenet, hath asserted that a Dogmatical faith intitles to baptism: to oppose
which, Master <hi>Baxter,</hi> however in his Letter to me he pretends the unpleasantness
and non-necessity of meddling any more about the point of Infant Baptism, the
want of time and health for work of greater moment, that he might decline
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ing where his law of Infants visible Church-membership unrepealed is, and
<pb facs="tcp:100458:3"/>
thinks a man cannot justifie it to lay out the hundreth part, or perhaps the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth
part of his time, study, talk, or zeal, upon this question, yet here he blames
not them that <hi>are sollicitous about</hi> it, being <hi>of Divine appointment and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
of such concernment to the Church,</hi> and hath himself, besides his Apology
before this last year, published a large Book of disputations concerning right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
Sacraments, the second whereof is against Master Blake; which though it was
intended onely to overthrow his tenet, yet indeed the middle terms and proofs of
his Arguments do beat down his own tenet of Infant Baptism, and direct into
the right way of restoring believers Baptism, To demonstrate which, that those
who have adhered to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may see how ill Master <hi>Baxter</hi> hath dealt with
them, and may, if God give them wisdom to discern the truth, be brought into
the right way of believers Baptism, is this writing framed, in which thou hast
presented to thee, a remarkable instance of Gods providence, in clearing truth
by the Pen of its most eminent adversary, and of his he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

ever counted a good plea to Argue for his own condemnation out of his own

down as his but his own words, what is added be may discern'd by the different let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
some other mark. His caution, that he means his propositions in the case of
Baptism of adult persons, and that he hath elsewhere proved Infant Baptism,
are without wrong to him left out, sith his Arguments do as strongly prove there
should be none but Adult Baptism, as that none should be Baptized upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of a bare Dogmatical Faith; for though his aim be onely to prove that the
faith professed which intitles to Baptism must be justifying, yet his Arguments
to prove this prove more, that none but such as profess such faith are to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
and that this profession is to be by each Baptized in his own person, and
no other to be Baptized. Not one Text he brings proves that a Parents or Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
profession doth intitle to Baptism; what he hath disputed elsewhere for
Infant Baptism is all now answered and published in the three parts of my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view;</hi>
no where doth he prove (though that is it be should chiefly have proved)
that in order to Baptism a Parents or Proparents profession is by God allowed
as the Infants own, but still be supposeth it, which is the main point to be
proved, which <hi>Logicians</hi> know is of all fallacies the grossest, to wit, the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the question. Yet lately Master <hi>Baxter</hi> hath Printed a book about Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
in which he dictates many things which he should prove, of Infant
visible Church-members and their priviledges, and repeats his ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Arguments
for Infant Baptism, and acknowledging onely his sorrow for provoking words,
saith he will give some account, and in his preface to his book of Justification
tells the Reader, he shall yet vindicate his Papers written to me, where he gives
some reason also of Printing my Animadversions on his Aphorisms of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
His sorrow for his provoking words is some good sign of Gods touching
his heart, and so far as belong to my person I heartily forgive him, though
they have been extreamly injurious to me, to the tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th and Church of God.
<pb facs="tcp:100458:4"/>
And for my Animadversions he hath now Printed, he may understand that I
intend (if God vouchsafe me life, and strength, and leisure) to shew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency
of his answers. If he give an account and vindicate his Papers, I
expect he should do it otherwise then he did in his <hi>Praefestinantis Morator,</hi> and
his usual fashion is. Let him do that which becomes a Replicant, set down mine
own words to which he answer, and answer them fully and distinctly without
interrogations &amp; exclamations, proving such distinctions, definitions, assertions,
expositions, as I deny, and making good by solid proof his Arguments, which that
learned man mentioned in my preface to the third part of my <hi>Review</hi> counted not
like an Argument for Infant Baptism, and allows me to tell him, that if he will
choose his best Argument, he is ready to demonstrate his censure of his book to have
been just. In the mean time I judge it necessary that this book be Printed, that if
God shall vouchsafe him such mercy he may understand his error from his own
writing, and the Reader may judge whether the Lord doth not now abundantly
refute Infant Baptism, and require him to practise that command of Christ of
being Baptized after believing, which however now reproached, was by all
<hi>Christians</hi> observed heretofore with much zeal and conscience of their duty and
honor, and is commended to him from Christ and his Apostles. Remember the

53. Argum. 1. If we must not baptize any who
profess not true repentance, <hi>then must we not
baptize any Infants;</hi> but the antecedent is true.
Therefore, &amp;c. <hi>The consequence of the major, is
manifest, sith this proposition on which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
Infants profess not true repentance, is
manifest by sense.</hi> The antecedent is easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from Scripture, and I know not whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Protestant</hi> deny it. I prove 1. that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
2. and such as is proper to the effectually
called is necessary to be professed by all that we may baptize; I will joyn the
proof of both together. <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. If <hi>John Baptist</hi> required the profession
of true repentance in men before he would baptize them, then so must we:
but <hi>John</hi> did so, therefore the consequence is clear. 1. For either <hi>John<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
and Christs were the same, as most of our Divines against the <hi>Papists</hi> do
maintain (though <hi>Zanchy,</hi> and some few more follow the judgement of the
ancient Doctors in this) or as <hi>Calvin Institut,</hi> saith, the difference seems to
be but this, that <hi>John</hi> baptized them into the Messiah to come, and the
Apostles into the name of the Messiah already come. 2. Or if the difference
be greater we may argue <hi>a fortiori,</hi> from the more forcible: if <hi>Johns</hi> baptism
required a profession of repentance, then much more Christs; for certainly
Christ required not less then <hi>John,</hi> not did he take the impenitent into his
Kingdom whom <hi>John</hi> excluded. The antecedent I prove. 1. From <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 3, 4.
He preached, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the baptism of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
unto the remission of sins. And doubless that repentance which is in
<hi>remissionem pecatorum,</hi> unto the remission of sins, is true special repentance.
One of our Divines, and many of the Papists have sound another evasion:
That is, that <hi>John</hi> did engage them to repent, but not requiring a profession
of repentance as foregoing baptism; but this is against the whole current of
expositors, ancient and modern, and 2. against the plain scope of the Text.
The words in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3 6. are [they were baptized of him in <hi>Jordan,</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their sins] This confession was with, yea before their baptism; and
this confession was the profession of repentance that <hi>John</hi> required. <hi>Maldonate</hi>
on the text, having first railed at <hi>Calvin</hi> and slandered him, as turning bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
into preaching, (as if he had expounded <hi>Johns</hi> baptizing, not of water bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
but preaching, when he onely shews that both should go together) doth
tell the <hi>Protestants</hi> that they cannot prove by this text that confession went
before baptism, because it is named after; but that he might not seem utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impudent, he confesseth that the thing is true, and that is the sense of the
text, and this he confesseth because he must rather be a faithful expositor, then
a subtile adversary. And if any should say that it's onely confession that's
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100458:5"/>
required, which is no certain sign of true repentance, I answer: When <hi>John</hi>
saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we confess our sins, he is faithfull and just to forgive us our sins]
he to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k that confession to be a sign of true repentance, and our expositors
and the ancients befor them agree, that it was such a confession as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct
with a detestation and renouncing of the sin, and it is expounded by
that of <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 18. as <hi>Grotius</hi> noteth, to have a special detestation of the
sin accompanying it, where to the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is added <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
confessing and shewing their deeds. And it
may suffice that the baptism to which this confession was required, is the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of repentance.</p>
            <p>But it is objected that in the 11. vers. of <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. It is said by <hi>John</hi> [I
baptize you with water to repentance] Therefore it is but an engagement
of them to it for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Our Expositors have fully shewed that this signifieth no more, but
[I baptize you upon your present profession of repentance, to newness of life]
for that this profession did go before is proved already, &amp; then the rest can be no
more, than the continuance of repentance and exercise of it in newness of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ife, which they are engaged to for the future: Onely if any falsly profess it at
present his own confession is an engagement to it as a duty. <hi>Grotius</hi> saith,
that [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>potest non incommode exponi hoc modo, baptizo vos
super professione paenitentiae quam facitis,</hi> unto repentance may commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
be thus expounded; I baptize you upon profession of repentance, which
ye make. The plain meaning is in a word [I do by baptism initiate you into
the state of repentance, or of penitents] but Christ shall give the Holy
Ghost (as it was poured forth) And so (as <hi>Pelargus</hi> speaks in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.
against <hi>Salm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ron</hi>) we maintain <hi>Johns</hi> baptism to be effectual, being the
baptism of repentance to remission of sin: And that it was true repentance
that he required appeareth further by the fruits of it, that he calleth from the

               </gap>ees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9. Lastly, I shall prove anon that God hath
not appointed us to baptize any upon a promise of repentance or faith, before
they profess actual faith and repentance, nor are they fit for such a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. For the proof of the necessity of a profession of repentance
before baptism, is this: If Jesus Christ hath by Scripture, precept, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
directed us to baptize those that profess true repentance and no other,
then we must baptize them and no other: But the antecedent is true, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to is the consequent. All that requireth proof is of the antecedent, which I
prove from an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>numeration of those texts that do afford us this direction (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the fore-mentioned.)</p>
            <p>1. Jesus Christ himself did by preaching repentance prepare men for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
end for his Kingdom, as <hi>John</hi> before began to do, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 17. so
<hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 15. The Kingdom of God is at hand, repent ye and believe the
Gospe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and to that end he sent his Apostles and other Preachers, <hi>Mark 16.
12. Acts 17. 30. Luke</hi> 24. 47. Repentance and remission is to be preached
to all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tions in his name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and baptism which is for the obsignation of remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n, according to the appointed order, comes after repentance.</p>
            <p>And when it is said by <hi>John.</hi> [I baptize you with water to repentance, but
he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost] <hi>Matth. 3. 11. Mark 1. 8. Luke</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100458:5"/>
3. 16. It implieth that Christs baptism comprehended <hi>Johns</hi> and somewhat
more. In <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37, 38. When the <hi>Jews</hi> were pricked in their heart (which
was a preparatorie repentance) and said to <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest of the Apostles
[men and brethren what shall we do?] <hi>Peter</hi> saith to them, Repent, and be
baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of
sins] so that we must require and expect true evangelical repentance to be
professed before baptism. For <hi>verse</hi> 41. its added [Then they that gladly
received his word were baptized] so that he baptized none that to outward
appearance did not gladly receive that word, which could not be without a
profession of that repentance. And he that hence perswadeth to repent and be
baptized for remission, doth in the next chapter, <hi>verse</hi> 19. require them to
repent, and be converted, that their sins may be blotted out, shewing what
kind of repentance it is that he meaneth; and as the work of general Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
to the unbelieving world is sometimes called a disciplining of nations,
which goeth before baptizing them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. So it is in other
places called a preaching of repentance and commanding all men every where
to repent, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30. an opening of mens eyes and turning them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive
remission (obsigned in baptism) <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. 1. Repent and turn to
God, <hi>verse</hi> 20. And if it was the sum of <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching to the unbaptized
[repentance toward God, and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ] <hi>Acts</hi> 20.
21. So that it is apparent that they took the profession or appearance of both
faith and repentance as prerequisite to baptism, and still this same repentance
is it that hath the remission of sin connexed, <hi>Acts. 5. 31. Luke</hi> 24. 47. Its
repentance unto life, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 18. And when the Apostles compare <hi>Johns</hi>
baptism with <hi>Christs,</hi> they still acknowledge <hi>Johns</hi> to be baptism of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 24. and 19. 4. and when the Apostle doth purposely recite
the principle of our Religion he doth it in this order. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. [The
foundation of repentance from dead works and saith towards God, of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of baptisms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. They that before they are baptized must renounce the world,
the flesh and the devil, must profess true Evangelical repentance (I mean still
such as hath a promise of pardon and salvation) but all that are baptized
must renounce the world, flesh and devil, of which we shall have occasion to
say more anon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. They that profess to be buried with Christ in baptism, and to
rise again, do profess true repentance; but all that are baptized must profess
to be buried with him and rise again, therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The major is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in that to be buried and risen with Christ, signifieth, A being dead to
sin and alive to God, and newness of life: and it is not onely an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this for the future, but a profession also of it at the present. This
with the rest we thus prove, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13. In whom ye are circumcised
with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the
sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, buried with him in baptism,
wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God,
who hath raised him from the dead, and you being dead in your sins and
the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him, having
forgiven you all trespasses. Where note 1. that this is spoken to all the Church of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100458:6"/>
the <hi>Colossians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and therefore they are presumed to be what they profess and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be. 2. That the putting of the body under the water did signifie our
burial with Christ and the death and putting off of our sins; and though we
now use a less quantity of water, yet it is to signifie the same thing, or else we
should destroy the being of the Sacrament. So also our rising out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
signifieth our rising and being quickned together with him. 3. Note also
that it is not onely an engagement to this hereafter, but a thing presently
done. They were in baptism buried with Christ, and put off the body of
sin, and were quickned with him; and this doth all suppose their own present
profession to put off the body of sin, and their consent to be baptized on these
terms.</p>
            <p>The like we have in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. chapter 4. 5. Know ye not that so many of
us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from the dead by the glory of the father, even so we also should walk in
newness of life; for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death,
we shal be also into the likeness of his resurrection. Here also it is evident, 1. that
all the members of the visible Church are supposed to be baptized into Christ,
and into his death, &amp; so to be buried with him by baptism into death &amp; planted
together into the likeness of his death. 2. And that this is not supposed to
be onely an engagement for the future, but a present entrance into the
state of mortification and vivification wherein they were to proceed by new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of life; and therefore <hi>verse</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8, 11. they are supposed to have the
old man crucified with Christ that the body of sin might be destroyed, and
that henceforth they should not serve sin, and that they are so dead as to be
freed from sin, as to the servitude thereof. And that they must reckon
themselves dead to sin, but alive to God. He that readeth the whole chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with judgement and impartialitie, will soon discern that true repentance
and abrenuntiation of the service of sin, was to be professed by all that would
be baptized; and that thereupon they sealed their own profession and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
by the reception of baptism, as Christ sealed his part by the actual
baptizing them; and that hereupon they are by the Apostles all called and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
such as they professed themselves to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. If it be the very nature of baptism to signifie and seal both
the present putting off the body of sin, and present putting on Christ,
then the profession of true repentance must needs precede or concur with
baptism: but the former is certain; of which more anon. I conclude then
that both Scripture, and the very signs themselves, and the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Church do shew that true repentance and present repentance must
be professed by all those that we may baptize.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 62. Argum.</hi> 2. My first Argument was from the necessity of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of true repentance. The 2. shall be from the equipollent terms, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
to the thing described, thus: We must baptize no man that first
professeth not to believe in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: <hi>But no
Infant professeth to believe in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;
therefore we must baptize no Infant: The minor is manifest by sense.</hi>
The major is proved from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. where this is made the form of the
words in baptism, or at least the end, and that which we must insist on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100458:6"/>
on the words yields the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> that faith is put justly before
baptism, <hi>nam alioqui mendax essot, figuraque remissionem peccatorum &amp;
spiritus donum afferes incredulis, qui nondum essent Christi membra.</hi>
For otherwise he should speak false, and the figure should bring remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sins, and the gift of the spirit to unbelievers, who were not
members of Christ. And that, <hi>non abs re, Patris, Filii &amp; spiritus expressa
hic fit mentio, quia aliter baptismi vis apprehendi non potest, quam si a
gratuita patris miserecordia initium fiat, qui nos per filium sibi reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liat,
deinde in medium prodeat Christus ipse cum mortis suae sacrificio,
&amp; tandem accedat etiam Spiritus sanctus per quem nos abluit &amp; rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat;
denique suorum omnium bonorum consor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es faciat.</hi> Not from the
matter, here is express mention made of the Father, Son, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
because otherwise the efficacie of baptism cannot be apprehended,
but by beginning from the Fathers free mercy, who reconciles us to
himself by his Son, and then that Christ himself come between with
the sacrifice of his death, and then at last the holy spirit also approach,
by which he washeth and regenerates us, and last of all makes us parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his benefits. It appeareth by comparing <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. with
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15. and 10. 2. that to be baptized into the
name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is not onely to be baptized by
their authority, but also to be thus initiated into the relation which the
Church standeth in to them, and to be consecrated to the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, as <hi>Musculus, Diodate,</hi> the assembly of Divines Annotations,
and the generality of expositors do express. See Doctor <hi>Hammond, Pract.
Catech. lib.</hi> 6. 5. 2. And especially on <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Grotius</hi> at large, and
that it comprehendeth or presupposeth a profession of believing Son and Holy
Ghost. <hi>For no man can devote himself solemnly by our ministry to the Holy
Trinity, that doth not first profess to believe in them: therefore the Chuch over
taught the</hi> Catechumeni <hi>the creed first, in which they profess to believe in God
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And before they actually baptized them,
they asked them whether they believed in God the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost?</hi> To which they must answer affirmatively, or not be baptized. <hi>And
all that are baptized must first profess to believe in his Name, and so to receive
him, and not onely promise to do it hereafter.</hi> I adde that the same faith that
is mentioned in the ordinary Creed in the Church, is meant in the baptismal
profession, and to be required before baptism; this will be confessed. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the creed it self hath been this 1300. years at least professed before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.
2. because the creed it self is but the 3. fundamental baptismal articles
mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. enlarged and explained on subsequent occasions
(as <hi>Sandford,</hi> and <hi>Parker, de Descensu</hi> have learnedly and largley proved, and
<hi>Grotius</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. proves out of <hi>Tertullian, &amp;c.</hi> that the creed was
not then in the form of words as now, though the same doctrine was used in
other words, to the same uses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 68. Argum.</hi> 3. The foregoing Argument was taken from the prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
profession, the next shall be taken from the very work it self, <hi>viz.</hi> the
presenting and offering our selves to be baptized, and willingly receiving bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism:
thus,</p>
            <p>If it be the very nature or appointed use of the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eanal part of baptism it self
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100458:7"/>
(yea essential to it) to signifie and profess (among other things) the saving
faith and repentance of the baptized, then true baptism cannot go without
such a profession. <hi>But the baptism of Infants is without such a profession, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the baptism of Infants is not true baptism. The minor is manifest by sense.</hi>
The antecedent (which onely requireth proof) I prove thus: It is of the
instituted nature of baptism to be in general, a professing sign as well as an
engaging sign, <hi>de futuro,</hi> for the future: This I premise, as granted by all
Christians that I know of that have written of baptism, and then let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of the several parts of the sign or external Ordinance, with the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of each; that it is essential to it to be significant and obligatory on our
part, as well as on Gods part, is commonly confessed. And 1. the Minister
doth baptize him into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and
the party doth consent thereto, 1. voluntarily offering himself to be bapit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and then 2. voluntarily receiving that baptism. And his offer of himself
hereto, goeth before the Ministers baptizing him, and his reception of that
baptism is essential to it: So that baptism essentially containeth on his part
a signal profession of consent to that which is meant in the form used by the
Minister [I Baptize thee into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost]
And that is, that God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost be mine, and I
be theirs, in the relations in which they are offered in the Gospel to Mankind;
for all confess that it is a Covenant that is here sealed, and so a mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
which the signs are instituted by Christ to signifie. Christ offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be related to me as my Jesus Christ; and by offering my self to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
and by voluntary receiving it, I do actually profess my acceptance of
his offer, that is of himself so offered. God the Father offereth himself to be
my God reconciled in Christ, and so my chief good: and by voluntary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
baptism I do signally profess my acceptance of him so offered. The
Holy Ghost is offered to be my Sanctifyer and guide; and by voluntary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of baptism into his Name, I do signally profess my acceptance of
him so offered: So that it is a most clear case, that baptism as baptism, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its instituted nature and use, doth contain the persons actual signal
profession of present assent to the truth of the Gospel, and acceptance of God the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost as therein offered. And it containeth (as our
Divines commonly maintain) an actual signal profession that we there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
consecrate or devote, or dedicate our selves to God the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost in the foresaid relations. 2. Another part of baptism is, the
Ministers washing the person, and the person first offering himself to be washed,
and after actually receiving it, doth thereby signally profess his consent.
Now this washing doth essentially signifie our washing from our former filth
of sin, together with the guilt; our putting off the old man which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
according to the deceitful lusts of the flesh. He that signally professeth
his present consent to be washed by the blood of Christ from his former filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and guilt, and to lay by the filthiness of flesh and Spirit, doth <hi>co nomine</hi>
profess saving faith and repentance. But all that are baptized with the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of Christs institution, do by the very voluntary reception of baptism, so
profess; therefore they do thereby profess saving Faith and Repen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Quad modum</hi> as to the manner; its commonly confessed by us to the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100458:7"/>
               <hi>Anabaptists</hi> (as our commentators declare) that in the Apostles times the
baptized were dipped over head in the water, and that this signifieth their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
both of believing the bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ial and resurrection of Christ, and of their
own present renouncing the world and flesh, or dying to sin and living to
Christ, or rising again to newness of life, or being buried and risen again
with Christ, as the Apostle expoundeth in the forecited texts of <hi>Col.</hi> 2. and
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. And though we have thought it lawful to disuse the manner of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and to use less water, yet we presume not to change the use and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of it: So then, he, that signally professeth to die and rise again in
baptism with Christ, doth signally profess saving faith and repentance.
But thus do all that are baptized according to the Apostles practice: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 74. Argum.</hi> 4. If we must baptize none that profess not their consent
to enter themselves presently into the covenant of grace with God in Christ,
<hi>Then we must baptize no Infant,</hi> but the former is true; Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.
The consequence is manifest, sith it is manifest even by sense, that Infants
profess not their consent to enter themselves into the covenant of Grace with
God in Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The antecedent I think will be granted by many of the <hi>Papists,</hi> and it is
the common Doctrine of the <hi>Protestants;</hi> and therefore as to them I need
not prove it.</p>
            <p>I confess, some of the <hi>Anbaptists,</hi> and some few others, do question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
baptism be a seal of the covenant of grace; but the quarrel is mostly, if
not onely, about the bare word [Seal] for they confess that in sense which we
mean by sealing; and particularly they confess, that we do in baptism enter
into the convenant of God, and that it is a professing and engaging sign on
our part, as well as an exhibiting, notifying, confirming sign on Gods part.
It is confest it is the covenant of grace we are to enter, and that there is but
one covenant of grace.</p>
            <p>This Master <hi>Blake</hi> acknowledgeth, for all the mention of an outward co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:
it is also a confessed thing on all hands that it is God that is the
first author and offerer of the covenant, that it is he that redeemed us, who made
the promise or covenant of grace upon the ground of redemption; and that it
is frequently called a covenant in Scripture, as it is a Divine Law or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
without respect to mans consent, as <hi>Grotius</hi> hath proved in the
preface to his annotations on the Evangelists: much more (out of doubt)
is it, that it is called a covenant before man consenteth, as it is a covenant
offered, and not yet mutually entred; in the former sense the word is taken
properly, but in another sense and for another thing then in the later. But in
the later it is taken tropically, <hi>viz.</hi> Synedochically, it being but a covenant
drawn up and consented to by God conditionally, and offered to us for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent.
It is the same covenant that is offered to us and not another, that we
are called to consent to or enter in, and we cannot be truly said to enter into
covenant with God if we make a new one of our own, and lay by his; for
that's none of the covenant of God: he never offered it, nor will he ever
enter it.</p>
            <p>We are I hope agreed what the covenant of grace is, as offered on Gods
part (or else its great pity;) <hi>viz.</hi> that on the title of cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>n first and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100458:8"/>
after, we being absolutely his own, it is offered to us, that God
will be our God (our chief good and reconciled father in Christ) that
Christ will be our Saviour (by propitiation teaching and ruling us) even
from the guilt, filth, or power of sin, that the Holy Ghost will be our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
Sanctifier, if we heartily or sincerely accept the gift and offer, that
God will consent to be our God, Christ to be our Jesus Christ, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost to be our in-dwelling Sanctifier, if we will but consent. This is no
doubt the gift or covenant so offered. These things being thus premised, I
come to prove not onely the inseparability but even the identity of heart cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing
and saving faith, and of signal external covenanting and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of saving faith, without which we must not baptize any.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 79. Argum.</hi> 5. We must not baptize any without the profession of
that faith and repentance which are made the condition of remission of sins.
<hi>But Infants make no profession of that faith and repentance which are made the
condition of remission of sins, therefore no Infants are to be baptized; The
minor is manifest by sense,</hi> and the major I prove thus.</p>
            <p>If we must not baptize any but intentionally for present remission of sin,
then must not we baptize any without a profession of that faith and repentance
which is the condition of remission. But the former is true, therefore so is the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uer; the consequence is past all doubt, for else we should imagine that men
may have present actual pardon without that faith and repentance which are
the condition of it, which subverteth much of the Gospel. <hi>The antecedent I
prove thus:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If God hath instituted no baptism, but what is intentionally for the present
remission of sin, <hi>then we must not baptize any but intentionally for the present
remission of sin:</hi> But the former is true, therefore so is the later. I say [in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally]
in contradistinction from [eventually, or certainly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
attaining that end] where further note, that I speak not of Gods ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
decrees, as if his intention in that sense could be frustrate; but of his
ends as <hi>Legislator</hi> speaking of him after the manner of men, but principally of
the instituted end of his ordinances; that is, the ends which he requireth
the Minister and People to use them for, and so it is our intention principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that I mention. As the Gospel it self is said to be intentionally to save men,
and though it condemn most, that is besides the first intention and but by
accident; and though this be principally to be spoken of the prae-imposed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of their conversion and salvation; yet Christ is pleased in the word
to ascribe such intentions to himself as attain not their ends, as professing
that he came not into the world to condemn the world, but that the world
through him migh be saved: That is, to condemn them is not his direct
principal intent, but onely on supposition of their wilfull final rejecting of
him; and thus he speaks partly in the habit of a rector or promiser, and partly
as man, or after the manner of men: and of the intention imposed on us
there is no doubt.</p>
            <p>Now I shall prove the antecedent (for the consequence is past doubt:)
And first we are confirmed in this truth, because the Opponent (whom it
concerneth) hath not proved any other baptism instituted by God, but what
is for present re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ission of sins. If they can shew us one Text of Scripture that
speaketh of any other, we shall give up all the cause; but yet they have not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100458:8"/>
done it that I know of. In the mean time we shall prove the contrary, God
hath instituted but one baptism: That one baptism is for the present remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sins, therefore God hath instituted no baptism but what is for present
remission.</p>
            <p>The major is proved from <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 5. There is one baptism. In the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
we take the words [for remission] not to speak of somewhat acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
or to be intended onely by the administrator, uncertainly or but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.
And I prove it from Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. Repent and be baptized e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye
shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, as remission is here made the end
of baptism so it is present remission. For 1. It is such as is the consequent of
the repentance which <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth them to, but that was present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
2. It was to precede the giving of the Holy Ghost in the sense there
mentioned, therefore it was present remission. <hi>Beza in loc.</hi> upon the place,
saith, [<hi>in nomen Christi] id est dans Christo nomen, cujus mortis, scpulturae
ac resurrectionis simus in baptizo participes, cum peccatorum remissione, nec

Christ, That is, giving our name to Christ, of whose death, burial, and

                  </gap>ri in nomine Domini Jesu Christi,
est baptismatis signo testari se Christo credere ad remissionem peccatorum.</hi> To
be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, is by the sign of baptism,
to testifie that we believe in Christ for the remission of sins. 1. Mark, It is
not onely an engagement to believe hereafter, but the profession of a present
faith. 2. And that not a common faith, but that which hath remission of
sin. 3. And this was not an accidental separable use of baptism; but he
makes this the very exposition of <hi>baptizari in nomine Jesu Christi,</hi> to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in the name of Jesus Christ. And thus he expoundeth the covenant,
[<hi>est enim baptismus pactum seu foedus gratiae, quod init inter baptizandum
nobiscum Christus</hi>] For baptism is an agreement or covenant of grace, which
Christ enters into with us, when we are baptized. And that it is a professing
sign of our true repentance, he shews before [<hi>&amp; rectissime conjungitur paeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia
&amp; baptismus, quia baptismus paenitentiae signum est</hi>] and most rightly
is repentance and baptism joyned together, between baptism is the sign of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.

as there is in or of the new birth by the spirit; yet it is by most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
that Christ doth here speak of the new birth as signified by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
and so hath respect to baptism, as the ordinary confirming sign: And
so the Text fully sheweth us, that baptism is instituted to be the sign of our
present regeneration, or else it could not be said that we must be born [of
water and the spirit.]</p>

               <hi>Calvin</hi> saith, most are of <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> mind, who took it to be meant of

and some more think otherwise, yet as long as they take it to be a meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymical
expression, the sign being put for the thing signified, it doth as well
acquaint us with the use of baptism, as if it were a proper speech. <hi>Bullinger in

2. That it is also a Sacrament of repentance on our part, for we again engage

without examination, least they prostitute the Sacraments, and contract guilt
to themselves and the Church. And <hi>pag.</hi> 56. against <hi>Maldonate</hi> he proveth
the baptism of Christ and <hi>John</hi> all one; and when <hi>Maldonate</hi> saith, that
<hi>John</hi> baptized <hi>in panitentiam, &amp; baptismus praecedebat, paenitentia sequeba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
unto repentance, and that baptism went before, and repentance followed,
(confessing that in Christs baptism repentance precedes) he answereth [that
it is faise, <hi>nam etiam in Joannis baptismo praecedebat paenitentiae, sequebatur
baptismus</hi>] For repentance did also precede in <hi>Johns</hi> baptism, and baptism
followed.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. It is said of the barren ungodly professor [That he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
that he was purged from his old sins,] where I take it for a clear case, that
it is the baptismal washing which the Apostle there intendeth, wherein all profess
to put off the old man, and to be washed from their former filthiness; for I
suppose we shall be loath to yield that it was an actual cleansing either of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
or mortification, which the Apostle meaneth, lest we grant that men
may fall from such a state; and therefore it must be a Sacramental washing,
or cleansing, wherein the matter was appearingly and sacramentally trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted.
From whence it is plain that the Apostle took it for granted, that as all
the baptized were visibly Church-members, so were they all visibly washed
from their old sins; which sheweth both what was their own profession, and
what was the stated end and use of the ordinance. The Apostle saith not that
[he hath forgotten that he promised or engaged to be purged from his old sins]
but that [he was purged] from them. <hi>Paraeus in locum,</hi> upon the place, saith,
[<hi>A veteribus peccatis purgatum, hoc est se esse baptizatum, seu se accepisse
in baptismo purgationis signaculum. Omnes enim baptizati debent purgari a
peccatis, sicut dicuntur induere Christum,</hi> Gal. 3. <hi>mori cum Christo,</hi> Rom.
6. <hi>sensus est, qui se volutant in sceleribus, non recordantur se baptizatos
esse, abnegant ergo baptismum suum</hi>] That he was purged from his old sins,
that is, was baptized, or had received in baptism the seal of purging, for all
those who are baptized, ought to be purged from their sins, as they are said to
put on Christ, to die with Christ, the meaning is, they which wallow in
their sins, do not remember they were baptized, and therefore do renounce
their baptism. 1 Cor. 6. 11. the Apostle saith of the visible Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>
[such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but
ye are justified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] where it is evident, that all the visible members of the
Church are visibly washed, sanctified, justified: And I think it is clear
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100458:10"/>
that by washing here he hath some respect to their baptism. So that I conclude
that there is no baptism to be administred without a profession of saving faith
and repentance foregoing, because there is no baptism that ever Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
but what is for the obsignation of remission of sins, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Blake, pag.</hi> 171. reciteth some words of mine containing this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
thus; That faith to which the promise of remission and justification
is made, must also be sealed to: Or that faith which is the condition of the
promise, is the condition <hi>in foro De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> in the Court of God, of the title to the
seal: But it is onely solid true faith that is the condition of the promise of
remission; therefore it is that which gives right <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> in the Court of
God, to the seal. Who would think now but Master <hi>Blake</hi> had given some
substantial answer to this and other Arguments, when himself and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are so confident of the sufficiency of them? His answer is this: [To
this I have answered, faith is not sealed to, but remission of sins or salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon condition of faith; and when I come to speak of the sealing of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
I shall (God willing) make this more evident, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>qua</hi> seal immediately respects our priviledges, not duties] <hi>Reply</hi> 1.
Is here one word of answer to any real part of this Argument. Is not this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
as little to the matter, as if he had talked of another subject. I think it my
duty to say that Ministers of the Gospel do but proclaim to the Church the
matter of our common lamentation, and the enemies joy, when some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
publish such kind of Disputations, and others are satisfied with them;
and I must say if all were such, they should never be angred with one word of
mine in opposition to their assertions, though they would maintain that the
Crow is white. 2. To that useless touch that he hath on a word (whose follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
explication might have spared him his labour) I may say that our Divines
have ordinarily maintained hitherto that there is a mutual covenanting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and us, (and no man more then Master <hi>Blake</hi>) and that there is in
the Sacrament a mutual sealing; the receiving being our seal, as the act is
Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 88. Argum.</hi> 6. If baptism be instituted to be a seal of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that faith which we have yet being unbaptized, then must we baptize
none that profess not a justifying faith. <hi>But no Infants profess a justifying
faith, therefore we must baptize no Infants; The minor is manifest by sense.</hi>
The reason of the consequence is evident, in that we must use baptism one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
according to its nature and to its instituted ends: The antecedent is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thus:</p>
            <p>Circumcision was instituted to be a seal of the righteousness of that faith
which we have yet unbaptized. The consequence will not be denied by
them whom we now deal with: because they confesse that baptism succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
circumcision. The antecedent is evident in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. it being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
said of <hi>Abraham</hi> to whom circumcision was first given. I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
what they will say, unless it be by recourse to the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> shift, to
say that circumcision was instituted to this end indeed, to <hi>Abraham</hi> himself,
and others that were sincere, but not to all that had right to it; but God
here tells us the established use and end of his ordinance, and in such relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100458:11"/>
the end is inseparable. And as God hath not made many sorts of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms
or circumcisions: So neither many meer inconsistent ends (or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable)
and we are likest to know the true end of the institution, where the
institution and first example are reported to us. <hi>Calvin in loc.</hi> saith, <hi>Duae
denique ut baptismi hodie sunt, ita olim circumcisionis erant partes, nempe,
tam vitae novitatem, quam peccatorum remissionem testari:</hi> Lastly, as there are
two parts at this day of baptism, so of old there were two of circumcision, <hi>viz.</hi>
to witness, as newness of life, so forgiveness of sins. Saith <hi>Piscator, in loc.</hi>
upon the place, <hi>Sicut olim circumcisio signum suit faeleris gratiae, &amp; figillum quo
credentibus obsignata fuit justitia fidei, hoc est, quo illi certiores sunt redditi, sibi
remssa esse peccata, propter futuram satisfactionem Christi, ac proinde se babere
Deam propitium ac foventem; ita caetera quoque sacramenta, &amp;c. similiter &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
seu scopus omnium sacramentorum unus idemque, viz. obsignatio justitiae fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei,
quae vulgo dicitur fidei confirmatio. Paraeus in loc.</hi> saith [<hi>ita signum fuit
dantis &amp; accipientis respectu, &amp;c.] Et [Justitia fidei est remissio peccatorum fide
accepta propter redemptionem Christi] et [sic Sacramenta non sunt instituta justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficandis,
sed justificatis, hoc est non infidelibus sed conversis, non igiturnisi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versione
&amp; fide sumi debent: secus sigilla justitiae esse cessant: quid enim non ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentibus
fidem &amp; justitiam obsignarent?</hi> As circumcision was of old a sign of
the covenant of grace, and a seal whereby was sealed the righteousness of
faith to believers, that is to say, whereby they were certified that their sins
were forgiven them, by receiving of the future satisfaction of Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had God propitious and favouring unto them, so also the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Also the end or scope of all the Sacraments is as one and the
same, <hi>viz.</hi> the signing of the righteousness of faith, which is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the confirmation of faith, so it was a sign both in respect of the giver,
and receiver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the righteousness of faith is the forgiveness of sins
by faith, received because of Christs redemption, and so the Sacraments are
not instituted for those who are to be justified, but for the justified, that is,
not for unbelievers, but for those which are converted, therefore are they
not to be taken without conversion and saith, otherwise they were to be seals
of righteousness, for what would it seal to them, who have not faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Willet, in loc.</hi> saith [circumcision then did not conser upon him
that grace which he had not, but did confirm and establish him in the grace and
faith received: the sacraments then <hi>non instituta sunt justificandis, sed justificatis,</hi>
are not instituted for those which are to be justified, but for them which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
justified <hi>Parae.] Peter Martyr</hi> is large, and makes these words <hi>Rom.</hi>

Disciples of Christ. But none are professed Disciples of Christ that
profess not saving saith in Christ, therefore we may not baptize any that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
not saving faith in Christ: <hi>But no Infant doth profess saving faith in
Christ, as is manifest by sense; therefore no Infant is a professed Disciple of
Christ, nor must we baptize any.</hi> The major is proved from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19.
Go, Disciple me all nations baptizing them] As for those that say, they are
discipled by baptizing, and not before baptizing, 1. They speak not the
sense of that Text. 2. Nor that which is true or rational, if they mean it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100458:11"/>
as so spoken, else why should one be baptized more then another?
3. But if they mean that by heart-covenant or Gods acceptance and promise
they are Disciples before, but not so compleatly till the covenant be sealed
and solemnized, as a Souldier is not so signally a Souldier till he be listed,
nor a King till he be Crowned so fully a King, or a man and woman so fully
maried till it be solemnized in the congregation; in this sense they say the
same that I am proving: men must be first Disciples by the professed consent,
before they are declared such by the seals or publick sacramental solemniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And that onely the professors of saving saith are Disciples, may appear by
a perusal of the texts of Scripture that use this word, and it will not onely by
found that this which I maintain is the ordinary use of the word (which
should make it so also with us) but that no Text can be cited where any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are called the Disciples of Christ. For the major and minor both observe
<hi>Piscators</hi> definition of baptism [on <hi>Matth</hi> 28. 19.] <hi>Baptismus est sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum

Baptism is a Sacrament of the New Testament, by which those men
who belong to the Church, by the command of Christ, are consecrated to the
worship of the true God, which is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, by
the Ministers of the word, and are confirmed in the faith of remission of
sins, and of hope of eternal life. And he proveth this description, <hi>per partes,</hi>
by parts. 1. That is a Sacrament. 2. That it belongeth to those that pertain
to that Church, and that onely must be baptized, <hi>qui ecclesiam suerint
ingressi, ac fidem Evangelii prosessi,</hi> who are entred into the Church, and
have professed the faith of the Gospel. Which he proveth from <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16.

Christ commands them to be baptized, who have given up their names to the
Gospel, and have professed to be his Disciples, partly that baptism might be
to them a sign of eternal life before God, partly an external sign of Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men, and as God confirms his grace to us by this seal, so whosoever
offers himself to baptism, doth reciprocally engage his faith as it were by his
bond. And after [<hi>verum quia docere prius jubet Christus quam baptizare,
&amp; tantum credentes ad baptismum vult recipi, videtur non rite administrari
baptismus nisi fides pracesserit</hi>] But because Christ commands first to teach,
then to baptize, and onely will have believers to be received to baptism, it
seems that baptism is not rightly administred, unless faith doth precede. So
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100458:12"/>
that it is <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement, that this very Text which is the most notable
copy of the Apostolical commission for the baptizing of the Disciple nations
doth appoint that saving faith be professed before men be baptized. <hi>Paraeus
in locum,</hi> from <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. sheweth that the order is, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>redere &amp; baptizari,</hi>
to believe and to be baptized.</p>
            <p>I agree with him and the rest in the main, that justifying Faith
must be an act of the Will (embracing or accepting an offered Christ)
as well as of the understanding, and that the profession of it must go
before baptism.</p>
            <p>But I shall further prove the minor from some other texts of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi>
that they are not Christs Disciples that profess not saving Faith. <hi>Luke</hi> 14 26,
27, 33. [If any man come to me and hate not his Father and Mother, and
Wife and Children, and Brothers and Sisters; yea, and his own life also, he
cannot be my Disciple: and whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after
me, cannot be my Disciple: whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all
that he hath, cannot be my Disciple] This is spoken of true Disciples in heart
(the first <hi>significatum</hi>) by him that knew the heart. From whence I argue thus:</p>
            <p>[If none are Christs Disciples in heart, nor can be, but those that value
him above all, and will forsake all for him if he require it, then none can be
his Disciples by external profession, but those that profess to esteem him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, and to be willing to forsake all rather then forsake him: But the
former is proved by the Text; the consequence is clear, in that the world
hath hitherto been acquainted but with two sorts of Christians, or Disciples
of Christ; the one such sincerely in heart, and the other such by profession,
and the later are so called because they profess to be what the other are indeed,
and what themselves are if they sincerely so profess. And it is the same thing
professed which makes a man a professed Christian, which being found in
the heart doth make a man a hearty Christian. <hi>John</hi> 13. 35. [By this
shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye love one another] Here
Christ giveth a certain badge by which his true Disciples may be known. If
onely those that love one another are true Disciples in heart, then onely those
that profess to love one another are Disciples by profession. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 31. If ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in my word then are ye (that is you will approve your selves) my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
indeed]</p>
            <p>If onely those are Christs Disciples indeed as to the heart, that have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of perseverance, then onely those are his professed Disciples that profess
a resolution to persevere. But therefore all this I have said, is no more then
we have ever practised, when in baptism we renounced the world, flesh, and
devil, and promised to fight under Christs banner to our lives end.
Saith <hi>Piscator</hi> in <hi>John 13. 35. Si pro Christianis, id est, Christi Discipulis
haberi volumus, oportet ut nos mutuo quam ardentisaime diligamus, &amp;c.</hi> If we
will be accounted Christians, that is, Christs Disciples, we ought most ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to love one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Any one is a Disciple that is willing to learn of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No such matter: in an improper sense you may so call them, but
not in Scripture sense; where 1. A Disciple and a Christian are all one, <hi>Acts</hi>
11. 26. but every one that is willing to learn of Christ is not a Christian,
therefore not a Disciple. 2. A Disciple of Christ is one that will take him
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100458:12"/>
for the great prophet of the Church [which whosoever heareth not shall be
cut off from Gods people] and will learn of him as of the Christ: but so will
not all that will learn of him: for a man that taketh Christ but for a common
wise man, as <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> may be willing to learn of him: And so
may be his Disciple in another sense, but not in the Christian sense as
a Christian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 96. Argum.</hi> 8. We ought not to baptize those persons that do not so
much as profess their forsaking of the childhood and Kingdom of the Devil:
<hi>But no Infant doth profess its forsaking of the childhood and kingdom of the
Devil, as is manifest by sense, therefore we ought to baptize no Infant.</hi> The
maior is proved thus:</p>
            <p>If we must baptize none but for present admission into the Kingdom of
Christ, then we must baptize none but those that promise a present depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the Kingdom of the Devil; but the former is true, therefore so is
the later. The antecedent is granted by those that I have to do with; the
reason of the consequence is evident, in that all the world is divided into these
two kingdomes, and they are so opposite that there is no passing into one but
from the other. The minor of the first argument I prove thus. All they are
visiby in the kingdom of the Devil, or not so much as by profession removed
out of it, who profess not a removal from that condition in which the wrath
of God abideth on them, and they are excluded by the Gospel from everlasting
life, but such are all that profess not a justifying faith. The major is proved,
in that it is the condition of the covenant of grace performed that differenceth
the members of Christs Kingdom from Satans; and so it is that condition
profest to be performed that visibly differenceth them before men. It is the
promise of grace that bringeth them out of Satans Kingdome, therefore it is
onely done visibly to those that profess the performance of the condition:
moreover to be out of Satans Kingdom visibly, is to be visibly from under his
government, but those that profess not saving faith are not visibly from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his government.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to be visibly out of Satans Kingdom, is to be visibly freed from his
power, as the executioner of Gods eternal vengeance; but so are none that
profess not saving faith.</p>
            <p>The minor is proved from <hi>John</hi> 3. 36. Where it is plain, 1. That the
unbelief spoken of is that which is opposed to saving faith, even to that saith
which hath here the promise of everlasting life, 2. And that this leaves them
visibly under the wrath of God.</p>
            <p>So in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. compared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 19. In the later Christ bids
them make him Disciples, and in the former he describeth those that are such,
and those that remain still in the Kingdom of Satan [He that believeth and
is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned] Here it
is evident that the unbelief threatned is that which is contrary to [and even
the privation of] the faith that salvation is expresly promised to, and that all
that profess not this saving faith are not so much as professedly escaped a state
of damnation, and that this is the differencing character of Christs Disciples to
be baptized [of which yet more afterwards.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 98. Argum.</hi> 9. If it be the appointed use of all Christian baptism to
solemnize our mariage with Christ, or to seal or confirm our union with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100458:13"/>
him, or ingraffing into him, then must we baptize none that profess not
justifying faith [because this is necessarily prerequisite, and no other
can pretend to union, mariage or ingraffing into Christ] <hi>But no Infant doth
profess justifying Faith, as is manifest by sense; therefore we must baptize no
Infant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both the antecedent and consequent are evident in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27, 28, 29.
For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ:
Ye are all one in Christ Jesus, and if ye be Christs then are ye <hi>Abrahams</hi>
seed, and heirs according to promise. Here 1. we see that it is not an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
or separable thing for baptism to be our visible entrance into Christ,
our putting him on, our admittance (by solemnization) into the state of
Gods children and heirs according to promise. For this is affirmed of all the
baptized with true Christian baptism. If we be truely baptized, we are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
into Christ, if we are baptized into Christ, then we are Christs, and
have put on Christ, and are all one in Christ, and are <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, and
heirs according to promise. If any object that the Apostle speaks this but of
some of them, even of the regenerate, because he saith [as many of you] I
answer,</p>
            <p>It is manifest that he speaks of all, 1. because it was of all them that were
baptized into Christ, 2. he expresly saith as much in the next foregoing words
[<hi>ver.</hi> 26. For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus] To which
the words recited are annexed as the proof [for as many of you as have been
baptized into Christ, have put on Christ] the assumption is implied [but
you have all been baptized into Christ] therefore ye have all put on Christ, and
so in him are all the children of God. 2. Note that they are the special gifts of
saving grace that are here ascribed to all the baptized. 3. Note also that all this
is said and proved to be by faith. 4. Note also that it is expresly said to be a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
faith, before <hi>vers.</hi> 24. [that we might be justified by faith.] Indeed
this text affordeth us divers Arguments. 1. The Apostle supposeth all the
baptized to profess a justifying faith, among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> therefore so
must we suppose of others, and expect that they do it. The antecedent is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from <hi>vers.</hi> 24, 25, and 27. compared. 2. All the baptized are said to have
put on Christ, therefore they are supposed to profess that faith by which
Christ is put on: But that is onely justfying faith. 3. All that are duely
baptized are baptized into Christ, therefore they are supposed to profess that
faith by which men are united, or ingraffed into Christ, but that is onely
justifying faith; but the rest of the Arguments here will be further touched

            <p>Master <hi>Rutherford</hi> saith that Scripture no where calleth Christ the head of
the visible Church as such, as it is after cited.</p>
            <p>I conclude then that Christ hath app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inted no baptism but what is for a
visible mariage of the soul to himself (as <hi>Protestants</hi> ordinarily confess)
Therefore he hath appointed no baptism but for those that profess to take Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ for their Husband, and to give up themselves to him as his espouse:
but this is a profession of justifying faith, for heartily to take Christ for our
head and husband is true saving faith, and proper to his own regenerate pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
if any thing in the world be so; and no man can profess to be maried to
Christ that doth not profess to take him for a husband. Therefore for my part
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100458:13"/>
I never intend to baptize any without profession of saving faith, <hi>Amen. And
let the Lord God say so too, that Mr.</hi> B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xter <hi>may baptize no more Infants, nor
defend so palpable an abuse, but may wipe away the reproach he hath cast on Gods
people and ordinance: He goes on thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 100. Argum.</hi> 10. If <hi>Paul</hi> account all the baptized Saints or Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
men dead with Christ and risen with him, such as have put on Christ,
sons of God by adoption, <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, heirs according to promise and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified;
then they did all profess a true justifying faith. <hi>But no Infant did
profess a true justifying faith: if they did let it be sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The antecedent Master <hi>Blake</hi> confesseth, and I shall prove it by parts.
The consequence is that which lyeth chiefly on me to prove, and I shall do
both together.</p>
            <p>The Apostle in the beginning of his Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other places calls the whole Church Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. He saith to them
[but ye are washed, ye are sanctified] That part of the antecedent then is
certain; the consequene I prove thus.</p>
            <p>There are none called Saints in all the New Testament, but onely such
as were in heart devoted to Christ by a saving faith, or professed so much, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the word Saint in this case must signifie onely such. If any will prove a
third sort of Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> such as profess a faith not saving, they must do that
which I never saw done.</p>
            <p>The first and most famous signification of the word Saints or Sanctified
in the New Testament, is onely of them that are in heart devoted to Christ
by true faith; therefore the borrowed, or Analogical, or less proper significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(call it what you list) must be of that which hath the likeness or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of this, and that is onely the profession of it. Profession maketh
Saints visible, or by profession, as hearty dedication to God by faith maketh
real or heart Saints.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Blake</hi> addeth [we read of Churches of the Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33.
And they were taken to be Church-members as soon as they made profession,
as they ceased to be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> and took them to the way of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
as we see, <hi>Acts 2. Acts</hi> 8. 12. 13. 38.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They renounced the way of ungodliness, and wickedness in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
by a profession of repentance, as well as the way of <hi>Paganism</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism</hi>
in particular. There were no Christians that professed not repentance
towards God from dead works 2. We believe that there were Churches of the
Saints, and therefore that none should be of the Church that profess not to
be true Saints. But prove if you can that there was ever either Church or
Church-member called Saints in Scripture, that had not either special san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
or a profession of it. And as for those <hi>Acts</hi> 8. you cannot prove that any
of them were either called Saints or baptized without a profession of a justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
faith: as shall further be shewed afterwards. The <hi>Galatians</hi> I find
not called Saints, but to call them a Church of Christ or believers is
equipollent: and what Saints were they? Why they were all the sons of God
by faith in Christ Jesus, having been baptized into Christ, and put him on,
and were all one in him, and were all <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed and heirs according to the
promise, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26, 27, 29. A Church in Scripture sense, is a society of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100458:14"/>
men professing true saving faith. And thus we see what a Church was, and
what Saints were, and what believers and Disciples were supposed to be by
the Apostles, and what is the signification of these words in Scripture, for
they are all of the same extent. Thus much I have said to prove that all the
baptized are accounted Saints, and therefore professed a saving Sanctity.</p>
            <p>The second title which I mentioned follows (of which I shall be more
brief) All the baptized are accounted to be dead and risen with Christ, even
dead to sin, and risen to newness of life; therefore they all profess a saving
faith. The proof of this is full in the two Texts already cited, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. and
<hi>Col. 2. 11, 12. Rom. 6. 3. &amp;c.</hi> How shall we that are dead to sin live any
longer therein? Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus
Christ, were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by
baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the
glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have
been planted together into the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the
likeness of his resurection, knowing this that our old man is crucified with
him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that hence forth we should not
serve sin; for he that is dead is freed from sin.</p>
            <p>Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.</p>
            <p>Likewise, reckon ye also your selves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive
unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Here is a full report of the use of
baptism, and the profession of all that are baptized, and the state they are
supposed to be in. So that I cannot speak it plainlyer then the words themselves
do. So <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. which I shall not stay to recite, because it is to the same
purpose, and before cited.</p>
            <p>The third title mentioned in the argument is this: All that are baptized
have professedly put on Christ; therefore they have professed saving faith.
The Antecedent is expressed <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23. [for as many as have been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
into Christ have put on Christ] the consequence is proved in that to
put on Christ heartily, is to be made true partakers of him, and living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of him, therefore to profess this is inseperable from the profession of saving
faith; yea by that faith he is truly put on. Putting on Christ is the same
with [putting on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness
and true holiness, being renewed in the Spirit of our minds, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 20,
21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. It is putting on the new man which is renewed in
knowledge according to the image of him that created him] and putting on
the Lord Jesus Christ is put for the state of Sanctity in opposition to a flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Saith <hi>Calvin</hi> on this Text [<hi>induere Christum bic significat virtute spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus
ejus undique nos muniri, qua idonei ad omnes sanctitatis partes red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damur:
sic enim in nobis instauratur imago Dei quae unicum est animae orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum.
Respicit enim Paulus ad vocationis nostrae finem, quia Deus nos ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptans
in corpus unigenti filii sui inserit, &amp; quidem hac lege, ut nos abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes
priore vita fiamus in ipso novi homines. Quare etiam alibi fideles
dicit Christum induere in baptismo,</hi> Gal. 3. 27.] To put on Christ signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
here to be defended in all points with the virtue of the Spirit, whereby we
may be fit for all parts of holiness, for thus the image of God is renewed in us,
which is the onely ornament of the soul, for <hi>Paul</hi> hath respect to the end
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100458:14"/>
of our vocation, because God adopting us, hath ingraffed us in the body of
his onely begotten Son, and that upon those terms, if we deny our former life,
and become new men in him: wherefore he saith elsewhere, that believers put
on Christ in baptism. Aud upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. he saith [<hi>Quum dicit, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum
induisse, intelligit Christo sic esse infitos; ut coram Deo nomen ac per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonam
Christi gerant, ac in ipso magis quam in seipsis censcantur.</hi> When he
saith they have put on Christ, he understands that they are so ingraffed in
Christ, that they carry that name and person of Christ in the sight of God,
and are rather reckoned in him, then in themselves. And he comes to the
objection, How all that are baptized can be said to put on Christ, when bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
is not effectual with all? And he answereth in summe, That to Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
it is uneffectual, <hi>qui nudis signis superbiunt,</hi> who are proud with
the bare signs. But then he saith, that the Apostle speaking of these <hi>non res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicit
Dei institutionem, sed impiorum corruptelam.</hi> He hath no respect to
Gods institution, but to the corruption of the wicked. (But doubtless it is
Gods institution that we must look to in our administration) <hi>Qaum autem
fideles alloquitur, qui rite utuntur illa, tunc conjungit cum sua veritate, quam
figurant. Quare? neque enim fallacem pompam ostentat in sacramentis, sed
quae externa caremonia figurat, exhibet simul reipsa. Hinc fit, ut veritas, secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
Dei institutum, conjuncta sit cum signis</hi>] But when he speaks to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
who use it rightly, he joyns them with their truth, which they typifie.
Wherefore? for he doth not make shew of a deceitful pomp in the Sacraments,
but what the external ceremony figures, he exhibites together in very deed.
Hence it comes to pass that truth, according to Gods institution, is joyned with
the signs. To the same purpose say other <hi>Protestants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next title mentioned in the Argument was, Sons of God. All that
are baptized are the visible or esteemed sons of God by saith in Christ; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they all profess that justifying faith to which that real or special sonship is
promised. The antecedent is expressed in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 26, 27. [For ye are all the
sons of God by saith in Christ Jesus] which he proveth in the next words
[For as many as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ] What
Sons of God are in Scripture sense may be seen, <hi>John 1. 12. Rom. 8. 14, 15.
Phil. 2. 15. 2 John 3. 1, 2. Gal.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 5, 7. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. [if sons, then
heirs, heirs of God, and joynt heirs with Christ] was a good consequence
in <hi>Pauls</hi> judgement [In this (saith <hi>John</hi>) the children of God are manifest
from the children of the Devils: Whosoever doth not righteousness is not of
God, neither he that loveth not his brother, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 10. See also <hi>John
11. 52. Rom.</hi> 8. 16. 21.</p>
            <p>But Master <hi>Blake</hi> objecteth <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. [To them pertained the adoption]
and <hi>Gomarus</hi> his comment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. 1. Gomarus</hi> saith not, that any were in either sense Sons of God
without a profession of a saving faith. 2. It was not after their unchurching or
unbelief, that the adoption is said to pertain to them, but before, and then,
let Master <hi>Blake</hi> prove [if he can] that any <hi>Israelites</hi> were adopted without
profession of that faith, which was then saving: I doubt not to prove the
contrary anon. And 3. If he could prove that such there were among the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi>
yet he will never prove that they are called Sons, though the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were; because the denomination was principally from the true Sons, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100458:15"/>
next from the professed ones: None are visibly sons that be not visibly
true believers.</p>
            <p>The next title mentioned in the Argument is [<hi>Abrahams</hi> seed] All
that are baptized are called <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 19. Therefore
they all profess a justifying faith. The consequence is proved, in that none
are <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed in Gospel sense, but those cordially that are true believers,
and those appearingly that profess true faith. This is proved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4, 6, 7.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. [that he might be the Father of all them that believe, that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
might be imputed to them also] this therefore is a justifying faith,
and the priviledge of the justified that is here mentioned. Its added <hi>vers.</hi> 12,
13. [And the Father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but also walk in the steps of the faith of our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> yet uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised.
For the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
or his seed by the Law, but by the righteousness of faith—Therefore
it is of faith that it might be by grace, to the end the promise might be sure to
all the seed, even to that also which is of the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of
us all.]</p>
            <p>So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9. [Even as <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, and it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to him for righteousness: Know ye therefore that they which are of
saith, the same are the children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> And the Scripture fore-seeing
that God would justifie the Heathen by faith preached before the Gospel to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi>
In thee shall all nations be blessed. So then, they which be of saith
are blessed with saithful <hi>Abraham</hi>] So <hi>vers.</hi> 14. 16. [That the blessing of
<hi>Abraham</hi> might come on the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> through Jesus Christ, that we might
receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. Now to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his
seed were the promises made; he saith not, and to seeds as of many, but as of
one; and to thy seed, which is Christ, and so to those that are in him. It
is hence most undeniable, that all <hi>Abrahams</hi> true seed are justified, and
have a justifying faith; and all his professing seed do profess this
faith.</p>
            <p>The next title mentioned in the Argument is, [Heirs according to the
promise.] All the baptized were heirs according to the promise: None that
profess not a justifying faith are heirs according to the promise (either really or
appearingly) therefore none that profess not a justifying faith should be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
the major is expressed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 19. the minor (of which is
all the doubt) is proved from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. where there is an express concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of [children, heirs of God, coheirs with Christ, that suffering with
him shall be glorified with him] <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1, 6, 7. The heir is Lord of all and
a Son, and therefore hath the Spirit of the Son, by which they cry <hi>Abba</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7. [According to his mercy he saved us by the washing of
regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost which he shed on us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
being Justified by his Grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope
of eternal life] The heirs then are regenerate, justified, and have the hope of
eternal life. So <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 6. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> being made fellow-heirs, and of
the same body are partakers of the promise in Christ by the Gospel, even the
unsearchable riches of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17. The heirs of promise have their
salvation confirmed by Gods oath. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. they are called the heirs
of salvation. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. 9. It is true justified believers that have that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100458:15"/>
title, and <hi>James</hi> 2. 7. [They are called heirs of the promised Kingdom]
and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. they are called coheirs [of the same grace of life] So that
to be heirs in the first and proper notion is to be Sons that have title to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of glory: and therefore to be heirs in the second analogical notion
is to be such as seem such by profession of that Faith which hath the promise
of that glory.</p>
            <p>The last title that I mentioned in the Argument was [Justified] <hi>Paul</hi>
calleth all the baptized Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> Justified; None that profess not
a justified Faith are called Justified, therefore none such should be baptized.
The major I proved to Master <hi>Blake</hi> out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. [Ye are washed, ye
are sanctified, ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of our God.]</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Blake</hi> doth not at all deny the major or the sense of the Text alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to prove it; but darkly in generals intimateth a denial of the minor, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
passing over that particular title [justified] as if he durst not be seen
to take notice of it. I confess its sad that good men should be so unfaithful to
the truth, which is so precious, and is not their own, and which they should
do nothing against (<hi>as Master</hi> Baxter <hi>hath done</hi>) but all they can
for it.</p>
            <p>Having gon thus far about titles, let me add another; the title [Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate]
Christ hath instituted no baptism, but what is to be a sign of present
regeneration. But to men that profess not a justifying faith it cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
as a sign of present regeneration; therefore he hath instituted no
baptism to be administred to such.</p>
            <p>The major I have proved already in the first Argument, and its plain in
<hi>John</hi> 3. 5. Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter
into the Kingdom of God] And so in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. where it is called the laver
of [regeneration] In both which though I am of their minde that think
that the sign is put for the thing signified; yet it may thence plainly appear
what is the thing signified, even regeneration, or the new birth: Yea so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
was this acknowledged by all the Church of Christ, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more common in the writings of the Fathers then to take the terms [re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
illuminate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and baptized] as signifying the same thing, or at
least spoken of the same person, which occasioned one of our late Antiquaries
so stifly to plead that regeneration in Scripture signifyeth meer baptism, and
that all the baptized are regenerate.</p>
            <p>I grant that it oft falls out that baptism being misapplied sealeth not rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
at present, and that the same person may afterward be regenerate,
and his remembred baptism may be of use to him for the confirmation of his
faith. But this is not the institutes commanded use of it, to be so admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
at first, if the party profess not saving faith, though this review of it is
a duty, where it was so abused at first. The minor I shall take for granted,
while regeneration in Scripture stands so connexed to salvation; I
know no regenerate ones, but the justified, or those that profess to have a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
faith, nor hath he proved any more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 118. Argum.</hi> 11. All that are meet subjects for baptism, (are after
their baptism without any further inward qualification, at least without any
other species of saith) meet subjects for the Lords Supper: <hi>But no Infant
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100458:16"/>
is a meet subject for the Lords Supper, as is acknowledged, therefore no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
is a meet subject for baptism:</hi> Or thus, Those whom we may baptize,
we may also admit to the Lords Supper: <hi>But we may admit no Infants to
the Lords Supper, as is acknowledged by baptizers of Infants, therefore we
may baptize no Infants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The major Master <hi>Blake</hi> will easily grant me, and if any other deny it I
prove it thus.</p>
            <p>1. It is the same covenant that both Sacrament seal, one for initiation the
other for confirmation and growth in grace; therefore the same saith that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth
for the one, doth sufficiently qualifie for the other, for the same covenant
hath the same condition.</p>
            <p>2. They are the same benefits that are conferred in baptism and the Lords
Supper to the worthy receiver. Therefore the same qualification is necessary
for the reception: The antecedents is commonly granted. Baptism uniteth to
Christ, and giveth us himself first, and with himself the pardon of all past
sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lords Supper by confirmation giveth us the same things;
it is the giving of Christ himself, who saith by his Minister, Take, Eat,
Drink; offering himself to us under the signs, and commanding us to take
himself by faith, as we take the signs by the outward parts. He giveth us the
pardon of sin, sealed and procured by his body broken, and his blood
shed.</p>
            <p>3. A member of Christs Church, against whom no accusation may be
brought from some contradiction of his first profession, must be admitted to
the Lords Supper; but the new baptized may be ordinarily such: therefore
if he can but say, I am a baptized person, he hath a sufficient principal title
to the Lords Supper, <hi>Coram Ecclesia,</hi> before the Church. [I mean such as
we must admit] though some actual preparation be necessary, unless he be
proved to have disabled his claim on that account either by nulling
and reverting that profession, or by giving just cause of questioning
it.</p>
            <p>4. The Church hath ever from the Apostles dayes till now without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
admitted the new baptized at age to the Lords Supper, without requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any new species of faith to intitle them to it. I take the major therefore
as past denial: I must confess as much as I am against separation, I never
intend to have communion with Master <hi>Blakes</hi> congregation, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
not saving repentance and faith, And if he exact not such a profession,
I say still he makes foul work in the Church, and when such foul work
shall be voluntarily maintained, and the word of God abused for the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, and ordinances of God, it is a greater scandal to the
weak and to the schismsticks, and a greater reproach to the Church, and sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
case to considerate men, then the too common pollutions of
others, which are meerly through negligence, but not justified and
defended.</p>
            <p>Let Master <hi>Baxters</hi> own words judge him, who makes the same foul work
in the Ordinance of baptism by admitting Infants to it upon a Parents or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parents
(as he terms them) profession, when all his proofs of the necessity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
to go before baptism are of the profession of the party himself to be baptized,
and this device of a Parents or Proparents profession instead of the Infants, is his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100458:16"/>
own invention that hath not any intimation in Scripture, and by his own proofs
makes Infants capable of the Lords Supper, and perverts the nature of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which his own words do fully express, thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 123, 124. The first Argument of Master <hi>Gillespies</hi> 20. is from the
nature of Sacraments, which are to signifie that we have already faith in
Christ, remission of sin by him, and union with him. The sense of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is, That seeing Sacraments, (according to Christs institution) are
confirming signs presupposing the thing signified both on our part and on
Gods; therefore none should use them that have not first the thing signified
by them. Though I undertake not to defend all the Arguments that other
men use in this case, yet this doth so much concern the cause of baptism,
which I am now debating, that I shall give you this reply to it. What Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
are there that deny the Sacraments to be mutual signs, and seals signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
our part as well as Gods? And how ill do you wrong the Church of

If it be so to you, it is a pity that it is so; but sure you have seen Master <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi>'s
Books against Doctor <hi>Ward,</hi> and <hi>Davenant,</hi> wherein you have mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of sentences recited out of our <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines, that affi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m this
which you call new.</p>
            <p>It is indeed their most common Doctrine, that the Sacrament doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose
remission of sins, and our faith, and that they are instituted to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
these as in being.</p>
            <p>It is the common <hi>Protestant</hi> Doctrine, that Sacraments do solemnize and
publickly own and confirm the mutual covenant already entred in heart,
as a King is Crowned, a Souldier Listed, a Man and Woman maried after
professed consent: So that the sign is causal as to the consummation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
(as a Key or Twig and Turff in giving possession) but consequential
to the contract as privately made, and the right given thereby; so that the
soul is supposed to consent to have Christ as offered first [which is saving faith]
and then by receiving him Sacramentally delivered, to make publick profession
of that consent, and publickly to receive his sealed remission. Master <hi>Cobbet</hi>
[cited by you] might well say, that primarily the Sacrament is Gods seal;
but did he say that it is onely his, and not secondarily ours? And in the
next words you do in effect own part of the Doctrine your self, which you have
thus wondered at, as new and strange, saying; [I confess it is a Symbol of
our profession of faith.</p>
            <p>If you mean as you speak [taking profession properly] then 1. you yield
that the Sacrament is our symbol, and so declareth or signifieth our action as
well as Gods. 2. And it is not onely a sign of our profession, but a professing
sign, and therefore a sign of the thing professed; for the external sign is to
declare the internal acts of the mind, whi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The Fourth Argument of Master <hi>Gillespy</hi> is from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
was a seal of that righteousness of faith; therefore so is baptism, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it belongeth onely to justified believers. He that maketh it the instituted
nature or use of circumcision to be a seal of righteousness of faith, which
the person had before, doth make his circumcision a proof of his foregoing
righteousness of faith.</p>

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 133. You cannot shew where ever the wicked are commanded to
communicate with the Church in the Sacrament, but in this order; First
to be converted and repent, and so baptized, and so communicate, <hi>Gillespy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arons</hi>
rod blossoming, <hi>pag.</hi> 514, 515. The assumption [that baptism it self is
not a regenerating ordinance] I prove thus.</p>
            <p>1. Because we read of no Persons baptized by the Apostles, except such as
did profess faith in Christ, gladly received the word, and in whom some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
work of the Spirit of grace did appear (I say not that it really was in all,
but somewhat of it did appear in all.) Baptism even of the aged must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
precede the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 144. My Twelfth Argument is from <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 12. [Friend, how
camest thou in hither, not having on a wedding garment? and he was speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less]
To [come in hither] is [to come into the Church of Christ.] By
the wedding garment is undoubtedly meant, sincerity of true faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
so that I may hence argue:</p>
            <p>If God will accuse and condemn men for coming into his Church, or the
communion of Saints without sincere faith and repentance, then it is not the
appointed use of baptism to initiate those that profess not sincere faith and
repentance. <hi>But Infants profess not sincere faith and repentance, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
by sense, therefore it is not the appointed use of baptism to initiate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 145. The Thirteenth Argument is this: We must baptize none that
profess not themselves Christians; <hi>But no Infants profess themselves</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
<hi>as is manifest by sense, therefore we must baptize no Infants.</hi> The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
is certain, because it is the use of baptism to be our solemn listing sign into
Christs Army, our, initiating sign, and the solemnization of our mariage
to Christ, and professing sign that we are Christians, and we do in it dedicate
and deliver up our selves to him in this relation as his own. So that in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
we do not onely promise to be Christians, but profess that we are so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in heart, and now would be solemnly admitted among the number of
Christians; the minor I prove thus.</p>
            <p>1. No man is truely a Christian that is not truly a Disciple of Christ
[that is plain <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 26.] No man is truly a Disciple of Christ that doth
not profess a saving faith and repentance, therefore no man that doth not so
profess is truly a Christian. The minor I prove thus: No man is truly a
Disciple of Christ that doth not profess to forsake all contrary Masters, or
Teachers, and to take Christ for his chief Teacher, consenting to learn of
him the way to salvation: but no man maketh this profession that professeth
not saving faith and repentance; Therefore no man that professeth not saving
faith and repentance is truly a Disciple of Christ.</p>
            <p>The major is evident in the nature of the relation, the minor is as evident,
in that it is an act of saving Faith and repentance to forsake other Teachers,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100458:17"/>
and to take Christ for our sole or chief teacher in order to salvation. 2. No man
is truly a Christian that professeth not to take Christ for his Lord and King,
forsaking his Enemies: But no man doth this but the professors of a saving
faith. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. No man is a true Christian that professeth not to
take Christ for his Redeemer, who hath made propitiation for sin by his blood,
and to esteem his blood as the Ransom for sinners, and to trust therein; but
none do this but the professors of saving faith, therefore none else are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
The major of all these three Arguments is further proved thus:</p>
            <p>No man is professedly a Christian that professeth not to accept of Christ as
Christ [or to believe in Christ as Christ] but no man doth profess to take
Christ as Christ, that professeth not to take or accept him as his Priest,
Teacher and King; therefore. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The major is plain in it self: the minor
is as plain, it being essential to Christ to be the Priest, Prophet, and King,
and from these essentials related to us and accepted by us, doth our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
of Christians arise, and that a bare assent without acceptance
doth not make any one a Christian is past doubt, and shall be further spoken
to anon.</p>
            <p>If baptism then be commonly called our Christening, and so be our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
solemnly into the Christian state, then is it not to be given to them
that are not so much as Christians by profession. And furthermore if a Faith
defective in the assenting part about the essentials of its object, serve not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate
a man justly a Christian, then a Faith defective in the consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or accepting part above the essentials of the object serveth not to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
a man a Christian; but the antecedent is true, therefore so is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent.
The antecedent is proved, because else the <hi>Turks</hi> are <hi>Christians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they believe so many and so great things of Christ; and else a man
might be a Christian that denied Christs death, or resurrection, or other
essentials of Christianity. The consequence is good, for Christianity is as
truly and necessarily in the will as in the understanding; consent is as essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
an act of covenanting as any. So that I may conclude that as he is no
Christian that professeth not to believe that Christ is the Priest, Prophet, and
King, so he is no Christian that professeth not to consent and accept him for
his Priest, Prophet, and King.</p>
            <p>The fourteenth Argument is this: Our Divines ordinarily charge wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men with contradiction of profession which is made in baptism, and they
expound many places of Scripture, which the <hi>Arminians</hi> take as favouring
their cause, to be meant according to the profession of wicked men. <hi>But it
chargeth not such contradiction on persons baptized in Infancy, therefore it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
no profession or baptism of theirs:</hi> and if we must baptize none that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
not saving faith and repentance, <hi>we must not baptize Infants, who make
no profession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 177. Argum.</hi> 15. If all that are baptized must engage themselves to
believe presently (in the next instant) yea, or at any time hereafter, with
a saving faith, then must they profess at present a saving faith; or if we must
baptize none that will not ingage to believe savingly, then must we baptize
none that will not profess a saving faith; <hi>But no Infant will profess a saving
faith, as is manifest by reason and experience, therefore we must baptize no
Infant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100458:18"/>
The antecedent is Master <hi>Blakes</hi> Doctrine; who affirmeth, That it is
not necessary that they that come to baptism do profess a present saving faith,
but its sufficient that they engage themselves to believe by such a faith. The
consequence is proved thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>1. It is not the beginning of saving faith which we are to engage our selves
to in the Sacraments, but the continuance, therefore the beginning is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed
in that engagement, and so we must no more baptize without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of faith in present, then without an engagement to believe hereafter;
the antecedent is proved thus;</p>
            <p>There is no one word in Scripture either of precept or example where any
person in baptism doth engage, or is required to engage to begin to believe
with a saving faith, or to believe with a faith which at present he hath not.
Shew but one word of Scripture to prove this (if you can) if you cannot, I
may conclude, that therefore we must not require that which we have no
Scripture ground to require.</p>
            <p>Let Master <hi>Baxter</hi> shew but one word in Scripture to prove this (if
he can) that any person in baptism doth engage or is required to believe,
or profess to believe that another, an Infant may be admitted to baptism
by virtue of it; if he cannot, I may conclude, that therefore we must
not require that which we have no Scripture ground to require, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any Infant or other, by reason of a Parents, Proparents, or sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
profession or promise to believe for an Infant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 149. Argum.</hi> 16. If there can be no example given in Scripture of
any one that was baptized without the profession (<hi>and that his own, by his
own self and no other Parents, Proparent or surety</hi>) of a saving faith, nor any
precept for so doing, then must not we baptize any without it; <hi>but,</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
is true, therefore so is the consequent, <hi>and therefore we must baptize
no Infant, who makes no such profession, as all examples in Scripture of
any baptized are of, and every precept for baptism requires.</hi> Let us review the
Scripture examples of baptism, which might afford us so many several Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but that I shall put them together for brevity.</p>
            <p>1. I have already shewed that <hi>John</hi> required the profession of true repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
(<hi>by the baptized himself</hi>) and that his baptism was for remission of
sin.</p>
            <p>2. When Christ layeth down in the Apostolical commission, the nature
and order of his Apostles work, it is first to make them Disciples, and then
to baptize them into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and as
it is a making Disciples, which is first expressed in <hi>Matth.</hi> so <hi>Mark</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
who those Disciples are by patting believing before baptism, and that we
may know that it is a justifying faith (<hi>of the Disciple himself</hi>) that he meaneth,
he annexeth first baptism, and then the promise of salvation, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19.
<hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. [He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. This is not
like some occasional mention of baptism, but its the very commission of
Christ to his Apostles for preaching and baptism, and purposely expresseth
their several works in their several places and order. Their first task is to make
Disciples, which are by <hi>Mark</hi> called believers. The second work is to baptize
them, whereto is annexed the promise of their salvation. The third work is
to teach them all other things, which are afterward to be learned in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100458:18"/>
School of Christ. To contemn this order (<hi>as Master</hi> Baxter <hi>doth in Infant
baptism</hi>) is to contemn all rules of order: For where can we expect to find it,
if not here? I profess my conscience is fully satisfied from this Text, that it
is one sort of faith, even saving, that must go before baptism, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
whereof (<hi>by the Party himself to be baptized; He that believeth and
is baptized, not another then the believer, make Disciples and baptize them,
not others then the Disciples made</hi>) the Minister must expect, of which see
what is before cited out of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>scator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall be amazed reading this passage, at the blindness of Master <hi>Baxter,</hi> if
he see not how unanswerably his own words overthrow Infant baptism, or his hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
if being satisfied, as he saith, in conscience of his own exposition he do
not deny Infant baptism, and bewail his alledging of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. in his Book termed, <hi>Plain Scripture proof of Infants baptism, Part. 1. chap.</hi> 3. And
I pray God to deliver me from such hardness of heart, be adds,</p>
            <p>That it was saving faith that was required of the <hi>Jews</hi> and professed by
them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 41, 48. is shewed already, and is plain in the Text. <hi>Acts</hi>
8. The <hi>Samaritans</hi> believed and had great joy, and were baptized into the
name of Jesus Christ, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. 12. whereby it appeareth that it was both the
understanding and will that were both changed, and that they had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of a saving faith (even <hi>Simon</hi> himself) <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. The condition
on which the <hi>Eunuch</hi> must be baptized was [if he believed with all his heart;]
which he professed to do, and that was the evidence that <hi>Philip</hi> did expect.
<hi>Paul</hi> was baptized after true conversion, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 18. The Holy Ghost fell on
the <hi>Gentiles, Acts</hi> 10. 44. before they were baptized, and they magnified
God. And this Holy Ghost was the like gift as was given to the Apostles,
who believed on the Lord Jesus; and it was accompanied with repentance
unto life, <hi>Acts 11. 17, 18. Acts 16. 14, 15. Lydia</hi>'s heart was opened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she was baptized, and she was one that the Apostles [judged faithful to
the Lord] and offered to them the evidence of her faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30, 31,
33, 34. The example of the Jaylour is very full to the resolution of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
in hand.</p>
            <p>He first asketh what he should do to be saved; the Apostle answereth him;
[Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved and thy house] so that it
was a saving faith that is here mentioned. He rejoyced and believed with all
his house, and was baptized that same hour of the night, or straightway.
It is here evident that he professed that same faith which <hi>Paul</hi> required, <hi>Acts</hi>
18. 8. [<hi>Crispus</hi> the chief Ruler of the Synagogue believed on the Lord with
all his house<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and many of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> hearing, believed and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized]
Here we have two proofs that it is saving faith that is mentioned,
Those in <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 5. were baptized as believers in Jesus Christ. In a word,
I know of no one word in Scripture that giveth us the least intimation that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
man was baptized without the profession of a saving faith. There is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
this order in the prescribed duty, that no man should seek baptism but
a true believer, and no man should baptize any but those that profess this true
belief, <hi>Acts 8. 37. Philip</hi> is determining a question, and giveth this in as
the decision [If thou believe with all thy heart thou mayest] And to say
that this is but <hi>de bene esse,</hi> meaning that it includeth not the negative,
[otherwise thou mayest not] is to make <hi>Philip</hi> to have deluded and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100458:19"/>
or resolved. Use that liberty in expounding all other Scripture, and you'l
make it what you please. A Dogmatical faith is not the Christian faith, nor
any where alone denominateth men believers in Scripture. I remember but
one Text, <hi>John</hi> 12. 42. where it is called believing on Christ; and but few
more where it is simply called believing, but none where such are called belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
Disciples or Christians, or any thing that intimateth them, admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the visible Church without the profession of saving faith. I conclude that
all examples in Scripture do mention onely the administration of it to the
professors of saving faith, and the precepts give us no other direction; and I
provoke Master <hi>Blake</hi> (as far as is seemly for me to do) to name one precept
or example for any other, and make it good, if he can.</p>
            <p>I conclude that all examples of baptism in Scripture do mention onely the
administration of it to the same persons who in their own persons were profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of saving faith; and the precepts give us no other direction. And I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter (as far as is seemly for me to do) to name one precept or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
for baptizing any other, and make it good, if he can, and if not, by his
own reason he ought to baptize no other, but must reject baptism of Infants
who do not in their own persons profess saving faith, and give over his vain
Plea of Parents or Proparents profession of saving faith, as entituling Infants to
baptism, which (unless his violence and wilfulness of spirit blind him) his own
words and arguments will inforce to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 156. Argum.</hi> 17. is from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. [The like figure whereto
even baptism doth also now save us: Not the putting away the filth of the
flesh, but the answer of a good Conscience toward God] whence I thus Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue:</p>
            <p>If baptism be appointed for our solemn admission into a state of salvation,
as <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark received men into a state of safety from the Deluge, then none
should be baptized but those that profess that faith which entereth them into
a state of salvation; <hi>but no Infant professeth that faith which entereth them
into a state of salvation, as is manifest by sense and reason, therefore no Infant
should be baptized.</hi> Here it is implied plainly that this is <hi>quoad finem institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entis,</hi>
as to the end of him that instituted it, the common appointed of baptism,
which the Text mentioneth, though eventually it prove not the common ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
through the errours of the receivers: and this appeareth, 1. In that it
was spoken plainly in the text of the very nature and appointed use of baptism,
and so of baptism as baptism, without any exception, limitation, or distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Therefore it is not spoken of any different use that it is appointed for
to the elect, as distinct from its common use to others. Its spoken of that
signification and common use to which baptism is appointed, <hi>viz.</hi> to save,
else we shall never be able to understand the use of it, or any ordinance from
Scripture, if we shall take liberty to say [It is this to one, but not to another]
when the Scripture saith no such thing, but speaks of the nature and use of it
without distinction. Else when it saith, [circumcision is a seal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of faith] we may say with the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> it was so to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
but not to all others [And when the Lords Supper is said to be appointed for
the remembrance of Christ] we may say, That is but to some, and not to
others, when as the Text plainly speaks of the stated use of the ordinances to
all. 2 And in the type it is clear; for it was not some onely, but all that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100458:19"/>
               <hi>Noabs</hi> Ark, that entered into a state of salvation from the Deluge; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
so it is here as to the commanded use. 2. When baptism is said to save
us, its plainly meant of the state of salvation that baptism entereth us into
and not of baptism <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by the work done, effecting our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And so baptism comprehendeth the state into which we are solemnly by it
initiated. As a woman that is maried to an Honourable man, or a Souldier listed
under an Honourable Commander, is said to be honoured, the one by mariage,
the other by listing. Where antecedent consent is the foundation on both
sides of the honourable relations, and the subsequent state is the condition or
state it self which is honourable, but the solemn signation is but the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the former, and passage to the later.</p>
            <p>3. Hereby it is apparent, that though the answer of a good conscience be
the principal thing intended, and that saveth, yet the external baptism is here
included as the sign and solemnization, so that when the Apostle saith [not
the putting away of the filth of the flesh] he means [not the bare outward
act of washing alone, or as such] but baptism as it is entire, having the
thing professed on ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> part, together with the professing sign.</p>
            <p>4. It is therefore but by way of signification, obsignation and complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
exhibition, that baptism saveth, it being neither the fast or principal
efficient or condition of it, but is valued as it is conjunct with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
causes and condition for the attainment of these ends.</p>
            <p>5. It is not a meer remote means leading towards a state of salvation that
baptism is here affirmed to be, but an enterance or means of entrance into
that state of salvation it self. As the heart-covenant or faith doth it principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so baptism signally and complementally. This is plain. 1. Because it
is not said to help us towards a state of salvation, but expresly to save. 2.
Because the type which is here mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ark, was such a means,
that all that entered into it for preservation from the Flood were actually sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from it.</p>
            <p>All this laid together doth confirm both the antecedent and consequence,
of my Argument. <hi>Calvins</hi> words on the Text signifie, 1. that no baptized
men are excluded from salvation but Hypocrites. 2. That they that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from salvation for all their baptism are such as did dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave and corrupt
it, and not justly use it.</p>
            <p>Yet another Argument may hence be raised, thus. <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If, according
to the institution, the answer of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ood conscience must be joyned with bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
for the attaining of its end, then we must admit none that profess not
that answer of a good conscience: <hi>But no Infant doth profess that answer of
a good Conscience, as is manifest by sense: Therefore we must admit no Infant
to baptism.</hi> But the former is certain from the Text, for baptism is said to
save; that is, its appointed use, yet not the external washing, but the answer of
a good conscience doth it; therefore this is of necessary conjunction, and
without it baptism cannot attain its end, but it is to be administred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
onely in order to the attainment of its end, and therefore never in a
way by which the end is apparently not attainable. What this answer of a
good conscience is, we shall further enquire anon. Both the common exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
fully confirm the point which I maintain. The assemblies Annot. recit:
both thus:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100458:20"/>
[Hence by the answer of a good conscience we may understand that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
faith, whereof they made confession at their baptism, and whereby
their consciences were purified, and whereby they received the remission of
their sin, &amp;c. Some understand by the answer of a good conscience, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
whereinto they entered at their baptism, the embracing whereof they
testified by their unfeigned confession of their faith] <hi>viz.</hi> such a faith as
is aforesaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag. 160. Argum.</hi> 18. No one may be admitted to baptism, who may
not be addmitted a member of the Church of Christ. No one may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be a member of the Church of Christ without the profession of a saving
faith; therefore no one may be admitted to baptism without the profession of
a saving faith. <hi>But no Infant doth profess saving faith, as is manifest by sense,
therefore no Infant may be admitted to baptism.</hi> I speak of such admission to
Church membership as is in the power of the Ministers of Christ, who have
the Keys of his Kingdom to open and let in, as well as to cast out. The
major is past question, because baptism is our solemn entrance into the Church,
who were before entred by private consent, and accepted by the covenant
of God. All the question is of the minor, which I shall therefore
prove.</p>
            <p>1. It is before proved that all the members of the Church must be such as
are visibly, solemnly, or by profession, sanctified from former sin, cleansed,
justified persons of God, the heirs of the promise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this cannot be
without the profession of a saving faith; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. This is also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proved, where it was shewed, that no other are Christians or Disciples.
3. In <hi>Acts 2. 41, 42. &amp;c.</hi> The many thousand that were added to the
Church were such as gladly received the doctrine of saving faith and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and continued in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship, and breaking of
bread and prayer, and so far contemned the world as to sell all, and make it
common. And doubtless no man continued in those ways (of doctrine fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) without the profession of saving faith and repentance,
for the very use of these is such a profession, of which saith <hi>Calvin in Act.</hi> 2.

might be saved.</p>
            <p>The Church is the body of Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. 24. and none are members
of his body but such as either are united to him, and live by him, or at least
seem to do so. The Church is subject to Christ, and beloved of Christ, and
cherished by him: We are members of his body, of his flesh, and his
bones, <hi>Ephes</hi> 5. 24. 25, 30. And those that are against the general redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
me thinks should be moved with the consideration, that it is the Church
that Christ gave himself for, even the visible Church which he purchased with
his own blood, <hi>Acts 20. 28. Ephes.</hi> 5. 25. and he is the Saviour of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<hi>vers.</hi> 23. But so he is not effectively the Saviour of the professors of a faith

               </gap> according to opinion, he is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective

of the sincere: but of others neither way.</p>
            <p>Hitherto Divines have gathered from the plain Texts of Scripture, that
there is but one Church, one faith, and one baptism; and those that had this
faith really, were to be baptized, and were real members of the Church, and
that those that professed this faith, and so seemed to have it when they have it
not, are visible members of the Church, and are so taken, because their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is sensible to us; and by that they seem to have the thing prof<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in these.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. They feign a new Christian faith to themselves, <hi>to wit, a believing
immediate by the faith of a Parent or Proparent;</hi> so that before there was but one
Christian faith, and now they have made two. 2. And so before, there was
but one sort of real, serious, or sincere Christians, consisting of such as had
that real Christian faith, (<hi>in their own persons</hi>) and now they have found
out another sort of them, <hi>to wit, believers by anothers faith.</hi> 3. So they have
feigned a new baptism, for the old baptism was for remission of sin, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
and resurrection with Christ, and to ingraffe men into the Church, which
is the body of Christ, upon the profession of a saving faith: <hi>But now they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to baptism, as they term it, Infants without any profession of saving faith,
made by them to seal an imaginary covenant of grace made by God to believing
Parents and their seed, without any covenanting or sealing by the baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
upon a pretended title of Parents and Proparents faith, and instead of
baptizing [as of old they did] by putting under Water and coming
out again, so as to resemble Christs burial and resurrection, and their
conformity thereto, they call that baptism, and say falsly they baptize when
they onely sprinkle or pour water on an Infant without such dipping, as of old
Master</hi> Baxter pag. 70. <hi>confesseth was used and expressed by the Apostle,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:100458:21"/>
Rom. 6. 4, 5. 4. And they have feigned also a new kind of Church: For
the Church of Christs constitution is but one, which is called visible from
mens profession, and invisible from the faith professed. But they have made a
Church which consisteth of a third sort of members; that is, of men that
neither have saving faith nor profess it, but onely <hi>are Infants, whose Parents
or Proparents have faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. To this end they have confounded the Church and the Porch, the Vineyard
&amp; the adjac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

6. And hereby [<hi>by Infant baptism</hi>] also <hi>one of</hi> the two sorts of teaching,
which Christ distinguisheth, <hi>Matth. 28. 19, 20. is taken away, to wit,</hi> that
teaching which draweth men to Christ, and maketh them Disciples, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth
them to receive Christ Jesus the Lord. For they take him for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple

<hi>any</hi> preparatory truths, though yet he be not made a Disciple indeed, nor
profess to be.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Baxter</hi> is deeply offended <hi>with Master</hi> T. <hi>for denying Infants to be</hi>
Christians or members of the Church <hi>mediately, &amp;c.</hi> But I shall say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more concerning those <hi>Infants that are asserted</hi> by him to be Disciples,
who do not so much as profess a saving faith, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are no members
of the Church at all, and are not so much as to be named Christians, nor to
be admitted into the visible Church. No man can prove that ever one man
was admitted a Church-member in all the New Testament, <hi>without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of a saving faith.</hi> Otherwise we should have two distinct Churches
specially different, or two sorts of Christianity, and Christians differing <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
specie,</hi> in the whole kind, <hi>because the profession by a Parent and Proparent</hi>
which is made by him, <hi>their qualification doth make a difference specifical be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
such Christians and Church-members, and other Christians and Church
members.</hi> When the Jaylor <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30, 32, 33, 34. was admitted into the
Church by baptism, it was upon the professing of such a believing, by which
both he and his houshold might be saved, as is before shewed. And so of all
others in those times.</p>
            <p>Pag. 163. Argum. 19. <hi>If we once admit men to baptism</hi> without their own
personal profession, <hi>we shall be utterly confounded, and not be able to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
satisfactory</hi> resolution whose profession may be a sufficient qualification to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title

               </gap>obaptism,
<hi>as being utterly uncertain</hi> what Infants <hi>to baptize.</hi> This might be manifest by
considering the several conceits of <hi>Paedobaptists,</hi> some whereof make the faith
of the Church sufficient, some the faith of albelieving Nation, some of any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
some of the sureties, some of the next Parents, some of the Parent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched,
some of the Parent or Proparent, and this they claim by a covenant
which they can extend to no other then the Parent, who is believer, not onely
by Profession, but also really before God, which can be known to no admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strator
of baptism ordinarily.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:100458:21"/>
Paedobaptists speak so much and purposely <hi>of this point, particularly Master</hi>
Baxter <hi>of baptism, Part. 1. chap.</hi> 29. that one would think we may expect an
exact <hi>resolution of this point from</hi> him, if from any man, and yet he is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
what to fix upon, <hi>and if he resolve on any thing it is without proof, as is
shewed by Master</hi> T. <hi>Review, Part.</hi> 1. Sect. 35. 37. <hi>Exercit. Argum.</hi> 9. 11.
<hi>Review</hi> part. 2. Sect. 10. 12. 17. Part. 3. Sect. 50. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I perceive that
the stress of the differences between Master <hi>Baxter and Master</hi> T. <hi>did</hi> rest
much in <hi>this,</hi> and no wise man will leave his grounds till he see where he may
have better (<hi>especially when the grounds are so plain as those of the Antipae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptists
are from Christs institution,</hi> Matth. 28. 19. Mark. 16. 15, 16. <hi>and
the Apostles practice, which Master</hi> Baxter <hi>hath here so amply proved to be of the
baptizing onely of persons who themselves profess a saving faith</hi>) unless he
mean to be for nothing, or of no Religion. No man can tell where to fix,
nor what we must consent to, to procure a title, if we once forsake the present
ground <hi>of the Persons own profession of saving faith who is to be baptized.
What is said to the contrary is answered in the books forenamed, and it is not
meet to be still writing for</hi> those lazie Readers, that had rather erre then be at
the pains of reading what is already written. None are Disciples upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of your other faith, but of either saving faith or the profession of it;
none are Christians on the account of your lower kind of faith, but onely of
saving faith or the profession of it. Once for all I let you know, that I take
saving faith to be the constitutive or necessary qualification of a real or mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
member; and profession of that faith to be the qualifying condition of
visibility of membership. I confess still that the sealis to others besides belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
but though the promise be conditional, we must not seal to any but those
that profess consent to the conditions; and therefore not to any but those that
profess to be true believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 190. I find by sad experience (to my sorrow) that a considerable part
of some Parishes, or Villages are ignorant of the Fundamentals. I have spoken
with abundance that that know not Christ is God or man, or either (but they
say he is a Spirit) nor that the Holy Ghost is God, nor why Christ died, nor
that any satisfaction is made for our sins, or any thing done, or necessary to
their pardon, but our own repentance and amendment, and with some that
know not that the soul goes to heaven before the resurrection, nor that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
shall ever rise again.</p>
            <p>Now I would know of Master <hi>Blake</hi> whether all the children of these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
must be baptized again or not? For certainly these have not a Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
faith, which is the thing that he saith entituleth to baptism. And then
what certainty have we that any of our ancestors had a true Dogmatical faith:
<hi>And I would know of Master</hi> Baxter <hi>whether such children are not to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
agian? Sure if he say no, how can he allow that baptism which is without
a Profession of saving faith? If he say yea, how can he assure himself that any
of our ancestors had right baptism? Me thinks few that hold Master</hi> Baxters
<hi>Tenets should allow of the baptism of the greatest part of</hi> English <hi>People who are
no better then those Master</hi> Baxter <hi>mentions, and yet neither Master</hi> Baxter <hi>nor
other Paedobaptists do baptize such when they come to profess understandingly
the faith of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 195. My Twentieth and last Argument is drawn from the constant
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100458:22"/>
practice of the universal Church of Christ. It hath been the constant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Catholick Church from the Apostles practice till now to require
that profession of saving faith and repentance, as necessary, before they would
baptize; therefore it must be our practice also. <hi>But it is otherwise in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
baptism, as experience shews, therefore the practice of it is not right.</hi>
For the proof of the Churches practice,</p>
            <p>1. I have already said enough about the Apostles own practice and the
Church in their days.</p>
            <p>2. The constant practice of the Church since the Apostles to this day is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
known. 1. by the very form of words in baptism, and 2. by the history
of their proceedings therein. 1. It is certain that the Church did ever baptize
into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And as I have proved
before, the voluntary seeking and reception of that baptism containeth the
actual profession of saving faith. 2. It is certain that the persons to be baptized
(if at age) did profess to believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 3.
It is also certain, that they did profess to renounce the Flesh, the World, and
the Devil. 4. And it is certain that they promised for the future to live in new
obedience, and thus they publickly entered the three stipulations; <hi>Credis?
credo: Abrenuncias? abrenuncio: Spondes? Spondeo.</hi> Doest thou believe?
I believe. Doest thou renounce? I renounce. Doest thou promise? I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
            <p>It was the constant doctrine of the Fathers and the Church then, that faith
and repentance (given in vocation) did go first, and that Justification,
Adoption, and Sanctification followed after. And so they took this justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faith and repentance to be prerequisite to baptism, therefore they ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
before hand whether they believed in God the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, and renounced the Flesh, the World, and the Devil (as is aforesaid)
and caused them to profess this before they would baptize them. And as it is
true of the ancient Church, that they never baptized any without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of saving faith and repentance, so it is true of all the Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the world that I can hear of to this day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papists</hi> themselves do use the same words in baptism, as are before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
and require a profession. And though their false doctrine force them
to misexpound their own words, yet custom hinders them from changing
them; and for the reformed Churches it is past all question, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
practice, that they require the profession of a saving faith. The practice of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> till the late change, may be seen in the Common
prayer book, wherein all that is fore-mentioned is required, <hi>even from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
to whom the question is propounded, doest thou renounce? doest thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve?
wilt thou be baptized? although they took the answer of the sureties
as if it were the childes, and say in the Catechism they now promise, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
faith and repentance by their sureties.</hi> In the confession of faith of the
Assembly at <hi>Westminster,</hi> cap. 28. and again in the shorter Catechism, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of faith in Christ, and obedience to him is the thing required. They
add also in the Directory [that all who are baptized in the name of Christ
do renounce, and by their baptism are bound to fight against the Devil, the
world and the flesh.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. saith [<hi>Quod non admittitur Eunuchus ad baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100458:22"/>
nisi fidem professus, hinc sumenda est universalis regula, non ante reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piendes
esse in Ecclesiam qui ab ea prius fuerant alieni, quam ubi testati fuerint
Christo se credere. Est enim baptismus quasi fidei appendix: ideoque ordine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterior
est. Deinde si datur sine fide, cujus est sigillum, &amp; impia &amp; nimis cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa
est prophanatio.</hi>] That the Eunuch was not admitted to baptism till he
professed faith. Hence this universal rule is to be gathered, that those are not
to be received into the Church, who before were strangers from it, till they
first testifie they believe in Christ: for baptism is as it were an Appendix to
faith, and therefore is later in order: then if it be given without faith, of which
tis the seal, tis a wicked and too gross a prophanation. Here note. 1. That
baptism (as received) is the seal of our faith (how much soever denied by
Master <hi>Blake</hi>) as it is the seal of Gods promise as administred. 2. That the
constant order is that baptism follow faith. 3. And that it is no better then
an impious profanation of it, if it go without faith; that is. 1. if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
seek it without the presence of faith. 2. if the Pastor administer it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
