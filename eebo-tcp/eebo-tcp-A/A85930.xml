            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>E it known that Sir <hi>Balthaſar Gerbier,</hi> Knight, erects an Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, wherein forraigne Languages, Sciences, and all Noble exerciſes ſhall be taught, <hi>viz French, Italian, Spaniſh, German,</hi> and <hi>Low Dutch,</hi> both Ancient and Modern Hiſtories, joynlty with the conſtitution and government of the moſt Famous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and Stares of the world. Beſides, the true experimentall Naturall Philoſophy. As alſo, what is moſt neceſſary and moſt noble of the Mathematicks, to wit, Arithmetick, the true method of keeping Bookes of Account, by double parties, as is practiſed in <hi>Italy</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> Geometry, Geography, Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mography, Perſpective, and Architecture, as well for building as for magnificent ſhewes, and ſecret motions of Scenes, and the like. But above all, what is moſt excellent of practicall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematickes, whatſoever belongeth to Fortification, beſieging and defending of places, Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, ordering of Battallies, and Marches of Armes, Muſick, playing of all ſorts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, Dancing, Fencing, riding the great Horſe, together with the new manner of fighting on Horſe-backe. And if there be any lovers of Vertue, who have an inclination to Drawing, Painting, Limning and Carving, either for their curioſity, or to attain unto a greater excellency in ſeverall of the forementioned Sciences, <hi>(viz.</hi> Arithmetick, Fortifications, &amp;c.) they may have them as exactly taught as any of the other Sciences, and by a ſhort method, which ſhall give them a full inſight in the Theoricall part of the ſaid Sciences and Exerciſes at the ſelf ſame time that they ſhal be taught in the Forraigne languages, whereunto ſhall ſerve ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Treaties held forth by the ſaid Sir <hi>Balthaſar</hi> in the Forraigne Languages aforeſaid, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue being joyned thereunto, together with divers excellent Tables of very great uſe for facilitating the matter, and helping the memory; which Treaties ſhall be continually at Miſtreſſe <hi>Allens</hi> ſhop at the ſigne of the Crown in <hi>Popes-head Alley,</hi> neere the old <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, London;</hi> ſo that all lovers of theſe Languages, Sciences, and Exerciſes, may be pleaſed to addreſſe themſelves to the ſaid Sir <hi>Balthaſars</hi> houſe, at <hi>Bednall Green,</hi> beyond <hi>White Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi> where Gentlemen, and the ſonnes of all ſuch lovers of vertue, are received and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to their and their parents entire ſatisfaction, being a place moſt pleaſant, healthfull, and fit for the ſtudious, that are diſpoſed to apply themſelves, as aforeſaid, and there to improve themſelves in ſuch a ſhort and convenient time, as that they ſhall be the ſooner enabled to travell as Gentlemen, who converſing with perſons of repute and worth, will leave a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſteem of themſelves in forraigne parts, when ſtrangers ſhall find them to be well verſt in Languages, Sciences, and perfect in all noble Qualities; And that they ſhall not owe to the ſaid ſtrangers, the merit of their education. Beſides the other more weighty conſiderations which conſcience and loyalty to our own native Countrey obligeth all, parents to preferre, and eſpecially in theſe evill times, when it proves a generall misfortune that a number of young Gentlemen abroad, are drawn into evil company, where they heare and learn nothing but meere corruption both of manners and language, beſides deſtructive Principles to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey, and to their Religion, it being alſo conſiderable, that the ſending of young Gentlemen to any of the Forraigne Academies (where they ſhall learn no more qualities then now they may get at home, nor altogether ſo many) as it is incomparably more expenſive, ſo it expoſeth them to many dangers and inconveniencies.</p>
            <p>And although the principall ſcope of the Academie is for the education of young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet thoſe of more mature Age, may find in it wherewith abundantly to ſatisfie any laudable curioſity in any kinde whatſoever, whether onely for enriching the minde, or for honorable profit.</p>
