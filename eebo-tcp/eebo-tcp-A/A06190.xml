            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

onely miniment, and memoriall of a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in this last, and worst age, that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for vs but bookes amongst the best, and by-words amongst the worst, as her one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bequest, and our legacie. Howsoeuer, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it is the heartie ioy of Israel, &amp; the vnspeakeable comfort of Iacob, that still some of the precious balme of Gilead that falls vpon Aarons head, doth distill downe euen vnto the skirts of his priestly clothing. And whereas others may haue spices, and balmes to preserue their bodies for a time, and monuments of brasse, and stone to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a future glorie to their memorials: yet euer those haue bene most enobled, whose remembrances the tokens of vertue, and godlinesse haue endeuored to eternize, and keepe from the rottennesse of corrupted ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, and obscure obliuion. And albeit the purport of this whole proiect is but the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my tongue into my pen, and the matter it selfe is but a preaching againe (as it were) the same words another saboth day,<note place="margin">Act. 13.</note> as the Gentiles besought Paule in the Acts:
<pb facs="tcp:3525:3"/>
yet I pray you entertaine them as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of my spirit, the pledge of mine heart, and the earnest of that affection, and loue which I iustly beare vnto you. And whereas before I spake in a great auditory in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and countenance of a liuing man, am now content in this my paines to bury my selfe in a dead letter of lesse effectuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion: But principally I protest to this only end and purpose, that God might be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (if it be his holy will) in me the weakest, &amp; meanest of his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts both by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of mine heart, and in the endeauors of mine hand. The Treatise is of the loue of God deuoted vnto your selues in whom I haue obserued much loue toward God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your brethren without, and amongst your selues at home. Goe on then (blessed in the Lord Iesu) in this sacred vettue that disposeth you to God so amiablie, and you<note place="margin">Ioh. 20.</note> shall find these holy encreases in you 1. You shall euer desire to thinke on him that made<note place="margin">Luke 2.</note> you. 2. Gladly, and willingly to frequent his house the pallace of praier 3. Duly to speake,<note place="margin">1.

&amp; talke of him. 4. Often to heare of him by<note place="margin">Io. 14.</note> his messengers, and to meditate of that you heare. 5. Readie will you be to giue for his<note place="margin">1. Io. 3.</note> sake. 6. Ioyfull that you suffer whatsoeuer it<note place="margin">Io. 18. 1. Io. 5.</note> be for Gods honour. 7. Duly to bowe your hearts to the obedience of his holy lawes, 8. Yea you wil loue them that loue the Lord,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> and despise and hate them that hate him. 9. Neither will you loue this world, nor anything therein, vnlesse it be for the Lords cause. 10. Yea in a word, you will loue your friend in the Lord, and your enemie for the Lord.</p>
            <p>Long may the blessing of this diuine loue which is the beautifull Idea of your soules, sparkle and flame in you. Let the God of heauen grant that the distempered humours of misperswasion may neuer quench it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, nor the ouerflowings of vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the world euer put it out, but let the light of Gods owne most blessed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for euer and euer shine vpon you, and cause it to be enflamed eternally.

Lord Iesus Christ is loue substantially, hauing nothing<note place="margin">Bern. de am. dei.</note> in him selfe but himselfe, being loue it selfe essentially, not accidentally, he is also loue causally, causing it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as in the Elements, in the creatures, in the sweete symphonie of the whole vniuerse, and in the bitter iarres of mans corrupted nature, making men to be of one mind in an house, and of one heart in a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. He is loue actiuely louing all things he hath made, man more particularly, his redeemed most especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, with a loue to the end, in the end, without end.</p>
            <p>Louing them in their election, when they could not loue him; louing them in their redemption when they would not loue him; louing them externally, for they haue a promise to enioy their outward blessings; louing them internally, for their hearts shall be comforted; lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them eternally, for they shall euer be blessed with him in heauenly things. He is loue passiuely most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be beloued, being louing euerie daie in multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his blessings, being louing euery way in magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mercies, louing vs first in preuenting vs merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, louing vs in continuance in guiding vs powerfully, louing vs last in perfecting vs eternally. Yea so louing that if he go to punish, he walkes a soft pace, he comes in the coole of the day: but to shew mercie he runnes; for he is gracious, righteous, yea our God is mercifull, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing three, or fowre of the generation of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse; but shewing mercy to thousands that loue him, and liue in his feare. Taste then, and see how gracious the Lord Iesus is, and how plentifull is his goodnesse, which he hath layed vp for them that feare him, and prepared

for them that trust in him, euen before the sonnes of men. He being the perfection of Priesthood and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, of sacrifice and sacrament, so that now who so set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his heart vpon any thing but vpon the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> is liable to the extreme curse of Gods desertion. Set not then your hearts on beautie, beloued, it is but a forward blossome soone nipt; nor on pleasure, it is but a bitter pill lapt in sugar; nor on your belly, it is but the pantrie for the draft house; nor on riches, they are but guiles, and baites to insnare vs, which while they are in getting wearie vs, while they are possessed, befoole vs; and when<note place="margin">Picus Mirand. in Apolog.</note> we lose them, they crucifie vs. Set not your hearts on the fauour of Princes or Potentates, for they are but the sonnes of men; nor on ambition, it is but a feather tossed with the wind; nor on gay apparell, it is but rags; nor on goodly houses, they are but so many bonefiers against the day of doome; nor on any thing vnder the sunne: but only like, and loue them in and for the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> sake, as they are either remedies for sin, or directions <hi>in ordine ad Deum</hi> for our vsefull necessities, and furtherances to further our future happinesse.

            <p>Out of <hi>Sion</hi> (saith <hi>Dauid</hi>) hath God appeared in<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 2.</note> perfect beautie; for what higher, and more heauenly perfection can be imagined, or was euer hard of then <hi>Sions</hi> sacred rayes, which giue bright splendor, and most glorious lustre to the whole Christian world?

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3525:8"/>
if he haue grace, here is his welbeloued also, and this commencement and commerce of sweet loue, will be the whetstone of true, perfect and perpetuall loue.</p>
            <p>If any be curious, here is amiable beautie <hi>white and ruddie: white,</hi> answering the purenesse he would haue, and <hi>ruddie</hi> corresponding the zealous hartines he would craue. And further if he shall be curious, and be <hi>elegans formarum spectator,</hi> here is choice, euen the chiefest of ten thousand. For here he may behold the spouse, first shewing her deere affection, then her true loues description: her affection she vttereth by appellation of vnfained loue, <hi>welbeloued:</hi> and also by application, thus, <hi>My welbeloued:</hi> she then describes him generally, as thus, <hi>is white, and ruddie, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest of ten thousand.</hi> And then particularly in his parts as in the verses following of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>In her generall description she sets him downe in<note place="margin">The diuision.</note> orient colours of heauenly perfection, as first his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <hi>is white,</hi> both essentially (<hi>is</hi>) and especially to, <hi>white.</hi> Secondly his purity, and zeale both <hi>Zeraphical,</hi> and also <hi>Cherubical,</hi> wholie passible, wholy amiable, euen in these words (<hi>and ruddie</hi>) which is a sweete, and seemely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mixture of white, and red. Then the choice, aboue thousands, and the chiefe of choice the chiefest of ten thousand. In loue then you see he is matchlesse, in purity spotlesse, in zeale pricelesse, in choice peerelesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Come hither then thou passionate louer, and</hi> repent thee of thine inordinate, and immoderate loue to

alluring, and deceiptfull beautie, that vaine vermilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on die mingled with white, (like bloud in snow) both vanishing with the Suns beames, with sicknes, old age, and many other casualties; and whereof thou thy selfe art suspicious, euen while thou dost enioy it, and art inlie tormented, lest an other should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with thee: come hither I say, and sit downe at these pure waters a while, and let thy soule see, and be rauished with the sight of celestiall beautie, and grace shining vnto thee (miserable, and wretched man) euen from heauen; and yet thou neuer didst vouchsafe so much as once to cast thine eie vpon it.</p>
            <p>No man I confesse can pourtray or delineate this loue vnto thee as it is in deede, therfore I could wish that my soule had consulted with the Lord Iesus his<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Paranymph</hi> the beloued disciple, who leaned vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> his sacred breast at supper, and felt the breathes of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed loue that breathed out of his tender bowels, or had bene rapt vp with <hi>Paule</hi> into the third heauen, to<note place="margin">2.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3525:9"/>
Iesus pourtrayed herein most mystically, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely.</p>
            <p>But how shall I then dare to aduenture, or take vpon me to open my mouth to set forth this loue? seeing as <hi>S. Bernard</hi> saith, None can vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d <hi>Paules</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bern. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syd. ad Euge nium. l. 3. c. 4</note> meaning, but they that are endued with <hi>Paules</hi> mind, so none can conceiue the spouses affection, but they that are touched with the like loue. How shall wee either speake of the spouses tender affection, or you heare accordingly? seeing we are all carnall, sold vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sinne, and these things are mystically, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually discerned. This onely comforts me, that God hath granted two meanes to know these sacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, the one infused and extraordinarie, onely proper and peculiar to the men of God in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages; the other attained by studie, and industrie ioyned with inuocation to God for illumination &amp; grace, the onely sacred reliques of Iesus Christ left to his seruants in these last ages. The <hi>Gospel</hi> being the foundation of all our sacred skill, out of the which whosoeuer preacheth Christ crucified, hath the mind of Christ. And hauing his mind, we may with reuerend boldnesse auerre, that we also know the true Churches meaning.</p>
            <p>Hearken then to the Church here styling Christ, <hi>her welbeloued,</hi> for he is hers, and shee is his: first, she by way of petition intreateth saying, <hi>Shew me (Ã´ thou whom my soule loueth) when thou feedest, where thou liest at noone?</hi> And then he by way of replication answereth, <hi>My loue, my doue, mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled,</hi>

               <hi>open vnto me, for my head is full of dewe, and my haire of the drops of the morning:</hi> whereupon the Church doth in eight Chapters in this diuine song, nine and twenty times style him (her best <hi>beloued</hi>) as if she could neuer too oft remember his vnspeakeable loue towards her his welbeloued. <hi>Saint Paule</hi> also a sonne of this sacred mother hath in his Epistles fiue hundred times the name of his Lord Iesus, as acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Cenebrards obseruation.</note> himselfe most happie, when that most sacred name of loue and life sounded in his lips, or was written with his pen. If therefore we of the last and worst generation be transported, and out of our wits as you think (being rauished with the surpassing loue of God, it being shed in our hearts by the holy<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 13. 14.</note> Ghost) weare it to God: or if we be modest, and in our right mind, we are it vnto you, for the loue of Christ constraineth vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the beloued disciple, now being old, writes of nothing else but of this loue, as appeareth in his canonical Epistles, chusing now to die, and depart in beholding the surpassing beautie thereof, insomuch that he summons all degrees, children, yong men and<note place="margin">1.

               <hi>dwelleth in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we shall descend lower to other lights of the Church, we shall also see that this was the earnest, &amp; most certaine pledge that their soules had here, euen to be swayed, and transported with this diuine loue. Euery thing is caried with his weight: <hi>Loue is my</hi>

               <hi>I am tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sported. S. Bernard</hi> admireth this loue, <hi>that God being so great, so greatly should loue vs wretched miscreants, and that freely.

Eusebius Emiss.</hi> epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth our seruice thus, <hi>Be not distracted with many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, for what God requireth of thee, is in thee, to wit, the seruice of thy mouth by confession, and the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thine heart in faithfulnes.</hi> In thy heart then hath God set the soules city of refuge, that whence the sin came, the medicine might thence also issue. How nigh then is this remedie? How sweete is this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell? Of this doubtles spake <hi>Moses: It is neare euen in thy</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 30. 14.</note> 
               <hi>mouth, and in thine heart: miserable</hi> therfore <hi>is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> (saith <hi>Ierome</hi>) <hi>not to be with him, without whom we cannot be.</hi> Be with God we cannot otherwise (while we are here) then by affection. <hi>What (Ã´ loue) can be sufficiently said in thy praise?</hi> saith <hi>Hugo de S. Victore, seeing through thee God should humble himselfe to descend from heauen, and man should be exalted from earth to heauen; great is thy power, that thus God should be abased, and sinfull man so aduanced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus haue the sacred sonnes of the true Churches generation expressed their affectionate rauishments in this diuine loue, shewing that nothing can be more pious, nothing is more precious. And this heauenly affection also is not onely generall in the whole Church, but also particularly in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious soule, which applieth it soundly, certainely,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3525:10"/>
and sweetly to it selfe, and saith as the spouse here, <hi>He is my beloued,</hi> by way of appropriation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee may discerne a twofold certainety of our<note place="margin">Certitudo objecti.</note> faith, the one of the obiect; as that <hi>there is a life euerlasting, that Christ died for the sinnes of the world.</hi> Both certaine by the promise of God. Yet this is small comfort, vnlesse the other certainety of the subiect also be assured vnto vs. To wit, that this euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting<note place="margin">Certitudo subiecti.</note> life is prepared for me, and that Christ died for my sinnes. This indeed is the vndoubted worke of faith. <hi>Dauid</hi> could saie, <hi>Blessed is the man whose sins</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 32. 1.</note> 
               <hi>are forgiuen.</hi> Yet this is but Christ in the whole cloth, (as we may say) but <hi>Paule</hi> had learned to turne <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids quorum</hi> into his owne <hi>ego,</hi> and say, <hi>whereof I am</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 15.</note> 
               <hi>cheefe,</hi> and so cut himselfe a garment therof to couer his owne wretchednes: For he well knew that as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> as were baptized into Christ, had put on Christ. So you see, he is fitted as a garment to weare, and not to gaze vpon.</p>
            <p>The reason of this certainty, is this. Because faith maketh that present which is absent. Therfore by the<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> Spirit of God faith is called <hi>The euidence of things not seene.</hi> Neither is this certainety of hope, but of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For <hi>S. Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>We know that when he shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, we also shall appeare in glorie.</hi> And <hi>S. Paule</hi> testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> 
               <hi>that the Spirit assureth our spirits that we are the sons of God.</hi> Doubtlesse therefore most restlesse, and most vnquiet is the mind of that man which doubteth of Gods loue. For what auaileth it thee, be thy estate neuer so happie, if it be miserable to thy selfe? What
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3525:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
comfort is it to a king to weare a crowne of gold, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in great happinesse of estate, if he be not perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the enioyment therof? What sound solace is it to any Christian to know, that there is a life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, &amp; yet knowes not whether he shall heare <hi>Come ye blessed,</hi> or <hi>go ye cursed?</hi> it being a very dictate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. Seneca.</note> That no man is happy, but he that so thinketh himselfe. The felicity thereof consisting not in the happy expectation, but in the present perswasion.</p>
            <p>Thus then you see the appropriation of this loue, how necessarie it is, and not onely herein, but in all other inducements of godlinesse. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth that he was conuerted by reading that of <hi>S.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. lib. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes. 8. cap. 12. Rom. 13. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Paule, Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Not in chambering, and wantonnesse, strife, and enuying, but put on the Lord Iesus.</hi> So <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> applied the Scripture to the particular refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his owne life. And <hi>Alipius S. Augustines</hi> louing consort applied the beginning of the 14. Chapter to the Rom. to the end that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> might thereby recouer &amp; confirme him that waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and staggered in the holy faith of Christ Iesus. So the spouse here appropriateth Gods deere loue to her owne affections, whereby we may learne, <hi>That to a deuoted and truly religious soule, Christ Iesus applied</hi>
               <note place="margin">The lesson.</note> 
               <hi>is the onely loue, and life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O heare a godly soule speake in her diuine phrases to Christ Iesus, applying him to euery part, to her mouth, saying, <hi>Let him kisse me with the kisses of his</hi>

               <hi>mouth,</hi> that her words might be gracious, and seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the salt of the spirit of God. 2. To her breasts,

               <hi>My beloued is as a bundle of myrrhe vnto me, he shall lie betweene my breasts,</hi> that by alwaies meditating on him, she might not be drawne aside to the by-paths of follie, and vanity. 3. To her affections, <hi>Set me as a</hi>

               <hi>seale vpon thine heart,</hi> that she might neuer be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his impression. 4. To her actions, <hi>And as a signet vpon thine arme,</hi> that she might neuer be destitute of his directions. The reason is, <hi>For loue is as strong as</hi>
               <note place="margin">7.</note> 
               <hi>death, iealousie as cruel as the graue: Much water cannot quench it, neither can the floud drowne it;</hi> whence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth a whole resignation. Therfore <hi>I am my beloueds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 7.</note> 
               <hi>and he is mine.</hi> Thus the true spouse. <hi>Dauid likewise</hi> in<note place="margin">Psal. 1 19.</note> the same case, <hi>I am thine Ã´ Lord, hide not thy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements from me. Dauid</hi> was now neither for sinne, nor for Sathan, nor for the world, nor for the flesh, nor for his owne selfe, but for the Lord totally by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, fully by affection. And verily how can it be otherwise, but that a religious soule should thus wholy deuote it selfe to God in all sacred affection, if it call to mind but these motiues following?</p>
            <p>First what <hi>Ieremie</hi> saith, how the Lord speaketh, when he considered whereof the sonnes of men were made, and weighed, that they were but dust, and therefore in his mercie to them he said it, and not to the Angels that fell, <hi>Shall they fall, And not</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 8. 4.</note> 
               <hi>arise? shall they turne away, and not turne againe?</hi> Here is rising from the gulfe of hell, and returning from the bondage, and captiuitie of the diuell, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs by promise in Gods preuenting mercie. Secondly when we shall remember that God hath
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3525:12"/>
omitted all his other creatures of heauen and of earth, and as it were neglected them, and hath set his loue onely vpon vs, yea the Angels that fel he hath reserued in chaines of darknesse for the iudgement of the great day, and yet saued a remnant of the sonnes of men. Thirdly, when it shall call to mind, that to all other creatures God hath giuen a direct<note place="margin">Picus Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. in Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapl. sup. Gen.</note> motion to content themselues in their now being, but to man a circular motion, that we should onely seeke our felicitie in him, in whom we had our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Fourthly, that forasmuch as Gods grace is giuen vs for our guide, in this dangerous world, which ouercometh infallibly the world, the diuell, and the flesh, holdeth the truth inseparably against all heresie and schisme, and leadeth indeclinably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Paradise of God, we should with all deuoted thankfulnesse entertaine this holy blessednesse. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seeing that we may by holy faith (as in a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall mirror) behold the whole holy and vndeuided Trinitie in this worke of louing, sauing and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, we should as those that had newly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their eye sight, after a long blindnesse, be raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with ioy, and comfort. For see, God the father so loued vs, that he gaue his onely begotten sonne,<note place="margin">Ioh 3.</note> &amp;c. that whosoeuer beleeueth in him should not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, but should haue euerlasting life. God the sonne so loued vs that he would die for vs, God the holy ghost so loued vs, that he maketh request for vs with<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> sighes vnutterable in our soules.</p>
            <p>Who would not then gather hence diuine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3525:12"/>
according to the measure of grace giuen vnto vs? calling to mind the precept of Christ which is the summe of all: <hi>Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God, with all thine heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy mind,</hi> that is, saith <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> Loue him with all thy right<note place="margin">Aug. in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> reason, with all thy earnest affection, and with all thy strongest powers, loue him with all thy vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, with all thy will, and with all thy memorie; loue him wisely, that thou be not deceiued by the diuell in an angell of light. Loue him sweetly that thou be not allured by the wicked and bewitching world. Loue him valiantly, that thou be not danted with the diuellish proiects, and practises of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.

            <p>Doubtlesse these holy soules knew that this loue was all loue vnto them, for euen in naturall loue Christ can be all things vnto thee; whereas thy gold cannot be thy clothing, thy siluer cannot be thy drinke, thy bread cannot be thy light, Christ alone is all this vnto thee. If thou neede necessarie loue, he is

thy protector, and bulwarke. If thou wouldest be happy in loue, with him is the fountaine of liuing life for euer. These considerations, and the like cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Gods children neuer to admit any thing neere their hearts, contrary to this loue, as is the affection inordinate to the creature, but loued the creature onely for the Lords sake. They euer remoued farre from their holy affections all carking care, and ouer much toyling in the businesse, and negociations of this world, as being the deceitfull bane of this loue: vsing indeed the world necessarily, but so as if they vsed it not, which caused their loue to be continuall, not flashes of passion rather then true affection, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during for a moment, but resembling the loue of the blessed Saints who see God, and loue him for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Againe, they knew that if we would be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, and sell our loue, none could buy it dearer, for he will giue vs a kingdome for it: if we would be liberall and giue it, none more worthy of it, for he is absolutely the soueraigne good.

Then lest that this inward conceit should be too priuate, and none take notice of their hypocriticall, and hyperbolicall integritie, like an old bottle they must vent it, or else they would burst, and vtter they must, yea slauer out (rather then faile) their owne fooleries, be they neuer so grosse, or neuer so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to be endured.

If therefore I should haue my wish, I would rather choose to be a doorekeeper to this generation of essentiall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then to dwell in the glorious tents of seeming holinesse; and I shall rather be at sea, tossed with a tempestuous storme in the ship with those that humblie professe themselues sinners, then on the shore in the table of those Pharisies that iustifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with their hideous haughtinesse.</p>
            <p>Now as this bright beautie is essentiall in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: so also it is especiall in the brightnesse, and excellencie thereof. For there are foure sorts of whitenes: First fanatically phantasticall whitenes. Secondly superficiall whitenes. Thirdly naturall whitenes; but changeable in the subiect. Fourthly natiue whitenes, and not changeable in the subiect.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3525:19"/>
The first is the diuell transformed into an Angell of light, for he is fanatically phantasticall white. The man that had a blemish of white in his eye was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from the priesthood, &amp; was resembled to the owle, of whom the Naturalists yeeld the reason, that shee cannot see in the day time, because of the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great whitenes she hath in her eyes, which scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth so the sight, that the optiques thereof cannot discerne perfectly the obiects. Such are all those that conceiue themselues pure, and yet are not washed and cleansed from their euill conscience, who say they see, and therefore their sinnes remaine; for had they bene blind, they might pretend some excuse, but now all excuse is taken from them, because they say that they see. The superficiall white are painted sepulchers, and whited walls, loathsome within, and the best is but woodden without, like the gilded potsheard <hi>Salomon</hi> speakes of, that the next shower of raine discouereth to be but an outcast for the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters field, how gloriously soeuer it glister. The natural white, but changeable, are they that are borne faire, but afterwards by the Sunne and soyle they become blacke and Aethiopian-like. Semblable are those that begin in the spirit of grace, and bright beautie, and end in the fraile and filthy flesh. The natiue and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable whitenes is that of pearelesse, and price<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse diamonds, whose least sparkle will shine, and giue true luster, albeit it be seuered from the whole.</p>
            <p>Such was, and is this speciall <hi>Candor</hi> in our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3525:19"/>
Lord Iesus, and his chosen, who euen in this life haue these white robes in part put on them mentioned in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> not their owne concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> attire of the righteousnesse of workes, but Gods owne righteousnesse; and they haue also the white stone giuen them, which is sanctification in some measure as an earnest penny, and pledge of further fauor, and future beautie, to be perfected in glory. Behold then with milke white, and pure eyes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith your Lord Iesus especiall and perfect white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, your precious diamond in especialnesse, by whom all wee, and as many as haue gone before vs being his holy seruants, haue bene beautified, and graced.</p>
            <p>First as he is <hi>Emanuel,</hi> that is, God with vs: His conception pure, he was conceiued by the holy Ghost. 2. His birth pure, he was borne of an vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led virgin. 3. His life the perfection of sanctimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for there was no guile found, no not in his mouth: And <hi>he is perfect, that offends not in his tongue.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam 3.</note> 4. His doctrine pure, correcting all the vnpure glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the reformalizing Pharisies; as in old time it was said, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> but Christ taught true<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> puritie, that wee should not be angry with our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnaduisedly. Teaching thereby, that furie and wrath doth oft transport vs to fell and desperate actions, and therefore his holy doctrine as an axe strooke at the roote. Againe, it was said of old time <hi>Thou shalt not commit Adulterie</hi> in act. But Christ taught vs not to looke on a woman to lust after her,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3525:20"/>
and so in turning away our eyes, we should not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold vanitie: Likewise it hath bene said, <hi>Thou shalt not forsweare thy selfe.</hi> But Christ taught that wee should not sweare at all; for be doubtlesse that vseth to sweare much, must needs sometime forget, and forsweare himselfe. And it hath bene said of old, <hi>Thou shalt loue thy neighbour, &amp; hate thine enemy.</hi> But Christ taught, <hi>Thou shalt loue thine enemie;</hi> for that is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of Christian charitie aboue all other loues. Nay, of euery idle word he told vs that we must ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an account. Oh holy lessons, Ã´ sacred discipline! how pure is the beautie hereof, how precious the sinceritie? In his death therefore, neither death nor he that had the power of death could finde any part whereon to fasten their intended furie, but in spite of death, and the diuell, and the wicked world, he was declared mightily to be the Sonne of God, by<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 2.</note> the spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection from the dead.</p>
            <p>We may learne then out of this which hath bene alreadie said, <hi>That the puritie of a sincere conscience</hi>
               <note place="margin">The lesson.</note> 
               <hi>consists in essentiall and sanctified actions, and not in seeming holinesse of froward and dottish factions.</hi> The blessing being promised to the pure in heart, and not<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> to the wordy pure, but to the worthy, of whom it is also said, <hi>That to such all things are pure:</hi> but of<note place="margin">Tit. 1.</note> the other, <hi>That their very consciences are defiled, and they themselues</hi> (howsoeuer reputed holy for some good workes) yet <hi>reprooued to euery good worke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reason, because God requireth truth in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3525:20"/>
inward parts, and the searcher of the heart knoweth what is in man. Likewise because no vnpure thing<note place="margin">Apoc. 22.</note> shall enter into the kingdome of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore surely no party propale Christian that dealeth hypocritically shall there haue entrance: I wonder therefore that any will be so foolish as to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues odious euery way by their seeming holinesse. First to the world, for the world hateth euen those that are Christians but in shew. For it can discerne no further. Secondly they are abhominable to God who hates them because they are but in shew. And lastly they are traitors to themselues, in deceiuing their owne soules and consciences with deceitfull dreames of sanctitie.</p>
            <p>But let vs a little lanch forth, and ken the diuell transforming himselfe into an Angell of light and brightnesse, and boasting both of puritie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence aboue, and before all others, both in Iudaisme, and also in Christianisme, as he euen yet worketh with too too many in this our age. In Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daisme we will take a view but of the Pharisies, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, Essens, and Hemerobaptists. The Pharisies were men separate from others in respect of their pretended perfection, they were pure in their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, pure in their deuotion, pure in their laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring.<note place="margin">Pharisies.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Their vestures must be enuironed, and the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders made broade with the commandements of God embrodered thereon. <hi>Luc.</hi> 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. Their deuotion such that they would not cure on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3525:21"/>
were the sicknesse neuer so desperate, nor plucke an eare of corne in the extremity of hunger. Their washings diuers, both of hands, pots, boords, and what not? Yet for all this outward pretended purenesse, Christ the true Doctor, and teacher of perfection tells them seauen times in one Chapter,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> that they were meere hypocrites and dissemblers.</p>
            <p>The Sadduces so pure in their owne conceit, that<note place="margin">Sadduces.</note> they onely, and no other were the true Iustitiaries: yet were they so sottish that they neither knew An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, nor spirit; and then iudge how brutish, how bestiall, and how carnall they were.</p>
            <p>The Essens thought themselues both essentiall,<note place="margin">Essen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

They wore white robes at all their refections, they obserued so strictly and precisely the Sabbath, that in that day they would not make a fire, nor stop a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">Ioseph. anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit. lib. 18. cap. 2.

            <p>The Hemerobaptists euery day did baptize and<note place="margin">Hemerobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists.</note> drench themselues in water, imagining that all their sinnes were thereby washed away, <hi>for <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These were the seemings of Iudaisme, all dying in their dreaming diuinitie. In Christendome what
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3525:21"/>
should I recall from hell the old <hi>Cathari,</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended<note place="margin">Epiph de hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note> the onely purity of life? the <hi>Gnostiques</hi> that had (as they deemed) the impropriation of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine knowledge; or <hi>Manes</hi> that onely boasted of the <hi>Paraclete:</hi> seeing our later age of fresher memorie hath heard of, yea and seene fanaticall Anabaptists, dreaming Euthusiasts of reuelation, and hideous visions, rebaptizations, and new pretended policie of Church, and common wealth? And we see many are daily misled, and misperswaded by Iesuites, the rare illuminates accompted of the world, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend aboue all the rest of their frie to be the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in respect of their direction in all negociations, <hi>in ordine ad Deum;</hi> and most sacred in that holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise which they obtrude vpon their nouices, that subiect and deuote themselues vnto them; yet are they no other indeed but the Chimeraes, and Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons heads of ridiculous and fanaticall fopperie.</p>
            <p>From out all these impious and impure routes of pretended purity and perfection, the view of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred beauty of the true purity, and perfection of Christ Iesus doth deliuer vs; and teacheth vs that men are deceiued most with shewes, and that the diuell when he meanes most mischiefe then doth he (as <hi>Iezabel</hi> did) paint and set out himselfe to shew. Let vs therefore hence learne important considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and wise iudgements, and let vs trie the spirits whether they be of God, or no; for all is not gold that glittereth, saith the old, and true English Adage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:3525:22"/>Is there one that can cunningly expound the Scriptures?

            <p>Beware then of false prophets, and be assured that as many as partake of this beauty are essentially sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, not in words onely but in deeds, not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit or opinion, but in vnderstanding and verity; for whatsoeuer they beleeue, it is either of nature, grace, or glory.

The blessings of grace they reade, they perceiue, they enioy, and ioy in the certaine expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of glory which euen now they haue a taste of and earnestly long after.

            <p>Let then a beleeuing soule say, O Lord Iesus what shall I repay vnto thee for this thy loue? I owed the debt, and thou didst pay it: I haue sinned, and thou art punished; this whole worke of thine is singular patience, the performance of it wonderfull humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the cause vnspeakeable charity. I haue circuited the whole earth, and can finde no where any such loue, as in thy glorious passion, the breadth whereof is Charity diffused, dilating it selfe into the fowre parts of the world. The length is long suffering, for thou hast borne mans iniquities; the height is the hope of heauen, and a certaine assurance of the same. The depth of it, is deliuerance from the lowest deepe the pit of fatall and finall destruction. If any should perswade me to come downe from the high medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this sacred mystery, I should greatly refuse it: for it shall euer be a bundle of Myrrhe betweene my breasts; yea here will I die, and not descend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Lord stretch his hand from heauen, and take me into his holy sanctuary.</p>
            <p>But to the retchlesse and respectlesse soule which regardeth none of this, our welbeloued saith farther, See what I suffer; these paines, these grones, these
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3525:25"/>
moanes, these nayles, these thornes, this speare; this profusion, and red sea of crimson bloud: yet am I much more inly tormented, that thy wilfull soule should yet be vnthankfull for this so vnspeakable loue, for this so vnutterable and grieuous passion, sustained for thy sake, to make thee a wretched sonne of man by nature, to become a blessed sonne of God by grace.</p>
            <p>Let vs beloued, and beleeuing brethren take yet a reuiew of this blessed beauty in the sacred mixture of white and red, for he is ruddy both in himselfe, and in his mysticall members. 1. In himselfe his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty appeares ruddie; for in the sacrament he is white in the bread, and red in the wine: therefore in the Scripture stiled sometime Manna, which was white, like the christall dew; and sometime a Vine which yeeldeth red grapes to glad the heart of man. The grapes of this sacred vine were the parts of his body, the crosse the wine presse, his bloud the holy liquor thereof, making glad both God, and man: God in the holy obedience of his sacred Sonne, purchasing himselfe a glorious kingdome; and man in the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his sinfull soule. These sacred seales of bread and wine shew the Lords death vntill he come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>Iosephs</hi> coate besprinkled with bloud, porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to old <hi>Israel</hi> as dead, but not actually; but these shew our true <hi>Ioseph</hi> to be crucified, and done to death in deed; and yet he like <hi>Sanpsons</hi> lion sends forth euen in, &amp; after his death, sweete hony combes, and most redolent graces. For his death abateth the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3525:26"/>
sting of death, abandoneth sinne, despoileth sathan the strong man of his weapons, and procureth for vs that die in him the land of the liuing.</p>
            <p>This holy mixture of white and red appeared in the opening of his side, whence flowed water and bloud, this blessed opening being much more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull then <hi>Moses</hi> rod; for that caused water one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to come out of the rocke, but this both water and bloud. The Fathers therefore obserue, that as out of the side of the first <hi>Adam</hi> the woman was taken by whom came sinne: so out of the side of the second <hi>Adam</hi> the Church should be framed, to saue (as <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> arke) the sonnes of men from the generall and fearefull deluge of sinne, and shame. Let then now all Histories tell, or historiographers of the world shew if in any age they haue seene or read, how that a mans limmes did showre downe streames of bloud, or that in any agony the face of man should stand beset with drops of crimson bloud. Neither doth this content the holy wisdome of God, but that also wee should see this loue of Christ resembled, yea testified vnto vs againe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, euen in his mysticall members, that is, in the beleeuers, by forgiuing whose sinnes he hath made them pure and white in his fight, and giuing also many of them grace, and honouring them so farre, that they willingly suffered as martyrs, whereby they also became purple red. Of the first white this is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood: <hi>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be cleane;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> 
               <hi>wash me, and I shall be whiter then snow.</hi> This is the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3525:26"/>
perfect beauty indeed to be purged from sinne. Of the second it is said of his beloued martyrs, <hi>That they</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apoc. 12.</note> 
               <hi>were prodigall of their liues euen vnto the death,</hi> for the testimony of the Lord Iesus. Such were <hi>Iames, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas, Ignatius, Polycarpus</hi> in the former ages; and all other euen those thousands (in hose <hi>Mariana tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>) whom fire and faggot deuoured, and all other exquisite torments that could be deuised by the wicked, bloudy, butcherlike mindes of Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. All which blessed soules were translated to God whom they loued, in fierie chariots of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and were rapt vp with <hi>Elias</hi> to the vision of the eternall God. This being indeed their matchlesse felicitie, that they were so greatly honored of their God, that they should shadow out vnto him his Christ whipped, stocked, striken, stoned, tormented, tortured, and bloudily butchered.</p>
            <p>Let not then the vaine and gallant minions of the world boast of their venereous ladies, or of their bright curtizans, or <hi>Helenaes,</hi> on whom they dote, which are but as the dunghils &amp; vnsauory salt of the earth; for behold here is a lillie and a rose from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, euen our Lord Iesus, a white lillie deuoide of sinne, and a damaske rose in his pure and crimson passion. And let them againe behold his martyrs as pure lillies cloathed with his righteousnesse, and as red roses in their sacred martyrdomes, into whose ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar euery beleeuing soule should desire rather to be registred, then in the catalogue of all the worlds misbeleeuing or misperswaded <hi>Magnificoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:3525:27"/>And seeing beloued that we are come to bloud, let vs pause a little, and stand still awhile as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did when in the wars they came, and saw <hi>Azael</hi> lie weltring in his bloud; and let vs see the godly suffer for the godles, the guiltlesse for the guilty. Let vs looke vp to the crosse, and see our Sauiour lie wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, gasping, crying, bathing, strugling, and dying in his bloud. <hi>Dauid</hi> could say, when he saw the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of the Lord kill the people with the plague of pestilence: <hi>I haue sinned, what haue these sheepe done?</hi> But Christ might haue said otherwise; <hi>These sheepe haue sinned, what haue I done?</hi> I am constrained to pay the things I neuer tooke. What more (blessed brethren) could he haue done for his vineyard? what greater loue can be shewed, then for a man to die for his friends? yet our welbeloued died for vs his enemies. But what doth the Lord require at our hands in retribution for all these blessings? Surely onely faith, and feruency of zeale, by which we also shall become white and ruddie by his sanctifying and by his sauing grace. Faith is as <hi>Iacobs</hi> hand, which will not let the Angell go vntill he haue the blessing. It is also as <hi>Iacobs</hi> robe put on to gaine our elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ Iesus his blessings; and it is the wedding garment wherewith we must enter into the wedding house of our spouse. And feruency of zeale is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of our loue, and is an heroicall, and magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vertue shed in our hearts by the holy Ghost, whereby we are moued to holy anger when either the glory of God, his truth, or his honor is violated.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3525:27"/>
Behold the zealous, and ruddy beautified Christians in this kind: <hi>Who will rise with me against the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked? or who will take my part against the euill doers?</hi> saith <hi>Dauid</hi> the Lords worthy; And in another<note place="margin">Psalm. 119.</note> Psalme, <hi>I fainted because men kept not thy law.</hi> And againe, <hi>The zeale of thine house hath euen eaten me vp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The zeale of God doth eate one vp, when God giueth such courage and magnanimity of heart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some one man, that he withstands many migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and malicious transgressors; and yet is not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from his holy valour and resolution, though the earth be moued, and the mountaines caried into the midst of the sea. Such an one was <hi>Elias</hi> against all Baals false prophets, and <hi>Micheas</hi> against the foure hundred false prophets of <hi>Ahab:</hi> and of late yeares <hi>Martin Luther</hi> against the Pope and all his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But we in our last, and worst age eate vp the zeale of God, because wee do not resist the euill wherein <hi>totus mundus ponitur,</hi> the whole world lieth; nor the arrogancie of the presumptuous, nor the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the mighty, nor the haughtines of the proud, nor the tyrannie of the oppressors: but like bastards, and not children, declaring to our owne selues that we haue not one drop of the good bloud of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father in vs; for <hi>bonus sanguis non mentitur:</hi> honorable bloud cannot dissemble, we suffer God to be blasphemed in our hearing, Christ to be scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, his sacred Ministrie to be despised; and we in the meane while either assent thereunto, or neglect to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3525:28"/>
rebuke it; which sheweth that we partake not at all of this diuine and roselike beautie.</p>
            <p>O that the Seraphicall zeale of God had inflamed the Princes, the Prelates, and people of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world, as it did <hi>Dauid:</hi> not a martiall zeale which is a feruour without discretion, but a zeale according to knowledge; not anger <hi>per vitium,</hi> but holy anger by zeale; not priuate grudge, but zeale appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the vocation and calling we are of, which hath both a good roote, and a good end. Such as was <hi>Elias</hi> zeale for the Lord of hoastes against idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: Such as was <hi>Phineas</hi> zeale against the beastli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Zmiri</hi> the sonne of <hi>Sale,</hi> and <hi>Cozbi:</hi> Such as was <hi>Ezechias</hi> zeale for the peoples reuolt; Such as was good king <hi>Iosias</hi> zeale, for the Lords dishonor among the Priests: Such as was <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> zeale when he heard the people speake halfe Hebrew, halfe Ashdod, halfe Sur, halfe Sion, halfe Christ, halfe Belial.</p>
            <p>Oh, to these holy Cherubicall zeales I exhort you (beloued) in the name of the Lord. Be you angrie with those that are angrie with God, when tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion befals them, or if their hearts bee not glutted with all the delights they desire, or if God do not fill their bellies with onions, and garlike, and other such like grosnesse. Be angrie with preachers that lie as <hi>Ionah</hi> did vnder the gourd, and preach not. Be angrie with the dogs that returne to their vomit, and with hogs that wallow in the mire, albeit they haue bene ten times purged. Be angrie with vice that

            <p>Let your station be like that of <hi>Elias</hi> in mount Horeb, who stood in the clifts of the rockes entrance, vntill the strong wind, the earthquake, and the fire (in all which God was not) were passed by; but when he heard a soft, and still voice, he came out, and stood before the Lord: so let vs be continually meditating the passion and rents of our rocke Christ Iesus, and hiding our selues therein, while the winds of wickednesse, the earthquakes of changings and chances, the fire of might and malice, and while all the works of darkenesse (wherein God is not) passe by; vntill we heare a soft, and sweete voice of the Lord to call vs forth of our station to rest: Then let vs go forth willingly vnto our welbeloued, and loue him, and liue with him for euer.

to Gods blessed promise made to the Patriarks, Prophets, and to all the faithfull.</p>
            <p>For he is <hi>the chiefest of ten thousand,</hi> &amp;c. or as some reade it, the chiefest of twelue thousand; where in wee may see the mystery of the number, both of ten and twelue; as also the excellency of the partie, that he is the chiefest in heauen, and the choicest on earth, together with the perfection of both heauen and earth in himselfe, and imparted to his chosen the Church of the redeemed. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, imitating the Platonists, are very superstitious in numbers, the one putting a fatall necessity in them in the period of estates and kingdomes; the other affirming a certaine secret efficacy to be in many numbers, but in the septenary number especially. Hence haue they their canonicall houres for prayer, and sacrifice. But <hi>Bodin</hi> in his booke <hi>de Repub.</hi> iustly taxeth <hi>Plato</hi> for that dreame. And the schooles conclude against them both, that <hi>Numeri, qua nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus, nulla vis, nulla efficacia.</hi> Wee therefore will content our selues with the holy and mysticall vse, which the booke of God maketh of them. The my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall numbers of sacred text are these, to wit, three, foure, fiue, sixe, seauen, eight, ten, twelue. Ten and twelue meete vs in this text by variation of readings, both signifying perfection. Ten is the highest of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple numbers, all nations after ten begin to number againe. The tenths was consecrated to the Priests, Gods seruants. In the tenth moneth the waters of <hi>Noahs</hi> floud abated. <hi>Sem</hi> a father of the faithfull
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3525:29"/>
seeth the tenth age: Ten words for the Creation of the world, and ten words for the gouernment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as the Talmudists obserue.</p>
            <p>For twelue, we reade of twelue Patriarches the sonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> twelue stones set vp in Iordan, twelue precious stones in the breast plate of <hi>Aaron.</hi> At twelue yeares <hi>Salomon</hi> decideth the plea of the dead child. Christ the true <hi>Salomon</hi> at twelue yeares disputeth with the Doctors. Twelue Apostles are sent to perfect the kingdome of grace. Twelue foundations, twelue gates, twelue Angels the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; a tree that beareth twelue manner of fruites medicinable all the twelue moneths of the yeare, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the perfection of the kingdome of glory in the celestiall Ierusalem.</p>
            <p>Thus we see, that the mysterie of the number sheweth onely the excellency of the perfection of the partie, being the chiefest in heauen and earth, so described by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Diuine, Apoc. 5. A throne is seene in heauen, one sitting theron hauing a booke in his hand written within and without, sealed with seauen seales. But none was found neither in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, nor in earth, nor vnder the earth worthie to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the booke, no nor once to looke into it. Then wept the Diuine because none was found worthie to open the booke; or once to looke therein. But one of the Elders said, Weepe not: Behold the Lion of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> the stocke of <hi>Dauid,</hi> hath so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, that he may open the booke, and loose the seales thereof.</p>

whereby he became flesh, he hath redeemed vs from being worse then very brute beasts. For man being in honor vnderstood it not, and therefore was compared to the beasts that perish. <hi>S.

Aske your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,</hi> saith <hi>Moses, and the daies of old, euen since the day that God created man vpon the earth, and aske from the one end of heauen vnto the other, if there come to passe such a great thing as this. Did euer people heare the voice of God speaking out of the midst of a fire, as thou hast heard, and liued?</hi> If <hi>Moses</hi> spake thus of the voice of an Angell (for the law was giuen by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie of Angels) what may we say of the gracious words of eternall life, vttered by the Lord of life? Indeed the cloud that led the people of God in the wildernesse, was darke toward the Aegyptians, but bright and lightsome toward the Israelits: So <hi>if our Gospell be hid, it is hid to them that are lost,</hi> for now the booke is opened, and the seales loosed.</p>
            <p>By Baptisme the second seale we put on Christ, Gal. 3. 2. <hi>For as many as are baptized into Christ, haue put on Christ,</hi> &amp; are engraffed into him by the Spirit, Rom. 6. <hi>For if we be graffed into him by the similitude of his death: euen so shall we be in the similitude of his resurrection.</hi> It being the lauacre of regeneration both priuatiuely, and positiuely; priuatiuely in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing

            <p>His descent the fourth seale was the death of death, and the death of the diuell who had the power of death, the ruine of the gates of hell, that they might neuer preuaile against his people, the triumph ouer darknesse, and the defiance of all hellish power, and principalities.</p>

            <p>Which things that we may performe, behold Christ the chiefest in heauen hath opened the book, that we might know them, and loosed the seales that we might do them. Woe therefore be vnto them to whom his booke is yet shut, and those seales yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loosed,

for our Gospell is hid to none but to them that are lost. Christ Iesus is also the chiefest to be found on earth. In the Reuelation of S. Ioh. Chap. 7. there are 144000 sealed by twelues; Christ is sealed in the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> in whom also the rest are sealed, to be the associats of the Lambe, according to that ancient prophecy of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 49. saying, that <hi>the Scepter should not depart from Iuda vntill Silo come.</hi> And against <hi>Dan</hi> he prophecieth thus; <hi>O Lord<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I haue waited for thy saluation,</hi> meaning Christ. Thus the Chaldaean paraphrasts.</p>
            <p>I will not here mention the pourtraiture which <hi>Pub. Lentul.</hi> sent vnto the Senate of Rome, describing the lineaments of our Sauiour, as he was vpon earth: That he was gracious in aspect, of a smooth brow, of an aburne haire, long, and wauing at his backe like a Nazarite, with a parted beard, and the whole frame of his blessed body being incomparably beyond all men that euer were, both in feature and fauour. For I am not ignorant how apocriphall that relation is in sacred history, and how grosly the Papists abuse themselues, and others in the table painting, &amp; lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of that Lord of life, according to the rude hand of many an idle lozel, that dares aduenture to pourtray that sacred beautie. But what a one the Scripture mystically hath decyphered, and described him to be, that willingly will we looke vpon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with awfull eyes of feare, and diuine reuerence. And therein also we shall see him <hi>the chiefest of ten thousand.</hi>

For he was fairer then the sonnes of men. Gracious in his speech, for grace was powred from his lips: valiant in his acts, for he was mighty in renowne: powerfull in his facts, for his arrowes pierced the hearts of his enemies: splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in his royalty, his throne being for euer, and his scepter, a scepter of righteousnesse it selfe. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent in his whole deportment, for all his garments smell of Myrrhe, Aloes, and Cassia.</p>
            <p>The beauty of <hi>Ioseph, Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Absolon</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in Scripture, but the first had an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring beauty, the father, and the sonne goodly to be looked on; but in Christ it was the beauty of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and not of defection: <hi>Nullus in egregio corpore naeuus erat.</hi> The Iewes indeed saw no beauty, forme, or feature in his face, Esay 53<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> yet was he peerelesse, being void of all staine, either of sinne or shame; the most absolute perfection of beauty. For his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, what eloquence may declare it? The Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> and the Romane <hi>Cicero,</hi> are herein but rudesbies. <hi>Hercules</hi> that was conceiued to draw multitudes after him with golden chaines, <hi>si ad illum co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>paretur, nihil est.</hi> The Queene of the South comes to heare the wisdome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> matchlesse in his time: but behold our true <hi>Salomons</hi> eloquence, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> being yet but a child of twelue yeares, the grand Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors are amazed to heare, Luke 2.

Yet this gracious eloquence, and heauenly charming was follie to the Pharisies, who thrust him out, Lu. 4. 29. and to the vnbeleeuers madnes, and therefore they cry, <hi>He hath a diuell.</hi> So euen at this day, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.</note> of prophecie (which indeed is the sauor of life vnto life) becomes to some misperswaded misbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers the fauor of death vnto death. Neither is this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence of this chiefest the delicacy of words, but the efficacie of power; for out of his mouth goeth a two edged sword, Apoc. 1. 16. By the eloquence of his word he leadeth the facile, with the terrour of his<note place="margin">Volentes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, nolentes trahit.</note> sword he enforceth the stubborne, and vnwilling: for if his word preuaile not, which deuides &amp; discernes; deuides betweene the soule and the spirit, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and the ioynts, and discerneth the very intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heart; then his sword, the rod of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mouth shall plague them, and <hi>the breath of his mouth shall kill them.</hi> Esay 11. 4.</p>
            <p>As for his power, who was euer able to resist it? either Heroique, or Heretique?

Among the ranke of heretiques, let the wretched ends of <hi>Arrius, Nestorius,</hi> and <hi>Euty ches</hi> be presidents of his power &amp; puissant renowne. And besides all this, the glorious increase, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfection of his Church, maugre the proiects of all his open, and secret enemies. The splendor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is so eminent, that it remaineth firme &amp; stedfast, when other powers haue yeelded thereunto: For <hi>his kingdome shall haue no end.</hi> Esay 9. 7. <hi>The zeale of the Lord of hostes shall bring it to passe.</hi> And God the Father hath giuen him <hi>a kingdome that shall not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away,</hi> Dan. 7. 14.

crucified him. And therfore the spouse representing the Church of the redeemed, saith in the Cant. <hi>We</hi>

               <hi>will runne after thee in the sweete odors of these thine oyntments, and fragrant perfumes,</hi> the sacred confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy most perfect nature.</p>
            <p>Thus we see our welbeloued to be the chiefest in heauen, and the choicest on earth, yea the perfection both of heauen and earth, both in himselfe, and also in his redeemed Church. For he is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, by which the heauens and the earth were perfected. The Elohim by whom al things in the great vniuerse receiue speciall perfection in particular; he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> all sufficient for himselfe and others, rightly resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to the glorious Sunne, that hath light sufficient for it selfe, and for both the superior, and this inferior world also.</p>
            <p>He is <hi>Ens simplicissimum,</hi> and things the more simple, and deuoide of commixture, the more pure and perfect they are, as heate is the more it selfe the lesse it is intermingled with cold; and wine the lesse it is alayed with water, and gold the lesse drosse is in it, the more refined. But our welbeloued is most pure and perfect without any the least dramme of blending or commixture.</p>
            <p>In a word, he is the perfection of life, motion, and being.<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Of life; for who so liueth not in him is dead alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, albeit he hath a name that he liueth.</p>
            <p>Of motion; for who so moueth not in him is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, and doth <hi>peregrinariÃ  Domino vitae,</hi> estrange
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3525:35"/>
himselfe from the Lord of life.</p>
            <p>Of being; for who so is not in him by his Spirit, is subiect to be lost by an eternall priuation.</p>
            <p>In his Church of the redeemed he is also of most absolute perfection, which Church consisteth both of men and Angels, he being the perfection of both: who albeit he was made man, yet was he God from euerlasting, laied in a cratch, yet adored by Angels from heauen, and worshipped by sages on earth. The Iewes saw no beauty, nor comlinesse in him, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing eyes saw in the mount a glimpse of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which rauished them with exceeding great ioy. He was baptized as man, yet forgiueth sins as God; he hungred, yet filleth a thousand hungry soules with the bread of life, the Angels foode. He prayed as man, yet heareth our prayers as God: he wept as man, yet wipeth all teares from our eyes.</p>
            <p>In a word, he is the perfection of prophecie and priesthood, of sacrifice and sacrament.</p>
            <p>I exhort you therefore beloued and blessed in the Lord Iesus; seeing that the chiefest, and choicest man and woman among vs is more then a litle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, let vs flie and hasten to our perfection, to be perfect men and women in Christ Iesus, and to rest and abide with him, that we may be beautifull, and perfect, as surely all those shall be that abide stedfast, and are found in Iesu Christ, according to his effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall prayer, Iohn 17. <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi> For by him was our creation, in him is our preseruation, and of him shall
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3525:35"/>
be our eternall felicity, and perfection.</p>
            <p>Let vs then (men, fathers and brethren) returne vnto him with stedfast eyes lift vp to heauen, where our perfection is; with bowed knees of humility, and grace, and with pure hands lifted vp to the throne of God, without wrath, or enuying, euen to him that was, and is, and is to come; that he would grant vs continuance of that we are to be his, and giue vs sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie of that we want, and that we resolue that it is our chiefest grace, and choicest beauty, to haue the least resemblance of his diuine perfection in vs. Euen so Lord Iesus. To whom with the Father, and the holy Ghost, be rendred all praise, perfection, power, maiestie, and glory, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ages, for euermore.</p>
