         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O Lord God, infinite in power, by whom the Thrones of Kings are eſtabliſhed, and their perſons made ſacred; take
(wee beſeech thee) into thy immediate and divine protection, thine Anointed Servant, the King, that no ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
prophane hand may come neere to touch him; in all his wayes let thy Spirit guide him, and thy holy Angels
pitch their Tents about him; And though he bee deprived of all earthly Councellours, doe thou continue to be his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
from Heaven; comfort him in his troubles, defend him in his dangers, ſupport him in his Cauſe: Bleſſe him in the
comfortable fruition of his Royall Conſort the Queen, in the ſafe returne of the Prince, in the proſperity and welfare of the
reſt of his Royall Progeny, and in the confuſion of all thoſe that riſe up againſt him, and indeavour his privation in theſe
bleſſings. Shew ſom token upon Him for good, even now O God, when the ſonns of violence are in the higheſt of their pride,
when they have conſpired and banded themſelves together, to ſeperate thoſe whom thou haſt conjoyned, to <hi>levell</hi> thoſe
whom thou haſt not made common, to pull downe him whom thou haſt exalted, and to root out that Religion which thine
owne right hand hath planted. Defeat their purpoſes, O thou preſerver of men, and let not their miſchievous imaginations
any longer proſper, but blaſt all their counſels, wither away their power like graſſe ſcorched with the Sunne; Bow down at
laſt their ſtiffe neckes and obdurate hearts, to a deſire of that peace which hath ſo long been an abomination to them, that
this miſerable Nation may no further purſue their owne ruine, and take pleaſure in ſhedding their owne bloud; but being
by ſo many bitter puniſhments made ſenſible of thy anger, for this unnaturall diviſion, may at laſt bee reduced within their
firſt obedience, to the glory of thy Name, the vindication of our defamed Religion, the joy of our afflicted King, and the
happineſſe of this yet bleeding Kingdome; And confirme all this to us. O Lord, by the merits, and through the mediation
of thine owne deare Sonne Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>2. A Prayer for the ending of theſe preſent Troubles.</head>
            <p>O Moſt juſt and powerfull Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth, wee cannot but acknowledge,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat the manifold miſeries which have befallen us, are the due reward of our deeds, and that we have
deſerved, that the things which belong to our peace ſhould ſtill be hid from our eyes; for when of
thy owne free mercy thou wert pleaſed to grant us a long time of plenty and proſperity, more then thou
gaveſt to any of the Nations that are about us, wee became weary of our happineſſe, and by our ingratitude
pulled upon us theſe Judgements which now threaten deſolation to this late flouriſhing Kingdome, and
ſince the time of our affliction thou haſt given us ſpace to repent, and we repented not, iniquity hath ſtill
more and more abounded; as heretofore thy mercies did not allure us, ſo now thy judgements have not
humbled us to a ſerious conſideration of our miſdemeanours. Now (O Lord) we finde our ſelves intangled
and wearied by our owne counſels, the troubles of our heart are inlarged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our iniquities and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which attend upon them, are a burden too heavy for us to beare. And therefore in the anguiſh and
bitterneſſe of our ſoules we returne unto thee, (in whom alone is our helpe) to have reſpect unto the prayers
of thy ſervants. O ſhut not thy loving kindneſſe in diſpleaſure, let not thine anger burne againſt the ſheep
of thy paſture, but binde up the breach of this people; let the ſighing of the Priſoners come before thee;
behold the teares of the diſtreſſed Orphanes and Widdowes, and of all ſuch as are oppreſſed, and have no
Comforter. How long, O Lord, holy and true, doſt thou forbeare to command deliverances? Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thy tender mercies which have been ever of old, and ſave us as thou haſt done heretofore: Remember
thy promiſe of deliverance to thoſe who call upon thee in the day of trouble; And when the bloud that hath
beene ſhed by oppreſſion calls aloud for vengeance, O then hearken unto the voyce of thy Sonnes Bloud,
which ſpeakes better things; Behold the Lambe of God, who was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and
bruiſed for our iniquities: And to this end, regard the ſincerity of thine Anointed, maintaine thine owne
Cauſe, and preſerve unto him that power which thou haſt given him; binde his ſoule in the bundle of life,
let mercy and truth preſerve him, and let his Throne be eſtabliſhed for ever before thee. Bleſſe them that
are peaceable and faithfull in the Land; and as for thoſe that have riſen up againſt him, we beſeech thee to
melt and mollifie their hearts to the entertainment of compaſſion and love; reclaime them to obedience,
lay not their ſinne to their charge, but guide tdeir feet into the way of peace: Give to thoſe that have done
wrong the grace to repent; and to thoſe that have ſuffered wrong, mindes ready to forgive: And if any ſhall
be averſe from Peace, O thou that art the wonderfull Counſellour, turne their wiſdome into fooliſhneſſe,
confound their practiſes, and let their miſchiefe returne upon their own heads.</p>
            <p>And when thou haſt vouchſafed to give us that tranquility which we beg at thy hands, give us grace to
embrace it with all thankfulneſſe, to obey our Goveruours, to live at unity among our ſelves, evermore
bleſſing thy glorious Name, which is exalted above all bleſſing and praiſe, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.
