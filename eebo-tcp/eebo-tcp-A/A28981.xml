            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT has been an Injury too often done to the Memory of Perſons eminent for Knowledge,
<pb facs="tcp:44037:4"/>
Learning, and Virtue, to have after their Death ſuch Works obtruded upon the World for theirs, as have been deſervedly ſuſpected; or if theirs, yet were never intended by them in that ſqualid, broken, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect condition, to have been publiſhed. But as for this Tract you were pleaſed to put into my hands to peruſe, it is not only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it was Wrote by the Honourable Perſon whoſe Name it bears; but
<pb facs="tcp:44037:4"/>
alſo that it was deſigned by him for the Preſs; as ſome Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in it do apparently ſhew.</p>
            <p>And if this Noble and Learned Author thought it ſeaſonable for thoſe Times<note place="margin">Anno 1647.</note> of Uncontroul'd Liberty and Confuſion in which it was wrote, it is as ſeaſonable, if not more, at the preſent; when that Vice againſt which it is directed, has of late Years ſo far prevail'd, to the great Diſhonour of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as our Religion, that the Patriots of our
<pb facs="tcp:44037:5"/>
Countrey aſſembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, have been thereby juſtly provok'd to prepare that late Bill (which ſince has paſs'd the Royal Aſſent) for the better and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Puniſhment and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it.

            <head>THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THESE Two Tracts against <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary Swearing</hi> and <hi>Curſing,</hi> lately met with amongſt the Papers of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Quality, and an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Acquaintance of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Mr. <hi>Robert Boyle,</hi> Tranſcribed by his own Hand; were found upon Peruſal, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb facs="tcp:44037:7"/>
and Fitted for the Preſs; except the Cloſe of a Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Epiſtle to his Noble Siſter, the Counteſs of <hi>Kildare,</hi> which (as far as appears by the Copy) he had but juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
            <p>The Year inſerted on the Title Page, as well as a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage or two in the former of theſe, ſhews that it was Penned toward the latter end of the late <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy Times, when he was about Twenty Years Old; by which time (if I am not miſtaken) this was the Third Treatiſe he had prepared for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
<pb facs="tcp:44037:7"/>
the other Two being that of <hi>Seraphick Love,</hi> afterwards Printed, and <hi>An Eſſay of Miſtaken Modeſty,</hi> referred to in this.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſay (though there is a ſenſible Conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Style of theſe and others of his Books) but that this Honourable Author, if he had been to write<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon this Argument in his Riper Years, might have given it a finer Turn; and added, out of his vast ſtore of Learning and Thought, much to the weight and force of it. But there is in the management of
<pb facs="tcp:44037:8"/>
it, ſuch a ſtrain of Modeſty and unaffected Piety, ſuch an affectionate Zeal for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Almighty God, and ſuch a paſſionate concernment for the Well-doing and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for whoſe uſe this ſeems more eſpecially deſigned; and in fine, ſo much Truth, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Obſervation (as the <hi>Pleas</hi> and <hi>Excuſes</hi> here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and anſwered ſhew) that muſt above all recommend it to ſuch as have his Name in Remembrance and Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44037:8"/>A Name, methinks, better than that of Sons and of Daughters, than that of Blood and Deſcent; and that ſhould provoke thoſe of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Extraction and Station, to an Imitation of ſo Worthy and Glorious an Example.</p>
            <p>What happy Inſtruments might they then be of Good to Mankind, by their wiſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and their exemplary Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues! What a reſtraint would this lay, above that of Laws, on their Dependants and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors! For how would ſuch dare to offend, that are ſure to find no Countenance or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection?
<pb facs="tcp:44037:9"/>
And what Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Countenance could they expect from their Superiors, whoſe Lives would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Reproof, and where they could find no more a Preſident, than they do a Law to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them in their wicked Oaths and Blaſphemies. To bring theſe Vices into diſparagement, and to repreſent the Folly, as well as the Sin of them to the better-bred part of Mankind, was the Generous and Pious Deſign of this Learned Author; and of thoſe Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that from their Relation to him by Blood or Friendſhip,
<pb facs="tcp:44037:9"/>
have been concerned in the Publication.</p>
            <p>Toward the utter Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of which amongſt us, there ſeems to be, as human means, nothing more neceſſary than the Vigilance of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, who are now as well and fully Empowered, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by the Law to ſee to the Puniſhment of it; and for the due Execution of which, they will moſt certainly have the good Wiſhes, Aſſiſtance, and Prayers of all Good men; and which is more than all, the Bleſſing and Rewards of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44037:10"/>I have only this to add, That the Second Tract, or Letter, ſeems to proceed from the ſame Hand with the Firſt, being agreeable to it in the Stile as well as the Deſign of it; and ſo the Naming Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> in it, is but a decent Cover for the Concealment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                        <p>As for the ſuppoſal this Miſtake is built on (the Involvedneſs of all men in the Guilt of Swearing) it is as weak as 'tis uncharitable; for (beſides that to allow no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy an Innocence from ſwearing, is as much a Slander to mankind in its preſent condition, as it would be its Crime if the accuſation were true) our Saviour gives us the World's Example rather for a Caution, than for Imitation: Where he tells us, That the Way to Hell is a Road, and throng'd<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 13.</note> with Numerous Travellers; but Heaven's Path is narrow, and the Gate that inlets to thoſe Manſions of Bliſs, as unfrequented as 'tis ſtrait.

'Twould be a ſtrange ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity in Phyſick, becauſe a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence is more diſpers'd and epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical, to think it therefore the leſs dangerous; or to believe that the Multitude of ſtinking Carkaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes can leſſen the Noiſomneſs of the Stench.

on Revenge: It being with the guilty Kingdoms as with leaking Boats, where the Number of the Paſſengers but makes them ſink more nimbly.

To paſs over this, that the ſame Conſiderations that contract the Number of your Oaths, do aggravate their Guilt, by arguing both a clearer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

of the ill you act, and a more bridling power to reſtrain it. But alas! how ſeldom does the ſilence of his Conſcience make for the Swearer? We know that Inſenſibility of Pain may as well proceed from the deadneſs and ſtupifi'dneſs of the part, as from a perfect and unmoleſted Health. In fighting, that is held a heavier blow, that (ſtunning) takes away the ſenſe of Pain, than that which pains the Senſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware your Tranquility reſemble you not to the Toad, that feels not Poyſon, becauſe he is all Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and reſents no alteration from it, becauſe 'tis natural to him.

they are no Swearers, and thus commit the fault they would wipe off the imputation of. But wiſe Phyſicians hold it a fatal Symptom when Excrements are voided without the Patient's knowledge; and 'tis a ſign that the Thief has haunted long, when the Maſtiff forbears to bark at him. In ſuch caſes, Conſcience, like oppreſs'd Subjects under an arm'd Tyrant, forbears Expoſtulations, not out of want of the cauſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, but out of uſe of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

                        <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> at this day, (as I learn'd whilſt I lately convers'd with them at <hi>Amſterdam</hi>) have ſo profound a Reverence for that great Name of <hi>Jehovah</hi> (common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Nomen Tetragrammaton,</hi> and <hi>Ineffable,</hi> ſo frequently record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scriptures) that they hold it unlawful for Mortal Lips ſo much as to pronounce it: But tho I eſteem this fancy ſuitable enough to the reſt of the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies of their Modern Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, yet certainly their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition will condemn our Irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.

whip their froward Children that cry without cauſe) and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in his anger theſe raſh and culpable expreſſions of yours. As for the other branch of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, I mean the harmleſsneſs of your intent; to that I muſt reply, That our Actions may as well of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend as our Intents, if they be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to our knowledge of God's averſion to what we do. And uſually men take it for a ſufficient offence, to do what we are ſure will diſoblige them, tho with a differing deſign. Nor do we think our ſelves leſs injured by Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers when they ſtrip us, becauſe they offer us that violence, not with intent to anger us, but only to make a Booty of our Purſes. 'Tis a received Maxim in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which Moraliſts prop with their full concurrence, That no Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44037:35"/>
(much leſs bare Innocence) of the Intent can juſtify a formal ſinful evil. If then the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this ſin againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ill you act, be not crime enough to condemn you, you muſt not be deny'd my Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. But withal, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit moſt ſinners in the world up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſelf-ſame ſcore; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the threatned Flames of Hell as uninhabited as inſupportable; ſince certainly ſuch ſinners (if any ſuch there be) muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious no leſs for their unequal'd rarity, than deviliſh perverſeneſs, that are ſuch Monſters as to offend their Maker, merely to offend him. For in Philoſophy our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters teach us, That Ill under that notion cannot be the object of our choice; (that being ever a real, or at leaſt a ſeeming good);
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44037:35"/>
and tho in our miſguided electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we oftentimes embrace it, yet that is ever under a contrary notion, and rather by miſtake than by deſign.</p>
                        <p>But oh! how induſtrious are ſinners to deceive themſelves; and how ſtrangely does the Devil faſcinate and blind deluded Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, when (by ſuch ſilly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Excuſes) he perſuades them rather to expoſe their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to a certain diſcredit, than let their Souls be ranſom'd from an Ignoble Slavery, into a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Freedom; and rather ſuffer their Abilities to be believed weak, than permit their Lives to be made virtuous. Certainly, ſuch people would make me as much aſtoniſh'd as themſelves are faulty, if I did not conſider this gallant property, of rather ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44037:36"/>
bad Apologies to defend their Sins, than good Reſolutions to forſake them, as intail'd upon them by a kind of traduction from our firſt Parents, who hoped with Fig-leave Aprons, and the faint Shade of Trees, to hide both their Nakedneſs and their Diſobedience from the Omniſcient Eye of God himſelf.</p>
                        <p>I will not waſte Ink upon their ſucceſsleſs and impudent defence, that make their Drunkenneſs an Apology for their Swearing, and make that an excuſe for their ſin, which is it ſelf a ſin above excuſe; but with as little juſtice, as the Keeper of the Lions in the <hi>Tower</hi> could excuſe any particular Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy they had acted, by alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had voluntarily let them looſe. But ſince the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that moſt diſpoſe men to a

flux of Oaths, are Drunkenneſs and Choler, give me leave by the by, to take notice of the chief Midwives that are uſually aſſiſtant to the birth of Oaths; and to obſerve, That as the Thunder falls not, but when Heaven is over-caſt, ſo we are proneſt to ſwear, when the Beaſtlineſs of our Paſſions hath either blinded or depoſed our Reaſon.</p>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> This brings into my mind the known Story of that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44037:37"/>
merry Gentleman, who to ſhew the ſullen Juſtice how the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiff he had kill'd, had firſt aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him and overthrown him, runs full butt at the formal Sir's breaſt, and ſends both him and his Chair to ſalute the ground: For when a Sin cannot be imitated, without being committed, then that you but repeat it only, is as ſorry an excuſe, as his muſt be, who to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the relation of a Murder, ſhould Piſtol the firſt man he meets withal. Beſides, when did Tranſgreſſion by Preſident turn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence? and what was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Act, become legitimate in the Repetition? It is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the relating of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Oaths may ſometimes be not only lawful but neceſſary; but then it muſt be either to diſcover or convert the Swearer; or elſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44037:37"/>
when the Oath is ſome material Circumſtance of a ſerious Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. But here the very End adds guiltineſs to the Action, it being only to make another's Vice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded, and render his Sin both infectious and immortal. But how will you juſtify this introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of God's Name only (like a Fool in a Play) to make the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany laugh, and to bring it into contempt, from the diſobedience to the Prohibition of taking God's Name in vain? Unleſs (perhaps) the conſequents of your ſin teach you a conſtruction that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve this difficulty; and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments your ſwearing will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke, ſhew you in what ſenſe you have taken your Maker's Name <hi>in vain.</hi> Remember how ſad a Reckoning was preſented to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi>

the Wall, for having turn'd the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Temple into Implements and Furtherers of Mirth, at his ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Entertainment; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider betimes, that God may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly leſs reſent the making merry in his Holy Cups, than the making merry with his moſt Holy Name.</p>
                        <p>To this may well be added, That in this ſinning at the ſecond hand, the Copied Sin is held more criminal in the Tranſcript than in the Original; for beſides that this Swearer by Imitation acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges himſelf ſo delighted with the other's ſin, that he becomes the Devil's Mountebank (or his <hi>Zany</hi>) to have it admired by all that hear him (and we know that Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is but an after-Conſent); beſides this, I ſay, the Leading Swearer has the excuſe of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Applauſe; whereas the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44037:38"/>
Apiſh Repeater wrongs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credits his own Piety, only to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate and proclaim another's Wit; if that be not too partially term'd Wit, that appears ſuch only to our Corruptions: Since when the Oath muſt make the Jeſt, 'tis only the Devil in us that is pleas'd with it. Handſome Replies are good without Oaths, and dull ones will not be made good by them: To the one they are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, to the other they are uſeleſs; that being juſtly enough appliable to Oaths in Apothegms, which is uſually believ'd in painting of Faces, That Beauties need it not, and deformed Women look but ridiculouſly for it.</p>
                        <p>Fools (ſays the Wiſe-man) <hi>make a mock of ſin;</hi> they can take<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 9.</note> pleaſure to hear him affronted, in whoſe Communion conſiſts hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;

and make that the fewel of their jollity, that ſhould be the object of their deteſtation. For my part I do not like this doing in jeſt, what a man may be damn'd for in earneſt; and I much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that we frail Mortals, whoſe faults are more numerous than the very minutes we have liv'd, ſhould think our own ſins too few to condemn us, without adopting thoſe of others too! and to our crimes (too numerous already) adding theſe ſins of Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!

                        <p>There remains yet a prejudice to remove, which though very rarely the pretence of Swearers, is very often a prevalent motive to ſwearing, and is an evil by ſo much the more obſtructive to theſe

ſinners reclaiming, by how much the more ſilently it oppoſes it. This is a fooliſh fancy that many Swearers cheriſh, that their Oaths make them look'd upon with a kind of admiration, as Gentleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſins; and witneſs in them ſo bold and daring a courage, that it extends to a fearleſsneſs of God himſelf.</p>

Though of this ſort of Swearers (as of ſome Savages that lurk in Rocks and Woods) it be much more difficult to obtain a Battel, than to get a Victory; and to draw them to the Field, than to give them a Defeat.</p>
                        <p>Doubtleſs theſe needy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will never tempt the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Wiſe men upon any other ſcore, than that of the greatneſs of their folly.

to our Charity, the multitude of their imperfections and wants. Wiſe men will make theſe poor and empty projects, the objects ſolely of their ſcorn and laughter; and only thoſe that want eſteem for themſelves, will reward you with it; and for ſuch peoples praiſes, they will but diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you: So that that empty applauſe you are ambitious of, will either be impoſſible to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd, or not deſerve to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. But what, your Oaths will make men take you for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man! you are deceived, there is too little Epicuriſm and Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs in your vice, to be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that Quality.

I'm ſure it ſhould not be ſo; but grant it were, Will you pretend to Nobility, by that alone which is not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, but the vice of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? and entitle your ſelf to that illuſtrious Quality, by that which, in God's Eye, makes them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy (if not diveſts them) of it? At that rate your pretenſions would parallel his mirth, who boaſted a deſcent from the firſt <hi>Caeſars,</hi> barely upon his being (like moſt of them) almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formedly Hawk Nos'd; deriving his intereſt in their blood, only from his ſympathy with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>

                           <pb n="63" facs="tcp:44037:41"/>For my part, I muſt confeſs, I am not ambitious of thoſe badges of Gentility, that Chriſtianity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers for the ſymptoms of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: Nor do I find men deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of the Gout, though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb have appropriated that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe to Rich men.</p>

But ſince the kindred betwixt vertues is not ſo remote, that the want of any one ſhould conclude the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of any other, and your impiety convince us of your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; Experience teaches us, That
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44037:42"/>
no men more fear what they ſhould contemn, than thoſe that contemn moſt what they ſhould fear. And Martyrs have embrac'd thoſe Flames with joy, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious perſons durſt not ſo much as think of without horror.</p>
                        <p>That boldneſs that men perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate againſt their Maker (were it real) would not be the effect of their reſolution, but either of their inconſiderateneſs, or their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. <hi>The wicked flee</hi> (ſays <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>)<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 1.</note>

Nor will all men ſo eaſily conclude, that he that fears not to venture his Soul, dares free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venture his Body. For ſince it is not the eſſential worth of things,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44037:42"/>
but the proprietary's value of them, that their dearneſs to us is to be meaſured by: That ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, and moſt mens actions, will preſent us the ſoul and body in a very inverted order of preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; the greater part of men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the Body as if they were all Body, and ſlighting their Souls as if they had no Souls, or had them but to loſe. It being but too true of the very greateſt of thoſe people, that in themſelves as in their ſtables, the Employment of the Man is but to ſerve the Beaſt. And truly he that conſiders that the neglect of the Soul proceeds from the former dotage on the Body, will think that a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely conſequence, that infers a readineſs to hazard the latter, from the careleſsneſs of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the former.

Debts; the vanity being rather on the other ſide, who by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to diſclaim ſo ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a Grace, imply that they eſteem it to be their own Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Purchaſe.

Moral Virtues may perhaps be reſembled to Great Mens Cloaths, which ſupply thoſe that ſee them, with ſome conjectures of the Quality of thoſe that wear them:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44037:50"/>
But inſpired Graces (ſuch as Repentance is) are like their Liveries, whoſe Gawdineſs evinces not the Footman's Deſerts, but his Lord's Splendidneſs; and in mens eſteem entitles the Lacquey to nothing but a good Maſter. Thoſe better Qualities Blood may convey, or Induſtry acquire, like Honours conferr'd by Princes, ſuppoſe the Party deſerving; but Heavenly Donatives are like Alms, which ever preſume need; and where they are more liberally beſtow'd, ſtronglier conclude the greatneſs of the Party's Wants than Merits.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44037:51"/>
you are then further to be put in mind, that not only the Confeſſion of our Virtues is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable when it is neceſſary to your Juſtification, but (tho in all other caſes our actions ſhould commend us, not we our ſelves, Praiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Debt which he that pays himſelf, acquits all others of) even the mention of our own Praiſes is allowable, when they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, not to extol, but barely to vindicate us, and finds a ſufficient defence in its being neceſſary unto ours.</p>
                     <p>The owning of Repentance has ſo much of Penance in it, that there is not any Grace more indiſpos'd to a perverſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Vanity; for ſtill Repentance (like the Pardon it endeavours to procure) does preſuppoſe a Fault, having this particular unhappineſs
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44037:51"/>
above other Virtues, that men cannot arrive at it but through Vice. And therefore in the return to the diſintereſtedneſs of action, Virtue (who can ſcarce more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our love to her, than by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting unto us a higher degree of it) commonly recompenceth ſo unſelfiſh a Duty, by making it a powerful engagement to perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance againſt Relapſes; and any affront or loſs ſuſtain'd upon that ſcore, turns to a Bleſſing, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing in us towards Religion, the uſual property of Sufferers for a Cauſe, more Zeal and Paſſion for the Party men have been Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers for. But admit you could not own Repentance, without being fancied vain, muſt the fear of others ſins continue (thoſe that are immediately) yours? Will you rather let others ſin by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44037:52"/>
imitation of your bad actions, than in their miſconſtruction of your good ones? And will you quench the Spirit, and refrain from being virtuous, leſt men ſhould think you know your ſelf to be ſo? Eſpecially ſince our Ignorance in good Performances, tho it crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the act, degrades the Agent from the Title of Virtuous: Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue being a habitude elective, and election pre-requiring knowledge. Which reaſon I might fortify, by asking to what end Preachers ſhould light us ſo many Candles, and give us ſo many Touchſtones to diſcover and examine Graces with, if our being conſcious to our own Repentance were a fault that deſerved it? Undoubtedly, that were (and that were ſtrange) to make it our Duty to ſeek, what it were our Sin to find.</p>

                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:44037:52"/>This laſt Reflection I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit, by adding, That ſince our improvement of, and thankfulneſs for Grace, will be expected pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to our ſtock of it, (as the Parable of the Talents, and our Saviour's declaring, that <hi>where much is given, there alſo much will be required,</hi> evinces) we cannot without the knowledge of our Receits, know what our Returns muſt be (of Gratitude and Duty) to be anſwerable to them. The utmoſt that Modeſty does exact of you, is the declining of thoſe Praiſes your actions do deſerve, not the refraining actions that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Praiſe, for fear of being ſuſpected to affect it. But truly, Baſhfulneſs, tho in Maids thought a Virtue, in Virtue is a fault; for ſure it is one of the worſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements you can put upon the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44037:53"/>
Spirit, to lock him up in a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, for ſhame to own his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits.</p>
                     <p>The union betwixt Virtues is too ſtrict, and their aſſiſtances ſo reciprocal, that That may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be no Virtue, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the exerciſe of any, and does not rather facilitate than obſtruct it. Certainly 'tis better be accuſed of Vanity, than guilty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes; and if ſome Reputation muſt be loſt, 'tis fitter that you ſhould be diſhonoured by other mens faults, than God by yours; for he is good enough to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence his ſervants, not only for being good, but for their not being thought ſo for his ſake; and to make one day their Diſhonour (not only the Foil, but) the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of their Glory.

Your Apology is juſt as excuſing as the Murderer's would be, who ſhould alledge before

his Judge, that ſince he had been a Murderer from his Youth, he begs to be excuſed; but truly for his part he could not help it, and he muſt needs continue the Trade of cutting of Throats, that he had ſo long practic'd. Is not yours a holy conſequence, I have been wicked long, therefore I will continue ſo ſtill? Sure 'tis the Devil's Logick, from thoſe ſins that evidence the Juſtice of our ſuddener Repentance, to infer the legitimateneſs of our Relapſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Crimes. The Argument would have as much Reaſon, and more Honeſty, that concludes out of, I have been wicked but too long already; that, Therefore I muſt be ſo no more; and from our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer want of Piety, infers there needs a greater meaſure now to make amends for paſt Omiſſions.

                        <p>Nor are the Obſtacles that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your cure, ſo ſtubborn as you are pleas'd to fancy them.

                        <p>And yet when the ſlight Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Shilling is laid upon each Oath, and ſtrictly exacted, we may eaſily diſcern a viſible abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the tale of your ſins, as long as you are true to your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; which were not moſt men too ſoon weary of, would (probably) ſoon make them weary of Offences of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                           <pb n="93" facs="tcp:44037:56"/>'Tis the opinion both of Pious and of Judicious Perſons, that Swearing is therefore, tho not the moſt unpardonable, at leaſt the moſt inexcuſable of Vices; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in it men have moſt power to refrain: And in effect, this ſin is ſo deſtitute both of Temptations, Advantages, and Apologies, that in ſubduing the Cuſtom of Swearing, we have ſcarce any thing but the Cuſtom to ſubdue.

                        <p>I ſhall never deſpair of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of any, that is but hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous to be reclaim'd; ſince that which God was pleas'd to make me lately inſtrumental to work upon a Gentleman, whoſe Nation being <hi>French,</hi> his Vice lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle younger than himſelf, Humor

extremely Cholerick, and his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the Succeſsleſsneſs of his Endeavours very great, obliged him to vanquiſh Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions numerous and great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make that concurrence very frequent in one ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and yet before one Fortnight was effluxt, he obtain'd ſo viſible a Conqueſt over this ſtubborn Vice, that he had afterwards only as many relicks of it to ſuppreſs, as might keep him from growing proud of ſo ſudden a Recovery.</p>
                        <p>So eaſy is it after having van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd the Imagination of the Difficulty, to overcome the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty it ſelf; for in matter of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy Chriſtian Duties, we muſt not only conſider the diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Weakneſſes to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles we muſt ſurmount, but allow the diſproportion of thoſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44037:58"/>
Obſtacles, to the Supernatural Aſſiſtances we ought to hope for. For God requires nothing at our hands, which his own Favour (zealouſly implor'd by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes) will not enable us to execute. And in this, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, differ from thoſe of men, that the latter but lay on us an Obligation, the former inveſt us with a Power to obey them. As when our Saviour commanded the ſick man (in the Goſpel) to <hi>take up his bed, and walk,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Mark 2. 9, 12.</note> at the ſame inſtant he ſtrengthens his Sinews to perform what he enjoin'd: And in the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that powerful Command, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> gave that bright<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note> Creature an Exiſtence, to make it capable of paying him an Obedience. Let not then Tasks above the forces of our Nature,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44037:58"/>
diſanimate thoſe that may expect aſſiſtances from his Almightineſs, who in the ſame Leaves where he commands us to perform more than we are able, promiſes to do in us what he commands; ſince difficulties are not eſſential pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of obſtacles, but only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportions to the powers they are to reſiſt. But admit that your habitude of ſwearing have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred your Converſion as difficult as you pretend; ſure then, that which Cuſtom of ſinning has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly made ſo uneaſy, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of that Cuſtom is very unlikely to facilitate: As proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may he, whom a Surfeit of Melons has caſt into a Fever, hope for a Cure by eating more again. No, no; remember that bad Cuſtoms, like Conſumptions, admit of Remedies in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

but grow ſtill more incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by delay; and Vices, like young Trees, the longer they are let grow, the greater difficulty there is in felling of them; each ſingle ſin being not bad only for the evil of the act, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity it gives to repetition.</p>

                     <p>BUT becauſe to ſhew a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the danger of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, without preſcribing him the Remedies that may contribute to his Recovery, would be but to give him a perfecter knowledge of his wretchedneſs, and prove a Truth as uncomfortable to him as an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> to the benighted Traveller that has loſt his way, whoſe horrid light ſerves not to guide, but to affright the Wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: I think it not amiſs in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Directions to caſt the Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a few Cords, by which (if they be carefully laid hold on) he may happily be drawn out of that deep and dangerous Pit of Sin, into which his Negligence or his

Nor let the courſeneſs of theſe home ſpun Lines divert you from making them Inſtruments of your Reſcue; for Silk and Satten Ribbons, you know, are not ſo proper to draw men out of Pits, as homely Hempen Cords: Nor did the impriſon'd Prophet refuſe to be drawn up out of the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, tho by the help of <hi>old caſt</hi>

                        <p>My firſt Advice ſhall be, Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider, that Swearing is a Sin, and ſuch a Sin too, as not
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44037:60"/>
its Nature, but its Commoneſs only, makes men count little: For if we may judge of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Crime, by that of the Vengeance Heaven inflicteth on it, certainly God has divers times ſo ſeverely puniſh'd obdurate and incorrigible Swearers, that were his Judgments on them as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulg'd as they have been terrible, that crying Sin would (poſſibly) be almoſt as unfrequent as it ought to be. Nor will the ſeeming harmleſsneſs of that act do more than make a parallel betwixt your fate, and that fond Wretches (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Book of <hi>Numbers</hi>)<note place="margin">Numb. 15. 32.</note> that provok'd ſtoning, for gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few ſticks on the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. For tho Almighty God (whoſe Will is the exacteſt Rule of Good and Ill) ſhould forbid actions otherwiſe Innocent, yet
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44037:61"/>
his Prohibition diveſts them from that property: And (as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Verſes of that Paſſage alledg'd of <hi>Numbers</hi> intimate) makes you liable to a juſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho not for the act, yet for the diſobedience. And conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly we find, that tho the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſo horrid and Parricidicial a Murderer as <hi>Cain,</hi> might ſeem an<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 15.</note> Act of Juſtice, yet God by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition having render'd it a ſin, annexes a Sevenfold Vengeance to the Breach of that Command.</p>
                        <p>Nay, tho the rebuilding of a ruin'd City be in it ſelf not only innocent, but highly conducing to the publick good; yet God (to ſhew the Independency of his Juſtice) having forbidden the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edification<note place="margin">Joſh. 6. 26.</note> of <hi>Jericho</hi>'s raz'd Walls, puniſh'd the Tranſgreſſion of that<note place="margin">1 Kings 16. 34.</note> Prophetick Order, in the very

Children of the Tranſgreſſor. An Example of Severity very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, being not, that I know of, to be parallel'd. Conſider not therefore ſo much (in your Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) the little harm you do, as the great God you offend. Falſe Coinage is as well Felony in Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, as in Half Crowns, or Twenty-Shilling-Pieces. And as careful Mothers ſoundlier whip their Children for eating ſowre Crabs, and ſuch Green Traſh, than ripe and goodly Fruit; ſo often are thoſe ſins moſt ſeverely dealt with, which bring us leaſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; nor is it a Prodigy, to ſee men get moſt ſtripes for thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences they get leaſt by.</p>
                        <p>It is an eaſy matter in trivial things to tranſgreſs heinouſly. What Trifle could appear ſlighter than the eating of an Apple? Yet

this petty ſeeming Peccadillo loſt <hi>Adam</hi> Paradiſe, and us a Title to it: God's Interdict enabling the Core of that Forbidden Fruit to choak his Immortality, and his Poſterity's hopes of it upon earth. But I purpoſely decline all Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this nature, not only in purſuance of my intended Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but becauſe 'tis much nobler and more handſom for you to owe your Repentance to your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than to your Apprehenſion.</p>

And thus this ſacred Duty does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procure, but in a manner give us what we pray for: As when ſome ſqueamiſh and diſreliſh'd perſon takes a long walk to the Phyſician's Lodging to beg ſome remedy for his Inappetence, his very walking thither does in ſome meaſure give him that good Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach he hopes to regain by the Medicines he ſhall get there.</p>

                           <pb n="107" facs="tcp:44037:63"/>But if in your firſt attempts this Sin meet with a ſucceſs more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to your fears than your deſires, be not diſcourag'd at it, but make of this delay the uſe it is intended for, a Riſe of greater eagerneſs and importunity in the purſuit of your addreſſes. Nor think it ſtrange, that God ſhould make you wait a while for the grant of your requeſts, that have been ſo tediouſly refractory to the Motions of his Spirit, that ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd your obedience to his commands. But loſe not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, for the wiſh'd ſupply will infallibly arrive at laſt, and all your expectation will but ſerve to endear it when receiv'd; for God will not be wanting with his Power to aſſiſt what is undertaken only for his Glory.</p>

                           <pb n="108" facs="tcp:44037:64"/>Nor is it leſs our duty to truſt in his Promiſes, than to obey his Commands; and we may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently expect from his Faithfulneſs to the one, what he will enable our endeavours to perform the other.

                           <hi>will perform it unto the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And on this ſcore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who entails happineſs only to the godly, does yet pronounce them <hi>bleſſed, that hunger and thirſt</hi>

                        <p>In the mean time, let this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration comfort you, That thoſe ſins diſpleaſe God leaſt, that diſpleaſe the Doer moſt: And that in this our Combats againſt ſins are differenc'd from our Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels amongſt men; that in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the Victory depends not ſo much on our Succeſs as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; ſince none are there held vanquiſh'd, but ſubmitters. And for your further comfort, you may take each Victory Grace wins of your Corruptions, not only for a Preparative to new ones, but an Earneſt of more. For the Conqueſts of Saving Grace in the Soul are not like thoſe the Sea makes upon the Strand, when it makes Acquiſitions by the Flow, but to loſe them again within few

                        <p>In the next place, as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency will permit, 'twere fit to fly the Converſation, or at leaſt the Familiarity of profeſt Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. This Advice of declining Infectious Company, tho in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Caution ever found preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent againſt all Vices, has a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar property againſt this: For there being very ſmall (if any) Temptation to it in our natures, it is principally imitated from others, (as when one yawns, moſt of the Company, though
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44037:65"/>
otherwiſe uninclin'd to that act, do uſually yawn out of ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy) and ſo ſubſiſts but as 'tis che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd by Example and Cuſtom, (its Motive and its Nurſe). And therefore, a very effectual Remedy againſt Swearing, is by converſing where it is diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd; to ſtarve it by diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, forcing that ſhame of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity that firſt begot it, to make amends for the miſchief it has occaſion'd, by employing it to the ruin of its own Productions. As Phyſicians make Scorpions their own Antidote by preparing out of them an Oyl that is Sovereign againſt their Stings.

                        <p>For the Fourth Remedy, I ſhould adviſe the Swearer to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige himſelf to pay or ſuffer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for every Oath he ſwears; thoſe little Forfeitures ſerving both as Monitors and as Penalties. But if the Bargain tye you to Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary Disburſements, be ſure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Chriſtians be (at leaſt) Sharers in them. For if (as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines tell us) the Poor be God's Receivers, they ſeem to have a Title as well by Juſtice as by Charity, to the Amerciaments that are eſtreated upon Treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againſt their Lord. But have a care you turn not this Phyſick into Poyſon, by imagining that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44037:66"/>
when you have fin'd for your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, you have done Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for your ſins; and by your Juſtice to your Compacts, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd your Diſobedience to your Maker. No, no, God requires not that you ſhould part with your Sixpences, but with your Sins; and the Repentance he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, conſiſts not in a paying for, but in forſaking your Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Eſteem then theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Mulcts but as Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers of your Faults, not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for them.</p>
                        <p>Ally'd to this Expedient is that uſeful one of procuring ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Friend, by putting you in mind of every Oath, to force you to take notice of your Faults; which this courſe will very much contribute to make you both wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44037:67"/>
and aſham'd of. Provided always, that theſe Reprehenſions be as well ſeaſonable as juſt; for to correct men in the firſt violent tranſports of their Choler, is by adminiſtring Phyſick in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Fit, but to exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate inſtead of curing.

                        <p>The Fifth thing that I muſt preſcribe our Swearer, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve at once to renounce that Vice, by a Deſertion not only ſincere, but unſuſpended and intire. Were it but one of theſe mere Moral Failings, whoſe Unfitneſs or Misbecomingneſs makes all the Guilt, I ſhould poſſibly counſel you to wean yourſelf of it by degrees, whoſe progreſs were ſcarce diſcernible before its end; juſt as Phyſicians uſe to reclaim thoſe that have been long accuſtomed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome Diet. But as the ſame Phyſicians, when once a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Surfeit is contracted, reſtrain not by degrees, but totally and abruptly, thoſe Exceſſes that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44037:68"/>
it, and whoſe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance would prove fatal to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; ſo here, where that which is to be forſaken, is not ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Fault as a Sin, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain without the leaſt Exception or Connivance; ſince elſe (the thing prohibited being in it ſelf a Sin) we allow our ſelves to offend God as much as ever, tho not ſo often; by committing the ſame Sins in Quality, however not in Multitude.</p>
                        <p>Indeed what is leſſen'd by the Number of our Oaths in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reformation, is recompenc'd by the aggravated Heinouſneſs of their nature; thoſe that ſeem'd formerly but the ſlips of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, being now authoriz'd by Diſpenſation. This bare abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Tale of our Sins is a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44037:68"/>
good Refuge, but a bad Deſign: Many times this diminution is the utmoſt our Endeavours can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at; but then it ought to be practis'd, and not to be intended; for true Repentance, and a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of relapſing, are hugely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent; the one not being real, without a property deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the other; ſince he but very lamely repents his Crimes, that reſolves not againſt Relapſes into the Crimes that he repents. No, no, this faint deſiſting from ſome acts of Vice, does but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear the reſt that is unexil'd, and that importunately urge for the recalling of their baniſh'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. This mild remiſsneſs, if it do not prune a Vice, at leaſt it does but lop it; and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits not its future growth;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44037:69"/>
which the only way infalliby to prevent, is to dig it up by the Roots, with the Spade of an abſolute and irrevocable Reſolve, never to accord to our ſelves ſo much as by connivance, the leaſt Licenſe that may endanger a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe. In this caſe, Extirpation is that alone which can ſecure our quiet; and the only way that leads to an eſtabliſh'd ſafety, is a ſeverity that its object ſecures from all poſſibility of exceſſes. A Sinner's condition may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to a Mouſe in a Pail of Water; if ſhe can get out at one leap, well and good, otherwiſe her toyl will prove but fruitleſs, in attempting to get out by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>

Sure that theſe people are not quarter'd in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> (where far leſs Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies have impriſon'd many) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds rather from the Multitude of the infatuated, than any want of Madneſs in their actions: But howſoever, wiſe men build Cages for them in their opinions, and in their ſoberer Thoughts condemn them to inhabit thoſe Frantick Lodgings.</p>

                        <p>But to what has been already delivered, to ſhew how little ſhelter our Swearers find from all their weak Apologies, (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Fruitleſneſs and Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſableneſs of their Vice conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, almoſt no Sinners have more to anſwer for, and leſs to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer) we muſt now add, That they want not only the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Excuſe, but the very Excuſe of a Temptation, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs its being forbidden, paſs for

For (Firſt) this Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grel Iſſue cannot (as other Vices uſe to be) be ſaid at Nature's door; we cannot father it upon Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, ſince we inherit it not from our Parents; nor is it born with us, but learn'd by us; ſo that here, before we can be Sinners, we muſt have been Diſciples. But (then) all other Vices have either Honour, (as Ambition), or Profit, (as Avarice), or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, (as Uncleanneſs), to plead for their excuſe; Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone can plead nothing but Guilty: So that if ever that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Apoſtle, which mentions <hi>Superfluity of Naughtineſs,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 21.</note> belong'd to any ſin, 'tis certainly here to be appropriated.</p>

Swearing was left Portionleſs; a Miſtreſs (only) for thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and diſintereſted Sinners, that need no Temptation; but loving Wickedneſs (as they ought to do Virtue) for its own ſake alone, aim'd at nothing in the act of ſin, beyond the ſatisfaction of having committed it. To whom the Lord may juſtly ſay, as he did to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Prophet, <hi>You have ſold your ſelves</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Iſa. 52. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>for nought.</hi> For whereas uſually thoſe Vices that rifle the Soul, do bribe the Senſes; in ſwearing the poor Soul is ſtript of her Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and robb'd of her Joys, without the leaſt Emolument (of Pleaſure or Advantage) accruing to the Senſes. This ſwearing (in my opinion) is e'en as fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh as loving a cruel Miſtreſs; a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44037:72"/>
man parts with his heart, and gets nothing in exchange for it. An Oath is like the Powder that charges a Granado, its proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are to make a momentary, diſpleaſing noiſe, to offend thoſe that are within the reach of it, and to ſpoil that from which it parts. Nor is that criminal blaſt unlike the Prophet's deſcription of the Cankerworm; of which he gives this Character, That <hi>it ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Nahum 3. 16.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>But the leſs advantages this Vice affords, the more culpable it is; the Diſobedience as well as Folly of a forbidden act being increaſed by the want of its being beneficial; he that treſpaſſes for leaſt, tranſgreſſes moſt; for ſure 'tis rather an aggravation than an
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44037:72"/>
excuſe of having injured any body, that you get nothing by it. The Ambitious and the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, are like great Ladies, that ſurfeit upon Apricocks, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarines, and Melons: Whereas the Swearer is but too juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to thoſe Beggars, that kill themſelves with Blackberries and Slows, and ſuch like Traſh, the Excrements of Hedges; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Appetites as ridiculouſly noxious, as thoſe of ſome of our Green-ſickneſs Girls, whoſe Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs riſe at Dainties, and long for Loam and Charcoal.</p>
                        <p>For my part, would I renounce my intereſt in Virtue, it ſhould be for the attaining of a Scepter, a Fame tranſcending <hi>Caeſars;</hi> and (in a word) where the Happineſs I forfeited ſhould ſeem ſo recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44037:73"/>
by that I gain'd by loſing it, that wiſe men themſelves ſhould have occaſion rather to compaſſionate my frailty, than admire my weakneſs. For I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it would extremely trouble me to hang for my Thirteen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence-half-penny; and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that many of thoſe this ſenſeleſs Vice has damn'd, do find a vaſt acceſſion to the Pains of Hell it ſelf, in the conſideration of the Cauſe of their enduring them.</p>
                        <p>Since then, Swearing is a Vice ſo ill qualified, that you want a Temptation to it, you find no Pleaſure in it, nor do derive any Advantage from it; O let not your obſtinacy to doat upon an empty fleeting ſound, that has
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44037:73"/>
nothing in it of a Sin, except the Guilt, hinder you from ſhunning Torments that will equal your Wretchedneſs to your Folly, and from keeping up a Title unto Joys, whoſe very Hope tranſcends all Earthly Happineſs, by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all your paſt Unneceſſary Oaths, by one Inviolable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſary One, <hi>Never to Swear Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly again.</hi>

                  <p>TO prevent all Miſtakes that may ariſe from ſome apprehenſions of mine, which (ſeeming to cenſure Oaths without diſtinction) may poſſibly be ſtretch'd beyond my meaning, I thought my ſelf oblig'd to declare, That in no part of this Diſcourſe my intention was to juſtify that plauſible Error of our Modern Anabaptiſts, that indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately condemn all Oaths as abſolutely and indiſpenſibly prohibited and aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Goſpel: My Deſign being only to reſtrain the Needleſs Abuſe, not interdict the Neceſſary Uſe of Swearing. Whoſe Criminouſneſs if not in this Diſcourſe I have repreſented in its moſt enlarged dimenſions, I may find an Excuſe in the Preſident and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44037:75"/>
Practice of thoſe Painters, who being to draw upon the Concaves of the Roofs of Churches, make their Pictures more Gigantick than the Originals they are to reſemble; to recompence by that advantage in the dimenſions, what the eye loſes by the diſtance from the object. For every Sinner naturally beholding Vice upon which he dotes, through the contracting Optick of Self-love, muſt have the Idea of his Crime enlarged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its true proportions, to make him ſee it in its juſt quantity. I might add, That 'tis ſcarce poſſible to paint this ugly <hi>Negro</hi> in blacker Colours than his own; eſpecially ſince now this Sin is grown ſo much in faſhion, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects not (as moſt other Vices) ſlow time or years to ripen it; ſince in our very ſtreets we hourly hear Children (who ſure offer up Oaths as the Firſt-Fruits to the Devil) ſwear, that can ſcarcely ſpeak; and ſee them perfect in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44037:75"/>
their Father's Language, before they are old enough to ſpeak their Mother-Tongue.</p>
                  <p>But tho in the heinous Properties of this Vice I might find cauſe enough to juſtify more fierceneſs than I have expreſt againſt it; yet ſhould I be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely loth, with many (much better ſtor'd with Zeal than Charity) to doom all thoſe to Hell, that through frailty or temptation ſometimes let ſlip an Oath. For ſo ſevere a Sentence may perhaps concern too many, whoſe addictedneſs to other, not to greater ſins than ours, makes often all the difference of our Guilts: And who in ſpite of all their ſlips and ſtumbles by the way, may by Repentance arrive ſafely at the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan:</hi> And therefore I ſhall conclude what has been ſaid of Swearing, with this ſenſe of it, That 'tis a Sin too Heinous to excuſe Neglect, and too Venial (if I may ſo ſpeak) juſtly to beget Deſpair.</p>

decline any Proofs of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mine. 'Tis not that I am not as unwilling to employ Cenſure, as I am confident you will be troubled to have neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated it from me; but (all conſider'd) I have too much Friendſhip, to have Courtſhip enough to let ſlip ſo fair an opportunity as your forc'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with <hi>Cleander,</hi> to ſhew you in him the Deformity of a Vice, from which I wiſh you were as free as from all other Crimes.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, if Curſes were as much the Badges of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as he thinks them, men would not gueſs him to be of a lower Order than that of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors: And if the Devil were

                  </p>
                  <p>I might add, that in moſt of theſe Imprecations, God's Sacred Name being clearly taken in vain, renders theſe <hi>Ebalites</hi> guilty of the breach as well of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment of the Firſt, as of the great Commandment of the Second Table; unleſs they will juſtify themſelves from that Crime, by the owning of a worſe; I mean, demonſtrate, That they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And now this laſt Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leads me to that of the Unreaſonableneſs of Curſing; For it is not a fit thing, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44037:82"/>
upon every little Accident that <hi>Cleander</hi>'s vex'd at, the Creatures of God muſt inſtantly change Maſters, and devolve to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Were it not very juſt, that God ſhould be the Executioner of all the raſh Decrees his pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Paſſion makes; and his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Power ſhould have no other Employment, but to run on Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands (at the Moody Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's beck) often repugnant to his Juſtice, and ever to his Mercy?</p>
                  <p>Nay, how often has <hi>Cleander</hi> in his Paſſion wiſh'd things, whoſe Accompliſhment himſelf confeſſes would have made him miſerable? And is it then either the part of a Good Man to make Wiſhes that are unlawful, or for a Wiſe Man to frame Deſires of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44037:82"/>
which he need repent the Grant? One Imprecation amongſt the reſt <hi>Cleander</hi>'s very ready in, which (with as little Caution as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly obſerves) I would not have pronounc'd for as many Kingdoms as he has us'd it times, and that's, <hi>The Devil take me.</hi> For ſhould God (as we are ſure he may, and know not but that he will) give the Devil leave to take him at his word, in what a caſe were he? And what Curb ſhall we henceforward think ſtrong enough to bridle his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, when what to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edeſt is the greateſt Terror, he makes his wiſh?</p>
                  <p>There was ſome years ſince in <hi>Geneva,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> (both by Extraction and Humour) who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44037:83"/>
riding a handſome Mare in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Angle, was by the Devil ſeduc'd to ſtallion her himſelf. The Fact once done, the Horror of a Crime that made him more a Beaſt than that on which he acted it, tranſported him ſo far, as to make him give himſelf to the Devil, if ever after he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps'd: But ſome while after, forgetting both his Conſcience, and the condition of his Vow, he was fatally tempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat his former Beaſtlineſs in the ſelf-ſame place; which he had ſcarce compleated, before the Devil appearing to him vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, remembers him of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Promiſe, and claims the Forfeiture: The trembling Wretch, to avoid the being hurried away inſtantly from the Hell he felt,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44037:83"/>
to that he fear'd, compounds with the Devil to reſign him his Soul at the expiration of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Reprieve: But before that time came to be effluxt, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to viſit both himſelf and the place of his Reſidence with the Plague; which rowzing his ſear'd and lethargick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, forc'd him to expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Anguiſh unuſual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make his Companions inquiſitive into the Cauſe; which having fully and circumſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſt, he was after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, upon that Evidence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd of having carnally abus'd a Beaſt, and having made a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with the Devil; which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though upon a Repentance ſuitable to his Sin, God's Mercy did diſannul, yet the Juſtice of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44037:84"/>
the Magiſtrate did for the former Crime condemn him to a Death he richly had deſerved, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently endured. This Story I thought not impertinent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in, to teach us how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and unſafe it is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that to the Devil, for which Chriſt ſhed his Blood; and (with more warineſs than <hi>Cleander</hi> can pretend to) to offer that to one that is greedy to ſnatch (and therefore ſurely willing to accept) that which the whole buſineſs of Religion is to defend and reſcue from his Attempts. The Story it ſelf may teach us, that though we are never to deſpair of God's Mercy, we are as ſeldom to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his Juſtice. I have given it you in the very Words of our Friend Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> who had it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44037:84"/>
the place from an excellent Divine of that Republick; to whom the Delinquent himſelf confeſt it, as to him that was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to comfort and aſſiſt him at his Death. And the Inſtances are not unfrequent in the moſt credited Authors, of thoſe whoſe Imprecations God has puniſh'd by granting them.</p>
                  <p>But I had almoſt forgot to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one opportunity to which the Devil is indebted for a vaſt number of <hi>Cleander</hi>'s Curſes, and that's his Gaming; for the leaſt Frown of Chance upon him then, gives Fire to whole Volleys of Curſes againſt Fortune; if at leaſt they deſerve not a more heinous Title than barely that of Curſes, who in ſeverer mens Opinions

are guilty of an (at leaſt) Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Blaſpheming; ſince <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 33.</note> does diſcreetly affirm, That all theſe croſs and happy Lucks at Play are not raſhly or deſignleſly ſhuffled by a blind Hazard, but are diſpenſed by an All-ruling Providence.</p>
                  <p>I determine not here, Whether theſe Words of the Wiſe Man (according to the receiv'd Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Divines) may be extended to an abſolute Sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation againſt all Games of Hazard; but this I know, that (not to inſiſt on that Injunction of God to the <hi>Jews, Be circumſpect, and make no mention of the names of</hi>

                     <hi>other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth;</hi>) it is very unfit that under the Sunſhine of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44037:85"/>
we ſhould build or repair the ruin'd Altars of depos'd Chance, and acknowledge a blind Deity; that under the abuſed name of Fortune, Fools anciently were pleas'd to create a Goddeſs, and ſinners now diſſemble to miſtake for ſome ſuch thing, that they may unreproved controul and cenſure thoſe Heavenly Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions their proud and peeviſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are diſpleaſed with. I know that many unforeſeen Accidents, which the Ignorant Vulgar do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to Fortune, are by God in the Scriptures aſcribed to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: And therefore you muſt give me leave, both to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and diſapprove that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful expreſſion of our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, wherein (to juſtify our Unthankfulneſs for the Benefits
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44037:86"/>
we have received) we uſe to call God's Bleſſing to a man in his outward Poſſeſſions, his <hi>Fortune;</hi> as if our Eſtates were Gifts blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt on us by the raſh Profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that fond Deity, and not the Emanations of God's Bounty, and Preſents of his Providence.<note place="margin">Gen. 33. 11, &amp; 5.</note> Old <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Gratitude ſpeaketh another ſtrain, and will not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his Wealth (though never ſo juſtly the Wages of his proſper'd Induſtry) without acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for the Gift of God.</p>
                  <p>But ſince this much-abuſed Name of Fortune has preſented it ſelf in my way, I dare not take leave of it, till I have expreſs'd a deſire that men would be more wary how they defame her, leſt through the ſides of Fortune they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44037:86"/>
affront Providence. If Fortune under the common Notion, had fee'd me to be her Advocate, I ſhould alledge, That Gameſters of all others, have the leaſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to complain of her Disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, ſince the Succeſs of the one abſolutely depending upon the Loſſes of the other, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reduce Fortune to a Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of diſobliging ſome of them, by rendring it impoſſible for her to content them all. And I would add, That what we fondly call her Inconſtancy, when ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forſakes thoſe ſhe once ſmil'd on, is much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be aſcribed to the Juſtice of her Goodneſs, and the Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of her Affection to men; ſince ſeeing ſhe is not able to make them all compleatly happy at
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44037:87"/>
once, at leaſt ſhe endeavours to make them fortunate by turns, and for ſome Intervals of time.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it her Fickleneſs, that in purſuance of this impartial Love ſhe ſeems to deſert her former Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, when ſhe confers her Favours on new Perſons, ſince ſhe bereaves not the firſt poſſeſſors of them with intention, but only by conſequent; as being not able to lend her benefits to new Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, without redemanding them of her former Debtors; whom, otherwiſe, ſhe has as little deſign to offend by this tranſplacing of her bounties, as the Sun has to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night the Antipodes, when to bring Light into our Hemiſphere he is neceſſitated to leave them in darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:44037:87"/>'Tis not the malice or inſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Fortune, but our miſtakes of the nature of her Preſents, that occaſion our Complaints; for we miſtaking thoſe Benefits for abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely given to us, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but depoſited in our hands, repine and murmur at their reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, inſtead of being thankful for their Loan, and having had their uſe. And ſurely they that pretend to be ſo perfect in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, muſt be guilty of more madneſs in truſting her, than ſhe can be of treachery in deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                  <p>But were I to frame an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to vindicate Fortune under the notion of Providence, I might repreſent, that what we attribute of her envious partiality, when ſhe does ſhower moſt Favours on
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44037:88"/>
thoſe that leaſt deſerve them, is but the effect of God's immenſer Bounty, that gives even them a larger portion of Pleaſures in this life, to whom he reſerves none at all in the next; and withal caſts a diſeſteem upon theſe glittering Goods, Fools over-value, by heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them upon his very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>I might farther alledge, That what our diſcontents, call For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune's Spitefulneſs, and her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, when ſhe ſeems to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thoſe moſt, that are moſt Virtuous, is in effect but God's Care of his Children, which by theſe Afflictions both Exerciſes and improves their Piety, ſecures them from the Allurements of Proſperity, endears his Aſſiſtances and his Recompences by theſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44037:88"/>
difficulties; which both add Luſtre to their Victories, and make their Vertues more Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary and more Meritorious.</p>
                  <p>And (Laſtly) I might ſay, That what we miſcall Inconſtancy in Fortune, when her Changes invalidate the title of Preſcription to her Favours, and make their reſidence (when poſſeſs'd) as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain as their wiſh'd ſtay is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; is indeed but a merciful ſtratagem of Providence, to wean us from a dangerous fondneſs of theſe tranſitory Goods; leſt if the continuance of their fruition were as certain as the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it are great, we ſhould by neglecting forfeit all nobler joys, and loſe far greater Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures reſerved for us in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44037:89"/>But we have too long wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our Theme; let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Cleander</hi> and his Curſing; which over and above thoſe other good qualities we have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in it, has that of being a Sin as uſeleſs as it is Unchriſtian. All other Vices have ſomething to extenuate their Guilt; all other Sinners ſerve Satan for his Pay; but the Curſer, (as the Swearer) is the Devil's Volunteer, valuing his Soul ſo cheaply, that ſome ſuſpect, that the reaſon of its ſtay in the Body, is, that the Devil ſcarce thinks it worth the fetching: And certainly, <hi>Eſau</hi>'s<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 33.</note> Bargain, who ſold his Birth-right for a Meſs of Pottage, becomes no more abſurd when parallell'd to this; which makes thoſe it Damns as much admir'd for their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44037:89"/>
folly, as tormented for their ſins, and ſo caſts upon them the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Madneſs, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives them of the privilege of Mad-men; for whereas Frantick Perſons (who innocently act all Crimes) may Kill men without Murther, the Curſer (on the other ſide) does Murther without Killing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cleander</hi> may indeed give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Devil by his Curſes, but never his Enemy; for if <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Authority be credited in this point, we ſhall believe that, <hi>as</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 26. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>the bird by wandering, as the ſwallow by flying, ſo the curſe cauſleſs ſhall not come.</hi> But the beſt on't is, that theſe Intentional Sins, for being ineffectual againſt others, diveſt not the being criminal in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: For the Curſer is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44037:90"/>
to himſelf as to his Enemies; he commits Murders without acting them; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the Guilt of his Neighbours Blood, without ſhedding it; and incurs the Penalty, without once taſting the Sweetneſs of Revenge. For 'tis not only in Good that God accepts the Will for the Deed; he makes the ſame reception to our Endeavours and Deſigns of Ill. And juſtly may God puniſh the Ill by us intended, tho by him prevented, ſince that diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which we think to find our juſtification, is not the effect of our want of Malice, but our want of Power, and ſo does not excuſe our Ill, but magnifies God's Goodneſs. Let us therefore ceaſe to wonder, that whilſt we curſe one another, our Maker curſes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44037:90"/>
us; and that the Plague is ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in our Houſes, ſo long as it is ſo rife in our Mouths: But rather let us tremble at that diſmal Fate, that <hi>David</hi> praying againſt his Enemies, Prophecies againſt God's. <hi>As he loved Curſing</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſo</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 109. 17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>let</hi> it <hi>come unto him: as he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not in Bleſſing, ſo let it be far from him: As he Cloathed himſelf with</hi> Curſing, <hi>like as with his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, So let it come into his Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els like Water, and like Oil into his Bones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might yet further alledge, That Curſes are of ſo culpable a Nature, that their very Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy concludes them Guilty, by Pleading them to be Idle Words: And I might add to all the paſt<note place="margin">Matt. 12. 36.</note> Diſſuaſives, The Ill Repute that Curſes gain a man, amongſt the moſt Scrupulous and Preciſer ſort
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44037:91"/>
of People, who judging of the greatneſs of the Vice, by the ſmallneſs of the Advantage that is derivable from it, will hardly believe him to be the owner of much Piety, that will Slight it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo little a Temptation. And thoſe of our Divines that hold Curſes to be the Dialect of the Reprobates in Hell, will think it but an ominous Piece of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in <hi>Cleander</hi> to imitate Travellers, who uſe to accuſtom themſelves before-hand to the Language of thoſe Climes they deſign to Viſit. But the laſt Conſideration that I ſhall employ to perſuade you to diveſt, with the Practice of uſing Curſes, the means of Provoking them, and the Fears of ſuffering them; is that of the ſcandal this vicious Cuſtom gives to weaker Chriſtians. And as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44037:91"/>
the former Conſiderations relate properly to <hi>Cleander,</hi> ſo this I muſt more peculiarly addreſs to You, whoſe Vertues have acquir'd you ſo high a Reverence, that they have put it in your Power, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to excuſe, but almoſt to Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the worſt Actions by your Example; and therefore ought to make you ſo much the more Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Strict in your Behaviour: Since men believing it impoſſible to fail in imitating you, your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Faults will contract a deeper Guilt by being Preſidents, than by being Sins.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, leſt I ſhould give you too Juſt an occaſion to encreaſe the number of your Curſes, by beſtowing ſome freſh ones upon my tediouſneſs, I will now put a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to your trouble, by ſaying to you as once our Saviour did to the
