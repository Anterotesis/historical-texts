            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> wrote my two first bookes beeing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly distracted, &amp; my spirit surseized with feare, foresaw the dismal chaunce that is nowe come vpon vs. The sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sermons, the im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pairing of a dutifull respect to the king, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon reports that were spred abroad of his death, before his death, the encrease of the Iesuits, &amp; by a consequent the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of their maxims, made many to suspect shrewdly, &amp; it was no great praise to bee a prophet. We haue therefore fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene, &amp; foretold the future calamity that was like to betide vs to our great losse, &amp; spake more true in it, then we could wish to haue done; Vpon the downefall of this so great a <hi>Prince</hi> many haue powred out
<pb facs="tcp:11387:3"/>
the torrents of their eloquence, and haue bewailed him with so much art, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath no more left to say. And to speak the truth wordes are too weak and feeble signes to expresse such a griefe; light affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions speak, when the greater are dumbe, and with the vaile of silence cover that which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be vttered. O miserable age! The murdering therefore of kings will ere long turne into a custome; and the naturall respect that the French were wont to haue of their Soveraigne bee choaked by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition. We see it to our great griefe. For whosoever shal hereafter take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt the life his king, shal be vnderpropt by many examples, &amp;, which is more, shall not want for rules: and if this growing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill be not by time prevented, it wil at last be held a punishment to raigne, &amp; the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of our kings, shall be as it were a consecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sacrifices markt out for the slaughter. For howbeit the singular wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and vigilant care of our <hi>Queene</hi> his Maiesties spowse hath served vs as a prop to sustaine our ruinous estate, yet may wee say that in <hi>him</hi> Fraunce hath lost the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyest king it hath had these many yeares, and the manner of whose death is a fatall
<pb facs="tcp:11387:3"/>
example, and a grand caveat to posterity.</p>
            <p>This wound did so smart, that I coulde never get my fingers of from it, nor for a long time togither settle my selfe about fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the remainder of this work. Griefe which of its owne nature is idle, is then so most especially, when the thing grieved at is past all remedy. Herevnto adde that this <hi>third booke,</hi> which entreats <hi>of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of prophecies,</hi> togither with the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them, requires a more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed spirit then the two former did: For as God intending to reveale future events to his prophets, withdrew them aside, and carryed them either to the desert, or els to the sea shore, that so having pluckt them from amidst the presse, he might setle their mindes in a quiet repose; So thinke I, that to diue into their prophecies a man neede be free from all cares, &amp; to partake of their rest, that he may partake of the cleerenesse of their spirit. And, indeed, what by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the publike griefe, the greatest part whereof hath fallen vpon vs, and what by reason of many interruptions, I had never dared to haue set vpon this matter, had not the excellent spirit of the <hi>King of Great Brittaine</hi> enlightened me, and if in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding
<pb facs="tcp:11387:4"/>
of these prophecies I had not been assisted by experience, which is the cause, that I haue more need of a memory herein, then any extraordinary revelation. God also, whom I here invoke to mine aide, wil by his spirit sharpen the dulnesse of mine, and as hee hath given this property to the sea-cards needle to stand firme in the most violent tempests, so is he able to giue his servants a piercing wit, and a setled minde amidst this confusion. He reveales his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to those which feare him, and makes them to vnderstand his will. Now that no man may accuse me of rashnesse herein, as though I did too curiously pry into after ages, or presumptuously gaue mine owne interpretations for rules; the reader shall do well to consider, that it is one thing to <hi>prophecy,</hi> another thing to <hi>speak of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of prophecies:</hi> the one is done by reve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lation, the other by experience; for the one we need to be inspired from aboue, for the other we need nothing but a memory to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with some insight in the present times. The Prophets drew their <hi>prophecies</hi> from the counsell of God, but we finde the <hi>accomplishment of their prophecies</hi> in histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by conferring the predictions with
<pb facs="tcp:11387:4"/>
the events; for the predictions after the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents become histories, and the promises performances.</p>
            <p>This is the reason why <hi>his Maiestie of England</hi> saith (and that most truely) that <hi>the fathers of the first ages, spake of this mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter but only by coniectures, wheras we speake of it by experience</hi>; For the prophecies which foretell of an evill to come, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be interpreted by those vpon whom it is come. Even as the <hi>Iewes</hi> being led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues into <hi>Babylon</hi> did easily vnderstande the <hi>prophecie of Ieremie</hi>; so Christians held vnder the <hi>second captivity of Babilon,</hi> may soone know the meaning of the <hi>prophecies</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which foretell of it; I would to God we were not the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our owne miseries, and that we had not learn'd the meaning of these prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by experience. Which makes mee to wonder at our adversaries who to intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle this point the more, doe nothing but quote passages out of the fathers, whenas they speake only but by coniecture, or else say such things as our adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues do deride, &amp; which experience hath confuted. <hi>Lactantius</hi> in the 25. <hi>chap.</hi> of his 7. <hi>booke</hi> saith that <hi>the world should not last
<pb facs="tcp:11387:5"/>
aboue</hi> 200 <hi>yeares more at the most,</hi> and yet notwithstanding it is well neere 1300. yeares past since <hi>Lactantius</hi> wrote. <hi>Sulpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Severus</hi> in the <hi>second booke</hi> of his <hi>history</hi> tels vs that <hi>it was generally thought in his time that Nero was not dead, but that hee vvas cured of the vvounde that vvas given him, and that his wound being cured, he is reserved aliue for the last day, to the end that he may exercise the mysterie of iniquity.</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi> in the 19. Chap. of the 20. book of the cittie of God, expounding S. <hi>Pauls</hi> prophecie, in the 2. Chap. of his 2. Epist. to the <hi>Thess.</hi> speakes thus, <hi>I confesse that I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand no thing of all that which hee hath said; only I will relate the divers surmises of men, that I could ever heare of, or read vpon this subiect</hi>; Then he alleages divers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he cals <hi>coniectures.</hi> Compare the booke of Antichrist fathered vpon <hi>S. Austin,</hi> with the expositions of <hi>Andrew</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Cesarea,</hi> and <hi>Bedaes,</hi> and <hi>S. Ieromes</hi> Commentaries vpon <hi>Daniell,</hi> &amp; you shall see but little agreement between them. Wherefore the Iesuits writing vpon this subiect are often times troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout confuting the Fathers opinions. If we then speak with more certaintie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they,
<pb facs="tcp:11387:5"/>
it is not our sufficiency that is the cause thereof, but rather our misfortune to bee reserved till the last daies, that wee might see the execution of the plagues foretold in these prophecies.</p>
            <p>This notwithstanding their praise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines whole vnto them stil: for he which expoundes prophecies not yet accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, ought to be more admired, if amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst ten false expositions hee hit vpon one or two true, then if after they were fulfilled hee should expound them all truly. Nowe the Fathers doe happily light vpon the true meaning in many of these points, and bring divers expositions, which the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of succeeding ages hath confirmed, which we will produce in their place.</p>
            <p>But heere before wee venter vpon this matter, the faithfull reader must bee advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to avoid two extreames; the one is, that he tie not himselfe too religiously to these things; the other, that he set not too little by them. As for the former, his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of England</hi> plainely affirmeth, that <hi>in this doctrine there are obscure things which he would not vrge as necessarie to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for every one.</hi> And that with good reason. For I am perswaded that in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb facs="tcp:11387:6"/>
religion, there is no one article of faith, which may be necessarie to salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at one time, and yet not necessarie at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now all confesse that the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of these prophecies was not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry before they were fulfilled. It followes therefore that even after their accomplish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment a man may bee saved without the knowledge of them. And I finde not that the reading of civill and ecclesiasticall hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories is recommended vnto vs in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures as necessary to salvation. But so it is that partly out of them, partly out of the present evils, wee draw the meaning of these prophecies. The articles of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of salvation, are no prophecies, but Commandements, or simple and bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; or if it please any one to call the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>resurrection of the flesh,</hi> and of the <hi>life everlasting,</hi> by the names of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies; yet are they coucht in such cleere tearmes, that they haue no need of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. For God which hath cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red future events with a thick darkenesse, doth propose the things simply necessary to salvation with great perspicuitie.</p>
            <p>The other extremitie, which is the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too little by these prophecies, hath no
<pb facs="tcp:11387:6"/>
lesse danger. For as when the <hi>ruine of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> by <hi>Nabuchadnezar</hi> did fulfill the <hi>Prophecy of Ieremy</hi>: or when the <hi>birth of our Saviour,</hi> made the prophecies of <hi>Iacob, Esay,</hi> and <hi>Micheas,</hi> plaine, &amp; perspicuous; if any one were so obstinate that he would not vnderstand these prophecies, hee had reiected the grace of God. So now adaies when God hath made vs to see the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of matters foretold by <hi>Daniel,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> whosoever shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon close his eies of set purpose, that man doth resist the wisdome of God, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates the holy Ghost of his inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, making (as much as lies in him) these prophecies to be vnprofitable. For God revealed these things to his Prophets and Apostles to no other end but to profit vs. That so the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, which they foretell of, taking effect, wee might not attribute it to our owne wisdome or force, but to his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and determination, which hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared long before to his Prophets: as also that we might knowe, that these calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, being foretold of, come not vpon vs by hap hazard, but by his fixt counsell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved vpon from everlasting, and to the end that we might keepe our selues from
<pb facs="tcp:11387:7"/>
being amongst the number of those vpon whome he will powre out the vials of his wrath because of their vnbeliefe. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall labour to prevent the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God denounced by his Prophets will never stile the studie of knowing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the name of curiositie. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie even as the faithfull which lived a little before the birth of our Saviour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted themselues vnder the Roman yoke by meditating vpon the comming of Christ promised by his Prophets which they called, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luc.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>solatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Israel,</hi> so ought wee vnder this Romish bondage, which tyrannizeth over our consciences, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vp our selues by these prophecies, part of which being already finished, assure vs that the rest too shall in their due time bee put in execution. Otherwise the reproach wherewith the Iewes were vpbraided by <hi>Ieremie</hi> shall also be cast in our teeth, to wit, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ierem.</hi> 8.7</note> 
               <hi>that the Storke, the Turtle, the Crane and the Swallow knew their seasons, but the people of God knew not theirs.</hi> For hee iustly sends them to the schoole of beastes, that will not be schollars in the house of God. But if these prophecies be not necessary as articles of our faith, yet at the least are
<pb facs="tcp:11387:7"/>
they necessarie as Gods forewarnings to vs ward, which we cannot reiect without hurting our selues, &amp; displeasing him. For is it no fault, trow we, if that after hee hath painted out <hi>the sonne of perdition</hi> vnto vs long time before his comming, we wil nor knowe him then when he is come, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are within his clumbs? The holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, should they ever haue foreseen these evils so long time before hand, to the ende that we should not see them when they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue? And if we demonstrate, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the predictions of the Prophets, that <hi>man of sinne</hi> must needes bee already come; what carelesnesse is it not to harken out his habitation, and not so much as vouchsafe to looke whether it may not be that we our selues serue him without thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it. I omit to tell how the vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of these prophecies, are of great force to giue waight and authoritie to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. For the mysterie of godlinesse is made more cleere by beeing opposed to the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of iniquitie. Because we are soon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to beleeue that the Prophets are true in their doctrines, when wee finde by effect that they speake truth in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies. We doe not therfore herein serue
<pb facs="tcp:11387:8"/>
our owne curiositie, but the good of the Church, and the commandement of God. Let others read the events of things to come in the Starres, or study Chiromancy, or Meteoposcopie; the best Prognosticke that a man can haue, is the feare of God, &amp; his word, the best booke of predictions, wherein God speakes, as if hee did stretch out his finger from heauen, and point out the <hi>See of Rome</hi> vnto vs, saying, behold her here of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my Prophets spoke, &amp; which I marked out vnto you in my word.</p>
            <p>It remaines that I speake of the subiect of this booke, &amp; of the end that I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to my selfe therein. I doe not here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute who that <hi>Antichrist</hi> should be, nor whether the <hi>Pope</hi> should be so called. And I refraine from doing this for two reasons, The one is, because I would not willingly contest about wordes, but rather tie my selfe to the things. For since all the fathers and our adversaries agree with vs in this, that in the 2. Chap. of the 2. to the <hi>Thessal.</hi> and in the 13. of the <hi>Apocal.</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Antichrist</hi> is pointed out, it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice if we search the meaning of these chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters. For if it be found that they speake of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the difficultie touching the name
<pb facs="tcp:11387:8"/>
wil be taken away. We will make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, let who so will drawe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. The other reason is, because this very name doth exasperate the simpler sort who thinking this an odious word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the booke for the titles sake. They thinke that other controversies pricke his <hi>Holynesse</hi> at the throat, but that this cuts his wind pipe. To whose quaint stomacks, and impatient delicacie I thought good to fit my selfe at this time; being content only to shewe the meaning of these holy prophecies, and to confirme my expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with proofes: which I hope to deliver so cleerely, and make them so agreeable, that I am perswaded that hee which is resolved not to beleeue any of them, shall at the least wonder by what chaunce it coulde come to passe, that so many things fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by <hi>Daniel,</hi> by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Iohn</hi> should all meete iointly together in one man. Or how they could draw a picture so like the <hi>Pope,</hi> and never thinke vpon him.</p>
            <p>Now, this being a difficult point, and a matter of importance, I must of necessitie (to handle it with order and care) speake a great deale more in it then <hi>Mounsieur Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effeteau</hi> bindes mee to doe. For seeing hee
<pb facs="tcp:11387:9"/>
doth but florish the matter over superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being content to cast some light dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties here and there in the way, it had beene impossible for mee to sound the depth of it in following him. Nevertheles he hath said nothing, to which I doe not answer, as it crosseth my course. God, of his mercy, fil vs with his grace fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue, and after the accomplishment of these prophecies which threaten vs, giue vs the accomplishment of his promises.</p>

               <head>The accomplishment of this Prophecie.</head>
               <p>THis prediction of the Apostle, being not wrapt in riddles, nor shadowed vnder figuratiue words, need no subtil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, nor laborious coniectures to be vnderstood, we need not speake by guesse,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11387:11"/>
when we feele the evill, &amp; I would to God we saw it lesse cleere then we do.</p>
               <p>The Apostle speaks of an evill that must happen in the last times; these last times be gunne from the Apostles times, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe tels vs in the 10. Chap. of his first epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it followeth that these last times are now much neerer, and that this present age is more the last times, then that was wherein S. <hi>Paul</hi> lived.</p>
               <p>In these last times therefore he foretels of a departing from the faith, of spirits of errour, which shall teach the doctrine of devils through hypocrisie against their owne conscience.</p>
               <p>This being spoken in generall would haue a thousand faces, and bee subiect to divers interpretations, were it not that the Apostle himselfe did put his finger vpon the evil, and specifie some examples there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; not the worst but the most sensible, not the most wicked, but the most easie to bee knowne. These are the errors. 1. <hi>A forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to marry.</hi> 2. <hi>A commanding to abstaine from meats.</hi> Both which are the errors of <hi>Papistry,</hi> and the ordinances of the church of Rome, more religiously observed then the commandements of God: Wee will

                  <hi>MArriage</hi> is an holy bond betweene ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereby they are made one body, &amp; one flesh. If antiquitie giue authoritie to things? it was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the creation? If the author, God did first institute it; If the place where it began? it was established in Paradise; If the witnesses? Iesus Christ himselfe did autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize it by his presence; If sanctity? God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it to his holy covenant, promising in <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>O see, that he will marry vs vnto himselfe for ever in righteousnesse and mercy</hi>; It is an assistance given vnto man; a lenitiue of all afflictions, a remedy against in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinency; and amongst faithfull persons it is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall harmonie, to ioine their praiers, to comfort them vp in their miseries, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them on to good workes, and in slipperie places to reach out their helping hands to each other. This is that which preserues mankind from perishing, it is the seed-plot of the Church, the fountaine and originall of al kinred and affinitie that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11387:12"/>
is in the world; without this men would liue dispersed like savage beastes, without making vp families, which are the first and principall parts of a Common wealth.</p>
               <p>Where is the man this day living, whose virginitie may be compared with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> marriage, in whome all the nations of the world were blest? Wherevpon <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>S. Austin</hi> also opposeth it to the virginity of <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> But there is nothing that doth add more authoritie vnto marriage, then that comparison so often <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.</note> reiterated in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, whereby the <hi>vnion of Iesus Christ with his Church</hi> is compared vnto <hi>marriage.</hi> The bond whereof is the holy Ghost, the contract the Gospell, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were the Registers of this contract, and Iesus Christ himselfe sealed it with his bloud: the betrothing is here below in the Church, but the wedding it selfe shall bee solemnized in heaven. God clothing this spiritual vnion with these borrowed terms to the end that no man might condemne marriage, but he should withal despise his covenant. The <hi>Prophets, Levits,</hi> yea and the <hi>High Priests</hi> entered this holy course of life, which before the division made by <hi>David,</hi> were to serue every day at morning
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11387:12"/>
and evening sacrifice. But if God had thought that there had beene any polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in marriage, hee would haue found some other meanes to continue the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of his Priests, then by the heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry succession of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after their fathers. Especially seeing that then in outward things, and bodily cleannesse, God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a great deale more puritie vnder the law then he doth now adaies. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles also were married: for in the first of S. <hi>Mark</hi> there is mention made of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>S. Peters</hi> wife. And S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 11. Chap. of the 2. to the <hi>Corinthians, All the Apostles,</hi> saith hee, <hi>except Iohn and Paule had wiues. Ignatius</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> doth not except Saint <hi>Paul</hi>; but saith, that <hi>Peter and Paule, &amp; the other Apostles were married.</hi> And <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus</hi> in the 3. booke of his <hi>Stromes,</hi> after a long reprehension of those which despise marriage vnder the shew of a more strict sanctititie, addeth. <hi>Doe they reiect the Apostles? For Peter and Philip begat children. Philip married his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to husbandes, and Paule sticks not to speake vnto his wife in one of his Epistles.</hi> Now it is to be noted that in these places,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11387:13"/>
the Fathers speak of marriage as it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against incontinencie, and as it was thought by some to be lesse holy then vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie; to the end that none should thinke that they thought the <hi>Apostles</hi> had wiues, but never lay with them. They tell Christ truly in the 9. Chap. of S. <hi>Matthew, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold we haue forsaken all and followed thee,</hi> And Iesus answers them; <hi>Whosoever shall forsake houses, or brethren, or sisters, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my names sake, hee shall receiue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth fold more, and shall inherit everlasting life.</hi> But we must knowe that this promise is made vnto all the faithfull, and not only to the Pastours of the Church. For he saith <hi>Whosoever shal leaue &amp;c.</hi> and yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse no man would infer out of this place that all the faithfull must abstaine from their wiues, or forsake their children for Christs sake; only our Saviour would that all the faithful should leaue all that is most neare and deare vnto them, when it shall hinder them from following him, &amp; when it cannot stand together with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Gospell. Moreover Christ here placeth the wife, and the children, &amp; the lands, and the houses in the same rank.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11387:13"/>
If a Bishop therefore may bee suffered to enioy his lands, or houses, in the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion that hee did enioy them before hee was a Bishop or Priest, what reason is there but that he should enioy his wife in the same manner that hee did before hee was a Priest? And if a father that is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made a Priest shal not for all this be less a father the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was before, why should hee become lesse an husband? Especially seeing that there is an expresse commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of our Lord in the 19. of S. <hi>Matt.</hi> which doth not permit a man to <hi>leaue his wife for any other cause but adulterie.</hi> And which saieth, that <hi>they are no more two but one flesh, Let no man therefore put that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder which God hath coupled together</hi>; Now it is manifest that the separation which he speakes of, is a separation of the bed, seeing that he opposeth it against that coniunction by which man and woman are made <hi>one body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This doctrine being sound divinity, and built vpon the worde of God, as we will shew it yet more manifestly; it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iust cause that the contrary doctrine is called <hi>the doctrine of Devils.</hi> The first that ever spake against marriage were the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11387:14"/>
Marcionites,</hi> &amp; <hi>Manichees,</hi> after who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Papistrie succeeded, a religion patched vp togither out of the divers shrids of ancient heresies. For the Popes haue set themselues directly to contradict the Apostles <hi>St</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> who saith, that <hi>a Bishop should be vnreprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of one wife, having his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vnder obedience with all honesty.</hi> On the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary <hi>Pope Pelagius</hi> in the 61. <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> commandes, that <hi>there should be no bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop chosen, but such a one that hath neither wife, nor children, nor any other crime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the canons.</hi> There is nothing more opposite.

               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:11387:14"/>It is true that our adversaries to obscure this truth, say that <hi>S. Paul</hi> speakes of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes which forbad marriage not onlie to Clarckes and Ministers, but to the lay people too, and that as a wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane thing in its owne nature; That the Church of Rome forbids marriage only to Clarckes, and Monkes, and such as haue made a vow of continency, and forbids it them not as an vncleane thing, but as a <hi>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sell of perfection,</hi> and as a more strict &amp; san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified profession.</p>
               <p n="1">1 I answere that they delude themselues in seeking to delude vs. For the Apostle calleth those false teachers in general that forbid marriage without specifying anie cause for which they forbid it: the rule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing general, it is not for vs to put in I know not what exceptions which the worde of God shall not put in. By diverse lines wee may well come to the same point, and by diverse waies runne to the same precipice. The selfe same errour is formed in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of men by diverse reasons, yet all the causes of error, and contrary to the holie Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Besides I say that they deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues if they think that the <hi>Manichees</hi> for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11387:15"/>
bad marriage vnto all, they forbad it them only whom they called their chosen or <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi>; For so did they name their <hi>pastours,</hi> &amp; such as made profession of a more exact &amp; sanctified kinde of life amongst them. <hi>S. Austin</hi> is a witnesse fit to bee believed for this, because himselfe was a <hi>Manichee</hi> at first for a long time: who in the <hi>second book, of the manners of the Church,</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees, &amp;</hi> 18. <hi>Chapt.</hi> brings in the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees</hi> speaking as our adversaries doe at this day. <hi>Here,</hi> saith he, <hi>I knowe that you wil exclaime for to make vs odious, that you doe not forbid marriage at all, since that is not forbidden to your hearers (which are in the</hi> 2 <hi>rancke amongst you) to marry, and to haue wiues.</hi> And in his 74. <hi>Epist. They which are called the hearers amongst them, eate flesh, plough their fields, and haue wiues too if they will, none of which are done by those whome they call their elect.</hi> Whence it also appears that they did not take marriage to be sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply bad, since they did permit it to their people. No more true is that which our aduersaries say that the Church of Rome doth not maintain that marriage is a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vncleane thing in its own nature. For see how the Popes speake of it. <hi>Pope

                  <hi>that they which dwell with their wiues should be receaued to any holy charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is written, Be yee holy as I am holy, saith the Lord.</hi> This Pope it seems thought that marriage could not stand together with sanctity. And by consequence that it was a prophane thing. And note the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse; For when God saith, <hi>Be yee holy,</hi> hee speakes to all men: but if by this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement God did require that men should abstaine from their wiues, what remaines there more but that there should no man bee married? To the same purpose doth he produce the passage of the <hi>Apostle to Titus Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Vnto the pure al things are pure, but to them that are defiled and vnbeleeuing, is nothing pure.</hi> Vpon this place doth hee ground the <hi>single life of Priests</hi> to the end they may bee <hi>pure,</hi> otherwise hee thinkes them <hi>defiled and vnbeleiuing.</hi> Also wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wresting that saying of the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. v 8.9. against married persons. Hee speakes thus to the Clarks. <hi>They which are in the flesh cannot please God; Now yee are not in the flesh but in the spirit.</hi> Could hee more disgrace married men then to saie they cannot please God. For note that the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11387:16"/>
Apostle in this place speaks to al the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in generall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pope Syricius</hi> in the same <hi>Distinction</hi> speakes yet more disgracefully of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; for first he ranckes the <hi>Priestes</hi> which beget children vpon their owne wiues, with those that commit adulterie. <hi>We haue vnderstood,</hi> saith he, <hi>that many Priests and Deacons, haue a long time after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, gotten children both in marriage, as also by fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi>; A little after he speaks vnto them both equally; <hi>Let them which are giuen to fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; which teach these sinnes tel me &amp;c.</hi> And we haue heard aboue how <hi>Pope Pelagius</hi> accounts the marriage of Clarkes for a sinne. So in the 31. <hi>Cause,</hi> 1. <hi>Quest. Canon. Hac ratione,</hi> the <hi>Romish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> saith, that howbeit the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> haue commanded second marriages, yet according to truth, and in reason it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. And the vow of single life is by them called the vow of chastity, as though there were no chastitie in marriage. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine in his</hi> 34. <hi>Ch. of the book of Monkes,</hi> stiles the <hi>marriage of Clarkes and Monkes</hi> by the name of <hi>sacrilege,</hi> and affirmes that they <hi>sinne lesse which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, after they haue once taken a vow, then they doe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11387:16"/>
which marry.</hi> And in the 19. <hi>Chap. of the</hi> 1. <hi>booke of Clarkes,</hi> he saith that the <hi>marriage of Saints is not without some pollution &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanesse.</hi> And indeed should this people hold their peace, yet experience would tel as much. For who is there but knows, that to see a Priest keepe a pretty wench in his house, or to goe into a Stewes, is thought but a laughing matter, and held to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall slip? But if a Priest should be married in the sight of the Church, this would bee held for a prodigie; They would say that this were the cause of the plague or the dearth that lay vpon them; that the eclipse of the sunne did prognosticate this: &amp; out of question it should bee recorded in their Chronicles. The former is but simple forni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation, but the other is <hi>sacrilege.</hi> For 500. publicke brothell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> houses to be in the citty of Rome is thought nothing so hainous a crime, as that one of the <hi>Cordiliers</hi> should be seene to be married. <hi>Moyses, Samuel,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> and the Apostle <hi>S. Peter,</hi> which were all married, would be thought monsters now a daies; &amp; a man might get mony by leading them about to bee seene for strange sightes. By this therefore wee see that this prophecy is fulfilled every
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:11387:17"/>
kinde of way.</p>
               <p>They excuse it by their <hi>vow,</hi> and say that the marriage of clarks and monks is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sacrilege because in beeing married they breake their vow. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere that if the marriage of clarcks were therfore only to be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, they should call it by the name of faithlesnesse only, or infidelitie, and not of <hi>pollution</hi> as <hi>Pope Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricius</hi> doth; nor yet of <hi>sacrilege</hi> as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> And in trueth why is it that before they receiue any to be clarckes they exact this vow of them so severely without anie exception, but that they thinke that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in it selfe is not lawfull for them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they tooke no vow.</p>
               <p>As for the necessity of keeping vowes, I say, that the first vowes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are good and necessarie, may not be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by those we take after, &amp; I am perswaded they will grant me this. But a clarcke before ever he were a clarcke did he not make a vow and promise to God to keepe his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? This is that which we all promise at our first entrance into the Church, and although we did not promise it, yet for all that were we bound to keepe it. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the commandements of God this

Can they without impietie affirme that he must rather keepe the vowe made to the Church wherevnto he is not tied by God, then that which he made to God, &amp; which he were bound to keepe although hee had not made it?

Why are humane institutions more strictly kept the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods commandements? insomuch that a Priest which shall commit fornication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the law of God, is thought to haue sinned a great deale lesse then if hee were

married against the promise made to the Church without the commaundement of God? the one being called but fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the other held to be sacrilege.

               <p>But I would yet further be informed, if when a man take vpon him to be a Monk and promise to liue chastly, whether by this promise he doe not withall promise to abstain from fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they would blush to deny this. It followes therefore that hee sinnes far more in committing fornication then in marrying, seeing that by fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (besides the violating of the generall vow which all men are bound to make to God, he also breaketh his very monasticall vow which hee tooke vpon him over and aboue the commandement of God. To all these things our adversaries never answer directly, nor speak they ought to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11387:18"/>
who acknowledge that virginitie is the most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious state of life to serue God in without straying, that marriage hath its discommodities, and as the Apostle saith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>troubles in the flesh,</hi> especially in time of persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But these praises agree only to <hi>chast virginitie,</hi> which doth not consist only in keeping the body from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse, but in withholding the minde too from lust. Whosoever hath this perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp; besides hath discretion enough to guid his familie, that man doth wisely to liue single. But if he be set vpon by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked desires, and yet notwithstanding doth still affect a single life, he provoketh God, exposeth himselfe to temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ensnares his conscience, and digs a pit for himselfe to fall in. <hi>Chast marriage</hi> will never be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to so many discommodities as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent virginitie, for what doe they which liue in this state, but chew the bit it secret, thinking that condition of life most sweet and happy which they are denyed to liue, desiring that which they fly, hauing their thoughts defiled with vnchast imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and yet notwithstanding all this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued not to follow the counsell of God, and to abstaine from vsing the remedies

which hee hath prescribed. This is a vice for which Philosophie could never finde a name, to burne with lust, and whilst wee are in this taking, to vow to God that wee will flie from the remedies that hee hath ordained against it; which is all one as if a man were sicke, and should promise God that he would take no Phisicke, there is rashnesse in this mixed together with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durat superstition.</p>

As who should say, that God gaue one power to be an Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peror, but yet did not grant that he should be an Emperour; that God gaue a man power to bee wise, but yet did not graunt that he should be wise. But to what ende serues that power, that is neuer reduced in to act? For our question was not, whether God gaue the power or the act; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he gaue the act of being continent to all men? Hee confesseth therefore that hee giues not this but to some particulars; and that to be actually continent is a guift of god that is not given to all. If then there be a Monke, to whom God hath not give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gift of continency, and which burnes with inward lust, who shall tell you him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that after so many <hi>Pater Nosters</hi> said,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:11387:20"/>
and often fastings, hee is yet still tempted with the spirit of fornication; I woulde knowe whether such a one bee to followe the Apostles counsell, that is to marry, or else to continue in his former incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie? But it ill befits these fellowes to talke of such things. For as it ill beseems a slaue to discourse of liberty, or a man with his belly ful to preach fasting &amp; pennance: so also is it ill beseeming these squires that liue so vnchastly, to dispute of chastitie. For their liues speak against them, &amp; their rules are refuted by their actions. Hardly would a man beleeue them since they doe not beleeue themselues, and since they make a vow of chastity, that so they may liue the more dissolutely. They speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst nature, whilst they are most giuen to nature; (to say nothing of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures contrary to nature.) Let them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore first learne to liue, before they goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to dispute; and let the Covent go no more to the Stewes, nor the Stewes bee kept any more in the Cove<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if they would not haue vs beleeue that continency is a gift, which God giues not to such as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his word. Or if every one may haue it that will, the more to blame they for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:11387:20"/>
it, since it was in their power to haue had it.</p>
               <p>Nor let them speake any more to vs of these vowes, which are a yoke of yron, and a snare to intangle weake soules. For they omit the first point, which is, that they should knowe before they take any vowe, whether it be good and lawful; seeing that if it be not lawfull to make, it is vnlawfull to keep. Things which are bad to promise, are worse yet to performe. Virginity is a good thing, &amp; honest, but for a man to tie himselfe thereto, is a token of rashnesse &amp; ignorance of his owne infirmity.</p>
               <p>For vowes are the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue these 3 conditions, 1. If the things vowed be good. 2. If they bee such as we know to be in our owne power. 3. If we vow them willingly and wittingly. None of al which are found in the vowes of chastity which the Monckes and Clarckes take; For to liue single is good, but not for all, but only for such as haue the gift of continency: it is good, but not in that degree of goodnes as they would haue it, making it a kinde of perfection aboue the law, and a worke of supererogation whereby we render God more then we owe him. It is hard that that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:11387:21"/>
which is the occasion of so much vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse should be a work of more worth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loue God with all our hearts. Or that that should be a worke of supererogation, which if every one kept, the church would ere long bee abolisht from the face of the earth, 2. That it is not in our power we haue shewed already, &amp; their liues which make this vow, shew their vnablenesse to perform it. 3. The monastical vow is not al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>waies made wittingly, and willingly. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there be that enter into it through cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, some through despaire, and others out of ignorance, and in their tender age when they doe not knowe what the motions of lust meane. A father will say, how shall I marry all my daughters, how shal I devide my goods amongst so many sonnes? I must needs place my lame sonne in a monastery, &amp; since he is fit for no other calling, make him a man of the church. It is a rare thing and seldome seene to offer a lamb without spot to God. And these poore children be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing come to yeares they finde themselues taken in the net, into which they entred at first as it were reioicing, but liue therein sorrowing, seeing themselues caught, with out all hope of ever being set at liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:11387:21"/>Seeing then it is better for the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our life to follow sacred and sure rules, then rash and indiscreet vowes; and not so much to keepe that to which wee haue bound our selues, as that to which we are bound by God, we will conclude this discourse, with the rule of the Apostle. 1. <hi>Tim. chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Let a bishop therefore be vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueable, the husband of one wife, ruling his owne house honestly, having his children vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obedience with all reverence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The common evasion is, that <hi>S. Paule</hi> meanes only that a Bishop must not haue had but one wife before his election into that charge, but that after his election he is to haue none. <hi>Hierome</hi> a professed enemie of marriage vnderstandes it thus. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret these words therefore, <hi>Let a Bishop be,</hi> by these, <hi>Let a Bishop haue beene.</hi> By their reckoning the Apostle should speak thus. <hi>Let such a one be chosen to bee a Bishop that hath beene irreproueable, the husbvnde of one wife, watching, temperate, modest</hi>; or, <hi>but let him now be so no longer</hi>; so doe they make the Apostle the teacher of vices, and the entrance into a Bishoprick to be a cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from vertue.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:11387:22"/>
his words so strangely, yet, as it seemes, he meant purposely to put the matter out of controversie, by that which he annexeth in the 12 verse. <hi>Let the deacons be the husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of one wife, and such as can rule their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well, and their owne housholds</hi>; where these words <hi>Let them be,</hi> go immediatly before, and are ioined only to the word, <hi>husbands.</hi> And, which is more, in the 11. verse, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth that <hi>their wiues be honest, not evill speakers, but sober, and faithfull in al things.</hi> Who would thinke that <hi>S.

For in the Aethiopian Church, which containes 17. realmes, the Monckes are married, and are labouring and handy crafts men; and in the Greeke Church the Priests and Deacons are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried once. Witnesse the Canon <hi>Aliter</hi> in the 32. Distinction. The tradition of the East church is divers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this of the church of Rome. For their Priests, Deacons, and Subdeaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are marryed: But in this church no priest fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a subdeacon to a bishop hath any liberty to marry. In the very same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is the iudgement of the councell of <hi>Nice</hi> set downe in these words, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the resistance made by <hi>Paphnutius</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Thebais. Now Paphnutius the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor withstood this, shewing that marriage was honorable, and saying that it was chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for a man to liue with his owne wife. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore hee advised the councell not to establish such a law; affirming that it was a matter of importance, and that it would bee an occasion either to them or their wiues of fornication.</hi> And this was <hi>Paphnutius</hi> his opinion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though himselfe were not married, whose advise was approved of by the Synod. The like is reported by <hi>Socrates</hi> in his 1. booke
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11387:23"/>
and 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> &amp; by <hi>Sozomene</hi> in his 1. book 23. <hi>Chap.</hi> &amp; by <hi>Nicephorus Callistus</hi> in the 8. book of his history, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. and by the actes of the councell of <hi>Nice</hi> written by <hi>Gelasius Cysicensus,</hi> all which do not onlie speake of suffering Priests to haue wiues, but graunt them the enioining of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bed, as honest and lawfull. Which I haue therefore the longer insisted vpon, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause there be some that haue mard this hi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>story, and that tell it otherwise. In the 56. Distinction, in the Canon <hi>Osius,</hi> there is a greate bedroll of bishops reckoned vp, which were the sonnes of bishops, Priests, or Deacons; And least a man should think that they were begotten before their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had taken holy orders, a little after in the same Distinction, the exposition is annexed in these wordes. <hi>When we reade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue that Priests children haue beene made Popes, we must not thinke that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got by fornication, but by lawfull marriage, which, before this prohibition, was permitted vnto all, and is at this day (as all know) suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the East Church.</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:11387:24"/>
difference betweene a Priest that is married, as though it were not lawfull to receaue the sacrament at his hands when he shal serue it, Let him be an Anathema.</hi> A Canon which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath falsified in the 21. Chap. of his first book of Clerkes, having turned <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The 6. Generall councell assembled at <hi>Trulla</hi> to make Canons hath an expresse ordinaunce herevpon in the 13. Canon in these words. <hi>For as much as we haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that it hath beene ordained for a rule in the Church of Rome, that whosoever will bee a Deacon or Priect, must first protest that he will never any more after that haue to doe with his wife: we, following the Apostolicall order &amp; discipline, will that the lawfull mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:11387:24"/>
of Clergy men be for ever availeable, by no means separating them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their wiues, nor forbidding them to come togither at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient times. Wherefore if any one shall be thought worthy to be chosen a subdeacon, dea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>con, or a Priest, let him not be hindred from mounting to this degree because he dwels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with his lawfull wife, and let it not bee exacted of him in the day of his election to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of his lawfull spowse. Least by this we be constrained to disgrace marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which was first instituted by God, and blessed by his presence, seeing that the Gospel cries out that no man shoulde separate that which God hath ioined togither</hi>; This, vnder the paine of excommunication &amp; deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and all against the Church of Rome, expresly named in the Canon. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> incensed against the Councel, cals it profane, in his 1. booke of Clarkes 19. <hi>Chap.</hi> so defaming and disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing these ancient cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels as often as they shall speake against the Church of Rome. But he did not marke how withall he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> which allowes of this 6.

               <p>Wee haue heard a multitude of ancient authors herevpon, which teach that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were marryed. If we beleeue <hi>Plati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in the life of <hi>Cletus</hi> the 1. <hi>S. Luke</hi> was marryed, and had his wife in <hi>Bythynia. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi> towards the end of his epistle to <hi>Draco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius,</hi> shews the custome in his daies. <hi>Many bishops,</hi> saith he, <hi>are not marryed, on the contrary there bee Monckes that are the fathers of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; as on the other side we haue knowne bishops that haue had children, and Moncks that haue had none:</hi> as who should say, that in this there was no law nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie imposed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> in the 22. <hi>chap.</hi> of his 5. booke. <hi>Many</hi> (saith hee) <hi>whilst they were bishops haue had children of their lawfull wiues. St</hi>. <hi>Gregorie</hi> of <hi>Nysse, brother to Basilius,</hi> was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:11387:25"/>
married; of whom <hi>Nicephorus</hi> speaks thus in the 11. Chap. of his 11. booke. <hi>Although he had a wife, in other things he was not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to his brother. Sozomene</hi> in the 11. Chap. of his 1. booke speakes thus of Saint <hi>Spiridion. Hee was a plaine man hauing wife and children, but this made him never the worse for his divine function.

               <p>And <hi>Synesius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Bishop, although hee tolde them plainely that hee would not therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his wife, and would haue as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny children by her as he could. <hi>S. Hierome</hi> himselfe a mortall enimie of marriage, yet neverthelesse (when hee is out of coller a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Iovinian</hi>) allowes of the marriage of Bishops. For in his Epistle to <hi>Oceanus,</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:11387:26"/>
he defendes <hi>Carterius</hi> a Bishop of <hi>Spaine</hi> which had a second wife, against a certain lewd fellowe, which being a fornicator spoke il of <hi>Carterius</hi> his marriage. He saith therefore. <hi>Carterius hath desired to haue children by his wife; but thou by giuing thy body to a queane hast destroyed thy race. He hid himselfe in the secret corners of his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whilst he served nature, and the blessing of God, saying, encrease and multiply, &amp; fill the earth; but thou serving thy beastly lust in open places wert detested by the beholders. Hee concealed a lawfull action by an honest modesty; but thou hast exposed thy vnlawfull actions to the sight of all men. For him it is written, that marriage is honorable, and the bed vndefiled; but for thee, that God shall iudge fornicators and adulterers.</hi> And the same <hi>Hierome</hi> against <hi>Iovinian,</hi> where hee speaketh so disgracefully of marriage, doth yet acknowledge that in his time Priestes were married. <hi>If it be said</hi> (saith he) <hi>that Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>muel, which was brought vp at the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, had a wife, how doth this preiudice virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie? As if there were not at this day many Priests that are married: seeing that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle describes a Bishop to be the husband of one wife, &amp;c. Leo</hi> the 1. Bishop of Rome in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:11387:26"/>
his 85. Epistle speaking of the Apostles Commandement of choosing a Bishop, which either is, or hath beene the husband but of one wife, saith that <hi>this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was alwaies observed so religiously that the same condition was held fit to bee kept in choosing the wife of a Priest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet (notwithstanding al this) I doe not deny, but that many holy men in times past, haue devoted themselues to a single life; thinking marriage a state of life not so agreeable with a Bishops calling as virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Wee may see many examples for this in <hi>Chrysostome, Epiphanius, Hierome,</hi> and <hi>Ambrose.</hi> And which is more, <hi>Origen</hi> that hee might liue chastly did vtterly disable himselfe for being fit for the act of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; whether it were that he did geld himselfe, or vse some other means to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his members. And indeed, as the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels before mentioned doe permit a Priest to take a wife, and to enioy her as hee did before he was a Priest; so I confesse it was the most vsual custome for Priests to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry before they tooke orders, it being the common fashion at this day in Greece for their Priests to take wiues some few daies before their ordination, and those once
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:11387:27"/>
dead, never to marry againe; but to bee married after their ordination this was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsuall. Vntill at last the Councell of <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caesarea</hi> which is but provinciall, did in the 1. Canon forbid Priests ever to marry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their admission. These were yet but the seeds of error; to which, that they might not encrease, the Councels held in the East, haue made Canons cleane contrary. But in the West, that is to say, in the Latin Church, which is called the Roman, the Romish Bishops hauing found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that virginitie was the fittest state for the preserving of Church goods, &amp; of maintaining their authority ouer the Cler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gie, did willingly admit of it, and by all meanes seeke to vphold it. And this evill, being increast amongst the <hi>Gaules, Salvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> a Bishop of <hi>Marsilia,</hi> which lived in the time of <hi>Clowis</hi> as then an heathen, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth much of it, towards the later ende of his 5. booke of providence; where hee speakes after this wise vnto such as did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from marriage that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into some holy order of religion. <hi>This is a new kinde of change. They doe not that which they may, and doe that which they may not. They abstaine from marrying, but doe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11387:27"/>
not abstaine from rapine. O foolish perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>! what dost thou? God hath forbidden sinnes, &amp; not marriages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> the 1. bishop of Rome did main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine this errour to the vtmost of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, about the yeare of our Lord, 600. and yet notwithstanding in <hi>Boniface</hi> his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, and 4 booke of dialogues, 11. <hi>chap.</hi> he speakes of Priests wiues whom hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Presbyteras,</hi> and makes mention of a Priest of <hi>Narsia,</hi> that did abstaine from ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his wife, <hi>For</hi> (saith <hi>Gregory) holie men haue this property, sometimes to abstaine from lawfull things, that so they may alwaies estrange themselues from the things that are vnlawfull.</hi> In his iudgement therefore, if this priest had dwelt with his wife, hee had done no more then what he might do law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>To be short, what care and diligence so ever the bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> and their substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes did vse, they coulde not effect what they intended, but slowly: there being not as yet aboue 500. yeares past, since that Priests were married in <hi>France, England</hi> &amp; <hi>Germanie.</hi> For the proofe whereof I could produce many good witnesses, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the great oppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that the Popes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:11387:28"/>
haue had in this matter, and the generall outcries of the whole clergie.</p>
               <p>It remaines that wee make good this clause of the Apostles prophecy, wherein hee foretelleth vs that lying spirites shall teach this errour through hypocrisie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauterized consciences, that is to say, having lost all sense and feeling of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as a tooth or other part of the bodie that is seared with an hot yron to dead it.</p>
               <p>Nowe that this doctrine was first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Doctours of the Romish church even against their owne consciences it is easie to prooue by vnanswerable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="1">1 For they call marriage a sacrament, and yet they say that in Monks &amp; Priests it is sacriledge. Can they possibly imagine that one and the selfesame action shoulde be a sacrament in one, and sacriledge in an other? Or that any one may be said to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mit sacriledge in vsing a sacrament?</p>
               <p n="2">2 Againe, this is against their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when they faine that they establish this decree of virginity for no other ende but that Clerkes should be the more holy, when the true cause thereof indeede, is the preservation of church goods, for feare a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11387:28"/>
bishop or Priest should pare awaie some thing from them, and imploy it to the vse of his wife and children; as Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> witnesseth in the 28. Distinction, &amp; Canon <hi>De Syracusanis,</hi> where he saith that the rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son why he did refuse to admit of a certain bishop, was, because he had a wife, &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by whom the church goods doe vse to be endangered. And yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, at the vrgent request of the people of <hi>Syracusa</hi> he did receiue him, on condition that his wife and children should not med<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dle at all with the church revenewes.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is also against their owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that having once confessed, that the single life of priests and monkes, is not by the commandement of God, but only by the law of man; yet they labour to proue it out of the scripture. For if their proofes be good, then is it by the law of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4 It is likewise against their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that after they haue acknowledged that fornication is vnlawfull by the law of God, and that the single life of priests is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished only by the law of man, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they mainetaine that it is a lesse sinne for a Priest to commit fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then to marry.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:11387:29"/>5 It is not with a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science that whilest they exact a vowe of chastitie of their priests, they should in the mean space excuse their lasciviousnesse, as the * Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists do, which haue made this glosse on the Decree in the 11. cause quest. 3. <hi>But if a priest embrace a woman, it is to bee presumed that hee doth it to no other end, but to giue her a fatherly benediction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 They goe against their conscience, when they say, that they doe not forbidde marriage, and yet will not suffer a priest, that is a knowne fornicatour, to bee mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
               <p n="7">7 They speake against their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when they say that they are no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of such marriages as are approved of in the Scripture, and yet never the lesse in their Decrees (which are the lawes of the church of Rome) they suffer <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="9">9 It cannot bee with a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that they exact the vow of continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and yet take away the remedy against incontinency: that they tie men to chastity and yet wincke at fornication: forbidding marriage, and opening the Stewes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they say that they avoid a greater evil, contrary to the rule of the <note n="*" place="margin">

For looke howe many the more prohibitions there are, so many the more dispensations must there bee, which are bought at a deare rate, and by so much the more is he repaired vnto. And note that he doth not only dispense with prohibitions of his owne making, but with those which God hath made too; suffering Vnkles to marry their Neeces, especially in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Princes: to the end that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> borne of such that are thus married, should for their owne ease bee glad to vphold his authoritie.

               <p>THe Apostle S. <hi>Peter</hi> commaunding vs to watch, and be sober presupposeth that sobriety is a helpe to vigilancie. For it is hard to watch with a full belly: one that is drunke is no fit ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be a sentinell. This watchfulnesse is requisite to foresee the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults of Satan, and to avoide his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to make vs lift vp our harts direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto God. For as a man cannot well stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the kitchin, so neither can one easilie meditate of heavenly things whilst his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is set vpon meat. The belly must hold his peace, when the spirit speakes to God, and the desire of eating be as it were mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by this spirituall hunger, wherof our Saviour speakes in the 4. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> saying, <hi>My meate is to do the will of my father that sent me</hi>; hardly can the loue of God liue to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gither with the pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pring of the body. Hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly can a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ever imprint any mark of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:11387:31"/>
in his hart, whose palate is more skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then his vnderstanding: or which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralleth his minde to his belly, nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this not so much for necessity, as curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity: but if this evill be pernicious at all times, it followes that sobriety is alwaies necessary, and that a Christians life ought to be a continuall fast; yea, I dare affirme, that in this, piety may learne of superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For if the superstitious do fast the eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of holy daies, why should not wee fast all our life long, since it is nothing els but the vigill of that great holyday which is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting sabbaoth?</p>
               <p>Fasting therefore is an holy exercise, &amp; in the worde of God ordinarily ioined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with praier. So our Lord Iesus in the 17. chap. of <hi>S. Matthew</hi> and 21 verse, speakes of certaine stubborne spirits, that <hi>could not be cast out but by praier &amp; fasting.</hi> And <hi>S. Paul</hi> in the 1. to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> &amp; 7. chap. <hi>Defraud not one an other, except it be with consent for a time, that yee may giue your selues to fasting and praier.</hi> For they knew that there was a mutuall accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween praier and fasting. Fasting enflames praier, and praier sanctifies fasting; Fasting remoues negligence from praier, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11387:32"/>
remoues pride and superstition from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting. For as prayer without fasting is but slow, so fasting without praier is but a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diet, and no spirituall exercise. God is more angry then pleased with this service, if that whilst a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath an empty stomack, he be dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ken with wrath, or glutted with lewd lusts. For he reckons of both alike, both of the surfets of the wicked, and the fasts of hypocrits, which change vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to foolery, and christian sobriety into a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of meats, and into scrupulous ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>servations, with (I know not) what opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of merit, and satisfaction. As though fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting could satisfie God, or as though hee were bounde more to pleasure him which hath lost his dinner. For true fasting is to make vs more fit for to serue God, but not for to merit any thing at his hands, or for to lay downe a payment for our sinnes, for which Iesus Christ hath already fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>But it is not so now a daies; so hath su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition overrun true devotion, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this holy exercise. This abuse began in the Apostles time; and is reprehended by the Apostle <hi>S. Paul</hi> in the 2. chap. of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> where he rebukes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:11387:32"/>
those which said, <hi>tast not, touch not, handle not,</hi> doing this, not because they thought any kinde of meate more vncleane then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but (saith he) by a voluntary religion, and humblenes of minde, that they might not spare their bodies, nor haue any regard to pampring of their flesh. Some 150 years after came the <hi>Tatians</hi> and <hi>Montanists,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and after them <hi>Eustacius</hi> bishop of <hi>Sebastia</hi> (whom <hi>Sozomen</hi> takes to be the author of the <hi>Asceticks</hi> of <hi>Basil</hi>) taught certaine superstitious fasts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions of meates; all which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for hereticall by the ancient Church.</p>
               <p>Last of all came the Church of Rome, which now is so far transported with this errour, that the greatest part of their religi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on consisteth in these petty observatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of daies, and distinctions of meats, which are so many in number, that the bondage of the legall Ceremonies might be called li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in respect of these; For whosoever will reckon vp all their fasting daies in a yeare, shall finde that they come to more then 5 months yearely. In some of these daies flesh only is forbidden; in others but<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter also and egges. In Spaine they are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

on fasting daies to eate the inwardes of calues, and sheepe, which they call <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillos</hi> and <hi>menudillos.</hi> A good and religious christian is now a daies discerned by this, to wit, if he keepe Lent, and the fowre Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber weeks, and the vigils of Festival daies; that which was craftily imposed at first. For in taking away the holy scripture fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people, and giving them divine service in an vnknowne tongue, he must needes thinke on some think to busie their bodies withall, whilst he did blind their minds, &amp; giue them some corporall exercise, whilst hee robbed them of spirituall instruction. Hence comes it that the poore people doe to a day know all the fasting daies exactly, and how many holy day evens there be to be fasted; but knowe nothing at all in the scripture. Hence also comes it that the priest in confession doth carefully enquire of the sinner, whether he hath kept Lent or no, and the 4 fasts: but never asketh if hee haue confirmed his faith in the promises of the gospell, if he be instructed in the holie scripture, if he vnderstand the misteries of our redemption: if he loue God with all his hart, and his neighbor as himselfe: But if it be found that the sinner haue broken
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:11387:34"/>
the ordinance of the Church by eating flesh in Lent, especially in the week which they call, the holy weeke; the Priest then hath no power to absolue him, but sendes him to the penitentiarie. As for murder, &amp; adulterie, and other lesse sinnes which are but against the law of God, the Priest can easily absolue him from such crimes; On the contrary, if hee haue fulfilled the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Church, and fasted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawes thereof, why, this is a meritorious worke, not only for his sins that shall thus haue fasted, but for the sins of others too. And this fasting is not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie of meat, but he is said to keepe Lent, that eateth no flesh, nor egges, although hee drinke that which is better, and feed on the best fish that can be got: for as for their after-suppers of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and drie suckats, they are not recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, because they take these as Physick, &amp; for to follow the Apostles counsell whoe advised <hi>Timothie</hi> to comforte himselfe by drinking wine against the weaknes of the stomacke. So haue they beene more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to fulfill the Apostles prophecie then the commandement of God.</p>
               <p>Their ordinarie excuse is, that <hi>S. Paule</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:11387:35"/>
in this prophecie speaketh of the <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> and <hi>Manichees,</hi> which held some meats to be vncleane &amp; profane: But that the Church of Rome thinkes no meat vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, but only forbids certaine kindes thereof for some few daies, to take downe the flesh by using it the more coursly, and by withholding such meates from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as doe most provoke lust.</p>
               <p n="1">1 But against this, wee haue seene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, how the Apostle <hi>S. Paule</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Colosians,</hi> condemneth those by name which by refraining from set kindes of meate (being led therevnto by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary religion and humblenesse of minde, thought to vse their bodies hardly, &amp; had no regard to the pampring of their flesh. And hee speakes not to the Iewes, for the Iewes did not abstain from certaine kinds of meats for to subdue their bodies, but to obay <hi>Moyses</hi> law. Besides <hi>S. Paul</hi> calleth these observations the commandements of men, but the Iewes kept theirs as the commandements of God. Herevnto adde that the Apostle speaketh of such who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the errour of distinguishing of meats did worship Angels withall. An errour wherewith as then the Iewes were not branded.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:11387:35"/>2 Moreover the Apostle speakes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and reckons the forbidding of meat, amongst the errors and doctrines of Devils, without specifying any reason for which it is done; The Church of Rome doth doe that which heretickes doe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be for another reason.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But what matter is it whether wee knowe for what cause they of the Church of Rome do abstaine from certaine meats, since in effect they make a conscience to eate of them, &amp; that the Apostle doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid vs to make a conscience of this; For behold his words in the 10. of the 1. to the <hi>Corinthians. If any of them which belieue not, call you to a feast, and if you will goe, what soever is set before you, eate, asking no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion for conscience sake.</hi> This rule likes not the Church of Rome, the people whereof are instructed, when they shall bee invited by such as they call hereticks and infidels, to make a conscience of not eating all things indifferently that are set before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Behold therefore a forbidding of meates condemned by the Apostle, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence the fulfilling of this prophecie.</p>
               <p>But what if wee shewe that the Church of Rome doth count flesh and the like
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11387:36"/>
meats to be vncleane in their own nature? For if it forbid the eating of flesh for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason but onely because it provokes to lust, it should far rather haue forbidden, wine, and sauce, and sweet meates, which enflame the bloud, and doe far more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke lust then any thing else whatsoever. 2 But what meanes that custome of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying their meat after Lent to the Priest for him to say his exorcismes over it, and blesse it, if they did not thinke that some wicked spirits lay lurking in it al the Lent long, and that it had some pollutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it had need to be purged? For if it were otherwise, and if that the intent of the Priest were only to blesse the meate, as we doe ours vsually at meales before we feede vpon it, this blessing would bee as good at any other times, as after Lent, and there would need no coniuration. This is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise confirmed by this, that the religious which make profession of a greater sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then others, as the <hi>Benedictins,</hi> and <hi>Chartrians,</hi> doe altogether abstaine from flesh all their life long, and eschewe the touching or tasting of it, as of a profane thing: Doing in this worse then they who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostle condemnes in the 2. to the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:11387:36"/>
                  <hi>Colosians</hi> which say, <hi>tast not, touch not,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moued therevnto onely with a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie religion, for to humble themselues &amp; bring downe the flesh. But if you read the disputations of our schoole Doctors, as of <hi>Durandus,</hi> and <hi>Alensis,</hi> &amp; others, you shall find that the reasons which they giue, why flesh is forbidden and not fish, do presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose some vncleannesse in flesh. For there be some of them say, that the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the creatures of flesh were curst and drowned in the generall deluge, &amp; not the fish: by which reason it should follow, that neither duckes, nor any other water fowle should be forbidden to bee eaten in Lent. Others of them there be that say that the reason is, because Iesus Christ never did eate any thing but fish after his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They cannot deny but that he did eate his part of the paschall lambe the last week in Lent before Easter: but I imagine these Masters will presuppose that he did dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se with his owne sanctitie in this. Finally if of two impure actions committed by any one, the one be more grievously punished then the other, is it not because it is more impure? When therefore the Church of Rome doth inflict a greater punishment
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:11387:37"/>
on him that doth eate flesh in Lent, then on him that hath committed fornication; doth it not thereby shew that it takes flesh in Lent to bee more vncleane then forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse, for to pleasure them, let vs suppose that the forbidding of certaine meats in the Church of Rome, be not built vpon any impuritie conceited to be in the meat; and hauing granted them this, let vs see, if herein our adversaries differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hereticks. <hi>Sozomene</hi> in his 3. booke, and 31. Chapter. witnesseth that <hi>Eustacius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sebastia</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> was the first that ever brought the monastical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession into <hi>Armenia, Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Paphla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonia,</hi> putting a difference between meats, and inventing a strange kinde of habits, &amp; other absurd things contrary to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Church. Hee tels vs also how that many women being ruled by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of that sect, shaved their heades vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shewe of religion: that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Gangres</hi> declared them to be cut of from the Church, if they did not renounce their opinions. In this Councell <hi>Sozomene</hi> saith that <hi>Eustacius</hi> protested how hee did not bring vp this as a necessary doctrine,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:11387:37"/>
but only for discipline sake, or as a devout exercise and acceptable vnto God. This at that time was the excuse of heretickes, whereby they did excuse their forbidding of meats, iust after the same manner that the Church of Rome doth now adaies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Montanists</hi> likewise were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned by the auncient church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they forbad flesh to be eaten. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did this out of an opinion they had, that flesh was defiled and polluted, or for exercise sake, to beate downe the flesh, and curbe in their lust, no man can better resolue vs then <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the captaine of that band; who himselfe was stained with this heresie, and hath purposely written a booke of this matter, intituled, <hi>Adversus Psychicos, against fleshly men:</hi> For so is it his pleasure to stile the catholicks. Whose obiections against the <hi>Montanists,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth in the second chapter, which are al one with ours against the church of Rome. For in the 2. chap. the Catholickes tell the Montanists. That <hi>the lawe and the prophets lasted but till Iohn, after what time me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fasted as they thought best, not for that they were so commanded by the imposition of a new disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, but accordingly as every man saw his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:11387:38"/>
occasion. That the Apostles vsed to do thus, imposing no other burden of solemne and set fasts.</hi> They do yet farther alleadge the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apostle rebuking the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 10</note> 
                  <hi>Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> because they observed daies and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths. They do also obiect that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the 58 of <hi>Esay</hi> approues not of that fast that is an abstaining from meate, but of that which is an exercise of the workes of righteousnes. And that Iesus Christ hath in a worde answered all these scrupulous observations of eating and drinking, by saying, <hi>That which goeth into the mouth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth not the man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

That the Apostle teacheth that it is not meate that maketh vs the more acceptable vnto God, &amp;c. To be briefe, the faithfull in times past did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute against the <hi>Montanists</hi> as we do now a daies against the church of Rome, &amp; the <hi>Montanists</hi> likewise did defend themselus by the same shiftes and excuses that the Church of Rome now doth. For see how they answere in the 15. chap. of the same booke. <hi>The Apostle,</hi> say they, <hi>condemneth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:11387:38"/>
such, as did commaunde men to refraine from meate; But the holy Ghost by his prescience, condemned such hereticks, before they came, as should enioine a perpetuall fast, for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy and vilifie the workes of the Creatour.</hi> Herevnto adde, that this errour of refusing Gods creatures, may wel be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d amongst the <hi>Marcionits, Talians,</hi> and <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> but not in the schoole of <hi>Montanus,</hi> which he calleth the Paraclet. And a little after; <hi>we abstaine from meates, which we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, but only forbeare to vse them for a time.</hi> And a few lines aboue. <hi>The Apostles intent was, to reprehend such as did abstaine from meate, out of a kinde of loathing disdaineful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and not out of duty,</hi> that is to say, out of a voluntary devotion. So did these he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks excuse themselues, whose forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of meate; was not yet left vnreckoned amongst their heresies, what protestations soever they made, that they did not thinke them to bee vncleane or vnlawfull in their owne nature.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:11387:39"/>
to encrease the number of fasts, yet were they nothing like those which are nowe a daies practised in the church of Rome. For they did abstaine not only from flesh, but also from wine, and all other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies. Witnesse <hi>S. Austin</hi> in the 1. booke of the customes of the church 33. chap. <hi>Let those that can, abstaine from flesh and wine for two causes, either because of the weaknes of their brethren, or else for their owne liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties sake herein.</hi> And in the booke of Faith to <hi>Peter</hi> the Deacon. 42. chap. <hi>Hold this for certaine, that the servants of God, which abstaine from flesh and wine, do not reiect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as vncleane things, but they refraine from stronger meats &amp; drinks for to chastise their bodies. Chrysostome</hi> in the 4. of his Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies made at <hi>Antioch</hi> vpon the breaking downe of the Emperours statues. <hi>There bee some</hi> (saith he) <hi>that go two whole daies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eating a bit, and againe there bee some, which cutting of not only wine and oile from their table, but all sort of flesh &amp; fish too, feed all the Lent vpon nothing but bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Basill</hi> in his 1. sermon of fasting, would that in fasting there be <hi>nether flesh nor wine vsed, nor any thing else that they like, which

serue their bellies</hi>; and that we should feede on nothing but bread only. And a little after. <hi>Thou dost eate no flesh, but thou dost eate thy brother; thou dost abstaine from wine but thou dost not abstain from doing outrage, and bearing thy selfe insolently, thou stayest for thy meate till night, but thou art all daie wrangling at the bar; Wo be vnto those that are drunke, but not with wine.</hi>

and the 55. Canon, in these words. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we haue vnderstood that in the cittie of Rome they vse to fast on the Saturdaies in Lent, against the custome left to the Church: This holy Synod hath therefore decreed, that they shall likewise in the church of Rome keep that Canon, which saith; If a Clarke be found to fast on saturday or sunday, let him bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded; if a lay man, let him bee excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</hi> But this fell out a long time after, this Councell being not assembled before the 674. yeare of our Lord. But at the first these things were more free, and the rules for them, lesse strict. <hi>S. Austin</hi> in his 86. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, saith, <hi>I see well, that fasting is comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in the Evangelicall, &amp; Apostolicall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and throughout all the new Testament, but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what daies we should fast or not fast, I see no commandement for this, neither of Christ, nor his Apostles</hi>: and a little before hee said that the diverse observations of Fasts, did not trouble the truth of Faith: &amp; that these things are the plaits of the kings daughters Robe. So did hee call the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent customes of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the 5. booke of his historie, recites an Epistles of <hi>Ireneus,</hi> to <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop of Rome, wherein hee speakes of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11387:40"/>
the diverse manners of fastings before Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. <hi>There be some,</hi> saith he, <hi>which think they must not fast but one day, others there be that fast</hi> 2, <hi>&amp; some that fast more, some measure their fasting daies by</hi> 40. <hi>houres, day and night. And this diversitie betweene the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers of the Easter fast, began not from our time, but long before, from their time (as it is credible) which governing the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out observing any exact rule, did, a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, turne that into a custome, which was done in simplicitie, and by particular observation. Neverthelesse they had all peace amongst themselues, and we yet liue in peace together,</hi> Agreeably to this in the passage of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> aboue alleaged, the Catholike Church maintaineth against the <hi>Montanists,</hi> that since Iohn Baptists time, fasts haue beene free, and that there is no rule which binds vs to certaine fasts that wee must keepe in common. <hi>S. Basil</hi> in his two sermons of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, speaking of the fast before Easter, tels vs, I knowe not how often, that this Fast lasted not aboue 5 daies. <hi>Let the belly,</hi> (saith he in his first Sermon) <hi>giue vs some time of truce, and let that, which is ever a craving, bee at peace with vs for fiue daies.</hi> And towarde the ende of the homily, hee
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:11387:41"/>
sharply rebukes such, as did vse before the fiue daies came, to stuffe their guts with meate and wine, to the ende they might fast the more easilie, and haue their bellies filled with provision. And in the second Sermon. <hi>This is an ill mind, because we hear of a fast to come of</hi> 5 <hi>daies, therefore to make our selues drunke before hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may not omit the history of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades,</hi> recited by <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the 3. chapt. and 5. booke of his historie. This <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> did macerate his body by fasting, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving onely vpon bread and water, even whilst he was in the prison: But it was told the Martyr <hi>Attalus</hi> by revelation, that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> did ill in abstaining fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods creatures, and did thereby scandalize his brethren; <hi>Alcibiades</hi> being told hereof, belieued it, and did ever after that time eate of all meats indifferently, and without feare, and gaue God thanks for it.</p>
               <p>The historie of <hi>Spiridion,</hi> related by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen,</hi> in the 1. booke, 11. chap. witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>S. Spiridion,</hi> and his houshold, did eate no bread vpon fasting daies, and that commanding his daughter to cover the table for a stranger, which came sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly vpon him, shee answered him that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11387:41"/>
there was no bread in the house, for (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as then a time of fast) it would haue beene superfluous. Notwithstanding all this <hi>Spiridion</hi> made her serue in a peece of porcke that he had left. But the stranger (brought vp belike in some superstitious place) told him that hee would not eate of it, because he was a Christian. Then <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion</hi> replied, <hi>But for this very reason thou shouldst the rather eate of it, for God saith, al things are cleane to the cleane,</hi> and did eate thereof himselfe. He did not say, <hi>eate of it, for I haue nothing else in the house, necessity may excuse thee</hi>; But hee alleages the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles rule, which had not beene lesse true, although hee had had never<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so much vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of meate in the house: and he himselfe in eating thereof without any necessity, &amp; only to giue him an example, shewes that there was no necessitie in this kinde of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinencie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Austin</hi> in his 33. chap. of the 1. booke of the customs of the Church (speaking of the fasts of Romish and Easterne Monkes. which were all artizans, every one get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his living by his trade) saith that none amongst them were put to any hard thing that they were not able to beare: <hi>There is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:11387:42"/>
no man which putteth a burden vpon any one that he shall refuse to carry; and he is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by others because he confesseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe too weake to follow them, for they haue not forgot, how that all things are cleane to the cleane, &amp;c.</hi> And the whole Chapter is spent about this, to shewe that when a faithfull man well informed, doth refraine from certaine meats, hee doth doe this for feare of offending the weake, although he knowe well enough that it is a thing law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and indifferent in it selfe.</p>
               <p>This diversity of customes in diverse countries, grounded vpon Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is set downe at large by <hi>Socrates</hi> in the 22. chap. of the 5 booke of his history. Hee saith that they did not fast at Rome but 3 weekes before Easter excepting Saturday and Sunday. That in <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> they fasted 6. that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places they fasted 3 times 5 daies, at 3 severall times, and yet that neverthelesse they did cal this Lent, every one alleaging a diverse reason. That there was the like differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in their fasting from meat. Some of them abstaining from all living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, others feeding vpon fish only, others eating fowle together with fish, as which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11387:42"/>
(according to <hi>Moses</hi> testimonie) were made out of the water. There bee some (saith he) which abstaine from the fruits of trees, and from egges. And there bee some that tie rhemselues to eate nothing but bread. And againe, there be some, that eate no bread at all. Whence hee collects, that <hi>since no man can shew any expresse comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement as concerning this, it is evident that the Apostles did remit it to everie mans will and pleasure, to the end every one might doe good, but not through feare, or by constraint.</hi> Neither can it be said, that this which hee saith of Rome, is contrary to <hi>S. Austin.</hi> in his 86. and 11. Epistles. where he saith, that they fast at Rome vpon Saturday. For <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> speakes of the Saturdaies all the yeare long, but <hi>Sozomene</hi> speakes only of the 3 last Saterdaies before Easter. And, say hee were mistaken in this, yet is it not likely, but that hee told the truth of other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which he himselfe saw. Especially see<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing that his testimonie is agreeable to so many witnesses aboue cited. To whom we will ioine <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> in his 34. Sermon, saying that in his time there were some which made their Lent to last 20 daies, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers 30. by interchangeable weeks. Now
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11387:43"/>
as touching the fast before Easter, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients doe not ranck it in the same degree, as they do the other fasts of the yeare. For the Catholicke Church disputing against the <hi>Montanists</hi> in the 10. Chapter of <hi>Tertullians</hi> booke of Fasts, saith, that those daies in the Gospell are markt out for fasting, in which the bridegroome was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, that is to say, the daies in which Iesus Christ suffered, and was in his graue; that all other daies are in a mans owne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. And <hi>S. Austin</hi> giues the selfesame reason for it in his 86. Epistle to <hi>Casulan.</hi> Because Iesus Christ said in the 9. of <hi>Saint Matthew, that the day would come wherein the bridegroome should be taken away, and then they should fast.</hi> This reason (ioined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with the ancient custome, witnessed by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> concerning this, to wit, that many did fast 40 continuall howres before Easter) doth discover the very head spring and first beginning of Lent. That is, that they thought themselues bound to fast 40 howres, because Iesus Christ was for so long togither kept vnder death, and that this was the time wherin the bridegroome was wanting. Which is likewise confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by that ancient custome of forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11387:43"/>
them to fast after Easter, till whitson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide were past: because this was the time wherein the bridegroome was restored, &amp; did converse here on earth after his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. But by little and little this fast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be enlarged, &amp; men vsed to fast ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies before Easter, some more, some lesse. Till at last those 40 howres, were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into 40 daies.</p>
               <p>During this diversity of customes in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers countries, wee never read that the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome did take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to correct other churches, or ever laboured to bring the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church, or that of <hi>Millan,</hi> to the fashions of the church of Rome.</p>
               <p>But I cannot deny but that some of the ancient were excessiue in the praise of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting. As <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Basill,</hi> which killed himselfe with fasting, making his body, for a long time, feeble, and vnfit for his voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by emulating <hi>Xerophagies</hi> a Monke of the desert. In their Homilies of Fasts, they say that <hi>Adam</hi> fell because he did not fast. That it was fasting that hardned the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the three children throwne into the fornace, and made them not to bee burnt. That fasting gaue <hi>Daniels</hi> body a temper of steele so that the teeth of the Lyons
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:11387:44"/>
could not bite him.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>S. Austins</hi> time these and such like scrupulous observations taking place, this good servaunt of God complained of it. Behold what he saith in his 119. Epistle. <hi>That which is brought vp besides the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> custome, as though it were the observation of some sacrament, I cannot approue of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I dare not freely to reprehend it, for feare of offending some persons; either holy, or turbulent. But I am much grieved at this that we set little by many wholsome doctrines contained in holy writ, and all things are so full of presumption, that he shall be more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, which during the Octaues shall touch the earth with his bare foote, then hee that shall haue buried his vnderstanding in drunkennesse.</hi> And a little after speaking of such as did charge the church, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were observations, &amp; particularly with that of abstaining from flesh, he saith. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it cannot bee found that these things are contrary to the faith, neverthelesse they lade religion with servile burdens (which God would haue to be free, he himselfe laying nothing vpon it, but the observations of the Sacraments, which are but few, neither yet obscure) in such sort, that the condition of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:11387:44"/>
the Iewes is more tollerable. For although they knewe not the time of libertie, so it is, that they were subiect onely to the burdens of the law, and not to humane inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntions. But the Church of God, mingled with much chaff and many tares, suffereth many things. But she approues not of that which is against the faith, or a good life, neither doth she conceale it, nor yet doe it. Wherefore, that which thou wrotest vnto mee, that there bee some which doe abstaine from flesh, thinking those to bee vncleane which eate of it, is manifestly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the faith, and sound doctrine.</hi> So did this good servant of God, suffer that with griefe, which hee coulde not amend. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the slaverie and burdens of which he complaineth, were nothing in respect of ours now adaies. He himselfe in the 118 Epistle, telleth vs that hee followeth the counsel of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> as of an oracle, which is this. <hi>When I am at Rome I fast the satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, when I am here, I doe not fast. So thou, to what Church soever thou shalt come by chance, conforme thy selfe to the customes thereof, if thou wilt not bee a scandall to any body, nor haue any one to bee a scandall vnto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The abuses which followe, are more
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:11387:45"/>
grosse yet, and farther remote from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient simplicitie. For the Ancients did not thinke that their fasts were payments to God, to satisfie for the paine due to our sinnes. This is a strange kind of fashion, for a man to pay his debts with fasting, as if a creditour should abate his debtour 10 crownes for every day he should fast. Hee that thinkes that God is contented with this, dreames of an easie composition, and payes him but in light mony. I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse that God hath wrought many deliuerances for them that haue fasted: but our adversaries doe wrong to attribute that to the vertue of fasting, which was meant by God to faith and prayer, that doe sanctifie fasting. And they may doe well to remember the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.</note> Pharisee, who was sent away, although he fasted twice a weeke, and gaue God to vnderstand of his workes of supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Aboue all, they haue a good grace, to make one man fast for another, and they would haue me belieue, that God wil par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my sinnes, because my neighbor hath fasted for me. There is no iudge so foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connivent, that will pardon a crime to any one, in consideration that his brother
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:11387:45"/>
hath not dined. But that which we would iudge an intolerable sottishnesse in a man, shall we thinke this fitting for God? For the Pope would haue him to rest conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this. And they that are not in the humour of fasting, loue rather to borrowe it of others, &amp; to change their bodily fast, into a pecuniarie mulct. They wil say there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore to some religious person, fast for mee, and I will content thee. And that which is thus given to Monkes shall bee called an almes, although they be never so rich. This pretty doctrine is taught in the Canon, <hi>Presbyter,</hi> in the 82 distinction. <hi>He may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the moonday fast, if need be, by singing a Psalme, or giuing a penny to the poore.</hi> And the glosse of the Doctors herevpon. <hi>Hee may free himselfe from fast by giving a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; wherefore by a greater reason he may bee freed by others fasting for him. Because also that the fasting of the living is availeable for the dead.</hi> Agreeable to the Canon. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimae,</hi> in the 13. Cause, &amp; 2. Question. <hi>The soules of the dead are delivered by</hi> 4 <hi>means; either by the oblation of Priestes, or by the praiers of the Saints, or by the almes of their friends, or else by the fastings of their kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and allies.</hi> It is Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:11387:46"/>
speakes this, who belieued that the soules were in Purgatory, some in hot houses, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnder the leaues of trees, others in rivers, and hee was much troubled how to get them out thence. Now I say that if the fasting of the living doe refresh them, their feasting also must burne and torment the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Track mee but any footing of al these opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the 3 or 4 first ages.</p>
               <p>Or else of that proper custome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Prelates that enioine fasts doe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with them, giuing these dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not to the poore but to their friends, and such as are gracious with them. At Rome yee shall get letters of a perpetuall dispensation. In the booke of the Taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Romish Chancerie, formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, this article is found in the 6. leafe. <hi>For that a lay man is not tyed to fast on the daies which are enioyned him by the Church, and may eate cheese, this letter costs twentie groats.</hi> If a poore man pay it, he shall for al that fast after he hath payd it.</p>
               <p>This being so, it is no wonder; if hee which giues dispensations to others, doe take one for himselfe, and if the Pope and Cardinals doe often dispense with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in these matters. For we are to know
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:11387:46"/>
that in the 25 cause, 1. quest. in the Canon <hi>Ideo.</hi> vpon a question which some made, whether the Church of Rome were subiect to the Statuts of Councells, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the fourth, makes this answere. <hi>The holy Church of Rome giues all power, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to the holy Canons, but shee for her owne part is not bound, nor tied to keepe them.</hi> And a little after hee saith that <hi>as Iesus did sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himselfe vnto the lawe, and sometimes withstand it, to shewe that hee was master of the law. So,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Bishops of the chiefe see, respect the Canons made by themselues, or others vnder their authoritie, and do yeeld to keepe them, that they might make them to be kept of others; but sometimes too, either in commanding or decreeing, or by oppugning them, they shew that they are Lords over the decrees, and the makers of them.</hi> And a little after he saith, <hi>that the Church of Rome gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it selfe speciall privileges, against gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall decrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herevnto adde the custome, of making the people to go in procession to our Lady in the beginning of Lent, that they may haue leaue to eate butter. As also the trick, whereby they delude the ancient custome, of eating nothing in Lent before evening.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:11387:47"/>
For now a daies they make the evening ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vice to bee song before noone, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards eat, saying, that evening is past: And a thousand such like shifts, which betraie not only abuse, but mockery too; to the ende that the prophecy of the Apostle might be fulfilled, when he saith, that this error shall be taught thorough hypocrisie, and by such as haue their consciences sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with an hot yron. And doubt not, but, if that we had not opposed our selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the tyranny of the Pope, which did daily encrease like a swelling torrent, there had beene worse things seene. After that he had once got the kitchins and shambles vnder his dominion; he tooke vpon him to make other lawes for attire, and houshold stuffe, so that a man might not lie vpon a matteresse, nor weare silke, nor presume to bath himselfe without some speciall dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. And their booke of dispensation fees, made a hundred yeares since, doth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently shew, that they did even then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to encroach vpon these things. For as then, letters of dispensatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a Nunne to bath her selfe, were prized at a certain rate And letters of dispensation for a lay man, to study in the schooles; and letters of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:11387:47"/>
for to bury a body in two sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres: and letters of dispensation for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to keep that which he had got vniustly. To conclude, they amongst this people which do most hate vs, may know, that they are bound to vs, for that little liberty which they do yet enioy.</p>

               <p>MAny, being either led by curiosity, or spurred on by impatience, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the day of the Lord was hard at hand. Whose over rash and headlong for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes, is here staied by the Apostle, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that this day shall not come till there be a falling away. What manner of falling away this is, he himselfe telleth vs in that <note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.</note> Prophecy of his, which wee haue formerly touched; telling vs before hand, that in the latter time many shall fall away from the faith. And so did some of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:11387:50"/>
vnderstand it; <hi>Primasius, Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> whom, his Maiestie of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, followes. There be some that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it, of the peoples falling away, from vnder the Roman Empire. And so do some of the Ancient: which also agreeth with the event. For we shall see anon how that the papacy increased by the decreasing of the Empire, and that the greatnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was built vpon the ruines of the Empire.</p>
               <p>The head and chiefe cause of this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from the faith, is by the Apostle S. <hi>Paule,</hi> called the man of sinne, &amp; sonne of perdition, according to the vsuall forme of speech in Scripture, which calleth a bloody man, a man of blood. And those the children of hell, which are markt out for hell. So the man of sinne, and the sonne of perdition, signifie, a man that is a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious sinner, and such a one as is markt out vnto perdition.</p>
               <p>That these qualities, some ages since, were fitting the Bishop of Rome, no man can doubt that hath read the writings, not of their enimies, but even of their owne servants that haue most respected them. Never was there man that did more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute himselfe to vphold the Popes pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:11387:51"/>
then <hi>Baronius</hi> did. And yet see his own words in the yeare 912. and 8. article. <hi>With what face did the Church of Rome then look, and how ilfavoredly? then, when famous queanes, and lewd strumpets did domineere at Rome? at whose pleasure Church livings were bestowsd, Bishopricks given, and that which is horrible to heare, and not to bee spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, their louers, false Popes, thrust into the seat of Peter.</hi> It would bee long to repeate the whole passage; till at last hee breakes out, and asketh, <hi>What Priests, and Deacons Cardinals do yee thinke were chosen by these monsters</hi>? And hee complaineth that Iesus Christ did sleepe, Now hee speakes of such a great number of wicked &amp; vitious Popes that it should seeme by his reckoning, that Iesus Christ slept a long time. <hi>Platina</hi> in the life of <hi>Benedict</hi> the 4. saith, <hi>The liberty of sinning hath begot vs these monsters, and prodigies, which by ambition and corruption, haue rather vsurpt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> possest the holy chaire of Peter, no Prince repressing the wickednesse of these men.</hi> Nay I dare affirme, that the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of Emperours, and Pagan kings, written by their enimies, or by strangers, doe not speake so ill of them, as the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Popes, written by their owne
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:11387:51"/>
servants, and flatterers, doe speake ill of Popes. From the yeare 870. to the yeare 1050. You see none but Necromancers, but Adulterers, and Murderers, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous persons preferred to the Papacy: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one knowes the complaints of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> of <hi>Petrarke,</hi> of <hi>Mantuan,</hi> bewailing the corruption, &amp; bad report of the Court of Rome. If these witnesses bee not of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie enough, at least I hope Popes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues shall bee beleeued herein. <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> otherwise called <hi>Pius secundus</hi> in the 66. Epist to <hi>Iohn Peregall,</hi> speaks thus. <hi>The court of Rome giues nothing without mony; yea the imposition of hands, &amp; the gifts of the holy Ghost are sold; and the remission of sinnes is communicated vnto none, that haue not wherewithall to pay for it.</hi> Where is the man that durst now adaies speake so bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>S. Bernard</hi> did in his 125. Epistle. <hi>The beast</hi> (saith he) <hi>of the Apocalyps, to whome a mouth was given speaking blasphemy, and to make warre vpon the Saints, doth possesse the Chaire of S. Peter, as a Lyon prepared for the pray.</hi> I will annex one passage out of the Canonists, which haue glozed the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, in the title of Election, and 6. Chap. Their wordes are. <hi>Rome built at first by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:11387:52"/>
theeues, doth yet retaine the smacke of her first religion, being called Roma quasi rodens manus.</hi> It must needs be that this evill was great, seeing that in a booke so publike &amp; authenticall, which containes all the laws and Statuts of the Church of Rome, these doctors did insert such things to their owne shame. To be briefe, if this be huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to cause 70000 persons, within a few daies to be murdered in a massacre in France; If this bee chastitie, to establish Stewes at Rome: If this bee humilitie, to make Emperours and Kings kisse his feet: If this be fidelitie, to dispense with vowes and oaths; If this be religion, to weare the crosse of Christ vpon his Pantophle: If this be liberalitie, to set the absolutions from sin, and <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Taxa Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaria A. post fol.</hi> 11.</note> dispensations for ill doing, at a certaine price of money, and to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse books thereof; I am then content that we be said to haue done his Holinesse wrong by calling him the man of sinne.</p>
               <p>As for the title of the sonne of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is not our parts to giue iudgement vpon any body, or positiuely to define what men are damned: but wee pray to God to shew mercy to these Popes, which haue bathed their handes in our bloud.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:11387:52"/>
Howbeit * <hi>Platina</hi> the Popes servant and Secretarie, speaking of their vices, doth as it were despaire of their salvation, saying. <hi>Our vices are growne to that heigth, that they will hardly ever find mercy in the sight of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here. least our adversaries should perplex vs, we are to knowe that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth not say, that there must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie be a generall departure, before the son of perdition be revealed, so that when hee shall once come, there shall no more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men be left in the world: It is enough for the fulfilling of his Prophecie, that this departure be begun, and haue already ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered some little strength, then, when the sonne of perdition shall be disclosed; of which departure hee shall make himselfe the head, and seeke to increase it with all his power; which yet shall never bee so great, but that there shall be some faithfull men in the world, left hid amidst this great corruption.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, wee neede not wonder that the Bishop of Rome, is called the man of sinne, in the singular, though there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, one after another. For we speak so commonly, and say that the Emperour
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:11387:53"/>
goeth before kings, although there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny successiue Emperours. So our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries say that the Pope is the head of the Church, and not the Popes, because there is but one at a time. In France wee vse to say that the king dieth not, because that by the king, wee doe not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Henry, or Lewis, but a continuall descent of kings, one succeding the other So in the 7. and 8. chapter of <hi>Daniell</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall succession of kings, is represented by one only beast, which appeareth yet more plainely in the 8. chapter 20. verse. <hi>The ramme which thou sawest having two hornes, are the kings of the Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi> And in the verse following, the kings of Greece are figured by a Goat, the horn of which signifieth the first king. The Greeke article <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, doth most vsually signifie an indefinite person: as in the 2. to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and 3. chap. where it is also, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. that the man of God may be absolute, where this word, <hi>The man,</hi> is aswell, as in this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, taken indefinitely, and applyed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse men a part. And so <hi>Matthew</hi> the 18. verse 17. <hi>Let him be vnto thee, as the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man, or publican,</hi> although there were a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:11387:53"/>
great number of this sort; and so shall wee finde it often. But if the sonne of perdition were but one only man that were yet to come, how shall the saying of the Apostle stand, who presently vpon this telleth vs, that the mystery of iniquity did even then in his time begin to worke, for to prepare his way? Is it credible that 5. or 700. yeares should bee imployed about the producing one only man, which should not last aboue 3. yeares, and some few moneths? Or that the mysterie of iniquity shoulde even then begin to worke, and that this man shoulde not yet be revealed? Especially seeing that our adversaries make Antichrist to bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Iew, of the tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> and which shall build vp Ierusalem againe, whereas we see no preparations for all this, so that by their reckoning the mysterie of iniquity should bee lesse prepared nowe then it was in the Apostles time. But if any one thinke it strange, that <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> which was but one person, should bee a figure of divers successiue persons, Let him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that many high Priests one succeeding the other, were the figures of Iesus Christ, which yet neverthelesse was but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And yet the reason is alike on both
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:11387:54"/>
sides. Besides, <hi>Antiochus</hi> is not the figure of many at a time, seeing there is never but one Pope at the same time.</p>
               <p>Neither, can so great a dominion over so many nations (got, not by any exploite of war, but by guile, as the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels vs in the 17. ch.) be the work of one on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly man, much lesse of such a one, that shall raigne but 3. yeares and an halfe; this is a worke of many ages; that which followes, sutes with this, and is full of perspicuity.</p>

               <p>That the Pope names himselfe God, and is so called by his favourites, this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing, whereof the Popes Decrees, &amp; the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels where he sat as chiefe, are full. The Canon. <hi>Satis,</hi> in the 96. Distinction, speakes thus. <hi>It is manifestly seene that the Pope can in no wise, neither be vnbound, nor bound by any secular power; who is knowne to haue bin called God, by the religious Prince Constantine before mentioned: now it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, that God cannot be iudged by men.</hi> He excludes princes therefore from the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of God, that he may reserue it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and approving of <hi>Constantines</hi> saying which calleth him God, thence inferreth that the Pope may not bee iudged by any person.

               <p>The glosse of the extrauagant, <hi>cum inter</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. hath these words. <hi>To thinke that our Lord God the Pope, the author of the aforesaid Decretall, and of this, had no power to decree as he hath decreed, would be iudged

               <p>And <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> denieth not this, but saith that the Pope is God in the same sense that the scripture calleth kings, and other powers by the name of Gods: an idle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, and against the intent of his <hi>Holines</hi> For in the old testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, this word of Gods is indeed attributed to Princes in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:11387:56"/>
nor prelate ever did. The bishop of Rome is the first, who some ages since began to vsurpe this title.</p>
               <p>We are also to note, that the word <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> in the old testament is never attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any creature: but well the worde of <hi>Elohim</hi> may in the plurall, which signifieth Gods, and Lords.

               <p>But for to know in what sense the Pope is called God, the Pope himselfe can best resolue vs. For out of this title, he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by consequence that he should bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored; The last councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> in the 3. and 10. sessions saith. <hi>The Pope ought to be worshipped of all people, and is most like vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to God:</hi> and that a man might not imagine that it speaketh of a civill kind of worship, it is there told vs what manner of adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this must be, wherwith he is to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; to wit, that it must bee with that kinde of adoration that is mentioned in the 72. Psalme. <hi>Adorabunt eum omnes reges terrae,</hi> All the kings of the earth shall worshippe him. Where by worship, the highest kinde of worshippe is meant, which is due to the son of God; as <hi>Tertullian</hi> teacheth vs in his 5, booke 7. chap. against <hi>Marcion.</hi> So doth <hi>Mantuan</hi> vnderstande it, which speakes of the Pope:
<q>
                     <l>Ense potens gemino, cuius vestigia adora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</l>

                     <l>Caesar adores him with an humble awe:</l>
                     <l>And kings with Caesar too in this do meete,</l>

                  </q>
The histories of these last ages are ful with examples of this adoration of the Pope. In the 2. Tome of councels they doe highly magnifie <hi>Iustinian</hi> because hee did adore Pope <hi>Agapet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> But the most remarkable worship that is given him, is that which they do vnto him within the conclaue, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after his election. As soone as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he is pronounced Pope by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals shut vp in the conclaue, they presently run vnto him, and pulling of his owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, put on other insteed thereof, redde hose, and red shooes with a crosse of gold, a red girdle with buckles of Gold, a red cap, and a rochet, and answerably fitting him with a red mantle, and a triple crowne glittering with Diamonds, they mount him vp vpon their shoulders aloft, as it were some glorified body, and set him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar. This amongst the Italians is commonly called adoration: and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more worth the noting, because the Pope is set vpon the Altar, which is a place where they set their Masse-god, and which is appointed for divine worship: so that this worship, cannot be taken for a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill worship. Herevnto adde that in civill
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:11387:58"/>
affaires kings haue more authoritie then Popes, and should therefore by a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent rather bee worshipt with civill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. But they doe not only not worship Kings, but exact of kings themselues to worship the Popes. But if a King called himselfe God, he might seem to haue some shew for it, by alleaging the passage out of the old Testament wherein kings are said to be Gods, yet should a king so doe he would be thought by Christians to bee little lesse then a blasphemer, and I am perswaded that the Pope himselfe would not like it, being that hee vsurps the name of God excclusiuely from al other Princes vnto himselfe, by reason that it is a holy word, and imports as much as adoration. Neither will hee bee woone to grant, that kings, because they are called Gods by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vid,</hi> should therefore deny to bee iudged; seeing that he takes vpon him to bee their iudge. And yet we haue seene before, how the Pope out of this very saying of David, concludeth that no man may be his iudge, although in that place there bee no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of Bishops or Pastours, but of Princes: It is easie to bee knowne in what sense he calleth himselfe God, since hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually

               <p>Besides I say, that to call himselfe his <hi>Holines</hi> exclusiuely to al others, is to take a name vpon him that is proper to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, who is not only <hi>the most holy Father,</hi> (a name which the Pope doth also assume) but Holinesse it selfe.

               <p>Next in order comes our Saviour Iesus Christ, adorned with titles, names &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, all which the Pope applyeth vnto himselfe.

               </p>
               <p>After that he hath once seized vpon the names and titles of the Father, and of his sonne our Saviour, it is no wonder that he equalleth himselfe with the holy Ghost, saying in the 25 cause, 1. quest. that to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate his Canons &amp; ordinances is to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheame against the holy Ghost, to the end we should know, that such an offence shal

               <p>THE Apostle will tel vs in the 10. verse of this Chap. that the sonne of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall vse all guile and deceitfulnesse.

Or how could any one be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced therewithall? but rather he must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate himselfe through deceipt, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shewe of sanctitie. <hi>Hee shall haue</hi> (saith the holy Ghost in the 13. of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyps) two hornes like the lambe, but hee shall speake like the Dragon:</hi> making a shew of Christianitie, and professing the name of Christ, but teaching divelish doctrine, As <hi>S.

for to strike his father, then his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as also vpon this, that the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous the faults bee, they are punished the more grievously: If therefore an offence committed against the Pope, be more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely punished then an offence commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against God; if the Popes Decrees be more authorized, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts God: if a man bee thought to haue sinned more hainously in disobaying the Pope, then in disobaying God; how can wee but confesse, that this sin of the two is thought to be the greater, and by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequent that the Pope doth exalt himselfe aboue God? Experience confirmeth this; swear, &amp; blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheame in Italie, no man is moved at it. Oathes are thought to bee but the flowers of eloquence.

which they call reserued cases, from which no bishop can absolue a man, except it bee only vpon the point of death. You will i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine perhaps, that these cases are either murder, or parricide, or incest, or atheisme, or sodomie; no such matter. But these great sinnes from which none can absolue a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> except the pope only, are, the stopping of a man vpon the way as he is going to Rome to purchase him great pardons, the intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ones selfe in a benefice, the stealing of church goods, to haue spoken ill of, or done ill, vnto the Apostolical seat, &amp;c: such sinnes as these cannot be pardoned on this side the Alpes, except it be by a special per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mission, and that vpon the point of death. If you haue committed either murder or fornication, the priest will absolue you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this.

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:11387:63"/>2 Againe, the pope exalteth himselfe aboue God, when he takes vpon him to be the chiefe iudge in controversies of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in steede of deferring this soveraigne iudgement to the holy scripture, which is the word of God. It is said, that it is the church, which doth giue force &amp; authority to the scripture, and that the pope is aboue the church: so he is two degrees aboue the word of God, seeing that he is aboue the church, and the church aboue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But especiallie the pope exalteth himselfe aboue that, which is called God in the church of Rome, for so do papists at this time, call the bread of the Eucharist; they say, that they holde vp God in the Masse, when they hold vp the bread, that they carry God to the sick when they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the bread, that they eate God and take their creatour, when they take<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eat the bread. Many kinde of waies doth the pope exalt himselfe aboue this God. For in the procession vpon the day of his coronation, and at other solemne times, they make this God go before him, carryed vpon a white horse, having a Sansbell about his necke, and a lantherne before, being covered all
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:11387:64"/>
over with a Canopy, which is carryed vp by the citizens of Rome. But the pope comes after being carried vpon mens shoulders, vnder a Canopie helde vp by princes or princes ambassadors, the Emperor to (if he be there) putting to his helping hand, or if his Holynesse bee on horse backe holding his horses bridle, after that hee hath first held the stirrup for him to mount; as it is described at large in the 1. booke of holy Ceremonies, 2. Section, &amp; 3. cha. compare the popes manner of furniture with that of his God, and yee shall see the Apostles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie fulfilled, where it is said, that <hi>he shall exalt himself aboue that which is called God, and is worshipped.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 You shall see the like example to this, in the 1. Section of the 2. booke in the 14. cha. where it is set downe, with what solemnitie the pope doeth celebrate the masse in his owne person. As he is going vp to the Altar, the greatest prince, or the Emperour himselfe (if he be present) hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vp his traine: there is a Canopy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ouer his head, borne vp by 8. princes, or princes ambassadours: being before the Altar, whilst he is singing of the masse, the prelates come, and kneeling downe kisse
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:11387:64"/>
his right knee: others kisse his feete. He doth bow himselfe, I confesse, before the host; but the standers by doe him ten times more reverence, then they doe God. The greatest prince in the company giues him water 4. times to wash, serving it to him vpon his knee, as <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. did to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the 6. He is capt, &amp; vncapt, shod, and vnshod; gloued, &amp; vngloued; ringed, &amp; vnringed, I know not how often. There is his taster by him, as they vse to haue at princes tables. There standes one by his side, that points at the words in the booke with his finger, as we vse to serue litle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He sucks wine out of the chalice with a reede. So that all well considered, this whole sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nitie, vnder a shew of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Host, is done farre more for the honour of the pope, then for the honor of his God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Let vs annex one proofe more; he that giveth authority to the holy scripture hath more authority the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the scripture. But Bishops of Rome take vpon them to giue authority to the holy scripture, &amp; say that wee are to receaue it, because the pope hath so ordained He attributs more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie therefore to himselfe, then to the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:11387:65"/>
holy scripture. The minor is proved by the words of pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> in the 19. Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Canon. <hi>Si Romanorum,</hi> where he approueth of their saying which said, <hi>That the old and new Testament are to bee recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, not because they are annexed to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, but because holy Pope Innocent hath pronounced that they must be receaued,</hi> For there, he doth not only not reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d those that speake thus prophanely, but doth herevpon ground the establishment of the popes Decretals, which are not inserted in the Canons. By this reckoning then, wee must beleeue; that God created the world; that <hi>Cain</hi> killed <hi>Abell</hi>; that <hi>Noah</hi> built the Arke; that God made a covenant with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>; that God gaue his law vnto <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>; wee must belieue all this I say, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the holy scripture witnesseth as much, but because the pope &amp; the church of Rome doe say that it is true, and that these bookes ought to be receaued; And for to make vs relie more vpon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Church of Rome, then of the scripture, they vse commonly to speake thus vnto vs. How would you knowe that this were the scripture, if the Church had not told you of it? whence they conclude
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:11387:65"/>
that the church is aboue the scripture. As if I should say, I should not haue knowne that this was the king, but that such a man shewd him to me, therefore this man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the king. A wicked church may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vs that this is the scripture. The Iewes made the old Testament knowne to the Apostles, &amp; yet notwithstanding they persecuted our Saviour.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Briefly, to take such wordes out of the common forme of Gods law, as doe forbid vs <hi>to make images, or to fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them,</hi> what is this but to correct God, and by a consequent to exalt himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue God.</p>

               <p>This needeth no long proofe, &amp; it doth followe out of the two precedent points. For it is impossible, that hee should call himselfe God, &amp; exalt himselfe aboue God, without being contrary vnto him, &amp; withstanding his wil: yet behold some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal proofs for the confirming of this too.</p>

forbid vs to adde any thing to, or take any thing from his word. And at the end of the new Testament, God doth denounce a curse against him that shall adde any thing to the things contained in that booke. A passage, which the Councell of <hi>Friuli</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Church of Rome doth thus expound. <hi>The Apostle S.

At the ende of the last Councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> there is a Bull of <hi>Leo</hi> the 10, wherein all <hi>Luthers</hi> heresies are reckoned vp. The 26. heresie is, that he said, <hi>That out of doubt it lay not in the handes either of the Church or Pope to make new articles of faith.</hi> And in the Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> in the last session it is defined, that the Church of Rome may adde vnto the Creed.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:11387:71"/>
moving, the other a resting; the one signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to take a place, and the other to keepe it. This is the reason why the Apostle hath set it downe in the accusatiue, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to represent a moving vnto vs. His meaning then is that the Pope shall sit in the temple of God, and take place there, but he doth not deny that after he is entered into the temple, and is sate there, hee shall driue the service of God thence. The temple of <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> was it not the house of God? And yet the Priests which were sate there changed it into a den of theeues: how much more if they had brought Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry into it? They therefore which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abuses of the Church of Rome, say that they must not go out of it because An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichrist is there, suffer themselues (as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me) to be bound with a straw, and to be held with a slight reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sufficiently wonder at their foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for they speake as if they should say. We may not go out of this house, for the plague is here; or thus, that we may not be the children of perdition, we must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the sonne of perdition. We confesse that the Church of Rome was the true church, when the Pope was first establisht
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11387:71"/>
therein, as well as the <hi>Greeke</hi> church, the <hi>Syrian,</hi> or <hi>Armenian,</hi> but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was once establisht there, by little, and litle he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw religion, so that they, which look to be saved, must of necessity goe out of her; And he that shall go out of her, goeth not out of the vniversall Church, but out of a particular corrupted church.</p>

               <head>The proofe of this exposition.</head>
               <p>For to proue this exposition, wee are to shew two things. 1. That there were some seedes of Papistry sowen even in <hi>S. Paules</hi> time. 2. That Papistry is built with artificiall mysteries, &amp; fraudulent devises.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The first point. That there were some seeds of Papistry sowen even in S. Paules time.</head>
               <p n="1">1 THe affectation of preheminencie in the church. 2. The religious service done to creatures. 3. The Distinction of meates, and of daies. 4. The allurements of philosophy. 5. The traditions of men; all these are the maladies of the Papacie, and vices of the church of Rome.</p>
               <p>There were some seedes of these vices sowne in the Apostle <hi>S. Paules</hi> time. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at that time, one called himselfe the disciple of <hi>Peter,</hi> another of <hi>Paule,</hi> and a third of <hi>Apollos</hi>; which were enflamed with emulation about chiefdome. The encrease of which disorders was for the present hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:11387:72"/>
by the humility, and vnion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. And it may well seeme not to bee without great consideration, that the same Apostle hath advertised the <hi>Romanes</hi> not to be high-minded, vnder the paine of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut of. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. For although the same instruction be giuen in general to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, yet doth he meane it more in speciall to the Romans; foreseeing that their fall would come by pride; &amp; giueth them this information, which they should take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of a prophecy.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There were some of them too which were giuen to worship Angels, whom hee reprehendeth in his epistle to the <hi>Colossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 2. chap. <hi>Let no man</hi> (saith he) <hi>beare rule over you, by humblenesse of minde, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 There were euen in those daies these words heard, <hi>Eate not, taste not, touch not. Col.</hi> 2. and many made a conscience of eating certaine meates. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and this for a religious exercise, and out of a voluntary devotion, &amp; for no other end but to keepe downe the flesh. Then did some begin to make a distinction between daies, as if one had beene better then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:11387:73"/>4 Then were there some, that sought to seduce the simple by philosophy; where of <hi>S. Paul</hi> doth also admonish the faithful. <hi>Beware that no man spoile you through phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and vaine deceipt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 In the same place he forbiddeth the <hi>Colossians</hi> to sticke to the traditions of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and he toucheth the corruption, that was growing amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Out of these sparks, through continuance of time, there arose a great flame: Satan endeavouring at that time to beate vpon this yron with as little noise as might bee, which hee could not bring to that perfect forme as hee desired, till many ages were past; There were many yeares to be imployed about the licking of this beare, before it could be brought to any handsome shape. The authority of the Apostles, the zeale of their disciples, the violence of persecutions, did stop him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> going forwards in his worke; but if fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very infancie of the christian church, &amp; in the sight of the Apostles, he did begin to set about this mysterie of iniquity; what did he do after these lights were extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, after this zeale was waxen cold; is it likely that hee woulde forget his former worke, or begin it so earely to cast it off at

last? Seeing that if Antichrist must be such a one, as our adversaries describe him to be, to wit, a Iew, one that must build vp Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem againe, and be a soveraigne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch over the whole world, we see no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings yet of all this, nor nothing more vnlikely to come to passe.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The second point. With what cunning the prophecie is built and of the diverse sortes of guile that are therein.</head>
               <p>AS the Apostle calleth the doctrine of our redemption, a secret or mistery of godlynesse, because of the height, &amp; depth thereof: so doth he call the doctrin, which is framed with deceipt, and continued by deepe policie, a secret or mistery of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: which is the selfesame with that, which the spirit of God in the 2. of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> calleth the deepnesse of Satan.</p>
               <p>The policies imployed about the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Poperie, and establishment of the papall dignity, are of 4. sorts. 1. There be some of them, which serue to blinde the people, and to darke their vnderstandings.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:11387:74"/>
2. There bee others that serue to heape vp riches; 3. There be others that serue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt the pope, and his clergie to honour, &amp; dignitie. 4. There bee others which serue for the preservation of that which is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The first sort of Policie serving to blind, and inveigle the people.</head>
               <p>THat the people therefore might bee blinded, and deceaued without vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing so much; the pope hath wrested the scriptures out of their hands, and take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> order that they should not bee translated into a knowne tongue. Within these fewe yeares, the scriptures were no more knowne to the people of <hi>France,</hi> then the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was: There were only some Latin Bibles in Monasteries, and in clergie mens houses. And eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this very time in <hi>Spain, Italie, Sicilie, &amp;c.</hi> to see an Italian or Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Bible, would be deemed to bee a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy, and thought a matter sufficient to fetch one vnder the inquisition. To the same ende it is that hee will haue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon service read in a strange tongue, and the women and children are taught to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:11387:74"/>
pray in Latin, for feare they should vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand themselus. This once effected, it was easie for the Pope to drawe religion to his owne profit, &amp; to disguise it as he thought best; the poore people suffering themselus perforce to bee led along by these guides, which haue hoodwinckt their eies. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse because it is the nature of the people to be busie about some thing; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken away the scripture from them, insteed thereof he gaue them images, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with many outward ceremonies, &amp; gay ornaments, to the end that whilst they stood gazing vpon these he might the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier display his nets to ensnare them; Some pretty recreations they haue for to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py their mindes, whilst hee in the <hi>Interim</hi> builds a strong fort round about them, for to keepe them in slavish bondage.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But because, be you never so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full herein, yet there will ever be some cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious spirits that will escape and get out, and that it is hard, but that some one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will be desirous to see the head spring and knowe vpon what authoritie Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion is founded; for feare least such a man as this, hauing gotten the sight of the scripture by stealth, should bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:11387:75"/>
for to see it so little agreeing with the doctrine of the Romish Church, they haue sought to prevent this inconvenience, by an impudent shift. That is, they vse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile the scripture, saying that it doth not containe all things necessary to salvation, that it is but a peece of a rule, that it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, and ambiguous, that the divell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe makes vse of it, that it is not the chief iudge of controversies; but that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence wee must appeale to the Church of Rome, which cannot bee deceaued, and to the Pope which cannot erre in the faith; By these meanes they haue made the rule of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> subiect vnto themselues, since that they themselues, are the rule of religion: and haue made themselues, both iudges &amp; parties, since that in the accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s against the Church of Rome, they will haue the Church to be iudge, and acknowledge no other true Church but the Church of Rome.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To the same end is it that they bind and tie the beliefe of the people, with an ignorant respect, making them to followe without vnderstanding, and to beleeue without knowledge, whereas the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 10 4.17.8.6.69.</note> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would haue vs first know &amp; then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:11387:75"/>
So doe they fold the faith of an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant man within the faith of his curate; but take away the means from him, where by hee might knowe whether his Curate taught the truth or no.</p>
               <p>This also serueth to detain mens minds, to wit, that the Church of Rome by varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of recreations hath studied to fit it selfe to all sorts of humors, and to content all kind of persons; There is not so distasting a spirit, but may finde something here to please his palat. Doe you loue pompe and magnificence? where is the like to that of the Cardinals, and Prelates? or set out with that stately furniture, as their most solemne Masses are? But if a sordid life bee more pleasing to any one, you haue the Capuchins, and Fevillants; doe you loue to liue at your ease? you haue your Abbays, and Priories, together with richly landed places for Canons and Monckes: who enioy their hearts desires, &amp; haue the world at wil; but if you like ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to liue like a beggar, you haue the 4. orders of begging Friars; if you affect soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarinesse, you haue the Hermits; if to keepe company, you haue the Conve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tuall Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks; are you desirous of knowledge, behold the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:11387:76"/>
Iesuits that take vpon them to professe it; or if ignorance? you haue the ignorant Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, which haue made a vertue of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; Doth insolencie, and lasciviousnes, like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, there is shrouetide, a time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to daunce, and revell in, which sportes if any chance to distaste, presently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon ensueth ash-wednesday, which cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth their countenances, and turneth all their lewd mirth into a suddaine devotion. At Rome you haue covents of cloystered Monckes wonderfull for their austerity, &amp; stricktnesse of life; and hard by, the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stewes: liberall almes bestowed on the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitall of the holy Ghost; but withall sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of benefices, dispensations, absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Church offices.</p>
               <p>All this is done in divers places, and by divers men, but behold contrary things in one and the selfe same person. The Pope makes Emperours to kisse his feet, but hee himselfe on Maundie Thursday washeth poore mens feet; he calleth himselfe a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch &amp; God vpon earth, but ye shal heare him at another time, say that he is the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of servants. Pretty diversity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull; a witty people, to cloath religion with this variety of colours. There are

none there, euen to little children of 6. and 7. yeares old, but shall haue some thing or other that wil content them; there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine feasts of purpose for them, as the feast of <hi>S.

When they are 9. or 10. yeares old they haue their heads bound about with fillets, and little crosses laid vpon them of beaten gold, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bishop stroaks their crowns, and this is that which they call confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <head>The second Policie serving to gaine.</head>
               <p>IN the second place, Popery hath made religion serue, as a meanes to gather vp riches;</p>
               <p n="1">1 This is the reason why they haue made a new article of faith, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes the whole gospel: to wit; that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ by his passion hath not satisfied for the paine due to our sinnes which wee commit after Baptisme, but that it lieth vp on vs to satisfie for them, by doing pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in this life, and after this life by bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

But such is the mercy of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that hee pardoneth a great deale of this time to some, whither it be by iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or else by way of suffrage.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To the same end is it, that they tie their pardons to certaine churches, and hang them on certaine altars; to which this priviledge is granted, that whosoeuer shal cause a Masse to bee said there, on such a day, shal haue his choice to free what soule he will out of Purgatory; but this is neuer done without paying; And in the buls of Indulgence there is this clause ordinarily inserted, that this priuiledge is for none, but <hi>Manus porrigentibus adiutrices,</hi> for such as shall put to their helping handes, that is to say, for such as shall giue some thing to the Church, or which shall put some thing into the poore mans boxe, which for this purpose is set before the church dore where the pardons are han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Wherein wee may note a notable point of subtilty, for the Pope sending his Iubilee into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> sendeth it but onlie into two or three places of the Realme, &amp;

Peter,</hi> or send so many souldiers to such or such a country, for the service of his Holinesse; whereof we haue produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced many examples aboue.</p>
               <p n="6">6 In publike ceremonies, in Masses, in Sittings, &amp; Feasts, they haue taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to be princes superiours, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act slavish submission at their hands; The Kings must serue popes at the Masse vpon their knees; They must hold his stirrup as he is getting vp to horse; They must hold
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:11387:79"/>
his horse by the bridle as he is going; or else help to beare vp his chaire with their shoulders; they must wait vpon him at the table. And at the popes feast the chiefe Cardinall Bishop, is to sit aboue the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est prince of Christendome; and it is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table maxime, and infallible rule, which is mentioned in the 3 booke 1. sect. and 2. chap. of popish ceremonies; to wit; <hi>Note that the Pope doth never doe reverence to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man.</hi>

               <p n="8">8 They haue also yet more exalted themselues by their works of supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by vertue of which, they obtaine a de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gree of glory in Paradice aboue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Saints, which had no other sanctitie but to obay God; wheras these squires do more then God hath comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded; their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant satisfactions serue for others, &amp; the Monckes which haue suffered more

               </p>
               <p n="9">9 The cases of marriage also haue bin a great helpe to encrease their power; for they haue remoued all matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the courts of ciuill Magistrates. Whence it comes to passe that men repaire to Rome from all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> for the disanulling of marriages, and for dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to marry in forbidden degrees; the children that are borne out of which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of necessity to defend the Popes authority, seeing that such marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as these, depend altogither vpon his permission.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Of the same rancke is their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon service which they cause to be said in the Latin tongue.

               <head>The fourth Policie. The meanes how to keepe that which they haue gotten.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Popes</hi> being thus enriched, and ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>alted to this height of honour, did wisely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, that it was to little purpose to get, if they were not able to keepe that which they had gotten; &amp; this is the maine point aboue others in which they haue beaten their braines, and laboured to the vtmost of their power.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The first meanes, to preserue that which they had gotten, was to forbid men of the church to marry, for feare lest bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Curates, should encroach vpon church goods, and least they should turne little streames out of the common chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel to their private families; <hi>Gregory</hi> the 1. hath told vs as much aboue, saying, <hi>that he was therefore vnwilling to admit of a marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bishop, because a wife and children, doe vse commonly to consume the church goods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 And for feare that Princes might come to finger their substaunce, and that their lands (for treason or other such like

crimes) might chaunce to be confiscate to the crowne, they haue got to haue their iudges, their officers, &amp; their prisons apart yea they haue so farre forth prevailed with our ancient kings, (which were intente to nothing else but to draw the sworde, and followe the game) that their civill causes were altogither decided at <hi>Rome</hi>; they did also obtaine that the church shoulde euer be held to be vnder age, that so they might not be bound to stand to any bargaine, if it were their lucke at any time to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And to the ende that kings &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces should not put their noses in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, by medling with the choosing of <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Popes,</hi> as they did heretofore, they haue not only confined this election to the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of a fewe <hi>Cardinals,</hi> but they shut them vp also within the <hi>Conclaue,</hi> damme vp the windowes, put in their meat vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them at a little hole; giue them their bread cut in small peeces, their wine in cleere glasses, for feare least there should be any ticket inclosed, wherby they might receaue some information from without; They dine every one apart, without hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping one another.

their businesse the sooner, their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are diminished, and their ordinarie made lesse from day to day; yea <hi>Princes</hi> now adaies thinke themselues highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored if they can buy the <hi>Cardinals</hi> voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for huge summes of mony, to the ende they may haue a <hi>Pope</hi> that will not handle them too rigorously; And there is scarse ever a <hi>Pope</hi> made but by such meanes as these.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The same politicke wisdome of theirs hath suggested this maxime vnto them, that for the strengthning of their state they must of necessitie oblige great families, and let them haue a share in the pray. Wherefore if a <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Lord</hi> haue a house overcharged with children, they will bestow a <hi>Cardinallship</hi> on the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, and make him an <hi>Abbot,</hi> or a <hi>Prior,</hi> this makes the house the lighter. A father hauing put his daughter into some religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous order, is not troubled to provide her a dowrie against her marriage day. They giue civill magistrates leaue, and make them capable of holding benefices, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be married, so to make them obliged.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The chiefest point of their policie,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:11387:82"/>
is their thrusting of Prelates, and other churchmen into Councels, &amp; into Courts of Parliament, to the end they may know all the affaires of a Realme; which is more; Cardinals promoted to this honour by Popes, sit in the Councels of kings, against all the rules of state, that a king should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such into his Councel, as are the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of a stranger; By the like reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, kings should also for their parts haue some lay men in all Ecclesiasticall assemblies, and generall Councels, which should haue an eie over their actions, and knowe what they did; but they are to wise to suffer this.</p>
               <p n="6">6 This is not sufficient: For because a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Prelats, Bishops, Abbots, and the most quallified men of the clergie, there are ever a great many honest, &amp; well min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded persons, which doe loue their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and the liberty of their Kings, the Pope hath therefore here and there dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed a great rabblement of petty Monks which should preach the obedience due to him; who meriting for themselues, and others, haue receaued certaine preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of holinesse from the Pope, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue not; The <hi>fraternitie</hi> of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliers</hi> haue the privilege to drawe a soule
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:11387:82"/>
out of Purgatory vpon certaine daies. The <hi>Carmelites</hi> haue the prerogatiue not to be in purgatory beyond the Saturday after their deaths. To weare the cowle, &amp; make the vow of <hi>S. Francis</hi> &amp; <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p n="7">7 But aboue all, their greatest policy, and all the depths of the mysterie of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie haue beene discouered in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the order of the <hi>Iesuites</hi>; which leaue the honour of keeping the vowe of pouertie, and chastitie to other orders, binding themselues chiefly to the vow of obedience, being tied in particular by an oath to the pope, whom they sweare to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay, <hi>In omnibus, &amp; per omnia,</hi> with an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which they call a <hi>blind obedience,</hi> such as doth execute the commandements of a superiour, without inquiring why; which are sent to run over the whole earth even to the <hi>Indies,</hi> which haue a permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to goe in Lay mens apparell, and to vse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation in iudgement, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale the confessions of traytours, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiratours against the life of their Kings:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:11387:83"/>
which take nothing from any by parcels, but catch by grosse, &amp; swallow vp whole families together.</p>
               <p>All these tricks, and devises, tend chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ruine and reproach of kings, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his <hi>Holinesse</hi> doth cause to bee whipt most shamefully, and with whose crownes hee dispenseth at his pleasure.</p>
               <p n="8">8 It is true indeed that the pope doth recompense them; For hee giueth them of his spirituall graces, an <hi>Holy Rose,</hi> a <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,</hi> or a <hi>sacred sword,</hi> a <hi>Boxe full of holy Graines,</hi> of <hi>little crosses, and beads,</hi> which in kissing and carrying about them, they shall gaine an hundred yeares of pardon. As also the priviledge of communicating vnder both kinds. Whoe will not stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed to behold these things? Or who will be so obstinate as not to be forced by the evidence of the truth? Although al this which I haue said is little, or nothing; I had need of better eies to looke downe in to the bottome of this so deepe a mystery. Wee haue produced nothing of this but what we haue knowne by experience. But how much more is that which lies hid, and which we doe not knowe? All other poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is but blockishnesse in respect of this,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:11387:83"/>
and I am of opinion that they which are the contrivers of it, can hardly look vpon one another without laughing. Finally this is altogether such a subiect, as God doth demand for to shew that he doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the wisdomes of men, and take the subtill in their own devises. But the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> calls vnto vs, intending to make the matter more cleere yet.</p>

he vseth, doth signify <hi>to possesse.</hi> as in the 1. to the <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 7. v. 30. Hee foretelleth vs therefore that the Empire which did beare rule must be abolished, and that out of the ruines of the Empire <hi>the sonne of perdition</hi> must exalt himselfe, &amp; bee made manifest. The same word signifies also to <hi>withhold,</hi> or <hi>hinder</hi>; which also agreeth to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For the Roman Empire while it was in force did hinder the pope from rising, and kept him vnder, by punishing him, dri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing him to corners, degrading him, if at any time he failed to do his duty. But this Empire being decayed in the West, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished in the East by the <hi>Sarasins,</hi> The popes found means to seize vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chiefe citie of the Empire, together with a great part of <hi>Italie,</hi> &amp; to devoure the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Churches, and Realmes at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>Now although the Fathers haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing concerning these things, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by guesse, &amp; coniectures; because they were not as yet come to passe, nevertheles I knowe not how it hath come to passe to bee a generall receaued opinion amongst them, and a common prophecie, that <hi>this sonne of perdition</hi> whom they call <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:11387:85"/>
should rise out of the destruction of the Empire, and be exalted vpon the ruins thereof: And they apply this passage to that purpose, wherin they al hold that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichrist</hi> is spoken of: <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his book of the resurrection of the flesh, chapter 24 <hi>Onely</hi> (saith he) <hi>hee which now holdeth, must hold till he be abolished; what is this but the Roman Empire, the scattered parts whereof being divided amongst tenne kings shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Antichrist, and then shall that wicked man be revealed, &amp;c. Chrysostome</hi> in his 4. sermon vpon the second to the Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, <hi>What is it therefore that withholdeth, that hee bee not made manifest, that is to say, what is it that hindreth him from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: some say that it is the grace of the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly Ghost, others say that it is the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, of whose opinion I am altogether.</hi> The Greeke scholiast gathered out of diverse interpreters, saith the same. <hi>By him which holdeth, hee vnderstandeth him which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth; And what is this? some say that it is the holy Ghost, others that it is the Roman Empire, and this opinion is the best; S. Austin</hi> in his 20. booke and 19. chap. of the cittie of God: <hi>Whereas the Apostle saith, that only he which now holdeth, must hold till hee be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:11387:85"/>
this is thought by some and that not absurdly to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Roman Empire, as if it had beene said, Only hee which now bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth rule, must rule, till he be put from it.</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masius; <hi>The Roman Empire shall be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before that Antichrist bee revealed; S. Ierome</hi> saith the same in the 11. quest. to <hi>Algasia</hi> where he doth expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this place, <hi>If the Roman Empire bee not first destroyed, and Antichrist goe before, Christ shall not come.</hi> And a litle after, hauing said that the name of blasphemy written in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the harlot clad in skarlet, is, <hi>Roma aeterna,</hi> hee addeth, that the Apostle durst not say in expresse tearms that the Roman Empire should bee abolished, for feare of drawing persecution vpon the Church.</p>
               <p>Since therefore that the destruction of the Roman Empire must goe before the manifestation of the sonne of perdition which is called Antichrist, we are to looke whether this Empire be destroyed. For if it be found that it was long since ruinated, there is no question but the sonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is made manifest.</p>
               <p>Here vpon there is a question moved whether the Empire of Germanie bee the true Roman Empire, and the same Empire
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:11387:86"/>
which was in the Apostles time. There be some that affirme this, building vpon this ground, that the Emperour of Germanie is called King of the Romans. Others say that we are not to stand on wordes, but things: And that the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Empire, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>S. Paul</hi> speaketh, is no more, as <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avell</hi> saith in his 1. booke of the Florentine historie: that, <hi>L' Imperio é tutto in terrâ.</hi> the Empire is all falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flat vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground. That the Empire of Germanie came not by succession from the auncient Romane Emperours; but that Charles the Great, King of France was the first founder of it. That the Emperour of Germanie holdeth nothing neither in Rome nor in Italie. That Germanie for the most part is out of the ancient Roman Empire. That it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely that hee should be the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, which is not onely not Emperour of Rome, but sendeth to Rome to tender his submission, and to take an oath of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance and obedience to him that beares sway there, to wit, to the Pope of Rome. And indeed <hi>Lypsius</hi> whoe hath spent his whole study in an exact knowledge of the Roman Empire, and which in this point yeelds to no man living, affirmes boldly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:11387:86"/>
that the Pope holdeth the remainder of this Empire; wherefore hee saith that this Pope and Roman Dictatour doth sustaine the parts of this ruined edifice. That hee hath his Senate clad in purple, whom wee may compare to Kings; That hee hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posts, and Embassadours from farre coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. That Kings themselues, and Princes doe bend before him, and bow down their heads in token of subiection. Wherevpon also he saith that <hi>this sacred Empire at Rome, hath beene, and is, insteed of an ankor to floating Europe</hi>: And in my opinion the Pope and his Parasites do but plainly scof at the Emperor, in calling him king of the Romans, since that they haue taken away all Rome and Italy from him. But we need not here go about to decide this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; for it is is sufficient that all confesse the Roman Empire long since to haue beene so decayed, that one may say truly that it is ruinated, and destroyed; as say that our Kings should bee thrust out of al France, except it were a little Corner in Brittany, one might say that their kingdome were destroyed, &amp; abolished. Besids, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth not see how he doth contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in affirming that the Roman Empire
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:11387:87"/>
whereof <hi>S. Paule</hi> speakes is not yet abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished: For hee saith by a consequent that the Empire of Germanie doth hinder the comming of Antichrist: which being gran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, there is no likelyhood that Antichrist must be a Iew which shall take vp his seat in the kingdome of Ierusalem, for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of Germanie hath no meanes to hinder this.</p>
               <p>This then being out of question, to wit, that the Roman Empire, whereof <hi>S. Paule</hi> speakes, is already ruinated, it must needs also be that the sonne of perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made manifest; since that hee is to rise out of the ruines of the Empire, and bee made manifest by the abolishment therof. We are therefore to finde out some state that did raise it selfe by the fall of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire: the head whereof must call himselfe God, and take vpon him to rule in the house of God, which is his Church, and boast of signes and miracles: Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Turke never tooke such titles: &amp; there shall no man but the Pope be found to whom all these things will agree: who hath also made the seate of his Pontificall Empire in the same towne, which in the Apostle <hi>S. Pauls</hi> time was the seate of the

Roman Empire, and which for many ages together was the chiefe cittie of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: so that it cannot bee denied but that he holdeth the same place which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours did of old: And this is so knowne a thing that our adversaries the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are forced to confesse it, some of whose testimonies wee will cite. <hi>Nicholas Machiavell</hi> dedicateth his <hi>Florentine hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie</hi> to <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the 7: And yet for al that, in the 1. booke there of hee is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to speake in this manner: <hi>The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour therefore becomming a Christian, and withdrawing himselfe to Constantinople, it followed therevpon that the Roman Empire came to decay, and the church of Rome to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the more: neverthelesse till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Lombards (all Italie being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rule of Emperors or Kings) the Popes never tooke any other authoritie vpon them at that time, but to looke into mens manners, and their doctrine: In other matters they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayed the Emperours or Kings, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did put them to death, and imploy them as their servants in what businesse they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: but that which woone them the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and made them to be the more respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Italie, was King Theodoricks laying
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:11387:88"/>
siege to Ravenna: because Rome remaining without a Prince, the Romans to haue the more refuge, were compelled to yeeld the Pope the more obedience. Yet they did not gaine much authoritie by this, only the Church of Rome got to be preferred before that of Raven<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>na. But the comming of the Lumbards, &amp; the division of Italie into so many parts, were the occasions of the Popes rising. Because he (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were the head at Rome) the Emperor of Constantinople, and the Lumbards did so far forth respect him, that the Romans by the Popes meanes did enter a league of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the Lombards, and with Longinus, not as subiects but as friends. And so the Popes continuing to be friends both with the Lombards, and with the Graecians, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their dignitie; but a little after ensued the downefall of the East Empire, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about that time vnder the Emperor He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclius, by the Sclavonians, Persians, Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins, &amp;c.</hi> He addeth farther that the Pope being not able to obtaine succor from the Emperour against the Lombards, sought to the kings of <hi>Fraunce</hi> for aide, and that all the wars which were in <hi>Italie</hi> after that time were raised by the Popes, which made Barbarians come to succour them,

vnder which word of Barbarians hee doth also comprehend the French, who were the only men that did vphold the Papacie as it was falling, and which gaue the Pope whatsoever he doth possesse in Italie.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modity by the ruine of the Empire, let him read <hi>Sigonius</hi> his historie of the kingdome of Italie. In the beginning of his 3. booke he relateth how (the Emperour <hi>Philippicus Bardanes,</hi> opposing himselfe against the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiving of images into churches) Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 2. did for bid the Italians to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any letters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperour, to pay him any tribute out of their mony, to place his statue in their temples, or so much as once to name him in their publike service. This was the first time that the Popes did rebell against the Emperours, being much enfeebled by the Sarasins in the East, and spoiled of the Empire of the West. Before
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:11387:89"/>
then they tooke heed not to raise any mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies. Now this first attempt of the Popes fell out in the yeare of our Lord, 712. yet this stroke drew no bloud, for no man did for all this withdraw himselfe from beeing subiect to the Emperour. And <hi>Sigonius</hi> tels vs plainly that eleven yeares after, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Leo</hi> gaue <hi>Marin,</hi> an Esquire of his body, the governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the city of Rome, which place they that helde were called Dukes of Rome, to whom he gaue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to put Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> to death: which he being not able to effect (the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Emperours as then decreasing from day to day, he commanded his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in Italie who was called the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, to spoile him of his Popedome, &amp; to degrade him; But <hi>Gregorie</hi> sued to the vsurpers of Lombardie for aid, against the Emperour his naturall Prince: And his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute concerning the service of images served him for this purpose, wherein vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of devotion he did oppose himselfe against the Emperors, which did beat downe images in all places; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perswaded the Italians that to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw images was to overturne Christian religion, hee made the Emperours odious
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:11387:89"/>
to the people of Italie. Till at last in the yeare 725. hee wrought them of Rome, of Campania, of Ravenna and Pentapolis to revolt from the Emperour, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand cruelties practised vpon those that tooke the Emperours part; Wherevpon <hi>Sigonius</hi> concludeth thus; <hi>By these meanes Rome and the Dukedome of Rome came to be in the Popes power, being taken from the Grecians by reason of their wicked heresie</hi>; that is to say, that the Popes did take away the chiefest part of the Empire from vnder the Emperours government, because they would not yeeld to worship images. This was the pretext; but the true cause was, because the Emperour was poore &amp; weak so that one might offend him without much danger. This notwithstanding was nothing in respect of the greatnesse to which <hi>Pepin</hi> king of France did exalt the Pope in the yeare 755. which is the time wherein the Pope did first begin to bee an earthly Prince vnder any title. Now even as when a great tree doth fall, every man runs with his hatchet to get some branch or other: Even so in the ruine of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, diverse Princes, and people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

snatched a part of it. But the Bishop of Rome over and aboue the possession of the head citty of the Empire, and of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try round about, did by little &amp; little take the markes and dignitie of the Empire vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to wit, his habit, &amp; shooes of skar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; his senate clad in skarlet, the power of enrolling some for Gods, and Canonizing them for Saints: the obeisance, &amp; submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all the Princes which doe agnize him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Canon law in imitation of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: Embassadours called Legats, as those of Emperours.

               <p>IN the yeare of our Lord 1513. the pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome being in the heigth of worldly glory, and covering al the earth over with a darknesse more thick then that of Egypt, pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 10 began a most shamefull trafficke: sending messengers to carry his pardons into all places, who sold the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes at a set price, and for two crownes would drawe a soule out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie. These Babylonish merchants we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from towne to towne venting their ware, and gathering infinite summes of money, which as they made shewe was to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in warre against the Turke, but the diuell a souldier was euer prest for this purpose; but all was converted by these Collectours to the buying of Cardinals caps, and the maintaining of pride and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency, as if one should take a sack full of crownes, and throwe it into a deep quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.

The subiect of their sermons was onely to speake of the miracles of Saints, and vertues of reliques: Iesus Christ could scarse be knowne from their common sort of Saints, and it was a long time before he could get a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuall day to be assigned vnto him. The common fashion was to wrap men, as they lay a dying, in a Monks gown, that so they might dy in the state of grace; this was thought to bee of no lesse vertue then a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond baptisme.

And out of doubt popery had beene abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished ere this, if Kings and Princes had not vpheld it by their power, and if their crueltie had not compelled men to yeeld vnto it for feare; and if the great revenews which the Clergie possesse did not hold many people fast bound by the bellies, &amp; obliged to maintaine this error. Now this so suddaine and so great a change doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently shewe, that before euer Luther taught, many did distast this abuse, and watcht for nothing but an occasion to cast of the yoke of tyrannicall superstition, we haue therefore by the events which fell out in our fathers time seene a greate part of the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plishment of the Apostles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, which is, that Iesus Christ shoulde consume the sonne of perdition by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his mouth, which is a fashion of speech vsed by <hi>Isaiah</hi> in the 11. chap. &amp; 4.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:11387:93"/>
ver. where speaking of Iesus Christ he saith, <hi>that he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, &amp; slay the wicked with the breath of his lips.</hi> so, that which the Prophet calleth <hi>the breath of his lips, S. Paul</hi> calleth <hi>the spirit, or breath of his mouth</hi>; wherfore also in the 1. of the <hi>Apoc.</hi> it is said that <hi>a sharp two-ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged sword went out of his mouth</hi>: which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the peircing vertue of his word. And out of questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if the kingdom of the son of perdition must be established through the doctrine of lies, it must needs bee that hee must be overthrown by the word of truth. Nor doth <hi>S.

Yet for feare that miracles by being made to commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should cease to be miracles, he thought it not fit to satisfie every mans curiosity in this, but sends vs backe to the hearing of his word: which being once confirmed by miracles in the first publication thereof, to aske any more for miracles is manifest incredulitie. Herevnto adde that Satan doth sometimes imitate the miracles of God, but never his truth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it happens that he which will not beleeue except he see miracles, doth thereby (without thinking of it) sollicit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to worke some miraculous feates, and to sport himselfe in deluding him. This is the reason why our Lord in the 13. of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teronomie</hi> doth forbid vs to iudge of the doctrine by the miracles, and woulde that we should rather iudge of the miracles by
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:11387:95"/>
the doctrine, saying <hi>that if any one shal giue vs a signe, or wonder, and the signe or wonder which he told of should come to passe, yet we must not harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him if he once say, Come and let vs go serue other Gods</hi>; that is to say, if he shall teach false doctrine. Such were the miracles of the magicians of Egypt, which counterfaited the power of God. Such were the miracles of the ancient he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, who disputing against the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes did alleadge their miracles, as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> reporteth in 44. chapt. of the booke of prescriptions. <hi>They will moreover (saith he) speake much concerning the authority of every hereticke, that they haue more then any others co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed the certainty of their doctrin that they haue raised the dead, healed the sick, foretold of events to come, that they might be reputed for Apostles: as though this also were not written, that many shall come doing great miracles, for to strengthen the deceitfulnesse of their wicked preaching.</hi> And in the 3. cha. of his 3. booke against Marcian, hee saith, <hi>that the false Christs doe worke miracles ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easily.</hi> For Iesus Christ tels vs that in the last day many shall say vnto him, <hi>haue not we cast forth divels in thy name?</hi> To whome he shall answere, <hi>I know yee not, depart from

               <p>Which made me not a little wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der how <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others came to put mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles amongst the notes of the true church, since the spirit of God hath given it vs in these last daies for a marke of the false. And that after the miracles of the Apostles, and their disciples, we hear of no miracles fore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>told, but only those of false teachers, and the sonne of perdition, as the author of the commentary vpon <hi>S. Matthew</hi> (common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fathered vpon <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) saith in the 49. sermon. <hi>We do not now acknowledge ani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:11387:96"/>
Christ in the</hi> 12. <hi>of Matthew</hi>; But the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rest the contented with the wil of God revealed in his word: For if we teach no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doctrine then that of the Apostles, their miracles are ours, and confirme our religion. It is for them that forge newe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith, to worke new miracles, that they may be beleeued.</p>
               <p>Now for to finde the accomplishment of <hi>S. Pauls</hi> prophecy in the miracles of Po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pery, wee are of necessitie to rippe vp the whole matter from the beginning, and to see by what miracles the Papacy beganne first to be advanced.</p>
               <p>The Apostles &amp; their Disciples having wrought many excellent and sauing mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, this vertue did insensibly diminish by little and little. This notwithstanding in the third and fourth ages there were some miracles done. But wheresoever God hath his Church, the divell will be sure to build him a chappell not far of: and where he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting it, hee will obscure it by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting the like therevnto. He did ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe many miracles by the handes of hereticks, as <hi>S. Austin</hi> doth confesse in his 13 tract vpon <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> and in the 16. chapt.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:11387:97"/>
of his booke of the vnitie of the Church, where he saith that <hi>Donat</hi> and <hi>Portius</hi> did miracles, of whom and of all those which pray towards the sepulchers of the dead, and which see visions, he saith, <hi>that they are either the fictions of lying men, or prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of deceitfull spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Satan hath for this purpose made vse of another more subtill device. For hee hath raised vp historians, which in rehearsing the true miracles of the good servants of God, doe adde some of their owne, &amp; min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the true with the false.

The brother of <hi>Martin</hi> being dead, his soule was presented before God, and for his sinnes sent to hel, there to be grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tormented: But two Angels, came, and signified to God (for God himselfe knewe not of it) that this was the man for which <hi>Martin</hi> prayed, wherevpon God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that hee should bee releast, sent backe againe into the world; and restored to <hi>Martin.</hi> After his death a dog barked incessantly at certaine men as they passed

And in the 10. chap. a Lady of good fashion is possessed with a diuell because shee lay with her husband the day before the dedication of a certaine church. In the first chapter of the 2. booke, the diuell breakes <hi>S. Bennets</hi> bell with a stone, which hee did vse to ring, when hee would haue meat brought vnto him. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, the same Saint burning with the fits of loue, did (for to correct the outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous insolencie of his flesh) roll his naked body vpon thornes, and nettles, till the blood sprang out againe. In the 20. chap. a Monke holdes a candle to <hi>S. Bennet</hi> all supper time, as though it had beene a sinne for him to set it downe vpon the table.

In the 4. booke and 21. chap. two Monkes that were han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, doe sing most melodiously vpon the gibbet after their deathes. And this fourth booke is spent wholly in mentioning of soules, that say they are in Purgatory, not in a fire vnder the earth, that the Pope might draw them out by his Indulgences (for this invention was not yet thought vpon) but in bathes, in the wind, vnder the leaues of trees, or in the cold water. And these soules being asked why they suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red these paines, answered, because they had wronged some Monk or other, or had not giuen that to the Church which they had promised. Wherevpon <hi>Gregory</hi> stands amazed at the so frequent visions of souls, neuer heard of before. Saying in the 41. chap. <hi>Whence comes it to passe I pray you,

Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were made serue to this end, which as then were so frequent, that it was held for a miracle, not to worke a miracle. <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in his Annals, in the 870. yeere parag. 63. names certaine witnesses which report that three miles of from the towne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> there was in former times a table or image of the virgin Mary in painting, the painting whereof came to bee flesh incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate within the wood, and sent forth a more odoriferous oyle then balme. <hi>Luit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prandus,</hi> and <hi>Platina</hi> in the life of <hi>Sergius</hi> the third, reports that when the body of pope <hi>Formosus</hi> was carryed into <hi>S.

This was a meanes rather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:11387:100"/>
him on to it afresh. There are images shewed at <hi>Burgo</hi> in Spaine, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to haue fallen from heauen, and to be made by <hi>S. Luke,</hi> and images of a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix the haire &amp; nailes of which do grow out new every month. <hi>Caesarius</hi> and others recite infinite miracles done by images, which did sweat, or weep, or speak, or wag the head, and it is certaine that (if at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we may beleeue these people) the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the virgin Mary hath wrought a thousand times more miracles, then Iesus Christ himself ever did in his own person. Which holy virgin they haue prophanely dishonored, by attributing such miracles vnto her as are scarsely honest. There is an Italian booke sufficiently knowne, intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Miracoli d' ella gloriosa virgine Maria</hi> printed at Milan in the yeare 1547. which saith that a certaine Abbesse being great with child, the holy virgin willing to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her crime, did in her steed present her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe before the Bishop in forme of an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse, and shewd him by an ocular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that she was not great with child. The same booke relateth that an honest woman snatcht the virgin Maries sonne from betweene the armes of her image,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:11387:101"/>
saying vnto her, <hi>Giue me my sonne which is kept prisoner, or I will not giue thee thine,</hi> &amp; that the virgin Mary for to haue her owne sonne did free the other womans sonne out of prison. <hi>Caesarius</hi> in his 7. booke 35. chap. reports that the virgin Mary for 12. whole yeares together, did supply the place of a certaine Nunne called <hi>Beatrice,</hi> whilst shee lay in the Stewes, till at last she came backe againe to take her place, and freed the Virgin from standing sentinell any longer. And God being enraged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rebellion of men, hath giuen to these miracles a powerfulnes of deluding, that so the Apostles prophecy might bee fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Nowe looke after what manner Satan went about at first to establish the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Images, the same way did he go to lay the foundation of transubstantiation, &amp; did also for the authorising of this, serue his owne turne with a new sort of false mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. For many faithfull servants of God opposing themselues against this errour in the rising thereof, the foster-fathers of this abuse, began to invent a kinde of miracles never heard of before.

Wherefore they do yet keepe some bloud &amp; flesh in many churches, for feare least the people suspect that these were illusions. For Satan even in those daies did secretly begin to weaue the web of the mistery of Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which having co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by these miracles, he got it at last to passe in an article of a councell, the <hi>Lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the miracle of the Asse that left his proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to worship the hoast, seemes most ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to the king of Great Brittaine: and that with good reason: howsoever <note place="margin">

Wee are therefore now come to that passe, that it is helde im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety not to think that foolish legends for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged but of late, must haue all one authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to bind our beliefe, as the word of God, besides, no miracles of the scripture do pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vertues in brute beasts: for it must needes be (by their reckoning) that this Asse (going of his own accord to worship the hoast) had some zeale in him &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, which was not to be seen in the Kine that drew the Arke, nor in <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> Asse. The miracles that are done nowe a daies are of no more worth, and are al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to one miracle, which is to driue away divels, who make as though they were afraid of holy water, and the signe of crosse, so to detaine the people still in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: and as theeues are thought to giue life when they do not take it away, so the divels are said to do good when they cease
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:11387:103"/>
to hurt. Wherevnto they do willingly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend, for to make men thinke that the Masse or these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iurations haue some ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in them. The Pharisies accused Iesus Christ for casting out divels by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> Prince of the divels, thinking that <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub</hi> did cast out others as being more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull then they. But we speak not as the Pharisies: for we say not that these coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of spirits in this age, do cast out divels by any superiority or predominancie that they haue over them, but by collusion, and by the voluntary departing of the divels themselues. Wherefore they cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer vs as our Lord did the Pharisies, that if Satan cast out Satan his kingdome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure, because hee is divided against himselfe, for in all their exorcismes we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose that the diuels are to well agreed. Yea and I say, that if Christ could haue done no other miracle but to heale those which were possessed with diuels, the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies had had some reason to doubt of his power: but he gaue sight to such as were borne blinde, raised the dead that lay stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in their graues, multiplyed the bread, things which the diuels cannot doe, and which our aduersaries (though neuer so

               <p>To go about here to reckon vp a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand false miracles wherewith the legends are stuft, were nothing else but to rake vp heapes of dunge. <hi>S.

shee scoffed at her husbands miracles. In all this, the greatest miracle is the patience of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the blockishnesse of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that are thus led.

               <head>The cleering of this prophecie, togither with the proofe of this exposition.</head>
               <p>ALbeit this chapter make no mention of the bishop of Rome, yet I must of ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cessity expound it, because it serues for the vnfolding of the chapters following, and because they depend vpon this. Now the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:11387:109"/>
exposition which I giue of it is so cleere &amp; naturall, that it may be thought a labour spent in vaine to goe about to proue it.</p>
               <p>By this woman I vnderstand the church of <hi>Israel,</hi> after <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; the patriarches, which were the fathers of the 12 tribes of Israell, till the Iewish church began to bee mixed togither with that of the Gentils, which came to passe presently vpon the time of the Apostles. This is the reason, that (although the church of the Iewes before the preaching of the gospel, and before the ascension of Iesus Christ be the selfe same Church with that of the faithfull Iewes, which from the Apostles time did beleeue in Iesus Christ) yet so it is, that for the more perspicuities sake I cal the church of the Iews after the ascension of our Saviour Iesus Christ the Iewish-Christian church, for to distinguish it from the Iewes that were the enimies of the gospell: &amp; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it is still the Church of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be 2 reasons that enforce me not to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the church in generall by this woman, but only the church of <hi>Israell.</hi> The first is because Iesus Christ is borne of the church here mentioned. For least any man
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:11387:109"/>
should vnderstand this of a metaphoricall birth, the holy Ghost doth there make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse mention of a birth that goeth before his ascension: which cannot agree to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, whereby Christ is formed a new in vs. The second reason is because in the 17. verse this church is manifestly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from that of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tils; as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the daughter. Besides the whole course of the chapter sheweth vs that this is the meaning.</p>
               <p>In the third verse the diuell is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the forme of a beast having 7. heads and ten hornes, which is the forme vnder which the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is represented in the 7. of <hi>Daniell</hi>: and in the 1. verse of the chapter which wee come next to handle; where we will examin the reason why the Empire is described in this manner. And the diuell and the Empire are both repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented vnder the same forme, because the diuell did as then make vse of this mightie Empire for to persecute the church.</p>
               <p>In the 4. verse their revolting, which held some place in the Church, is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the falling of starres throwne down from heauen vpon earth. For as the church is often called the kingdome of heaven, so
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:11387:110"/>
by the same reason they which are placed therein are compared to starres: whose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacie is as the falling of one from heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to earth, both because they are shut out of heauen, as also because they deiect &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base their desires and affections from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly to earthly things. Which will also serue vs to expound the 10. verse of the 8. chapter of this booke, where it is said that a great star fell from heauen, which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the thirde part of the waters of the earth, the meaning whereof is nothing els, but that a great man of note in the Church should fal from the faith, and by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple corrupt many others.</p>
               <p>That which is said in the fifth verse, that the child (which is the Messias) shall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne all nations with a scepter of yron, is taken out of the 2. Psalme, ver. 9. <hi>Thou shalt crush them with a scepter of yron,</hi> that is to say, thou shalt keepe them vnder with a mighty scepter, and with a powerfull do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: in which Psalme the extent of the absolute Empire of Christ Iesus is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto us.</p>
               <p>The flight and retiring of the Iewish church, and the three yeares and an halfe wherein shee lay hid, as it is in the 6. &amp; 14.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:11387:110"/>
verses, are proved to be true by history. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sebius</hi> in the 2. booke of his history, and 5. chapter saith; <hi>The people of the church of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem were before the warre began by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle revealed to some of the chiefe amongest them, commanded to depart out of that citty, and to dwell in a towne on this side Iordano called Pella, whether as many as beleeved in Iesus Christ fled hauing left Ierusalem.</hi> Now this warre lasted 3. years and a halfe, as we may gather out of <hi>Dion,</hi> and <hi>Iosephus,</hi> from the third booke of his Iudaicall historie to the 6. In the 67. yeare of our Lord, in the month of Aprill, 4. moneths after the death of <hi>Nero, Vespasian</hi> sent at first by <hi>Nero</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to lay his siedge to <hi>Gadara,</hi> and <hi>Iota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pata,</hi> and to subdue <hi>Galilee.</hi> In the 70. year of our Lord on the 8. of December <hi>Titus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Vespasian</hi> tooke <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp; razed it to the ground, afterward departed thence to triumph at <hi>Rome,</hi> leauing some few forces to finish that which he had left vndone, which was effected with little or no resistance.</p>
               <p>The Prince of the Angels <hi>Michaell</hi> which is spoken of in the 7. verse, is Iesus Christ our Lord. For this is he which is the head of the Angels; this is <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Col</hi> 2.15. <hi>Ps.</hi> 68.19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8.</note> he which hath
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:11387:111"/>
overcome the diuell; this is he to whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the name of <hi>Michael</hi> agreeth, which signifieth, <hi>Who is as God</hi>? for hee hath thought it no robbery to be equal to God his father. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p>Now the battel that was fought in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven must bee vnderstoode to haue beene fought after the death or ascension of our Lord, and not after the retiring aside of the Iewes into <hi>Pella,</hi> although there be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of this before the fighting of the battaile in heauen: for <hi>S. Iohn</hi> hauing first related what befell the church vpon earth, mounts vp againe to the things that were done in heauen: and indeed in the 14. this very flight of the church is set after the figh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting of the battaile in heaven: which I doe not thinke was so in effect, but that hereby God did in a visio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> represent to <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> that Satan was cast out of heauen by Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>To this purpose wee are to note that in the 1. of <hi>Iob,</hi> the 6. verse, it is said, that the children of God (which are the Angels) came and stood before the Lord, and that Satan also thrust in amongst them. And in the 22. chapt. of the 1. of <hi>Kings</hi> 21. verse, it is said, that a wicked spirit came and stood
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:11387:111"/>
before the Lord, offring his service to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Prophets, and to be a lying spirit in their mouths. By which places it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, that Satan in that time had as yet free accesse into heauen, and that he was found amongst the Angels. But in the 10. chap. of <hi>S. Luke,</hi> and 18. verse, Iesus spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thus, <hi>I saw Satan like lightning fall downe from heaven.</hi> And in this 12. chapter of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> Satan is described vnto vs falling from heauen to earth presentlie after the ascensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iesus Christ. By which passages of scripture it seemeth that the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension of our Lord did wholly exclude Satan out of heaven, and barred him al en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance there again for ever after that time, tumbling him downe into this lower regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherevpon <hi>S. Paul</hi> also in the 2. chapt. to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> calleth the wicked spirits, <hi>the powers that rule in the aire,</hi> &amp; the prince of the diuels, <hi>the Prince of the powers that rule in the aire.</hi> Which region of the aire is in infinite places of holy writ called by the name of heauen: in which sense I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that must be vnderstoode which the same Apostle speaketh in the 6. chap. of the same epistle, where he saith, that the spirituall wickednesses are in the high, or
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:11387:112"/>
heauenly places.</p>
               <p>Now that Satan being in heauen did ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuse and calumniate the faithful to God, it appeareth by the example of <hi>Iob,</hi> whom he accused to God, as if al his zeale and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie had beene mercenary, and led by profit. Wherefore also hee is called the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, that is to say, a slanderer.</p>
               <p>The waters which Satan did powre out after the church for to hurt her, are the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, and nations. The meaning whereof would haue been hard for vs to haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out, if the holy Ghost himselfe had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it in the 15. verse of the 17. chap. <hi>The waters which thou sawest, are people, and multitudes, and nations.</hi>

               <p>By these 7. hils we do vnderstand 7. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers successiue governments, which haue borne soveraigne rule ouer the citty of Rome: to wit, the Kings, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Consuls succeeded, whose forme of governement was interrupted 3 several times by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie Tribunes which were endued with consular authority.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:11387:119"/>
it is come to at this day. And this expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not of our owne inuenting, but grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the 17. of the <hi>Revelation</hi> the 10. verse, where he saith that <hi>the</hi> 7. <hi>heads are</hi> 7. <hi>kings</hi> (so doth-he call all soueraigne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) <hi>fiue of which were fallen, and the</hi> 6. <hi>was, &amp; the</hi> 7. <hi>was not yet come.</hi> There is nothing so cleere and evident. For at the time when <hi>S. Iohn</hi> had this <hi>Revelation</hi> the 5. first of these 7. soueraigne gouernements were abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to wit, the kings, the Consuls, the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie Tribunes, the Decemvirs, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatours, the sixth did flourish, to wit, the Emperours, and the 7. to wit, the Popes were not as yet come. I am not ignoraunt that euen then there were Consuls still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and Militarie Tribunes, but they had no soueraignty. The Consulship was a place more of dignity, then any authority, and serued for nothing else but to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the yeares in their <hi>Fasti.</hi> And the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Tribunes were but the Captaines of one Legion, which are at this day called the Colonels of a band. It is not therefore an interpretation of our owne inuention, when we say that these 7 heads doe signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie 7. seueral formes of soueraigne gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ruling <hi>Rome</hi> one after an other, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:11387:119"/>
not all at the same time: seeing that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> saith that 5. of these 7. heads were fallen, that one was, and that the 7. was not as yet come. This doubtlesse is an admirable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and was suggested to his Maiesty of England by the spirit of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Iohn</hi> doth adde further, that this beast which is the Roman Empire had 10. dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demes, or crownes; the meaning is plaine: we vse to say that our King, besides the crowne of <hi>Fraunce</hi> hath also the <hi>crowne</hi> of <hi>Navarre</hi>: and that the kings of <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Spain,</hi> are kings of more crownes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one, that is to say of more Realmes or Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; The like is here to be vnderstood. The 10. crownes of the Roman Empire are 10. great Provinces &amp; principall parts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Empire did as then consist; <hi>Italie, Spaine,</hi> the <hi>Gaules, Germanie, Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bulgarie, Greece, Natolia</hi> or <hi>Asia minor, Syria</hi> and <hi>Assyria, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Affricke.</hi> The Iles are dependances of the next contine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And vnder euery one of these great partes are comprehended the next small provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were kept in subiection by the same armies: as <hi>Dacia</hi> &amp; <hi>Moldavia</hi> by the Legions appointed for <hi>Hungarie.</hi> If there were any other Provinces, as <hi>Armenia,</hi> &amp;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:11387:120"/>
                  <hi>Arabia,</hi> they were neuer held but weakly, and in part, and were often lost, and they are reckoned for dependences of <hi>Asia mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> and of <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although the Romane Emperour be here compared to a beast, yet this doth not deny but that there were some good Roman Emperours: and we may not think it strange that the holy Ghost doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this Empire vnto vs by a Beast, which was not only gouerned by <hi>Neroes, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and <hi>Heliogabales</hi>: but by <hi>Theodosies</hi> also, &amp; <hi>Valentinians,</hi> Christian and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princes. For Empires are called beasts in the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyps,</hi> because of the manner by which they did first rise and increase, to wit, by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and crueltie. For no man can deny that the Romans at first were nothing else but theeues, and common robbers, which heretofore hauing nothing but onely one walled towne, had no right ouer <hi>Italy</hi> lesse yet ouer <hi>Greece,</hi> ouer the <hi>Gaules,</hi> ouer <hi>Spaine, Africke,</hi> or <hi>Asia</hi>; but it is possible enough to gouerne that with order and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, which was first laid hold on by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice.</p>
               <p>It remains that we see what these names
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:11387:120"/>
of blasphemy are, which this citie and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Rome did beare. <hi>S. Hierome</hi> in the 11. question to <hi>Algasia,</hi> expounds this place thus. <hi>There is (saith S. Iohn in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,) a name of blasphemy written in the forehead of the queane clad in skarlet, &amp; this name is, Rome The Everlasting.</hi> The same citie is likewise called <hi>Dea,</hi> Goddess, And so doth <hi>Iulius Frontinus</hi> cal her in his booke of water workes. The queene and Empresse of the world, which is the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse of the earth, and all the nations. And <hi>Martial</hi> speaketh after the same manner, in the 8.

               <p>THis interpretation needeth not much proofe; euery man knowes the speedy atchieuements of the Romans conquests, especially after the 2 Punick war. <hi>Then</hi> (as <hi>Florus</hi> saith) <hi>the conquest of Macedon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that of Africke, then, that of Greece, &amp; of Syria, &amp; of all the rest in a huddle, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by the vnresistable tide, &amp; rushing torrent of Fortune.</hi> It is said of <hi>Pompey</hi> that he ouerran the world by his conquests in lesse time, then one could haue run it ouer a foot. And <hi>Caesar</hi> in the war against <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces</hi> doth boast, that hee no sooner came and saw him, but he ouer came him.

And <hi>Iosephus</hi> telleth vs that in the siege of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> vndertaken by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespasian</hi> there died 11000000 men:
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:11387:123"/>
and yet neuerthelesse these Princes haue beene noted for examples of clemency.

The Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where the people were entertained to passe away the time, where murder was a common sport, where men went to see Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tigers teare men asunder, so to solace themselues, what else was this but a discipline of crueltie, and a means to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome the people to murder, &amp; to drink in bloud at their eies by way of recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>As for the wealth of this Empire, it is an incredible thing: the riches of our Kings are but pouertie being compared to these.

which did amount to six hundreth and fiftie millions, and 4 hundreth fiftie foure thousand crownes, as it is summed vp by <hi>Hadrianus Iunius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These great riches came vpon them by the robbing and pilling of the Provinces of the Empire, whereby they did sucke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all their substance from the Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and spoiled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their goods as much in time of peace, as of warre.

               <head>The Proofe.</head>
               <p>THere is nothing more agreeable to the event then this interpretation. In the year 752. <hi>Aistulphus</hi> king of the <hi>Lombards</hi> destroyed the Exarchat of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and put downe the Exarchs, which 200. whole yeares after <hi>Narses</hi> had beene the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Lieutenants in <hi>Italie.</hi> This is the deadly wound which the beasts did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue. Now because <hi>Rome</hi> was a part of the Exarchat, <hi>Aistulphus</hi> did pretend that being Lord of the Exarchat, he was also to be Lord over <hi>Rome,</hi> and began to wast the territories of the Duchy of <hi>Rome. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> the second was then Pope, who in this extremitie sought to his soveraigne Lord the Emperour for succour, to wit, to the Roman Emperour, but being not able to get any aide from him, because he was weake, and elsewhere occupied, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide Pope had recourse to <hi>Pepin</hi> king of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:11387:126"/>
                  <hi>Fraunce,</hi> which not long before had got to bee king by deposing <hi>Childericke</hi> his Master and lawfull Soveraihne. At his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest <hi>Pepin</hi> came downe into <hi>Italie</hi> in the yeare of our Lord .754. And having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled <hi>Aistulphus</hi> to receiue conditions of peace, returned into <hi>Fraunce.</hi> But in the yeare following <hi>Aistulphus</hi> broke the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, &amp; did forrage the Roman ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory againe: This drew <hi>Pepin</hi> the second time into <hi>Italie,</hi> where having overcome <hi>Aistulphus</hi> he took the Exarchat fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and bestowed it on the bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; made him Lord over <hi>Rome,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Italie,</hi> 666. yeares after the time that the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> was revealed to <hi>Saint Iohn.</hi> So the Popes became Princes by the inconsiderat liberality of our kings, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan even then, to shew their good wils to cut of Monarchs, to imitate their actions, and to encroach vpon the rightes of the Roman Empire. Hereby the Church of Rome became to bee Queene over other Churches, and in her Prelats and Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall orders did reerect the Empire that was fallen: tyrannising over the goods &amp; consciences of men, vsing her temporall riches as a meanes to augment her spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:11387:126"/>
power, and to establish a Monarchie at Rome over the Church, bearing rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Temporaltie, and Spiritualty in Christian kingdomes; For how be it the successours of <hi>Charlemaine</hi> were and are as yet stiled the kings of the Romans, and that the <hi>Othons</hi> had a Regent at Rome, &amp; handled the Popes as their subiectes, yet this did not last long: and the Pope fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a meanes so to free himselfe from beeing vnder their dominion, that at length hee made them to be his vassals &amp; bondmen, and to receiue their crown by his benefit, &amp; vnder his permissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, till it should please his Holynesse to take it from them, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it on whom hee thought good: to to kisse his feet, to lay downe great sums of gold at his feete for tribute; and even then when the German Emperours did curbe the Popes, yet they did stil acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge themselues subiect to the Church of Rome. This once obtained it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell if hee name himselfe a King and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and call his Bishoprick an Empire, and so haue reestablished the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in its former seate, as <hi>Austin Steuchus</hi> the Popes library keeper saith,<note place="margin">

tearmes as may seeme to be made of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for the vnfolding of this prophecy. <hi>After the destruction of the Roman Empire</hi> (saith hee) <hi>caused by the lewd liues of the Emperours, if God had not raised vp the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, in which the Roman maiestie did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viue, it would haue hapned, that Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing succoured by no man, had beene inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or made astinking oxe-stall or pigstie. But in the Pope there arose, if not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Ancient Empire, at least a forme not much vnlike vnto that, whereby all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did heretofore obay the Emperours.</hi> And this is that which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> addeth, that all the earth went after the beast wondring. A little after the same <hi>Steu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> calleth the Papacie an Empire, and maiesticall Royalty: And so doth <hi>Lipsius</hi> speake of it, and others for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly cited, all which doe acknowledge, that the Popes are the true possessours of the Empire, and doe hold the place of the ancient Roman Emperours, that is to say, that they are Caesars successours more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostles. Now by these words of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> to wit, that all the earth wondring at the healing of this wound went after the beast, it appears that the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d which
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:11387:127"/>
the Empire did receaue by the <hi>Herules, Gothes, Vandals,</hi> was not the wound here spoken of: For the healing of this wound by <hi>Belisarius</hi> and <hi>Marses,</hi> drewe no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or nations to the obedience of the Empire, no countrie moved with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, did for this submit it selfe volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily. The fruit of this conquest over the <hi>Gothes</hi> was the establishment only of the Exarchat in a part of <hi>Italie.</hi> But the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Roman Empire by the Roman Hierarchie drew infinit sorts of people to the obedience of this Empire; And wee may say that all the earth moued with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, out of a voluntarie respect ran after the beast, which shall bee proved more fully yet by the 12. and 14. verse.</p>

               <p>This is a rare prediction, and such as giues light to this whole prophecie.

Which was manifestly verified in this, that when the Roman Empire went to ruine in <hi>Italie</hi> then was the question about the worship of images most hot. To which worship the people of the East did not yeeld then, when the Popes first of all became Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narches at <hi>Rome,</hi> but they were woon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it by little and little, after the imitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and by the authority of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The other kind of Idolatrie, to wit, the worshipping the bread of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, grounded vpon transubstantion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:11387:128"/>
also to grow vp in the Church iust at the same time that the Pope grew to be a Prince and earthly Monarch; for we may see some small seeds of this in <hi>Damascene</hi> which liued in the 750 yeare of our Lord, and as this errour did increase by little &amp; little, <hi>Bertram</hi> a Priest that liued in <hi>France</hi> vnder <hi>Charles the bald</hi> in the yeare 870. writ an excellent booke in confutation thereof, which is to bee seene at this day. And at the same time <hi>Iohn Erigen</hi> surna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Scot</hi> a Monke of S. <hi>Benedicts</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrot another booke against the selfe same errour. But the Bishops of Rome which had erected the service of images, did also establish the worship of bread: &amp; condemned the writings of the said <hi>Scot,</hi> especially <hi>Leo</hi> the 9. in the yeare 1055 ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving assembled a Councell at Rome, and another at <hi>Verseil</hi> in <hi>Piemont</hi> for the confirmation of this Idolatry, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which many of the faithfull did oppose themselues, and amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Berenger</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Angers,</hi> a man of great knowledge and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. At last truth was overborne by falsehoode, our kings lending a helping hand to the Pope. And that this prophecy

might be fulfilled in all points, looke how Idolatry did encrease, so did the greatnes of the Roman Hierarchie encrease; in so much that all did dread the power therof, thinking that none was able to resist it.

The head is called God, the Divine Maiestie, the vniversall Bishop, the head &amp; Spowse of the Church, the corner stone, the Lion of Iuda, and Saviour of Sion, the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

The body of this Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie vnder the name of the Church doeth vsurp that which appertaines to God, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Church cannot erre, and that it is the supreame iudge in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And that it is this church which giveth authority to the scripture, &amp; is the only infallible Iudge of the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof. They cal this Church the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-Catholick church, not in that sense as the Ancient did take Catholicke for Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, but by Catholicke they vnderstande vniuersall, exclusiuely to all other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as if there were no other church but the Roman. <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> They say that this Church hath authority to make newe articles of faith, and to adde to the Creede: That she is the mother and mistresse of all other Christian Churches: So the French and Spanish Church are become the hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maides of the Roman, and if any one bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked of what church he were, should answere, I am of the French church, hee would bee thought ridiculous, or scarce well in his wits, because the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch church
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:11387:131"/>
is now reckoned for nothing, or for some smal dependance of the Roman. Al which positions, are as so many blasphemies. 1. For, to take vpon ones selfe not to be able to erre, and to be supreame iudge in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion, is to intrude into Gods place, and to take away this dignitie of being highest Iudge from Gods word. 2. To boast that they giue authority to the holy Scripture which is the word of God, this is to exalt themselus aboue the word of God: For hee which giueth authoritie is more great then he which receiveth it. For if we consider well of the matter, wee shal finde that it is not the characters, nor the booke, which are vnderstood by the name of the holy Scripture, but God spea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king in his worde: the church of Rome therfore in this doth exalt her selfe aboue God. 3. Likewise the Church of Rome doth make her selfe equall with God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shee doeth challenge the authority of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an infallible interpretation of the scripture, and which shall be of equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the scripture it selfe, for none ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue interpretation of a law, which shal be of equal authority with the law, but on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly he which made the law: the church of Rome therefore is God, and doth vsurpe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:11387:131"/>
Gods seat, since she giveth interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to Gods law, which are of equal authority with the law. Nay, which is more, I say that to interpret the law after this manner, is a great deale more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make it, since that the people are not bounde to followe the letter of the law and of Gods word, but the interpretation which the Church of Rome shall giue of it. 4. The Church of Rome also doeth make her selfe as God, when in steed of instructing the people to beleeue in the word of God, she teacheth them to beleeue in the Church. For if you aske the simple people why they beleeue this or that, they will answer you because the church beleeues it, and by the Church they vnderstand the Roman Church, as if to beleeue in the Roman Church, and to beleeue in God were all one. Now it is to be noted, that in all these errours by the word Church, the people art not meant, for they are no iudges, they giue no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the scripture: but by the church the Hierarchie is vnderstood, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Prelats which being dispersed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough diverse nations doth depend vpon <hi>Rome,</hi> that is to say on the Romane consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie, and the Popes chaire. It was neuer heard of, before the Pope came to rule,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:11387:132"/>
that for to be saved, a man must needes be a Roman, and that the words, <hi>Vniversall</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> were coincident; whereas the Apostle wrote to the Church of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes after the same manner as he did to the Church of the Corinthians, or Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, &amp; gaue her not any title of superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: without doubt he should haue spake thus vnto them. Although your Church be the Mistresse of all other Churches, and my admonitions may seeme needlesse for you, because ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not possibly erre in the faith, and because <hi>S.

by the starres which fell from heaven, it is easie to prooue how the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth diffame those which did, and stil do, serue God in puritie, fastning odious names vpon them, and calling them He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes, Schismaticks, Infidels, Vaudians, Albigeans, Huguenots, Calvinists: perswa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding the simpler sort, that wee hold good workes to bee vnprofitable: that wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue all kinde of dissolutenesse, that wee are enimies of the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> and the Saints; that we make God the author of sinne: and such like things as we detest, &amp; which are cleane contrary to our beliefe.</p>
               <p>But if by those which are in heaven the Saints in Paradice bee vnderstoode, the Church of Rome doeth wrong these no lesse; For is it not an iniurie to the Saints to change them into Idols? and to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the instruments of dishonouring God worshipping and adoring them with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious kinde of worship that is due onlie to God? who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doubt but that the Saints do hate such as honor them thus?

                  </note>As for the persecutions which this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie hath raised against the faithfull, &amp; the victories which it hath had over the Church; It is never found that the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Church did make any massacres of the ancient hereticks. Crueltie is most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table with falshood. To burne a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an because he would not obey the Pope, is a thing which had never beene seene: but began after the Pope grewe to bee an earthly Monarch. It is well neere 400. yeares since <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3. within the space of a few monthes, made more then 200000 of the faithfull to bee slaine, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they called <hi>Albigeans,</hi> after the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they doe vs <hi>Hugenots</hi> now adaies.

In S. <hi>Bartholomewes</hi> massacre, in the yeare 1572, more then 80000 men

were slaine in cold blood. At <hi>Lyons</hi> 150. persons put into prison were drawne out all one after another, and stabbed at the gate of the prison.

In recompence whereof the Pope sent him an holy sword, &amp; consecrated gloues. The punishments of the Inquisition sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe all crueltie.

                  </note> The holy Ghost saith that it shall last 1260. daies, where wee must take each day for a yeare: For this Prophecie doth every where almost bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the tearmes of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and vse his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of speech, who by a weeke vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands 7. yeares, and who foretelleth that from the permission of returning, &amp; buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp Hierusalem againe, (granted by <hi>Darius, Nothus</hi>) vntill the finall destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, there should be 70 weekes,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:11387:134"/>
that is to say 70 times 7 yeares, to take a day for a yeare, which make 490 yeares which afterward came to passe; and this wonderfull prophecie was fulfilled at the time appointed. So likewise in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> in the 4. chap. and 6. verse. <hi>Thou shalt beare the iniquitie of the house of Iudah</hi> 40 <hi>daies: I haue appointed thee a day for a yeare.</hi> And in the 14 chap. of Numbers .34. verse. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the number of the daies in which ye sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out the land, even</hi> 40. <hi>daies every day for a yeare, &amp;c.</hi> It is no new thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Scripture to take a day for a yeare; but it is the stile of the prophecies. Now here is a mystery, and an admirable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency: for herein the Iewish-chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church which lay hid 1260 daies, flying the persecution of the heathenish Roman Empire, was a figure of the flight and persecution of the Christian Church vnder the Papall Roman Empire, which persecution must last 1260 mistical daies, which amount to so many yeares.</p>
               <p>Since it is so that the holy Ghost throughout this whole chap. speakes of the succession and establishment of this Roman Hierarchie, insteed of the Roman Empire, and that we haue shewed that the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:11387:135"/>
Pope began to lay the foundations of this temporal Empire in the yeare of our Lord 755. if therevnto yee ad these 1260 yeares of the continuance of this Hierarchicall Empire, it must needes last to the 2015. yeare of our Lord: according to which reckoning it hath 404. yeares yet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Wherevnto if yee ioine the predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apostle, who hath told vs that Christ shall abolish this sonne of perdition by the brightnesse of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, yee may well neere guesse the time of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Lord. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto adde that amongst the Iewes this was an vsuall prophecie, that as the world was made in 6. daies, and after came the day of rest, so the world must endure sixe thousand yeares, &amp; afterwards there shall be an everlasting time of rest: That is to say, that there must be so many thousande yeares in the worldes duration, as there were daies in the creation. For as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>S.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> saith: <hi>One day with the Lord is as a thousand yeares, &amp; a thousand yeares as one day.</hi> According to this calculation, this present yeare of our Lord, 1611. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 5560 year of the world. If the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Empire must yet continue 404 years,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:11387:135"/>
its end must bee in the 5964. yeare of the world, which is nor farre of from 6000 yeares. Astrologie also doth lend vs some light in this matter: for in the yeare of the world 3665. <hi>Ptolomie Philadelph</hi> raigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Egypt, some 469 yeares after the building of Rome, there lived one <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parchus</hi> a famous Astrologer, who reports that in his time the star commonly called, <hi>stella polaris,</hi> which is in the taile of the lesser beare, was 12 degrees &amp; two fifths distant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poles of the Equator. This starre from age to age hath insensibly still crept neerer to the Pole, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the poles of the Equator are moueable; it is not now past 3 degrees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the poles of the Equator: when this starre therefore shall come to touch the Pole there being no farther space left for it to go forward (which may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough come to passe within fiue or sixe hundreth yeares) it seemes that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there shall be a great change of <hi>things, and that this time is the period which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to nature.</hi> All these observations put together make vs presume that the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hierarchicall Empire must endure till the 2015 yeare of our Lorde. And that this
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:11387:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Empire being abolisht, the Pope yet shall remaine still, but without power &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, til that Iesus Christ shal destroy him by his last comming, which (as it should seeme by the evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces formerly cited) shal be some one, or two and twentie ages, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Saviours incarnation, who is God over all, blessed for ever.

               <p>Our adversaries goe more boldly to worke.

               <p>It remaines that we speake of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and religious service which the people shall giue to this Roman Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie:
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:11387:137"/>
The holy Ghost saith that all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that inhabit the earth shall adore it: Hee saith, <hi>All men,</hi> although there bee many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which never did acknowledge it: for the Scripture lightly speakes after this manner of great Empires, which hold a great number of people and many realms vnder their dominion: especially the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniel</hi> (to whose stile the holy ghost doth conform himselfe in the Apocalyps) in the 2. chap. 37. and 38 verses, speaking to <hi>Nabuchadnezar.</hi> O <hi>King thou art a king of kings, and in all places where the children of men dwell hee hath given them into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all</hi>; although hee had nothing at all in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and but little in Affricke. There is the like forme of speech in the 7. chapter, verse 23. So in speaking of the Pope wee vse to say that all the word is vnder him, although the Turke and Mores disclaime him: but by so saying wee meane that hee hath a large dominion. And our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries themselues doe not deny this, since they are of opinion that the heathenish Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Empire is meant in this prophecie, which yet notwithstanding, was never absolute co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander over one fourth part
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:11387:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the world: And I cannot imagin that there shall or can be such a Monarchie to which all the world (without excepting any place) shall be subiect. It is not three yeares and an halfe, no nor 3 ages that wil be sufficient for the obtaining of such a conquest. And there is not the man to bee found with a braine strong enough, to governe an Empire of this nature. The most politicke head in the world would in the governement of such a state be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted with the multiplicitie of businesse and fall into shivers.</p>
               <p>The dutiful respect therefore and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which the people must yeeld to this Roman Hierarchie, is called Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Not only because the head of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire shall cause himselfe to be adored, and make men kisse his feet, but also because of the strange kinde of soveraigntie that the body of this Hierarchie hath attained vnto.

in the yeare of our Lord 1073, to <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. who died in the yeare 1521. there are 448. yeares, during which time wee may say that the Papacie was at the height of her power and glory. Then Moncks were highly honoured, and the Popes Legates tooke their places before kings: then the Pope could command all the nobles, and all the men of armes, to come out of <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> or any other quarter of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trot from far through I knowe not howe many places to ioine their forces against the Sarrasins, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all <hi>Fraunce</hi> with widdowes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes: to him that chaunced to die in this warre, the Pope gaue a degree of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Paradice aboue the common sort of Saints. Then he which wore the badge of the crosse did cease to bee the kings sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and no Magistrate might touch him what offence soever hee had committed, because hee was the Popes souldier. At that time he made kings to be ierkt, and stroke of the Emperours crowne with his foot, and trod vpon his necke. His power now a daies is much diminished over that it was, and yet even at this time, he makes men come from farre and neere to seek at

Rome for the remission of their sins.

Nay which is more, they take vpon them to make God, and to create their creator with the repeating of certaine words; No mervaile therefore if they be so much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and respected.

               <p>These things are done (saith <hi>S.

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the holy Ghost by an admirable kinde of speech, and full of waight, cals the image of the first beast: because that although the <hi>Roman Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi> be a continuation, and succession of the ancient <hi>Roman Monarchie,</hi> and is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in this book by the same beast. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse, if we consider the point some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:11387:144"/>
better, and looke a little neerer into the matter, wee shall finde that it is rather an image and imitation of the ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,</hi> and a kinde of part that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vpon the seat of the ancient Empire. So the <hi>Roman Hierarchie</hi> is called the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the beast, both because it is built in imitation of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> as wee haue shewed aboue by 14 examples, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so because it is an imaginarie Empire, which doth consist only in the opinion of the subiects. Since the power therof hurts none but such as feare it. Its dispensations are worth as much, as we esteeme them to be worth; set light by the <hi>Popes</hi> thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts, and you shall sleepe the better. The price of his holy Graines, Agnus Dei, Beads, holy roses, and consecrated man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sists only in the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And his trading of late begins not to be so good as it was. Should a Prince or. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth but a hundreth years since haue done but a quarter of that which the <hi>Venetians</hi> haue within these few years, he (being bound hand and foot) had beene cast downe into hell and given to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell without all remission. The <hi>Croysade</hi> had beene preached against him in al pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:11387:145"/>
by vertue of which millions of men would haue assembled themselues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> to fall vpon the heretickes, that so they might gaine Paradice. But the King of great Brittaine, which hath stript the whore, and laid ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her mysteries, doth even to this day stand still vnexcommunicated. The gunpowder threatnings, are more dangerous then the Popes excommunications.</p>
               <p>Now albeit this Hierarchie be an image of the ancient Empire, yet Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith that this image doth liue and speake, and that this second beast which is the <hi>Pope,</hi> giues life vnto it, &amp; makes it speak; words wonderfully expresse, and significant. For the temporall power of the Popes Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall Empire would be nothing else but a dead image of the ancient Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, were it not that the spirituall power, did quicken the temporall, and giue strength vnto it. For it is his spirituall power, that accumulates such great store of goods, and riches vpon the temporall; which opens the peoples purses vnto him which forceth kings necks to bow, which makes his thunderbolts so dreadfull, which compels men to repaire from all
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:11387:145"/>
quarters to Rome, for to share of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall liberalities of his Holinesse. Yet he is ever a gainer hereby, and his spirituall power, serues for nothing but to vphold his temporal, as <hi>Guicciardine</hi> formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, affirmeth. It is the same spirituall power, that makes this image of the beast to speake, that is to say, which causeth that this Papall Empire (formed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the pourtraiture of the Roman Empire) should speake so big, giue lawes, pronounce decrees, decide questions of faith with a finall resolution, &amp; command all such to bee put to death as shall refuse to obey him: sounding the trumpet from an high place, thereby to incourage kings and people to exercise crueltie.</p>
               <p>This notwithstanding wee are to note one generall doctrine, that as they are not the carvers, nor founders, that make Idols but they which serue them, so also in this place, that the Pope which is the founder of this image, and principall promoter of this Hierarchie resembling the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, is not he for all that which hath made it to be an image, but the opinion of the people.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:11387:149"/>
no of the Bishop of Rome, we are not to look to the fashion of speech that is in vse with vs now adaies in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> but to the Greeks manner of speaking, seeing that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote in Greeke and to the Greekes; and into the nature of the thing.</p>
               <p>We are therefore to knowe that after the Empire was translated, the Cittie of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was called new Rome, and the Countrie about commonly called <hi>Thracia</hi> was called <hi>Romania</hi> likewise, and is so called to this day. But as for the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Italie, France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> which are reckoned vnder the Roman Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chat, the Greekes doe commonly call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Latin churches. When the Greeks see a french man or German in their country, they aske him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? Are you a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin? that is to say, as we vse to speake here with vs, are you of the Romish Church? So at the end of the Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> there is a long list of the names and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions of the Greeke Bishops, and in the second place the subscriptions of the Bishops of the Romish Church, amongst which there bee some French men, and Spaniardes, and Flemmings, and yet neverthelesse over the head of all
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:11387:150"/>
these subscriptions is written, <hi>Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones Latinorum patrum</hi>; So <hi>Nilus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Thessalonica</hi> wrote two books in greek one against Purgatory, the other against the Primacie of the Bishop of Rome, where he speakes (I know not how often) of the Latins, and of the Latin Church, without ever calling it the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church. Let this therefore bee taken for certaine, that then when the Bishop of Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Monarch, and erected an earthly Empire at Rome (for this is the time of which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth prophecie) the Roman Church was commonly called the Latin Church, and by a consequent, the head thereof was called Latin.</p>
               <p>As for the nature of the thing, there is no name that is more agreeing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; seeing that the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue only is received in Popish churches; all their service is said in <hi>Latin,</hi> the people are taught to pray in <hi>Latin</hi>; the Buls, and Indulgences, and letters of absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are all made in <hi>Latin,</hi> the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not allowed of but in <hi>Latin,</hi> and the <hi>Latin</hi> translation is preferred before the originall. And it is not long since that in the court of Parliament, and seates of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:11387:150"/>
Iustice, al the decrees, and sentences, acts, and publike instrumentes were set downe in <hi>Latin.</hi> To conclude, all that is there is <hi>Latin.</hi> I am verily perswaded that <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> speaking this had no reference to the bishop of Rome, for although he take vp <hi>Victor</hi> bishop of Rome somewhat short, for his sharpnesse &amp; violence, yet the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Rome in his time were so poore and feeble, that no man could possibly i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin that they shoulde ever haue come to this heigth. And indeed <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was rather led away by the coniecture of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther names, where the selfe same number is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. But the experience of succeeding ages hath refuted his other coniectures, &amp; ratified this, by which he hath opened a way vnto vs to know the truth, which he could not liue to know by experience, as we haue.</p>
               <p>But if besides this we shew that not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the number of 666. is found within this word <hi>Latin:</hi> but also that this very num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doth point out the time vnto vs exact<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in which the <hi>Pope</hi> became to be a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi> &amp; began to lift vp the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire into its former seat, then I hope that they which are most set against this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:11387:151"/>
will wonder at this interpretation, and by an amazed silence giue the glorie to God.</p>
               <p>We must vnderstand therfore, that the first persecution of Christians (raised vp by <hi>Nero</hi> in the last yeare of his raigne) fell out in the year of our Lord, 69. Fourteene yeares after, that is, in the yeare 83. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> began an other persecution, in which <hi>S.

It is true that <hi>Pepin,</hi> and <hi>Charles the Great</hi> his son, &amp; <hi>Lewis the Debonnayre</hi> his grand-child which gaue this donation, did yet reserue the right of soveraignty vnto themselues. But for all this the Pope did not spare to labour the best he could to make himselfe a monarch, and did even at that time lay his proiects for the compassing of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, taking vpon him to bestow the dignitie of a <hi>Patrician</hi> vpon <hi>Pepin,</hi> which none but the Emperours could conferre, &amp; presuming to set the Imperiall Crowne vpon the head of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> and that by a sleight, the said <hi>Charles</hi> the great not marking so much, and after being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him for so doing, and saying as he went out, that if hee had thought the Pope would haue vsed him so, he woulde not haue come into the Church, as <hi>Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> witnesseth in his history.

               <p n="5">5 And there was no guile found in their mouthes, nor no dissembling words, for they did appeare pure and innocent before the throne of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6 After that I saw a faithfull Minister of the Gospell rise out of the corruption of this papall kingdome, and passing

through the midst of the church to preach conformitie to the everlasting Gospel; &amp; God raised him vp to preach vnto the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that dwell vpon the earth, and to every nation.</p>

For besides that this number is a cubicall number co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of twelue times twelue, (God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intending to signifie that the number of his elect is perfect, and prescribed with great wisdome, and which may not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished) there is yet more in it, to wit, that God doth hereby shewe that this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber shall bee taken indifferently out of all people and nations: like as in the 7. chapt. this very number is taken equally out of the twelue tribes of Israel. For that by the 144000. all the Church of the Elect is here vnderstood, it appeares by that in the third verse, where it is said, that these were
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:11387:158"/>
bought from the earth.</p>
               <p>The foure beasts, which are mentioned by the way in the 3. verse, are described exactly in the 4. Chapter of this booke. And this vision is taken out of the first of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which makes mee to vnderstand these 4 beasts in the same sense as they are vnderstood by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> to wit, for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall vertues standing before the thron of God: Wherefore <hi>Ezekiel</hi> giues them wings also which signifie their readinesse to ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y. And they haue diverse faces for to shew the diversitie of their vertues. The one hath the face of a Lyon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for to shewe their courage, the other of an oxe, for to shew their strength, the other the face of a man, for to shew their wisdome, the other resembleth and eagle, which witnesseth their speech, and readinesse.</p>
               <p>The 24 beasts are the twelue Patriarks of the old Testament, and the twelue of the newe, which are the 12 Apostles, by whom we are to vnderstand al the church of the glorified Saints. Which we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily knowe by the 9 verse of the fift chapt. where these 24 Elders do praise the Lamb because he redeemed them vnto God by his blood, out of every kindred, &amp; people
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:11387:159"/>
and tongue, and nation. Now if the 24 El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders doe represent the whole Church of the glorified Saints, and speake in their name, by the like reason is it also agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that these 4 beastes should represent the whole companie of Angelicall spirits.</p>
               <p>The praises wherewith they did extoll God for revealing the mysteries of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, cannot be vnderstood by flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sensuall men, to whome the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell seemeth folly, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> saith to <hi>Peter.</hi> Mat. 16. <hi>Flesh and blood hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed this vnto thee, but my father which is in heaven.</hi> Of these 144000. which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the whole company of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith that <hi>they are not defiled with women, for they are virgins.</hi> Doubtles a continent, and chast virginitie both of body &amp; mind is a great perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: it keeps out all wicked thoughts from entrance; it frees the soule from care, and giues much libertie to the service of God. Yet for all this I cannot bee perswaded that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth here speake of bodily virginity, or of continuing in a single state of life: For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we should exclude the Prophets, and the Apostles out of the number of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full which follow the Lambe, and which
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:11387:159"/>
were redeemed from amongst the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth. This makes mee thinke that as Idolatrie is infinite times called fornication, &amp; adulterie in holy scripture, so this chastitie and virginitie here spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of is nothing else but an abstaining from the service of Idols, which are as it were the Concubines with whome Idolatours doe commit fornication, and breake the spirituall bond with which they had tied themselues vnto Christ.</p>
               <p>They which are thus chaste and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, are by the iudgement of the spirit of God in the fift verse pronounced to bee without spot; I confesse that in the most holy whilst they are in this flesh there is ever some infirmity remaining, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of sin abiding. <hi>David</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth himselfe to be a sinner, <hi>Psa.</hi> 51. <hi>&amp;</hi> 130. <hi>&amp;</hi> 143. and his life confirmes it.

               <p>In the 6.8. and 9. verses the Angels sent for to preach the gospel, are Ministers &amp; Pastours of the Church. For God sendeth not his Angels to preach in the church but his Ministers, which are often called Angels, in the second and third Chapters of this very booke. Which is also vsuall in the old Testament; especially in the 5. of <hi>Ecclesiastes, v.</hi> 6. And the Prophet <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi> seemes to haue taken his name from this. For <hi>Malachie</hi> signifies <hi>The Angell of the Lord.</hi>

               <p>From the 6. verse, to the end of the cha. the spirit of God doth reveale an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble history, and discovers many secrets vnto vs, for hee describeth at large what the condition of the poore Church shall
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:11387:160"/>
be vnder the government of <hi>Poperie,</hi> till the time that the day of iudgment shal be at hand. From the 6. verse to the 13. he tels of 3.

The rest of the chapter is spent in describing the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which God inflicteth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men because they did not obey their preaching, and because they did conspire against God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he doth produce 3. Angels which at diverse times did preach the gospell in the midst of Papistry, so doth he send 3. Angels to execute Gods iudgementes, which at severall times doe punish the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of men. And as the third Angell that preached the gospell, did preach it with more perspicuitie, and greater ferve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie then the two former, so the third An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell sent to revenge the hardnesse of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s harts, doth exercise more dreadful iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and doth mow down men as eares of corne, and tread on them like grapes in the wine presse.</p>

                     <hi>1</hi> In the first yeare of Belshazzar king of Babell Daniel saw a dreame, and there were visions in his head, vpon his bed: then he wrote the dreame, &amp; declared the summe of the matter.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2</hi> Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and behold the <hi>4</hi> windes of heaven stroue vpon the great sea.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3</hi> And <hi>4</hi> great beasts came vp from the sea one divers from an other.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4</hi> The <hi>1</hi> was a Lyon and had Eagles wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were pluckt off, &amp; it was lifted vp from the earth and set vpon his feete as a man, and a mans heart was given him.</p>

                     <hi>5</hi> And behold, another beast which was the second, was like a Beare, and stoode vpon the one side: and hee had three tuskes in his mouth amongst his teeth, and they said thus vnto him, Arise and devoure much flesh.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6</hi> After this I beheld, &amp; lo there was an other like a Leopard, which had vpon his backe <hi>4</hi> wings of a fowle: the beast had also <hi>4</hi> heads and dominion was given him.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7</hi> After this I saw in the visions by night, and behold the fourth beast was feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and terrible, and very strong. It had great iron teeth, it devoured, and brake in peeces, and stamped the residue vnder his feet: &amp; it was vnlike to the beasts that were before it, for it had <hi>10</hi> hornes.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8</hi> As I considered the hornes, behold there came vp amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another little horn, before whom there were <hi>3</hi> of the first horns pluckt away: and behold in his throne there were eies like the eies of man, and a mouth speaking presumptuous things.</p>
                  <p>I beheld till the thrones were set vp, and the ancient of daies did sit, whose garment was as white as snowe, and the haire of his head like the pure wooll: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheeles like burning fire.</p>

                  <p n="11">
                     <hi>11</hi> Then I beheld, because of the voice of the presumptuous words which the horne spake: I beheld even till the beast was slaine, and his body destroyed, and giuen to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <hi>12</hi> As concerning the other beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their liues were prolonged for a certaine time and season.</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <hi>13</hi> As I beheld the visions by night, behold one like the sonne of man came in the clowdes of heaven, and approached vnto the ancient of daies, and they brought him before him.</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <hi>14</hi> And he gaue him dominion &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and a kingdome: that all people, nations and languages should serue him: his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an everlasting dominion, which shall ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver be taken away, and his kingdome shall never be destroyed.</p>
                  <p n="15">
                     <hi>15</hi> I Daniel was troubled in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of mine head made me afraid.</p>

                  <p n="19">
                     <hi>19</hi> After this I would knowe the truth of the fourth beast, which was so vnlike to al the others, very fearefull, whose teeth were of yron, and his nayles of brasse: which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, brake in peeces, and stamped the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue vnder his feet.</p>
                  <p n="20">

               <head>The Exposition.</head>
               <p n="1">1 In the first yeare of Belshazzar king
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:11387:196"/>
of Babel Daniel saw a dreame, and lying vpon his bed, had his head troubled with visions, the matter of which dreame hee did afterward commit to writing.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And behold here what hee hath written of it. I had a vision by night, and it seemed vnto mee that the windes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the foure quarters of the world blew vpon the sea, that is to say, that the people and nations (whom the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth often compare to the sea) had many divers and contrary tumults to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And out of the midst of these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and nations came fowre great beastes of different shapes, figuring 4 great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Empires, which should reigne in the world.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The first beast which did represent the first Empire, to wit, that of Babylon, was like vnto a Lyon, to note his noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and valour, and had the wings of an Eagle, to note the speedy atchieuements of his conquests. And I beheld till this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue vigour was taken from him, and that being spoiled of his bestiall fiercenesse, he learned the lesson of obedience, and was taught to abstaine from blood, that so hee
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:11387:197"/>
might liue with humanitie like a man, and not with crueltie like a beast.</p>
               <p n="5">5 After this Empire succeeded the Empire of Persia, figured by a bear, which lay along vpon one side, either because his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quests did stretch from east to west, or else because he was like a beare resting himselfe, which never lyeth farre of from the prey which hee hath seized vpon. And this beare amongst many other teeth had 3 great teeth or tuskes, signifying that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many other kingdoms which this Empire should possesse, hee should haue 3 great and mightie kingdoms: that of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, that of Media, &amp; that of Babylon. And God being incensed against men sent out this beare to make them dye.</p>
               <p n="6">6 After the fall of this Empire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a third Empire rose vp, to wit, that of the Macedonians, figured by a Leopard, because of its crueltie, subtiltie, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, represented by the 4 wings. And this Empire was forthwith divided into foure kingdoms, which are the kingdoms of the Seleucidae in Asia maior, the kingdome of Antigonus in Asia minor, the kingdome of the Ptolomies in Egypt, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Greece, and God gaue vnto this
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:11387:197"/>
Empire to raigne over the earth.</p>
               <p n="7">7 After this Empire there arose ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Empire figured by a most dreadful &amp; mightie strong beast. It had mighty king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and provinces vnder it; it did scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ruinate, tyrannizing over those whom it did not slay. And this Empire was differing in force and power from the Empires that went before, and had 10 parts and principall provinces vnder it, &amp; as it fell to decay, ten kingdomes also did arise out of the division thereof.</p>
               <p n="8">8 As I stood wondring at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this Empire from which 10 king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes did arise, behold a Monarch grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a little horne amidst the other, that sprang vp from betweene these king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, which for his share did possesse such a portion of this Roman Empire, as there is of 3 to 10, that is to say, well neer the third part, and had the eies of humane vnderstanding, having contrived the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his kingdome by wonderfull po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, and spoke prowdly and arrogantly, boasting that he could not erre, that hee was the supreme iudge in matters of faith and religion, that he was a vice-God, and God vpon earth, King of kings, the head
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:11387:198"/>
and spowse of the Church, his holynesse, and a disposer of kingdomes.</p>
               <p n="9">9 I considered with my selfe howe this Bishop did advance himselfe, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, vntill the thrones mounted vpon wheeles, were set in their proper places, that is to say, vntill the day of iudgement were well onward, and hard at hand, and the Lord God sat down vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these thrones who is called the Ancient of daies, because he is from before all time, &amp; from before all antiquitie, and hee was cloathed with the light, and had a head all hoary gray, to signifie his age, his throne was like the flame, and the wheeles of his throne were as burning fire.</p>
               <p n="10">10 His iudgments like a fiery stream went from before his presence. An infinite number of Angels stood before him, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his pleasure. So he sate him downe to iudge the world: and that hee might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with equity, all his bookes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.

               <p>Albeit this exposition doe explaine it selfe, and be full of perspicuitie: yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue all difficulties, I will cleere 6. points in which the whole proofe of our exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth consist, and will shew.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That the Roman Empire falling to decay in the West, and the East, was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into parts or kingdomes, which <hi>Dan.</hi> v.7. and 24. saith are vnderstood by the 10 hornes of the fourth beast. II. That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome doth possesse well neer the third part of the ancient Roman Empire. III. That the Bishop of Rome doth cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge times and the law. IV. What the meaning of a time, times, and halfe a time is, during which tearme, the Saints shall bee made slaues, and the church kept in bondage. V. What this Empire &amp; dominion is that is giuen to the Saints. VI. That vpon good reason by the fourth beast we vnderstand the Roman Empire, and by the little horn the sonne of perdition, which is called An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichrist
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:11387:201"/>
by the Ancient, as likewise by our aduersaries.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The diuision of the ancient Empire into tenne partes is most euident. Danie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To find the accomplishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therefore of this prophecy, we are to look whether a little before the Pope became an earthly Monarch (for Daniel saith that these hornes here doe signifie Realmes) the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire were not diuided into tenne Realmes. We haue shewed already that in the yeare 755 the Pope began to lay the foundation of his earthly Empire, and of a Bishop to become a Monarch. Nowe a little before, (that is to say in the seauenth age) the Roman Empire was diuided into 10 peeces or kingdomes. 1, There was the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch, which held France &amp; a part of Germanie. 2. The kingdome of the English Saxons, which held great Brit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain. 3 The kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of the Visigots which held Spaine. 4. The kingdome of the Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards in Italie. 5. The kingdome of the Sclavonians which held Illyria, and the countries thereabout<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. The kingdome of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:11387:201"/>
the Huns and the Avarians in Hungarie &amp; Austrich. 7. The kingdome of the Bulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians reigning in Bulgaria and Seruia, &amp;c. 8. The kingdome of the Sarasens of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus that held Syria, and reigned in the East. 9. The kingdome of the Sarasens of Barbarie that reigned in Affricke, which about this very age did inuade Spaine and passe into Fraunce. 10. To which if yee ad that which as yet was held in possession by the Emperour of Constantinople, yee shall find 10 Realmes, euery one posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his part of the ancient Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: and this, a little before that this little horne shewed himselfe, that is to say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope began to take his place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Princes, and to lay the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Roman Monarchie.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That the portion of the Roman Empire, which the Pope hath vnder him, hath such a proportion in respect of the whole extent of the Empire, as there is of three to ten, that is to say, that hee doth possesse little lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the third part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: this is easily proued to bee true, if it please any to take but a map, and a payre of compasses, or else only to measure the countries of the Empire with his eies. The
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:11387:202"/>
Pope did never possesse any thing, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any dominion over Greece, Asia, Syria, Arabia, Egypt, or Affrick. For as for the incursions of our French into Syria, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt and Constantinople, they were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which lasted but for a small time, and did rather shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plant the Popes dominion in the East. Now all these countries being put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make vp a little more then two thirds of the Roman Empire, the rest hath beene vnder the Pope, wherein hee hath planted his Monarchie: wherevnto moreouer hee hath added certaine prouinces that were never subiect to the Ancient Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as Polonie, the north part of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Denmarck, and Swethland, and nowe of late a part of the Indies. But Daniel lookt not to these adiunctions, for hee speakes only of the diuision of the Roman Empire.</p>
               <p n="3">3 As for the changing of times, and the law, it is the Pope that takes vpon him to make the yeares shorter or longer. It is not long since that Gregorie the 13 did contract the yeare by 10 daies: it is the Pope that makes holy daies of common daies, which can if it please him, transport
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:11387:202"/>
the month of Iuly into Ianuarie; taking the authoritie vpon him of the ancient priests of Rome instituted by Numa, who proclaimed the holy daies, and thrust in odde days into the yeare at their pleasure. It were a needlesse labour for me to shewe more particularly howe hee changeth the law, seeing that my whole second booke is spent in declaring howe the Pope doth oppose himselfe against the word of God. Seeing also that hee boasteth that hee can dispense with oathes and vowes made to God, that he can dissolue compleat mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, although they bee not violated by adulterie: that hee can dispense with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for obaying their parents in honest things, and with subiects for being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their Prince. That he can giue a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaue to marry his own neece contrary to the commandement of God. That hee can keepe Princes from reading the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, contrary to an expresse commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is giuen them in the 17 of <hi>Deut.</hi> v. 18. Whereupon his Doctours also say and write in their glosses vpon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Church of Rome, and in their bookes of controuersies, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dispense against the Apostle, and against
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:11387:203"/>
the old Testament. And that hee can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with the commandement of the Lord wherein he saith, <hi>Doe workes worthy of repentance</hi>: as hee doth indeed dispense with it by his Indulgences.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Next followes the exposition of these words, <hi>A time, times, &amp; halfe a time,</hi> which is the tearme during which, Daniel saith, the Saints shall be kept in bondage, and the church held captiue. These words at the first seeme strange, but being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with other places where there is mention made of the continuance of the dominion of Antichrist, are easie to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. We haue seene in the 13 Chapt. of the Apocalyps, v. 5. that the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire after the healing of its wound by the Papacie, must continue 42 months, which make 3 yeares and a halfe, that is to say, 1260 mysticall daies, which amount to so many yeares, according to the stile of the Scripture: as we haue shewed by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the exposition of the said pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the Apocalyps. Now 3 yeares and a halfe, are one yeare, two yeares, &amp; halfe an yeare, so that the spirit of God by an admirable correspondency of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies doth say the same thing in diuers
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:11387:203"/>
words, and doth tell vs before hand that the kingdome of Antichrist and the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the Church vnder his dominion must continue 1260 yeares, which as wee haue shewed by vndoubted proofes, must begin in the yeare of our Lord, 755.</p>
               <p n="5">5 As concerning the kingdome, and dominion over all things which God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to his Saints, and the faithfull, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they seeme servants and strangers in this world, Daniel herein speakes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the stile of the Scripture, which calleth them Kings, Apoc. 1. v. 6. &amp; 5. v. 10 <hi>He hath made vs kings and priests vnto God his father.</hi> And in the 1. Epistle of <hi>S. Peter</hi> Chap. 2. the faithfull are called <hi>a Royall Priesthood.</hi> Now they are kings, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they raigne already in Christ, which is one body with vs, so that the kingdome which he now possesseth ouer all things is ours: as also because that in the last day of iudgement, the faithfull shall iudge the world, and the Angels; as the Apostle <hi>S. Paule</hi> saith in the 1. to the Corinth. Ch. 6. That is to say, that they shall bee the asses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the sonne of God, and approuers of the iudgment which he shall pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce against the wicked, and against the divels.
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:11387:204"/>
As also because that in the glory to come after the last day, they shal be aboue those which reigned over them, and shall bee kings whilst the mightie ones of this world, which were enimies to the church, shall be made slaues.</p>
               <p n="6">6 It remaines that we see, whether they that hold that there is no mention at all made in this Chap. of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, nor of Antichrist, but only of the kingdome of the Seleucidae: and of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus Epiphanes, can be excused.</p>
               <p>The ancient Doctors hold with vs, that in this chapter Antichrist is spoken of, as Hierome, and Theodoret vpon this place, S. Cyprian in his booke of exhortation to martyrdome. S. Austin in the 23. chap. 20. booke of the citie of God. And our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries are of the same opinion. They of the Ancient which by a little horne vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Antiochus Epiphanes, doe withall vnderstand Antichrist by the same horne, for they hold that Antiochus was a figure of Antichrist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that which is said of the one, agrees also to the other.</p>
               <p>As for mine owne part I finde this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie so cleere, that it is hard to doubt of the meaning; and indeed amongst all the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:11387:204"/>
chapters of holy scripture, this did ever seeme excellent vnto me, and I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver satisfy my selfe with admiring it. What deepnesse of wisdome there is in it! what cleerenesse of Prophecies! how many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable circumstances! what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent accord with the reuelation of <hi>S. Iohn</hi>! yee shall find the same stile in both places in the same matter. Whosoever shall take this prophecie from Christians to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate it vnto the Iewes only, goes about as it seemes to mee, to stop vp a great win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, at which God doth let in his light vnto vs, and to take away no small stay &amp; comfort from our faith: besides that they doe shut their eies of set purpose, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test against experience. Yet let vs heare what they alleage.</p>
               <p>They lay for a foundation, that the 2. chap. and the 7. speake both of one and the same thing, and that the vision of the foure beastes hath the same signification with the image that had his head of gold, his breast of siluer, his belly &amp; his thighes of brasse, his legs part of yron and part of clay. That is to say, that both of these visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe signifie foure Monarchies, vnder which the Iewish Church was held in cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiuitie;
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:11387:205"/>
I doe not deny but that the 3 first Monarchies are the same, in the 2. and 7. chap. But the fourth Empire here called the fourth beast, is altogether divers from the feet of the image in the second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="1">1 For this fourth beast is described here as more able and strong then the 3. former, and his lookes are said to be more stout then his fellowes, <hi>v.</hi> 20. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the fourth kingdome in the 2. chapt. is made to be farre weaker then the other. For <hi>Daniel</hi> in the 42. verse saith, <hi>that it shall be partly strong, and partly broken,</hi> and makes it so farre inferiour to the former monarchies, as yron &amp; clay are in respect of gold and silver.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Likewise when <hi>Daniel</hi> saith that the third Monarchy (which is that of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians) had 4 heads, who sees not that hereby he vnderstands, that the Empire should be divided into 4 kingdomes? As <hi>Daniel</hi> himselfe also doth expounde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the 8. chapt. v. 22. The kingdome of the Seleucidae being one of the 4 king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes into which the Empire of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> is divided, what probability is there that in the verse following hee shoulde
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:11387:205"/>
make these very Seleucidae a diverse beast, which but in the verse going before, hee had made to bee one of the heades of the beast? To salue the matter, they tell vs of diuers confusions within the kingdome of <hi>Aridaeus, Antipater,</hi> and <hi>Cassander,</hi> where they seeke for 4 kings opposing one an other at the same time, but cannot finde them; and say they should, yet is it likely that <hi>Daniel</hi> should rather speake of the diuisions that fell out in a little corner of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Empire, then of those that fell out in the whole Empire, being that these were the greater of the two without all comparison? Or who will thinke that <hi>Daniel</hi> in this place doth speake onlie of the diuisions of the country of Macedon, which had nothing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the Iewes, and omit those of Syria where the church dwelt?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Nor are they lesse troubled, if not more, to finde 10 Seleucidian kings, after whom they will haue <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> to rise. For they are faine to thrust in the Ptolomies to make vp this number, which did invade or ouerrun Syria. But <hi>Daniel</hi> saith that these 10 kings shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise out of the decayed Empire, and it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:11387:206"/>
be said that the Ptolomies did rise out of the kingdome of the Seleucidae, seeing that they did rise against the Seleucidae. They speake therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if I shoulde saie, that <hi>Brennus</hi> did rise out of the kingdome of <hi>Romulus,</hi> or the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> whereas he did rise vp against their state, &amp; poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And last of all, should we grant them that which they would haue, yet can they not make vp their number. For they make this <hi>Antiochus</hi> to bee the tenth of these kings, contrary to the expresse words of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which saith that this little horne shall rise vp after the ten kings: he is none of the ten therefore.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And they are as much out in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word, <hi>kings,</hi> which through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this whole chapt. doth not signifie the person of kings, but the kingdomes, or Monarchies. As it appeareth by the 17. verse in these words, the 4 beasts are foure kings, where they themselues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse that by the word kings, we are to vnderstande Monarchies.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Besides, I know not how they can finde that fulfilled in <hi>Antiochus,</hi> which <hi>Daniel</hi> saith in the 22. verse, to wit, That he shall subdue 3 kings; for histories re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:11387:206"/>
no such thing of this man.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Herevnto adde that, if (as they would haue it) the third beast doe signifie the Empire of <hi>Alexander</hi> only, &amp; not that of the Seleucidae; too, then this Empire must continue but 6. yeares, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly opposit to that which <hi>Daniel</hi> saith verse 12. <hi>That the liues of these beasts were prolongued, for a certaine time and season.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 Nor can it be said, with what vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence they wrest the words of the 13 ver. where Iesus Christ is described comming in the clowdes of heauen. They would haue this not to be spoke of his comming at the last day, but would haue it to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of his incarnation, when neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse it cannot be said without absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, that he came down from heauen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the clowdes.</p>
               <p n="8">8 But to what ende shoulde <hi>Daniel</hi> speake so often of the glorification of the Saints, and of their heauenly kingdome, if hee spake but only of the humiliation of Iesus Christ, and not of the last iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p n="9">9 The space also of three yeares and an halfe, exprest by a time, two times, and halfe a time, can not agree to <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:11387:207"/>
For in the 8. chapt. ver. 14. where this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> is manifestly spoken off, it is saide that hee shall wast the Sanctuarie for the space of <hi>two thousand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> three hundreth mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings &amp; evenings,</hi> which amount to more then 6 yeares. And note that these words, mornings, &amp; euenings, are purposely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to shew that he speaketh of common and ordinarie daies, and to distinguish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the three mysticall yeares, and an halfe, spoken of in this chapt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. On the other side all their obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s against this explication, aime at this chief<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, to shew that the Roman Empire is not spoken off in the 2. chap. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which we do not deny; but this lets not but that it may be spoken off in this chapt.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And, to say truth, they presuppose without reason that <hi>Daniel</hi> speakes this here but only for the Church of the Iews. For what inconvenience is there if we say that God did reueale something to his prophet concerning the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church? Seeing that in the 12 chapt. he doth appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly prophecie of the resurrection, and euerlasting life; And do not they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themselues, being that they woulde haue <hi>Daniel</hi> in the 6. verse speake of the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:11387:207"/>
confusions that hapned in Macedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where the Iewes had no interest, and which did not concerne them at all?</p>
               <p n="12">12 Last of all I say, that the vision mentioned in the 2. chapt. had beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in vaine in the 7. if there were no diuersitie in them, and if the second appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of the same vision did not teach vs some thing that was not contained in the former.</p>

               <p>The three first chapt. of this book, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine nothing, but familiar instructions, with certaine representations of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of God and Iesus Christ, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny predictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the sixth chap. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to foretell of future euents, and to draw out his propheticall revelations, in which he follows the order of the time, beginning at the nativitie of Iesus Christ, &amp; holding on till the approaching of the last iudgement, which is spoken of at the end of this 11. chapt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:11387:212"/>All this time is first of all diuided into the opening of the 7. seales, which are as so many reuelations of the hidden counsel of God a little after into the 7. soundings of the trumpets, which signifie seauen se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall executions of the iudgementes of God vpon the earth, which are also signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the 7. viols of Gods wrath thrown vpon men.</p>
               <p>How many years euery seale must last, &amp; how many, euery trumpet, this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther question; and which doth not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine directly to the See of Rome. Only wee are to note, that the two witnesses must be slaine by the beast vnder the sixt trumpet, and afterward be brought to life againe by the power of God, and at last be called from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to come vp thither, &amp; that after this the 7 trumpet must sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, as it appeares by the 13. verse of the ninth chapter, &amp; by the 15 verse of the 11 chap. Whence it is manifest that vnto vs (which liue now vnder the sixt trumpet) as wee will demonstrate, one part of these things is accomplisht: but that the whole is not yet accomplisht. Which is the cause of the obscurity of this prophecie, that troubled many mens heads, whilst they sought for
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:11387:212"/>
the fulfilling of thinges to come in ages past.</p>
               <p>And this doth not only shew me a waie to the cleering of this prophecie, but also giues me a reason why I should expounde this chapt. out of his order, and put it last. For whosoeuer shall read the Revelation diligently, shal finde that from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the sixth chapter to the end of the eleauenth, <hi>S. Iohn</hi> doth follow a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al course of prophetical history from time to time, vntill the day of iudgement. But that the 12. chapt. he doth begin the same historie againe after another fashion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the birth of our Sauiour, and following the historie of the church euen to the end of the booke, which hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with the last iudgement, and with the heauenly glory, of the church of God. Wherefore we could not choose but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this 12 chapt. and those which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, before the 11. chapt. that wee might follow the order of the time. Moreouer there being but one part of this chapt. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht, reason bids that we should end with that which is not as yet come to passe; But as for that which is come to passe, the exposition which I giue of it,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:11387:213"/>
seemes in my opinion, to be easie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</p>
               <p>The meting of the holy Citie, which is the Church, seemes to be taken out of the 40. chap. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where by a reed, or cane to measure, the holy Ghost giues <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel</hi> to vnderstand, that he would learn him an exact knowledge of his Church. In the 2. verse, in saying that the Court which is out of the Temple, is giuen to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, he doth glaunce at the mysticall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the building of the Tabernacle, which had three parts. 1, The court where the people stood. 2. The holy place, into which the Levits and priests entred, where the candlesticke was, the shew bread, and the altar of perfumes. 3. The Sanctuarie where the Arke surnamed the Lord stood, whither none might enter but the high Priests: The way to goe into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place was through the Court, and into the Sanctuarie through the holy place. The Court represented the nations which are out of the Church. The holy place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the Church, where the word of God doth illighten and nourish vs, and where the benefit of Iesus Christ is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall perfume before God. The Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:11387:213"/>
figured heauen, where our high Priest is gon in alone by his own power, to bring vs thither also. So the Court was a figure of the state of nature, the holy place of the state of grace, the Sanctuarie of the state of glory. And none euer entred into the second but through the first, nor into the last but through the second. Vpon good reason therefore is it that the Court here is assigned vnto the nations, which do not knowe God, seeing that it was out of the holy place, which was a figure of the church of God. And this is farther confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the renting of the vaile, (which did divide the holy place from the Court) at the death of our Sauior, whereby there was an open passage laid open, for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were strangers from his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to enter into the Church.</p>
               <p>Now here by the nations, not only the heathen are to be vnderstood, but all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are enimies to the church of God. The terme of time, for which they must oppresse the church of God, is 42 months which make 3 yeares and a halfe, which amount to 1260 yeares, to take a day for a yeare: as wee haue shewed in the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fifth verse of the 13. chapter.
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:11387:214"/>
This is the time that is allotted to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Empire to trample vpon the Church of God.</p>
               <p>As for the two witnesses, I take it that they signifie nothing else but a fewe witnesses, but yet sufficient enough to beare witnesse of the truth: whether it bee that the holy scripture doth vse these words of two or three, insteed of saying, very few; as when Christ doth promise, that where there shall be <hi>two or three</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in his name, he will be in the midst of them: and in the 32. of <hi>Deut.</hi> v. 30. <hi>two shall put ten thousand to flight,</hi> that is to say, a small number shall make a great multitude to turne their backs: and there is the like fashion of speech to bee found in the 17 of <hi>Esay,</hi> verse 6. Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that in the matter of witnesses, the number of two is put downe in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as sufficient, according as Christ saith that <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word is confirmed.</hi> Or whether it be, that what number soeuer there bee of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, yet all their testimonies being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the two testaments, which are the true witnesses of the will of God, it is not without good reason, that their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:11387:214"/>
is reduced to the number of two, to the ende that they should not looke within the authoritie of men, nor seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter customes for a third testimonie. For it is not likely that God should haue but 2 faithfull pastours to oppose themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Empire of the sonne of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which shall be so powerfull, and last for so many ages. Now, as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> said, that the oppression of the Church must conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue 42 moneths, which are three yeares &amp; a halfe, so likewise doth hee say that the faithfull witnesses shal preach 1260 daies which make vp also three yeares &amp; a halfe that is to say, that the dominion of the son of perdition shall neuer be without being contradicted by some fewe faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, and that the gouernement of the one, and the reluctancy of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are of the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance. We haue <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>These two witnesses are compared to two oliue trees, and to two Candlesticks: in imitation of the vision that appeared to Zachary chapt. 4. who saw a Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke

He opposeth the great Cittie, to the holy Citty, which is the Church of God, of which he speakes in the seconde verse, to shew that the false church, which is at enmitie with God, shal be very great in respect of the church of God. For that by this word, city, we are not to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d one only towne, it appeares by this, that

it is not only called Sodome, but Egypt also which is the name of a great Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try.

               <p>Now it is not without cause, that the Popish church is called Sodome, seeing that in the places where Papistrie is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht without Contradiction, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at Rome, whence al this great body of the Romish church doth depend, this vice is familiar, and hath euer beene so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the time of the <note place="margin">

this vnnaturall and preposterous loue, or if it fell out so by chance, it hits so happily that it may seeme to haue beene intended purposely.

Since therefore he shal raigne 1260 yeares, as we haue shewed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the 5. verse of the 13 Chapter, and this 11 chap. doth confirme it, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that the Roman Hierarchie shall persecute the faithfull 630 yeares. Now I doe not find that the Church of Rome did begin to persecute, and to vse crueltie in generall against all that did withstand her doctrine, till Berengers time, whom Pope Nicolas the 2. compelled to recant by force, in the yeare 1059. And euer since the Popes haue persecuted such as haue maintained the same doctrine.

               <p>At this time the people shall be much moued, for this is signified by the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. In this commotion, affrightment, &amp; dissention of the people, the tenth part of the men of the Church of Rome shall be slaine, which number is exprest by the number of 7000, according to a fashion of speech vsuall in Scripture, which by 7000 men vnderstands a greater number then can be conceaued, as when <hi>Elias</hi> thought that he had beene the only faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man that was left in Israel, God told him that he had 7000 left yet, <hi>which never bowed the knee to Baal,</hi> that is to say, a greater number then he could imagin.

               <p>By all that which hath beene formerly said, it appeares that we at this time liue in the last half day of these three last daies and a halfe of persecution, which is the time also that goes next to the sound of the last trumpet, that is spoken of in the 15 verse, that is to say, the seaventh &amp; last execution of Gods iudgementes, which

               <p>This seemes to me to haue fallen out, by the secret counsell of the wisdome of God. For as the world is diuided into 3. ages, to wit, into the time before the law, into the time vnder the law, and into the time vnder the gospell, so it pleased God that in every one of these ages there should one man be taken vp to heauen in his body, <hi>Enoch</hi> before the law, <hi>Elias</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> vnder the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; to the end that the souls of the Saints that liued either before the law, or vnder the law, or vnder the gospell, and are now in heauen, should haue a man in that age of theirs that should be an image of the fu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture estate after the day of iudgement, and a pledge of the resurrection of the bodie. For euen as <hi>Moyses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> did appeare vnto Iesus Christ on the mountaine, for to signifie that the law and the gospell gaue testimony vnto him (as the King hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent well noted in his booke) so I am perswaded that these 3 were as so manie witnesses of the resurrection vnto the Saints that liued before the law, vnder the law, and vnder the gospell.</p>

Iesus Christ therefore in this place meanes to tell <hi>Nicodemus</hi> only thus much, that none can bring vs the knowledge of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, but only the sonne of man that came downe from heauen.

And hee shall turne the harts of the fathers to the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the harts of the children to their fathers, least I come &amp; smite the earth with cursing.</hi> To this the King answeres that there is no better interpreter of <hi>Malachies</hi> wordes then Iesus Christ himselfe, who doth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vs that this <hi>Elias</hi> promised by <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi> is <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi> If (saith he) <hi>yee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue my saying, this is that Elias which was to come, Mat.</hi> 11.14. And yet more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the 17. chapt. he hauing said that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> was already come, and that they did not know him; <hi>S. Matthew</hi> addes that his disciples vnderstood him to speak of <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi> Iesus Christ indeed had saide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Elias must come,</hi> speaking in this (as the King hath well noted) according to the common opinion, but to the ende that this might not be vnderstood of any other but <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> he annexeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, <hi>But I say vnto you that Elias is already come, &amp; they haue not knowne him.</hi> Good cause therefore had his Maiestie to accuse <hi>Bellarmine</hi> of falshood, for allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging these words of Christ, <hi>Elias shal come</hi>
                  <pb n="423" facs="tcp:11387:223"/>
without alleaging the words that follow, <hi>But I say vnto you that Elias is already come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here the point of the question is, whether <hi>Malachie</hi> and the Apostles ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting to Christ that <hi>Elias</hi> must come, do speake of an <hi>Elias</hi> that must goe before the first, or second comming of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. As for <hi>Malachie</hi> hee begins this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course from the beginning of the 3 chapt. in these words. <hi>Behold I goe hence to send my messenger, and hee shall prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom yee seeke shall speedily come to his Temple.</hi> Wordes that cannot agree to the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, when hee shall neede no preparing of his way, &amp; the earth shall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be his temple no more. This appeares also out of the 7. chapt. where <hi>Malachie</hi> saith that this <hi>Elias shal turne the hearts of the fathers vnto the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which are the very words of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.17.</note> Angell vnto <hi>Zachary</hi> declaring the office of his sonne. To the same purpose also serue these words, <hi>For feare least I come and smite the earth.</hi> For how can it be said that these two witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses shall come for to hinder the comming of Christ to iudgement, and to keepe him
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:11387:224"/>
from smiting the earth? Seeing that his comming is inevitable, and that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full shall long for it? &amp; pray that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God may come, saying with <hi>S. Iohn</hi> Apoc. 22.20. <hi>Even so, come Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the 17. chapt. of <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> it is manifest that the second co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Christ is not meant in that place, but onlie the first. For the Apostles either ravisht with the glory of his transfiguration, or rather perswaded by the many powerfull mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Iesus Christ, to beleeue that hee was the Messias, neverthelesse found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnable to solue the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Scribes, which did proue that Christ was not the Messias by this argument, because that <hi>Elias</hi> was not yet come. Doubtlesse these Scribes did not contest about the day of iudgement, but about the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of the promised Messias, which (as they thought) was not yet come.</p>
               <p>To this they oppose the words of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachie,</hi> which calleth this day <hi>a great and fearefull day</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which seemes ill befitting the gentlenesse, and humilitie of Christs first comming. His Maiesties answer is that the day of the Lords passion was full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:11387:224"/>
and astonishment. The sun was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the vaile of the Temple was rent, the earth trembled, the stones were cloven, the monuments were opened, the dead were raised. Or wee may say that the first comming of the Messias although it were in humilitie, was yet for all that very fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For hee was sent to bee a stumbling blocke vnto many, and drew a totall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction vpon the Iewes.

               <p>In one thing they cannot choose but be much cumbred, to wit, in this, when they say that these two witnesses shall bee sent to fight with Antichrist for the space of three yeares and an halfe, at the ende of which, Antichrist shall slay them. By this reckoning Antichrist must be in the world before them, and stay in the world after them, yea &amp; be in the heigth of his stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth after he hath slaine them, seeing that there by he shall become victorious.

that Antichrist shall continue but 3 yeares and a halfe? Surely it must needes be that these two witnesses and Antichrist must come into the world in the same day and die in the same day.</p>

This is an open field for all quarrels; &amp; as we vse to say, a sword for all hands; yea by this many come to be Atheists—it is like a forrest where all claime right to graze, yea even Atheists themselues.</hi> And in the same chapter, <hi>The scripture hath no auctoritie, waight, power over vs, but only as much as the church doth appoint, and assigne vnto it.</hi> Now every one knowes that by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wee doe not vnderstand the paper or inke, but the worde of God contained therein, and none can deny but that the church is subiect to the word of God.

And this worthy psalter hath beene translated into French, and printed at <hi>Paris</hi> in the year 1601. with the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the faculty of the Diuines of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ris.</hi> In reading thereof you would say, See here the Psalmes of <hi>David,</hi> but only that the name of God is not called vpon in them. And it seemes that <hi>David</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the <hi>Virgin Marie.</hi> The 131. psalme
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:11387:234"/>
begins thus. <hi>Memento Domina David, &amp; omnium invocantium nomen tuum. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member David, ô Lady, and all those which call vpon thy name.</hi> With the like grace, the Reuerende father <hi>Solier</hi> a Iesuite of <hi>Sainctes,</hi> hath lately set forth 3. sermons in praise of the Beatified <hi>Ignatius,</hi> in the first of which, page 33. he saith that <hi>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> sung these psalmes to comfort himselfe in his banishment. It may be also that <hi>Elias</hi> did read them at the Canonical houres of our Lady. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Apologie against the King excuseth the matter, saying that <hi>Bonaventure did not change Davids Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but only made another of it in imitation of Davids Psalmes, being moved therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by a goldly affection that hee bore to the holy Virgin.</hi> But that which is an impietie against God, can be no pietie toward the Holy Virgin. Shee doth not thinke her selfe honoured by the dishonour of God. For this prophane psalter is made as if one should apply the Lords praier to the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary,</hi> in saying, <hi>Our mother which art in heaven, hallowed bee thy name, &amp;c.</hi> Hee that should speak after this manner to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> mought he excuse himselfe in saying that hee did not corrupt the
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:11387:235"/>
Lords prayer, but made another in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, being moved therevnto by a godly affection that he bore to the holy Virgin? This Psalter is little better. The 109. Psalme begins thus. <hi>Dixit Dominus Dominae nostrae, sede mater mea à dextris meis. The Lord said vnto our Lady, sit down mother at my right hand.</hi> The Psalm <note n="a" place="margin">

Hee that committeth himselfe to the protection of the mother of God, shall rest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vnder her shaddow, and safeguard.

                  </note> 93 Psalme, hee makes as though hee durst not presume to speake to God, but it is to wrong him. <hi>The Lord is a God of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, but thou ô mercifull mother art en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to pitie and compassion</hi>; you would say that she were set to pacifie Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to make him change his will. It was a hard matter therefore to get accesse
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:11387:235"/>
to God, before the birth of the Virgin, or before she was crownd queene of heaven; To conclude, all this whole Psalter is such and yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dares say that it was made <hi>with a holy and godly affection,</hi> &amp; the facultie of the Divines of Paris, did not sticke to approue of it. And yet afterward they are bold to say that the worship of <hi>Latria</hi> appertaineth to God only, as if the Psalmes of <hi>David</hi> were no divine service.</p>

                  </note> On the complaint which his Maiestie makes in the 5 place of the suppressing of the Scripture, for feare least the people should come to see it, these Doctours say, that the reading of the Scripture is not absolutely denied vnto lay men, but that they are forbid to read it without hauing a speciall permission; (that is to say) that the Pope by a speciall priuiledge wil giue a man leaue to obay God, for God would haue the people to read the Scripture. Kings are Laymen, and yet for all that in the 17. of <hi>Deuter.</hi> they are commanded to read in the booke of the lawe all the daies of their life. And when the Apostle wrote to the people of the church of Corinth, of Rome, of Ephesus, did he not meane, that they to whome hee wrote should read his
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:11387:236"/>
Epistles? And when in the beginning of the Apocalyps it is said, <hi>Blessed is hee that readeth, &amp; they that heare the wordes of this Prophecy,</hi> why should wee not, following the counsell of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> apply our selues to the reading hereof, seeing that it is the next way to make vs happy? And yet this is one of the obscurest bookes in all the Scripture: how much more then are wee exhorted by this to read the books of the Gospell, so full of perspicuity and instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? In the 17 of the <hi>Acts.</hi> ver. 11. they of Beroe are commended because that after they had heard <hi>S. Paule</hi> preach, they did dayly vse to examine his doctrine by the Scripture, to knowe whether it were so or no, and yet it is probable that the Apostle <hi>S. Paule</hi> did, at the least speake with as much certainety, as Curates and Bishops doe now adaies. Why then may not they which heare them (after their sermons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) compare that which they heard with the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to see whether it bee truely alleaged or no? A strange case! These Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors both in their sermons, and in their writings pretend Scripture commonly, but will not haue the people to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they deale truely or no. As if they
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:11387:236"/>
should say, <hi>S. Paul,</hi> or <hi>S. Iohn</hi> saith so, but doe not goe thither to see it. They send you to the holy Scripture, but stop you in the way; yea and in their ful sermons they alleage the Scripture in barbarous Latin, and interpret it according to such allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as if French were worth nothing except it were set in the taile of Latin. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ many a time in the Scripture askes of those that stand about him.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.26.</note> 
                  <hi>haue yee not read,</hi> and, <hi>How readest thou?</hi> should Iesus Christ now adaies speak in the same manner to the people of the Church of Rome, they would answer him, wee haue not read, for the Popes Holynesse will not permit it, except it bee vnto some fewe which vnderstand Latin, and which haue speciall leaue from their Ordinarie. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely I dare maintaine that for a man to take vpon him to permit any one by his speciall favour &amp; priviledge, to obay God or to be instructed in his word, is far worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he should forbid him to serue God. For hee which doth forbid a man to serue God, doth onely oppose himselfe against God: but he which giues any one a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to serue God, makes God to bee his inferiour, and his subiect, seeing that hee
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:11387:237"/>
cannot be served but by the permission of the Pope, and it will come to this passe at last, that God must doe him reverence, if he himselfe looke to be served. Herevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to adde that women, &amp; the common sort of people which do not vnderstand Latin care not to sue for a permission to read it in Latin, which yet is the only tongue that is allowed of in the Church of Rome. But if you turne over all the histories of the Church, you shall never finde that any went about to hinder the reading of the Scripture, but certain monsters &amp; tyrants, as <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> &amp; such like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutours of the Church, whose example the Pope hath followed. For that there are some vulgar translations seen now adaies in France and Italie, this hath beene but of late, and without approbation: &amp; our aduersaries are beholding to vs for it. For it is not yet a hundreth yeares since that you should assoone haue found an Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, as a French or Italian Bible, amongst the people of the Romish church. And yet to this day at Rome, or in Spaine, to finde a Spanish, or Italian Bible with one of the people, is a burning matter, and a case of the Inquisition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:11387:237"/>Yet iudge what tyranny this is. For the books of the old and new Testament, are our contract of marriage with our bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome Iesus Christ, and the testament of our heauenly father. The clauses of the Legacies and donations contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, do appertaine to the people as well as to the Priests: why then should anie one keep their fathers testament from the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple? Why may not the Spowse be suffered to see her contract of marriage? Must I in this businesse rely vpon the trust of men that liue by my ignorance, and make their gaine by concealing the truth from mee? Why do they suffer me to read fables and prophane histories, and will not suffer me to read the will, and the ordinances of my father? Why do they make me to suspect the Holy scriptures as if they were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bookes, and a knife to cut my throat with? Suffer vs at least to haue a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of God, and she shall be bound vnto you for it. If you say, But many abuse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; I answere that preaching is abused too, &amp; so is the goodnesse of God, and yet for al this we are not to abstaine from them, or suspect them the more: And besides that there is more danger in a voluntary igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:11387:238"/>
then in a desire to profit. And it shal neuer bee found that the people did hatch heresies by the reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but all the Arch Heretickes haue bin men that haue had the charge of teaching which should therefore rather of the two be bar'd the holy Scripture. They say that it is for none but men of knowledge to read them; whereas I ever thought that a man did read them to get knowledge; but these men wil haue knowledge to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before the reading of them: which is a most wicked assertion, to make a knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in religion that may be without the scripture, &amp; before the scripture. And yet if it were so, what shoulde become of a great company of the Priests, which are more ignorant then the most part of the people, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwithstanding the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scripture is permitted?</p>
               <p>But if any be desirous to know the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the Ancient Church concerning this, and whether the people did read the holy scripture then or no, beholde here some of their testimonies. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his 3. Homilie of <hi>Lazarus</hi> speakes thus to his auditours, <hi>I do exhort you alwaies, and will never cease to exhort you that you bee
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:11387:238"/>
not only attentiue here to that which is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but when you be at home also, that you would set your selus carefully to the reading of the holy Scripture. A thing which I haue not forborne to inculcat vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that haue spoken with me, in particular. For it is not fit that any should say vnto me, these words are but little gracious, and there be many other things to busie a man, I am tyed to attend at the Court, I ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nage publike affaires, I haue my occupation, I haue a wife, I see to the bringing vp of my children, I looke to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, I am mingled with the world, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not for mee to read the Scriptures, but for those which haue bid Adieu to the world, whose dwelling place is vpon the tops of hils, there leading a more strict kinde of life. What saist thou ô Man? must thou not turne over the scriptures because thou art distracted with many businesses? But it lyes thee vpon rather to reade them then they which are more free: For they haue not so much neede of the assistance of the scripture as thou which art tost amidst the vvaues of businesses, &amp;c.</hi> Till at last he sayth, that <hi>it is impossible, yea I say impossible that any should attaine to salvation, if hee imploy not himselfe daily in this spiritual reading.</hi> And

The first is in the 6. chapt. and 8. verse, Where the Popes seate is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

by <hi>a pale horse, &amp; his name that sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His Maiesty notes also that the Pope is the king called <hi>Abaddon,</hi> or <hi>Apollyon,</hi> that is to say, one that destroies, and wasteth soules, who is spoken off in the 9. chapt. v. 11. and is king over the Locusts which came out of the thicke smoake of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse pit, v. 2.3. that is to say, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose out of grosse ignorance that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from hell and the diuell, and that, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>a starre fell from heaven,</hi> that is to say, by the meanes of one which hauing beene a light vnto the church for a time, tumbled downe, and fell away from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things to earthly, of a spirituall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming a Temporal Prince: which is altogither suteable to the Pope. This is confirmed by this, that the men which serue him are punished in the 20. verse for serving Idoles of Gold, of syluer, of brasse and of stone, to the end that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should apply this prophecie to the Turcks. For the Turcks haue all sorts of Images in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation.
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:11387:241"/>
And the vices reckoned vp in the 21. verse do all agree to the Romane Hierarchie, as the King hath shewed most exactly and truely.</p>
               <p>He doth likewise apply the 16. chap. of the Apocalyps to the See of Rome, where God doth powre out 7 vials of his wrath, that is to say, 7 sorts of punishments vpon those which beare the marke of the beast in their foreheads, ver. 1. and 2. The three last are the worst. For in the fift, which is spoken off in the 10. verse, God powreth out darknes vpon the throne of the beast, and God smiting them from aboue, they blasphemed against him. But at the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of the sixt viall, verse 13. <hi>There came</hi> 3 <hi>vncleane spirits like frogs out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, &amp; out of the mouth of the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet,</hi> by which Frogs his Maiestie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands, the Emissaries, and new religious orders, which the Pope sends out to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the people, and especially the Iesuits compared (as the King hath most wittily obserued) to Frogs, because as these liue by land and water, and are of a mixt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so the Iesuits are halfe Ecclesiastical, halfe lay creatures; men of the church, &amp;

yet such as will thrust themselues into worldly affaires. And they are said to be 2, because (saith the King) of their three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold direction, being sent from those 3. mentioned v. 13. Which seemes to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by that which is annext in the 14. verse. <hi>These are the spirits that worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, which goe vnto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world to gather them to the battell of that great day of God Almightie.</hi> For these men speake of miracles, and incite kings &amp; people on to persecute the faithfull, but at the incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God shall overthrow them in the day which he hath appointed, &amp; doeth (as it were) expect them in battell.</p>

            <head>THE CONCLVSION OF THE King of Great Brittaines Preface, containing an exhortation to all Christian Kings and Princes.</head>
            <p>My harty desire is that you would deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consider, &amp; weigh your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in this Cause. For neither in all my <hi>Apologie,</hi> nor in the pretended Refutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof, is there any question made anent the <hi>Popes</hi> power ouer me in particular, for the excommunicating or deposing of me. For in my particular; the <hi>Cardinall</hi> doth me that grace, that hee saith, The <hi>Pope</hi> thought it not expedient at this time to excommunicate me by name; our questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being only generall, Whether the <hi>Pope</hi> may lawfully pretend any temporal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer Kings, or no?</p>
            <p>That no Church men can by his rule be subiect to any temporall Prince, I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shewed you; And what Obedience any of you may looke for of any of them <hi>de facto,</hi> he plainly forewarneth you of, by the example of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Emperor <hi>Mauritius</hi>: not
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:11387:245"/>
being ashamed to slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der that great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages Christian humilitie &amp; obedience to the Emperour, with the title of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained and forced obedience, because he might, or durst do no otherwise. Whereby hee not only wrongs the saide <hi>Gregory</hi> in particular, but euen doth by that meanes lay on an heauy slaunder &amp; reproach vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Christian humility &amp; patience of the whole Primitiue Church, especially in the time of Persecution: if the whole glorie of their Martyrdome and Christian patience shall be thus blotted with that vile glosse of their coacted &amp; constrained suffering, because they could or durst doe no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; like the patience and obedience of the Iewes or Turkish slaues in our time, cleane contrary to <hi>S. Paul</hi> and <hi>S. Peters</hi> doctrine of obedience for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science sake;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.6. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 13.</note> and as contrary to <hi>Tertullians Apologie</hi> for Christians, and all the protestations of the ancient Fathers in that case. But it was good lucke for the ancient Christians in the daies of <hi>Ethnicke Emperors,</hi> that this profane and newe conceit was then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne among them: otherwise they would haue beene vtterly destroyed and rooted out in that time, &amp; no man to haue

            <p>Thus may ye see, howe vpon the one part our <hi>Cardinall</hi> will haue all Kings and Monarchs to be the <hi>Popes Vassals</hi>; and yet will not on the other side, allow the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of the <hi>Pope</hi> his vassals, to be subiect to any Christian Prince.

            <p>Thus ye see how little he careth (euen in so little a volume) to contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, so it may make for his purpose; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>consent</hi> of the people to signifie their <hi>power of Election</hi> in the making of Kings: though in the making of Bishops, by the peoples <hi>consent,</hi> their <hi>approbation</hi> of a deed done by others must only be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstood.

giue him the crown of glory for the same: not being ashamed to proclaime it as a principall head of Catholique doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That the secret of Sacramentall confession ought not to be revealed, not for the eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of whatsoever evill.</hi> But how damnable this doctrine is, &amp; how dangerously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to all Princes and States; I leaue it to you to iudge, whom all it most high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerneth. For although it be true, that when the Schoole-men came to bee Doctors in the Church, and to marre the old grounds in Diuinity by sowing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them their Philosophicall distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; though they (I say) do mainetaine, That whatsoeuer thing it told a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessor vnder the vaile of confession, how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous soever the matter be, yet he is bound to conceale the parties name: yet doe none of them, I meane of the old School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, deny that if a matter be revealed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the concealing wherof may breed a great or publike danger; but that in that case the Confessor may disclose the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though not the person, and by some indirect meanes make it come to light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the daunger thereof may be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

though it should tende to the rvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:11387:251"/>
long vpon it, that it was revealed vnto him vnder the vaile of Confession, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it was done in that time, while as the partie was making his Confession vnto him; Yet at the last he did freely confesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the partie reuealed it vnto him as they were walking, and not in the time of Confession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But (he said) hee delivered i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ale that might be, and so hee tooke that he mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by the Seale of Confession; And it had (as he thought) a relation to Confession; in regard that he was that partie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Confessor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and had taken his Confession sometimes before, and was to take it againe within few daies thereafter. Hee also said that hee pretended to the partie, that he would not conceale it from his Superior. And further it is to be noted, that hee confessed, that two diuers persons conferred with him anent this Treason; and that when the one of them, which was <hi>Catesby</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with him thereupon, it was in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parties presence and hearing &amp; what a Confession can this be in the hearing of a third person? And how farre his last words (whereof our Answerer so much vaunts him) did disproue it to haue beene
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:11387:252"/>
vnder Confession, the Earle of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamptons booke doth beare witnesse.</p>
            <p>Now as to the other parties name, that reuealed the Powder-Treason vnto him, it was <hi>Greenwell</hi> the Iesuite; and so a <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite</hi> reuealed to a <hi>Iesuite</hi> this treasonable Plot, the <hi>Iesuite</hi> reuealer not shewing any remorse, and the <hi>Iesuite</hi> whom to it was revealed not so much as inioyning him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny penance for the same. And that ye may knowe that more <hi>Iesuits</hi> were also vpon the partie, <hi>Owldcorne</hi> the other Powder-Martyr, after the misgiving and discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of that Treason, preached consolato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doctrine to his Catholike auditory; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them not to faint for the misgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of this enterprise, nor to thinke the worse thereof that it succeeded not; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging divers Presidents of such godly enterprises that misgaue in like manner: especially, one of S. <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who in his second iourney to the <hi>Holy-land</hi> died by the way, the greatest part of his army being destroyed by the plague; his first iourney hauing likewise misgiuen him by the <hi>Soldans</hi> taking of him: exhorting them thereupon not to giue over, but still to hope that God
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:11387:252"/>
would blesse their enterprise at some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, though this did faile.</p>
            <p>Thus see yee now, with what boldnes and impudencie hee hath belied the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely knowen veritie in this errand; both in auowing generally that no <hi>Iesuite</hi> was any waies guiltie of that Treason, for so he affirmeth in his booke; and also that <hi>Garnet</hi> knewe nothing thereof, but vnder the Seale of Confession. But if this were the first lie of the affaires of this State, which my fugitiue Priests &amp; Iesuits haue coined and spread abroad; I could charme them of it, as the prouerbe is. But as well the walles of divers Monasteries and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites Colleges abroad, are filled with the painting of such lying histories, as also the bookes of our said Fugitiues are farced with such sort of shamelesse stuffe; such are the innumerable sorts of torments &amp; cruell deaths, that they record their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs to haue suffered here; some torne at foure Horses; some sowed in Beares skins and then killed with Dogges; nay, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue not beene spared (they say) &amp; a thousand other strange fictions; the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all which I will in two wordes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer vnto you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="478" facs="tcp:11387:253"/>First, as for the cause of their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I doe constantly maintaine that which I haue said in my <hi>Apologie</hi>: That no man, either in my time or in the late Queens, euer died here for his conscience. For let him bee neuer so devout a Papist, nay, though he professe the same neuer so constantly, his life is in no danger by the Law, if hee breake not out into some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acte expresly against the wordes of the Law; or plot not some vnlawfull or dangerous practise or attempt; Priests &amp; Popish Churchmen only excepted, that receaue Orders beyond the seas; who for the manifold treasonable practises that they haue kindled &amp; plotted in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are discharged to come home againe vnder paine of Treason, after their recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the said Orders abroad, and yet, without some other guilt in them then their bare home-comming, haue none of them bin ever put to death. And next, for the cruell torments and strange sorts of death that they say so many of them haue bin put vnto; if there were no more but the Law &amp; continually obserued custome of England, these many hundreth yeares, in all criminall matters, it will sufficiently
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:11387:253"/>
serue to refute all these monstrous lies: for no tortures are ever vsed here, but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles or the Racke, and these never but in cases of high Treason; and all sorts of Traitours die but one manner of death here, whether they be Papist or Protestant Traitors; Queene Maries time only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For then indeed no sorts of cruell deaths were spared vnexecuted vpon men women and children professing our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: yea, even against the Laws of God and Nature, women with child were put to cruell death for their profession; and a liuing child falling out of the mothers belly, was throwne in the same fire againe that consumed the mother. But these ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous persecutions were done by the Bishops of that time, vnder the warrant of the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie; &amp; therefore were not subiect to that constant order and formes of execution, which as they are here established by our Laws &amp; customes, so are they accordingly obserued in the punishment of all criminals. For all Priests and Popish Traitours here receiue their Iudgements in the temporall Courts, and so doe neuer exceed those formes of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution which are prescribed by the Law,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:11387:254"/>
or approued by continuall custome. One thing is also to be marked in this case; that strangers are never called in question here for their religion, which is farre otherwise (I hope) in any place where the <hi>Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> domines.</p>
            <p>But hauing now too much wearied you with this long discourse, whereby I haue made you plainly see, that the wrong done vnto mee in particular, first by the <hi>Popes Breues,</hi> and then by these Libellers, doth as deepely interest you all in generall, that are <hi>Kings,</hi> free <hi>Princes,</hi> or <hi>States,</hi> as it doth me in particular: I will now conclude, with my humble prayers to God, that hee will waken vs vp all out of that Lethargike slumber of Securitie, wherein our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors and we haue lien so long; and that we may first grauely consider, what wee are bound in conscience to doe for the planting and spreading of the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, according to his revealed will, in all our Dominions; therein hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the voice of our onely Pastor (for his sheepe will knowe his voice, as himselfe saith) &amp; not following the vaine,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.27.</note> corrupt and changeable traditions of men. And next, that we may providently look to the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:11387:254"/>
securitie of our owne States, and not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this encroching <hi>Babylonian Monarch</hi> to winne stil ground vpon vs. And if GOD hath so mercifully dealt with vs, that are his Lieutenants vpon earth, as that hee hath ioined his cause with our interest, the spirituall libertie of the Gospell with our temporall freedome: with what zeale and courage may we then imbrace this work: for our labours herein being assured, to receiue at the last the eternall and inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable reward of felicitie in the kingdome of Heaven; &amp; in the meane time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vnto our selues a temporall securitie, in our temporal Kingdomes in this world.</p>
            <p>As for so many of you as are already perswaded of that Truth which I professe, though differing among your selues in some particular points; I thinke little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion should moue you to this holy and wise Resolution: Our Greatnes, nor our number, praised bee GOD, being not so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptible, but that we may shew good example to our neighbours; since almost the halfe of all Christian people and of all sorts and degrees, are of our profession; I meane, all gone out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> even from Kings and free Princes, to the meanest
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:11387:255"/>
sort of people. But aboue all (my loving <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Cosins</hi>) keepe fast the vnity of Faith amongst your selues; Reiect <note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4</note> questions of Genealogies and <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid c.</hi> 4.7</note> 
               <hi>Aniles fabulas,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> saith; Let not the foolish heate of your Preachers for idle Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies or indifferent things, teare asunder that Mysticall Body, whereof yee are a part, since the very coat of him whose members we are was without a seam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and let not our diuision breed a slander of our faith, and bee a word of reproach in the mouths of our aduersaries, who make <hi>Vnitie</hi> to be one of the speciall notes of the true Church.</p>
            <p>And as for you (my loving <hi>Brethren</hi> &amp; <hi>Cosins</hi>) whom it hath not yet pleased GOD to illuminate with the light of his Truth; I can but humbly pray with <hi>Elizeus,</hi> that it would please GOD to open your eies, that yee might see what innumerable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible armies of Angels are euer prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ready to defend the truth of GOD; &amp; with <hi>S. Paul</hi> I wish, that ye were as I am in this case; especially that ye would search the Scriptures,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 26.29.</note> &amp; ground your Faith vpon your own certaine knowledge, &amp; not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the report of others; since euery <hi>Man
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:11387:255"/>
must be safe by his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> faith.</hi> But, leauing this to GOD his mercifull providence in his due time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Abac.</hi> 2.4.</note> I haue good reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you, to maintaine the ancient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of your Crownes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, not suffering any vnder GOD to set himselfe vp aboue you; and therein to imitate your owne noble <hi>Preaecessors,</hi> who (even in the daies of greatest blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) did divers times couragiously op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselues to the incroaching ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Popes.</hi> Yea, some of your <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi> haue in all ages maintained, and without any interruption enioyed your liberty, against the most ambitious <hi>Popes.</hi> And some haue of very late had an evident proofe of the <hi>Popes</hi> ambitious aspiring ouer your temporall power; wherein yee haue constantly maintained and defended your lawfull freedome, to your immortall honour. And therefore I hartily wish you all, to doe in this case the office of godly and iust <hi>Kings</hi> and earthly <hi>Iudges</hi>: which consisteth not onely in not wronging or invading the liberties of any other person (for to that wil I neuer presse to perswade you) but also in defending &amp; mantaining these lawfull liberties where with GOD
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:11387:256"/>
hath indued you. For ye, whom GOD hath ordained to protect your people from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, should bee ashamed to suffer your selues to be wronged by any. And thus, assuring myselfe, that yee will with a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led iudgement free of preiudice, weigh the reasons of this my <hi>Discourse,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my plainenesse in good part, gracing this my <hi>Apologie</hi> with your fauours, and yet no longer then till it shall bee iustly &amp; worthily refuted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I end, with my earnest prayers to the <hi>Almightie</hi> for your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperities, and that after your happy temporall Raignes in earth, yee may liue &amp; raigne in Heaven with him for ever.</p>
