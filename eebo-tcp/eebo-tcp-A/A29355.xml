            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
MAYOR
Aldermen, Majeſtrates and Officers
of the Military Force in this
City of LONDON, and County
of MIDDLESEX,
for you to receive, and in patience to conſider.</head>
            <p>MEN and Brethren, in the fear of the Lord
I beſeech you, every one of you to walk
humbly in the places wherein you are ſet,
and alſo warn you that you beware of pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Innocent blood</hi> on your own heads, though ſome
of you with the Jews may not matter it, if <hi>our blood
ſhould be on you and your children,</hi> Yet know this, if ye
ſhed it or cauſe it to be ſhed, it will prove a burthen
heavie for you to bear, even as the innocent blood
of <hi>Jeſus</hi> proved a burthen heavy for the Jews, though
they in haſte cried out, <hi>his blood be on us and our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
I write unto you Magiſtrates that you may
conſider, though <hi>Naboth</hi> was put to death by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of <hi>Jeſabel,</hi> yet <hi>Ahab</hi> leaving his <hi>ſeal</hi> ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly,
that his Wife could come at it, though <hi>Ahab</hi>
himſelf lay upon his bed, yet the blood of <hi>Naboth</hi> was
laid to <hi>Ahab's</hi> charge; and withal know this, that we
dare not part with the Inheritance which the Lord
giveth us, though with <hi>Naboth</hi> we ſhould be ſtoned
to death for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56011:2"/>
Therefore oh ye Magiſtrates, was not the late
made <hi>Law</hi> againſt us, who in ſcorn are called <hi>Quakers,</hi>
enough, but do you now leave your <hi>ſeals</hi> ſo careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that others may take them, and ſend Souldiers
into our peaceable meetings to abuſe us by bruiſing
ſome of our bodies, to the je<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pardy of ſome of our
lives.</p>
            <p>Therefore oh ye Rulers know this, that ye ought
to bear the Sword of Juſtice, and not to bear it in
vain, but to ſee that it be born for the puniſhment
of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do
well. And I write unto you Officers of the Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Force, that you may conſider, though <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> was
put in the Front of the battel by <hi>Ioab,</hi> and ſlain by

               </gap>word of the Children of <hi>Ammon,</hi> yet his blood
was laid to <hi>Davids</hi> charge; Therefore know this,
that if the Souldiers whom you ſend, ſhed our blood,
though the guilt will lie upon them, yet it will alſo
be laid to your charge: Therefore I warn you in
the fear of the Lord to take heed that ye bring not
ſwift deſtruction upon your ſelves, for we are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that expect deliverance only from the Lord, for
I denie all that confidence that truſteth in a carnal
weapon, for our truſt is only in the Lord God, and
how can we but <hi>Worſhip him</hi> who hath delivered us
out of ſo many dangers, which hath attended us;
Yea though we ſhould with <hi>Daniel</hi> be thrown into
the Lions Den, yet we muſt ſerve the Lord becauſe
we know that it is better to ſerve him, then to enjoy
the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; and ſome of thoſe
great abuſes I would lay before you which of late
have been done unto us, de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iring you to beware of

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56011:2"/>
Upon the firſt day of this week we being peacably
met together in the fear of the Lord, waiting upon
him to do his will in that meaſure of his Grace which
he hath beſtowed upon us, out of the great love that
he hath to the Sons of men, There came in one <hi>like
unto a man,</hi> but in the actions of Fury more like <hi>a
bear robbed of her whelps,</hi> paſſing through the body of
the people, laying about him with ſuch a weapon,
that merciful men would be loath to ſtrike <hi>Doggs</hi>
with, and ſome Souldiers following him ſhuffing us
to and fro as if we had been the moſt contemptible
of all creatures, throwing ſome out into the <hi>mire</hi>
and <hi>dirt,</hi> one being <hi>wounded,</hi> many receiving <hi>heavy
blows,</hi> which may be to the hazard of their lives, my
ſelf being a ſpectator of ſome of thoſe things, not
being aſhamed of the <hi>Goſpel of Christ,</hi> becauſe it is
<hi>the power of God</hi> unto ſalvation to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,
And alſo conſider how many of us have been
put into <hi>naſty priſons</hi> amongſt <hi>noyſom ſtinks,</hi> many of
the harmleſſe Servants of the Lord have gone out of
<hi>Newgate</hi> ſick in the time of this late impriſonment,
<hi>eight of which have died,</hi> being taken away from the
<hi>evil</hi> to come, nevertheleſſe that will not clear thoſe
that cauſed them to be put in priſon; and now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of carrying us to priſon to die there, Souldiers
comes to our meetings to beat us and bruiſe us, near
murthering of ſome of us, none of you having any
juſt thing againſt us, but as concerning the Worſhip
of our God; even as the Rulers of old had againſt
<hi>Daniel,</hi> and the Jews againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> But as it was ever
ſo it is now, <hi>The ſeed of the bond woman perſecutes the
ſeed of the free woman;</hi> But I commit our cauſe to
him that judgeth righteouſly, deſiring with my ſoul,
if it be the Lords will, that the worſt of our perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56011:3"/>
even thoſe that are poſting head long towards
<hi>Damaſcus</hi> may meet with that voice in the way, which
might make them to know, <hi>it is hard for them to kick
againſt the pricks.</hi> And having written ſomething of
what hath been done unto us, now I would deſire to
know, how vice is beaten down; Have the <hi>Stage players</hi>
liberty to Act their <hi>Playes,</hi> or are they hindred? Have
the <hi>Bear-baiters</hi> liberty to make a ſhew of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that were created for the uſe of man to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with thankſgiving or are they baniſht from
the City? Are the <hi>Ballad-ſingers</hi> ſinging Ballads up
and down the Streets, or are they reſtrained? Are
the <hi>Mountebancks,</hi> the <hi>Juglers,</hi> the <hi>Morriſ-dancers</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to Act their Tragedies, or are they not? Are
the <hi>Drunkards, Swearers</hi> and <hi>Lyers</hi> lying in the <hi>Taverns</hi>
and <hi>Ale-houſes</hi> in their drunkenneſſe, while ſober
people are kept in Goals? Is not this the time that
is ſpoken of, <hi>becauſe of Iniquity the Land mourns?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now oh ye Rulers come let us reaſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
what have we done, or what would you have
us to do? Who have we wronged, or whom have
we defrauded, whoſe Ox or whoſe Aſs have we ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?
<hi>Have we raiſed any Rebellion against the King,</hi>
that we ſhould be thus perſecuted? Nay, nay, we
abhor defraud and all ſuch things, we own <hi>true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
either <hi>Active</hi> or <hi>Paſſive,</hi> what we cannot for
Conſcience ſake towards God perform in <hi>Active</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
we are made willing to ſuffer as the Lord
ſhall enable us in <hi>Paſſive</hi> Obedience, till the Lord
deliver us, for <hi>our truſt is not in the Arm of fleſh, but in
the Living God;</hi> But here is the reaſon that we are
perſecuted becauſe the Lord hath called us to <hi>follow
him,</hi> becauſe we dare not joyn with <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we dare not run into <hi>the ſame exceſs of riot</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56011:3"/>
do, and as we have done our ſelves in times
paſt; Therefore as it is written, <hi>we are killed all the
day long, we are counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter:</hi> And
now conſider ſeriouſly with that of God in your
ſelves, and ſee what ye think it is that we thus ſuffer
for, <hi>for if our hope were only in this life we were of all
men moſt miſerable,</hi> for how has many of us left our
native Countries, ſome leaving their Wives and
Children, and travailed into ſtrange lands, receiving
when they have come there <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> or <hi>Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi>
or <hi>Baniſhment,</hi> yea ſome has been <hi>put to death,</hi>
and what has it been for, but for the ſake of that <hi>Life
Immortal,</hi> which no man could take from them;
And what is it that we keep up our <hi>Meetings</hi> for,
when ſome of us are haled <hi>to Priſon,</hi> ſome cruelly
<hi>beaten,</hi> ſome in jeopardy of our <hi>lives?</hi> what is it we
war for, is it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap>an <hi>earthly Kingdome,</hi> is it earthly
riches, honour or preferment? Nay, nay, it is for
that life <hi>Immortal,</hi> it is for that treaſure which will
never corrupt, <hi>and the weapons of our warfare are not
carnal;</hi> Therefore take counſel of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Lawyer, and let us alone leaſt ye be found
<hi>fighters againſt God,</hi> and alſo conſider what Spirit that
is that perſecutes, and how it differs from that ſpirit
that gave forth the Scriptures of Truth. <hi>Cain</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
his Brother <hi>Abell,</hi> and if I ſhould declare,
through the Scriptures, and through the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Chriſtians unto this day, I might make a
large deſcription of that ſpirit of <hi>Cain</hi> which hath
been perſecuting the true <hi>Abells</hi> in many Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ſuppoſe that we were Hereticks, as it may
be ſome of you may deem us to be; Yet conſider
that to murder an Heretick, were the way to caſt
him into <hi>Hell;</hi> and ſee how this is contrary
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56011:4"/>
to the Apoſtles Doctrine, where he ſaies <hi>in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
will give them repentance to the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Truth, 2. Tim.</hi> 2. chap. and in the 4th.
chapter of the ſame Epiſtle, it is ſaid, <hi>reprove, rebuke,
exhort with all long ſuffering and doctrine,</hi> (mark) with
all long ſuffering. And many examples I might bring
out of the Scriptures to prove, that that ſpirit that
ſeeks to deſtroy mens lives is the ſpirit of <hi>Antichrist,</hi>
not of Chriſt, who came to deſtroy <hi>ſin</hi> and to ſave the
<hi>life;</hi> But if nothing will ſatisfie you but our blood,
<hi>fill ye up the meaſure of your Fathers, that ye may have
blood to drink, and that we may fill up that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
of the ſufferings of our forefathers, and of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Chriſt in our fleſh, for his bodies ſake, which is the
Church;</hi> And now ſee what is it that ye thus purſue,
what am I or what are we, are not we the weakeſt
of all men, that is to ſay of our ſelves, for we are
made low in our own thoughts, and contemptible in
our own eyes, that the power of the Lord alone may
be exalted in us, for by the grace of God <hi>we are what
we are,</hi> it is not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God, and
to him only I do commit our cauſe, for we have
none other to fight for us, but only the Lord, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
by the right arm of his power hath made <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands</hi>
willing this day, I do believe, in <hi>England,</hi> rather
to have their <hi>outward Tabernacles of fleſh</hi> torn in pieces
then to yeld to that wil of man that is contrary to the
righteous Law of God, for we know that the utmoſt
of your power is but to <hi>kill the body,</hi> and then you
can do no more; Therefore hath the Lord brought
us into the pure fear of him that can both kill and
caſt into hell; and theſe things do I lay before you,
that ye may take heed of pulling innocent blood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56011:4"/>
your own heads, for the Lord hath made me a
plain man, and in plainneſs I write unto you, and I
leave what I have here written to that of God in
you, and in all people to ſee whether the Magiſtrates
