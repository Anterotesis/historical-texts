            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Relation of ſome of the moſt material Matters that paſsed
in a Publick Diſpute at Thriploe in Cambridge-ſhire
the 15th day of the 2d Month 1676. between Francis
Holdcraft, and Joseph Odde his Aſſiſtant, both Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Prieſts, on the one Party, and Samuel Cater,
with ſome others of the Friends of Truth called Quakers.</head>
            <p>I The aforeſaid <hi>Samuel;</hi> being at a Meeting of our Friends in
that Country, where there were ſome told me of the Lyes,
Slanders, and Reproaches that were frequently vented and
caſt upon us the people of God, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> by this
above-named <hi>Francis Holdcraft,</hi> and his Abettor <hi>Joſeph
Odde,</hi> (that is to ſay) that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are deceivers, and that
they did not believe in the True Chriſt the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and Saviour of
the World, and that they Preached another Jeſus, and not the
True Jeſus, and that they were Antechriſts; and of this they made
their boaſt, that they would prove the ſame to any of our Faces,
if we would or durſt come to that Town; upon the hearing of
which, for the Truth ſake, for which the Lord hath called me to
bear Teſtimony thereunto, and for the clearing of the Innocency
of thoſe that believe therein, and are led and guided thereby,
which I knew they had moſt groſly abuſed, I was made free in
the fear of the Lord to appoint a Meeting at that Town of <hi>Thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploe,</hi>
and give notice of it ſeven days before; in which time I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that the Perſons above-named might have timely notice of it;
which was done, that ſo they might prove that to our faces if they
could, which they had ſaid of us behind our backs, or receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
for their unfruitful works of darkneſs. So when I with
ſome Friends were come to the Town, and were at a Friends houſe,
there was word brought to us, that <hi>F. H.</hi> was come to Town alſo, and
that he thought it not ſo convenient to come to our publick Meeting,
but rather deſired to ſpeak with three or four of us more privately
to diſcourſe out the matters in Controverſie between us: then I
ſent him word; that he had reviled us, and our Principles openly,
and I did expect that he ſhould come as openly, as he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
to prove what he had ſaid againſt us, or elſe to receive ſhame
for his work; and the time of day was now come to go to the place
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46107:2"/>
which was appointed for the Meeting, where we did intend to go,
and deſired that he might meet us there; but if they would not come
to us, then we were reſolved to come to them after the Meeting,
and we being gathered together, and waiting upon the Lord ſome
time before they came, there was a Friend declaring the Truth to
the people; when <hi>F. H.</hi> came to the door, and ſaid, That if he
would not hold his peace, he would not come in; but the Friend
having freedom, he did ſoon leave, and then he came in: I ſtood
up and ſpake a few words unto the people by way of Exhortation,
That all might be ſober and weighty in their minds, that ſo they
might be the better prepared to give a right Judgment of what
might paſs between us:—Then <hi>F. H.</hi> ſaid, If I would not
hold my Tongue, he would be gone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Webb</hi> Anſwered, Be patient a little &amp; hear, and if we ſpeak any
thing contrary to Truth, thou mayſt judge us out of our own Mouths.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Francis Holdcraft.</speaker>
               <p>I will have no patience.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Samuel Cater.</speaker>
               <p>Then thou art unfit to be a Miniſter of Chriſt;
but however <hi>F. H.</hi> I would not have thee go away yet, for we do
expect that thou ſhouldſt perform what thou haſt promiſed, if thou
canſt; that is, to prove us deceivers, and thou haſt ſaid we deny
the True Chriſt, and that we Preach a falſe, and not the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> the
Saviour of the World; and this is the buſineſs thou haſt promiſed
to do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>And this I ſhall do by the help of Almighty God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>Is your name <hi>Samuel Cater,</hi> and are you a <hi>Quaker?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. C.</speaker>
               <p>My name is ſo, and I own, and have unity with all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and upright-hearted people of God, called <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>But do you own the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles? let me know
that, that I may have a foundation to ſtand upon in our Diſcourſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. C,</speaker>
               <p>What Principle is it that thou art againſt that we hold,
Repeat it, and I ſhall give thee an Anſwer?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>Do you own the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. B.</speaker>
               <p>Another Friend ſtanding by ſaid, there is a Book of ours
called <hi>Truths Principles</hi> any one therein contained we will own, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which you will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. C.</speaker>
               <p>As to anſwer to thee in ſhort, that I own all that are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
as the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles I ſhall not do; for this reaſon; there
are envious and evil-minded men have forged Principles, and called
them the <hi>Quakers</hi> to abuſe us, and to preſent us, and our Principles
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46107:2"/>
odious; and therefore ſeeing thou wilt not tell us what Principle
of ours thou art againſt, I ſhall here declare the univerſal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that I with the reſt of my Brethren own, and turn people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
that is, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the True Light, that Lighteth every
man that cometh into the World, and that ſo many as love this
Light, and bring their deeds unto it, and are led and guided by it,
are ſaved;</hi> and <hi>all that diſobey it, are condemned by it.</hi> This is our
Principle, What ſayſt thou to it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay to affirm that every one is enlightned with the Light
of Chriſt, is Curſed Idolatry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. C.</speaker>
               <p>Then I ſay <hi>Francis,</hi> the Pit that thou haſt digged for the
<hi>Quakers,</hi> thou art fallen into thy ſelf this day in the ſight of all that
have an Eye to ſee, and an Ear to hear; for I'le prove by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
of Truth, that this Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>that Lighteth every
Man that comes into the World,</hi> is <hi>the Lamb of God that takes away
the ſins of the World:</hi> See <hi>John</hi> 1 7, 8, 9. &amp; 8. 12. &amp; 29.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>That every one is enlightned, I grant; but not with the
Light of Chriſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. C.</speaker>
               <p>What is it then that they are enlightned with?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>A Creature.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. C.</speaker>
               <p>What kind of Creature is it, a Man or a Beaſt? but in this
he anſwered nothing, and in this as well as many other things he
was manifeſt to be in great Confuſion, and in his Knowledge to be
more bruitiſh than a Beaſt, to call that a Creature, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
of Truth calls the Life of God, and ſays it is <hi>the Light of
Men:</hi> Read <hi>John</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>I will prove that the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny the Man Chriſt Jeſus,
who is now at the Right Hand of his Father in the Higheſt Heaven,
and hold forth another Chriſt, another Goſpel, another Spirit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. C.</speaker>
               <p>Well, go on and do it if thou canſt, we ask no favour at thy
hand. By this time his Brother <hi>Joſeph Odde</hi> came in, the other Prieſt,
ſaying to him in a fauning flattering manner, Sir, I am glad to ſee you
here this day about ſo good a work as this is; but to me and the reſt
of my Friends he ſpake revilingly, and told us we were a Generation
of Vipers, and that they would prove us ſo to be before they went
from thence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>Do you own the Man Chriſt Jeſus, body fleſh and bone, to be
at the Right Hand of his Father in the Higheſt Heaven, yonder, yonder
above the Stars, pointing upward with his Hands and Eyes.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>S. C.</speaker>
               <p>The True Chriſt I own, and believe in the ſame that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
prophecied of, and the Apoſtles Preached Salvation in his name,
and am ready to render a reaſon of the hope that is in me, when
it is my place ſo to do; but <hi>Francis</hi> it is not thy buſineſs to Catechiſe
me at this time; but to prove that we deny the True Chriſt; this
thou haſt promiſed to do, and I expect thou ſhouldſt do it, or elſe
acknowledge thy error.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>
               <p>I ſaid as much, you dare not own the True Chriſt, if you

               <p>The True Chriſt I own, but thy Carnal Imaginations of
him I deny; but this I ſay, we are upon the defenſive part; thou haſt
ſaid we deny Chriſt, it is on thy part to prove it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F. H.</speaker>

               <p>To the people I am not aſhamed, nor afraid to confeſs my

into our minds, and make you believe; but the reaſon yet why I have
not done it is, becauſe it's not my buſineſs at this time; we are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by this man to deny Chriſt, and he ſaith he will prove it, it is his
place ſo to do if he can; and his asking me whether I own Chriſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys
as much as this, that he does not know whether we own him, or
deny him; ſo that he hath done unjuſtly by us, and unwiſely by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in going to report that we deny the True Chriſt, behind our
backs; and now we call him in queſtion before our faces: Inſtead of
proving of it, he asks us whether we own him or deny him; which
queſtion would have been more ſeaſonable, and more honeſt, to have
been asked us before he had thus openly reproached us, and ſlandered
us; for it appears he hath ſaid that of us, which he cannot prove; and
therefore muſt return again upon himſelf, as the raiſer, or at leaſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer
of theſe falſe reports; and he muſt, till he can clear himſelf of
theſe lyes and ſlanders, which he ſo frequently vends out of his
mouth, and caſts upon the Innocent, be numbred amongſt the
Lyers for the Lake, who are in the Steps which the Prophet ſpeaks
of; report, and we will report it.</p>

of God that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was Crucified by the
High-Prieſts, and envious ones, and was raiſed by the power of God,
and Aſcended far above all Heavens, and is at the Right Hand of
God; and is alſo knocking at every ones door for an entrance into

               <p>I ſay again, the ſame Jeſus in whoſe name the Lame Man was

Crucified him) in the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> of <hi>Nazareth;</hi> doth this man

               <p>Then there was one called to us, that we might have ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
concerning Election and Reprobation; for theſe Men had
declared before the people, that ſome Children were in a ſtate of
Damnation before they were born; about which ſome people were
diſſatisfied that heard them.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Joſeph Odde</hi> deſired to take the matter in hand.</p>

               <p>I do acknowledge according to the Scriptures, in <hi>Adam</hi> all

            <sp>
               <speaker>J. O.</speaker>
               <p>This <hi>Adam</hi> repreſents all men, ſo that in him all are included,

               <p>
                  <hi>The Apoſtle ſays,</hi> As was the offence, ſo alſo was the free

               <speaker>J. O.</speaker>
               <p>All fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> and you have granted that all ſinned in
him; and therefore Children while they are in the Womb, before
they are born, ſo ſoon as they have life, and are a Living Soul, they are
guilty of Original ſin, and are Veſſels of Wrath, and for deſtruction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. C.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>I'le prove this to be falſe Doctrine; and contrary to the
mind and will of God revealed in the Scriptures of Truth; for the
Lord ſaid by the Prophet</hi> Ezekiel 18. <hi>Read from the beginning on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that</hi> Proverb ſhall not be uſed in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaying, the Fathers have
eaten ſower Grapes, and the Childrens Teeth are ſet on edge; but as
the Soul of the Father is mine, the Soul of the Son is mine alſo; the
ſame Soul that ſins ſhall die. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 30.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. O.</speaker>
               <p>But death Reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> will you not grant
that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. C.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, over them that had ſinned; and therefore thou muſt
prove Children to be ſinners before they are born, (which thou and all
thy Brethren can never do) or elſe thou canſt not prove them damned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. O.</speaker>
               <p>Death Reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> over all men, and I
will prove a Child a Man before it is born; and therefore guilty of
ſin before it is born.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. C.</speaker>
               <p>Prove that if thou canſt; People I deſire you all to be ſtill,
and let us hear how <hi>Joſeph Odde</hi> will prove a Child a Man before it is
born, by plain Scripture, for no other proof we will accept of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. O.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt ſays,</hi> A Woman hath ſorrow, becauſe her hour is come;

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. C.</speaker>
               <p>This is no proof; for Chriſt does not ſay that it was a Man
before it was born.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>S. C.</speaker>
               <p>Whether was the ſin in the Mother, or in the Child? for
Chriſt ſpeaks of the ſtate of a little Child to be happy, <hi>for of ſuch is
the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> and you ſay ſome Children are for Hell and
Deſtruction, which is a damnable Doctrine, and altogether contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Scriptures, and to the mind of God revealed therein; which
ſays, God would have all to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of
the Truth; and therefore made none for deſtruction, but Mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction

the things of God in the Language in which we were born,

to have left it without further publication to the Witneſs of God, in
