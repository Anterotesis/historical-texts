         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY very good Lord, I doubt not, but before this time, you
have received from me the Directions of his most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Majesty, concerning preaching and preachers, which are so
graciously set downe, that no godly or discreet man can other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then acknowledge, that they do much tend to edification, if
he do not take them up upon report, but do punctually consider
the tenour of the words as they lie, and do not give an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to that, which may receive a faire interpretation. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
because some few Churchmen, and many of the
<pb facs="tcp:66255:2"/>
people, have finisterly conceived as wee here find, that those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
do tend to the restraint of the exercise of preaching,
and do in some sort abate the number of Sermons, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
by degrees do make a breach to ignorance and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
His Majesty in his Princely wisedom, hath thought fit,
that I should advertise your Lordship of the grave and weighty
reasons, which induced his Highnesse to prescribe that which is
done.</p>
            <p>You are therefore to know that his Majesty being much troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and grieved at the heart, to hear every day of so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
from our Religion both to Popery and Anabaptisme, or
other points of separation in some parts of this Kingdome, and
considering with much admiration: what might be the cause
thereof, especially in the Raign of such a King, who doth so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
professe himselfe an open adversary <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>incely wisedom could
fall upon no one greater probability, then the lightnesse, affected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and unprofitablenesse of that kinde of preaching, which
hath been of late years to much taken up in Court, University,
City, and Countrey.</p>
            <p>The usuall scope of very many Preachers, is noted to be soar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up in points of Divinity, too deepe for the Capacity of the
people or a mustring up of much reading, or a displaying of their
owne wit, or an ignorant medling with civill matters as well in
the private of severall Parishes and Corporations, as in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of the Kingdom: or a venting of their owne distast, or a
smoothing up of those idle fansies, which in this blessed time of
so long a peace, do boile in the braines of an unadvised people, or
lastly, a rude or undecent rayling not against the Doctrines
(which when the Text shall occasion the same, is not onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
but much commended by His Royall Majesty,) but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the persons of Papists and Puritans. Now the people bred
up with this kind of teaching, and never instructed in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme
and fundamentall grounds of Religion, are for all this
Airy nourishment, no better then <hi>(abraiae tabulae)</hi> new table-bookes
ready to be filled up, either with the Manuals and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chismes
of the Popish Priests; or the papers and pamphlets of
Anabaptists, Brownists and Puritans.</p>
            <p>His Majesty therefore calling to mind the saying of <hi>Tertullian
<pb facs="tcp:66255:3"/>
Id verum quod primum:)</hi> and remembring, with what doctrine
the Church of England in her first and most happy Reformation
did drive out the one and k<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>festing the people of this Kingdome doth find that the whole
scope of this Doctrine is contained in the articles of Religion, the
two bookes of Homilies, the lesser and the greater Catechisme,
which his Majesty doth recommend again in these directions as
the Theatres and proper Subjects of all sound and edifying
preaching.</p>
            <p>And so far are these directions from abating that his Majesty
doth expect at our hands, that it should increase the number of
Sermons, by renuing upon every Sunday in the afternoon in all
Parish Churches throughout the Kingdom that Primitive, and
most profitable Exposition of the Catechisme, wherewith the
people, (yea) very Children may be timely seasoned and instructed
in all the heads of Christian Religion the which kind of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(to our amendment be it spoken,) is more diligently obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in all the reformed Churches of Europe, then of late it hath
been here in England. I find his Majesty much moved with this
neglect, and resolved: (if wee that are his Bishops, do not see a
Reformation hereof, which I trust we shall) to recommend it to
care of the Civill Magistrate. So far is his Highnesse from giving
the least discouragement to sollid preaching or discreet, or religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Preachers.</p>
            <p>To all this, I am to adde, that it is his Majesties Princely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that both the former directions, and those reasons of the
same, be fairly written in every Registers office: to the end, that
every Preacher of what denomination soever, may if he bee so
pleased take out Coppies of either of them with his owne hand
<hi>(Gratis)</hi> paying nothing in the name of see and expedition.
But if he do use the paines of the Register, or his Clarkes, then
to pay some moderate fee, to be pronounced in open Court by
the Chancellours and Commissaries of the place, taking the
direction and approbation of my Lords, the Bishops: Lastly, that
from hence forward a course may be taken, that every Parson,
Vicar, Curate, or Lecturer, do make exhibite of these his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
directions, and the reasons for the same at the ensuing visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Bishops and Arch-Deacons, paying to the Register
by way of see, but two pence at the time of the exhibite: and

in all humility. The Petitioners conceive, the act lately passed by
Your Majesties Royall Grace and Goodnesse, (upon the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
made by those who shall adventure their moneys) to bee
the onely way left for raising present Money for that work. And
they finde that the removall of your sacred Majesty to places so
remote, and distant from the Parliament doth much discourage
the Adventurers in advancing Moneys for effectuall proceeding
in the work, and consequently will be a meanes unavoidably to
retard the long expected supplies, contrary to Your Majesties
Royall intentions often expressed, and will much encourage the
Rebels, and their adherents in that Kingdom, and may in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of some, (as they fain) gain a belief of those false reports,
which divers of the Rebels have taken the boldnesse to raise, even
very lately, since the publishing of your Majesties Proclamation
for suppressing the Rebels, that they are your Majesties Souldiers
and that the supplies that arrived here, were but the Parliaments

supplies. And your further Petitioners humbly shew, That if
strong Forces be not presently raised, and transported thither, (the
season of the yeare now serving) the Brittish and Protestants in
that Kingdom cannot long subsist, but will bee extirpated, and

            <head>A NEW DECLARATION FROM BOTH
Houses of PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>THe Lords and Commons in Parliament do declare, That it
is against the Lawes and Liberties of the Kindom, that any
of the Subjects thereof, should be commanded by the King to
attend him at his pleasure, but such as are bound thereto by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Service: and that whosoever upon pretence of his Maiesties
command shall take Armes, and gather together with others in
a warlike manner, to the terror of the Kings people shall
bee esteemed disturbers of the publick peace, and to do that
which may introduce a president of very dangerous consequence
for the future, and produce most mischievous effects for the present
considering the great distempers of the Kingdom, and what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Councellors and Incendiaries, are now about the King,
and how desperate and ill affected divers persons attending upon
his Majesty, have shewed themselves to the Parliament, and to
his other good Subiects, threatning and reproaching them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
<pb facs="tcp:66255:5"/>
even in His Maiesties presence, and for preventing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
such great mischiefes as may thereupon ensue.</p>
            <p>It is Ordered and Ordained by both Houses of Parliament.
That if the Trained-band, or any other his Majesties Subjects,
shall upon pretence of any such command be drawn together, and
put into a posture of war, the Sheriffe of that County where there
shall be such raising, or drawing together of armed men: Doe
forthwith raise the power of the County to suppresse them and to
keep his Majesties peace according to the Law. And that the
Lord Lieutenants, Iustices of the Peace, and all other his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Subjects, bee aiding and assisting to the severall and respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Sheriffs in performance hereof, as they will answer the
contrary at their perill.</p>
