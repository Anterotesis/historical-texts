            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE great charity the Author
had for souls (lest any should
take example by seeing him
drink) and the desire he had of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
what restitution he could, was the
reason he desired me to set out his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
against Drinking after his Death.
And as I who was constantly with him
must needs know him better than any
other; so I think my self obliged to do
him that right, as to let the world
know he was not the Man they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
took him for. I can justly say I
never knew any one of a more tender
Conscience: after he had been in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
if upon inquiry into himself he
found he had committed a sin in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too much, or done any thing he
thought extravagant, he would very
much lament himself, and hath sent for
the company he was with, and given
them good advice, perswading them to
a holy life. He has made resolutions to


<pb facs="tcp:93040:3"/>
drink nothing but small Beer, which he
hath kept till the violence of his fits
seized on him so severely, that he has
been forced to drink some Wine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him from them; but hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
troubled, and said to me, what
a miserable condition am I in, that
these fits should force me to that I would
fain quite cast off; and would take it
with great caution, and say, Lord give
a blessing so far as I may lawfully pray.
For his Family Duties, he was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
there should be Prayers morning and
evening. For some time he had a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
in the House which said the
Church Prayers twice a day; when he
was gone, he performed the duty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
and when he was not able by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his illness, he order'd one of his
Sons to do it. Several times when he
rose from Prayers, he would give his
Servants good instructions: And when
he could not go to Church by reason of
the violence of his Fits, he would speak
to me to take care that his Children
and Servants went; and bid me tell
them the reason why he did not go, lest


<pb facs="tcp:93040:3"/>
they should take example by his staying
away, which he said he would never do
if it pleased God he had his health.
It was his constant practice before he
went abroad, though it was never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a way, first to go to his Prayers and
beg a blessing of God. For his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in giving Alms, he had bowels of
mercy, he seldom gave Alms but he shed
tears of compassion for their misery:
And when they return'd thanks in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him, he would say to me, they
do me much more good by their prayers,
than I can do them with my Alms:
What a mercy it is that I have so much
plenty who deserve no more than they!
On the Lords day he had many of the
Poor dined with his Servants, which
he would speak to with a friendly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and look on them with much joy,
that they received refreshment at his
Table. He gave yearly Pensions, one
to a very ancient Widow, and another
to an ancient Gentleman, who died,
and then he gave it to his Brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the like want. He relieved seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Knights and Gentlemen in their


<pb facs="tcp:93040:4"/>
distress, feeding, cloathing, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
them with mony towards the bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their dead. And every <hi>Christmass</hi>
he gave money to the Poor of <hi>Betch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
and <hi>Brockham:</hi> And as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to Charity he used to say,
it is the best way of putting money to
use, to give it to the Poor. As he was
thus eminent in this Virtue of Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
so he was no less in that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of Charity, which is forgiving
Enemies. He received as much
wrong as a slanderous tongue could
do him, but was so far from returning
evil for evil, that contrary to that, he
asked me what he should do, to do that
party good; my answer was, I knew no
way but Prayer: which he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betook himself to, after a solemn
manner on his knees with me; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that told me, he had Prayed at
Church and in his bed for that party,
and though he received the wrong, yet
he first desired to be reconciled. I could
give several other instances of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
good for evil, for he never bore
malice against any, but still endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb facs="tcp:93040:4"/>
to overcome his Enemies with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
His Charity to souls was so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusive,
that he wrote several short de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
from sin, and exhortations
to a holy life, and used to cast them
privately about the streets, that some
finding them might by the grace of God
be wrought upon to forsake their sins.
One of the Papers I have by me, with
these words in it, Fear to do ill,
for thou know'st not how soon death
may overtake thee. He was very just
in all dealings, careful to pay his
debts, and in accounting would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be a loser than any should suffer
by him. He many times used this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
Whose Ox have I taken?
He was humble, kind and courteous to
the meanest of his Neighbours, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
slighted any Gentleman for his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty;
but used them with as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
as those that had great Estates.
He was a Loyal Subject to his King,
a true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and very much against Popery. He
was a loving Father to his Children, a
very kind Master to his Servants, and


<pb facs="tcp:93040:5"/>
(I must ever owne it) he was a most
tender loving Husband to me: which
he shewed in taking care to the utmost
of his power to provide for me, and to
his last in his extraordinary kind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
to me on his death-bed. Above
two years before his death a great Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
befell him, which brought much
anguish on his spirits, so that when he
hath been at Prayers with his Family
he could scarce bring out his words for
tears: and he being naturally melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
great afflictions must needs lie
heavier upon him and be harder to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
had he not had a great support
from Heaven. But through Gods grace
they turned so much to his advantage
and weaned him so from this world, that
his discourses to me were as Sermons
treating of Death and the happiness of
the next world. He said the day of
our death might very well be called the
day of our birth, giving us a greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
than when we came from the
inclosure of our Mother's womb: And
told me he and I should do as my Lady
<hi>Falkland</hi> advised her friends, not love


<pb facs="tcp:93040:5"/>
one another too much, but endeavour to
wean our affections, knowing one must
go before the other: telling me also of
one, that when he had word brought
him of the death of his only Son, said,
I knew I begat a mortal. When troubles
were on him, he would say, Heaven
will recompence all, Heaven is a sweet
place; there is no disturbance, but all
Peace and Love. He hoped he might
overcome his troubles, which he could
never have done, had he not had a
greater succour than any on Earth: but
God was all in all to satisfie his soul.
He used to say, all my strength is in
God, had I not depended on the Holy
Jesus I had been dead e're this. He
could not lay himself to sleep but with
some of these expressions, Jesus is my
strength; God is a very present help
in trouble: in him we live move and
have our being: It is he that perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all things for us: All my fresh
springs are in thee O Lord. He used
to have the Italian Testament, Bishop
<hi>Hall</hi>'s Book called, The Balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi>
with other good Books at his beds-head;


<pb facs="tcp:93040:6"/>
which he would read in before he went
to sleep, finding some comfortable sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
suitable to his condition, of which
he would discourse with me as he laid
himself to rest. He used in great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to take the Bible and open it at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
and then read what he first
found; which often hath been so suitable
to his condition, that he hath received
great comfort, and writ the places
down, which I have by me. His heart
was so much set on Heaven, that he
wonder'd how any Religious person could
concern himself for any of these vain
and transitory things: and would use
this expression of <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hammond, Let
God govern the world.</hi> And when he
heard of any false reports he said, Let
us not trouble our selves, but consider
how we stand in the sight of God. He
was very fearful of taking Gods name
in vain: Insomuch that when Fits seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
violently on him, and pain made
him cry, O Lord! he was troubled lest
he had broken that Commandment, who
(said he) is able to help me but he in
this my great extremity? He could not


<pb facs="tcp:93040:6"/>
endure to hear any one swear, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a lye. He wrote some of our blessed
Saviours Sermon on the Mount, which
he intended to write out, resolving to
get it by heart and make it his practice,
but death seized him before it was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
He had a great love to the
Word of God; and said to his Sister
on his death-bed, I love Gods word,
and I fear him. When he first waked
in the morning he said, God be blessed
that I have lived to see the light of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day, Lord grant that I may spend
it to thy service; and that Collect of
the Church, <hi>Prevent us O Lord in all
our doings,</hi> &amp;c. And when he rose
crossing his Arms, he said, In the Name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost, <hi>Amen;</hi> and then he
said the Lords Prayer which he had a
high veneration for; afterwards he read
a Psalm. He did not use long Prayers,
but short Ejaculations often both day
and night. When I have waked in the
Morning, I have seen him lifting up his
hand with so great devotion that it
hath moved my affection. He delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb facs="tcp:93040:7"/>
much in discourses of Religion, and
holy Meditations: and hath told me
in his bed, he hath had such sweet Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
as have raised him even to
Heaven. I am not able to express how
excellently he would speak of his love to
the Holy Jesus, and the blessed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
He said he loved God above all, and
not any thing in comparison of him;
and that he would be a Martyr for
God. If he were sure his sins were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
and the pain of death over, he
could willingly leave this world: for he
desired to be dissolved and to be with
Christ. He hath reckon'd to me the
many dangers he had escaped, and the
many blessings he had received: admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the great goodness of God that had
preserved him to that present, and had
given him time to repent of his sins,
and bestowed many undeserved blessings
on him. He told me he had desired
some temporals, which God denyed him;
but he look'd on it as a mercy, and
clearly saw that it was better for him
to be in that very condition God had
placed him in; and would often speak


<pb facs="tcp:93040:7"/>
of Gods Providence. He was a great
lover of the company of Divines; and
could not abide to see them slighted.
He had several of them in his prayers,
and desired the benefit of theirs for
himself. Satan would tempt him to lay
aside his confidence in the mercies of
God: but he resolved and armed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by faith against those assaults; and
hath said to me that he could as plainly
see Satan in his malicious designs and
temptations against him, as if he saw
him with his bodily eyes. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Satan tempted him to infidelity,
but he did resist him and presently said
the Creed. I heard him say on his
Death-bed, Satan would tempt me, but
I will not believe him: And then said,
<hi>I believe in God,</hi> &amp;c. which made me
think he had the same temptations
then, which he had told me of at other
times: And that that good God that
had sustain'd him to that time, would
not then leave him, but strengthn'd his
faith to the last gasp. About half a
year before his Death he had many scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which proceeded from the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness


<pb facs="tcp:93040:8"/>
of his Conscience, and made him
full of fears lest in this or that he had
offended: and though when company
came to see him, he seem'd as chearful
as he could; yet when they were gone
he would be troubled for any word or
action he might offend in: and did
examine himself of his former life with
sorrow for all he had done amiss. He
had very humble thoughts of himself,
and would judge and blame himself ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than others: and often say a proud
Man could not go to Heaven. He was
of a very sweet disposition, and so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hearted that he could not endure to
see any creature in misery: and hath
told me of one that put his only Son
to death for delighting in putting out
the eyes of birds, thinking he would be
a cruel Man. And though he was thus
tender hearted, yet upon a good account
he had great courage, as he hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his readiness to serve his King,
in the <hi>Surrey</hi> rising, and at other times,
though he never had the fortune to be
in any action. He was a very good
Scholar, understood <hi>Hebrew, Greek,


<pb facs="tcp:93040:8"/>
Latine</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> and had the French
Tongue as perfect as a Native. He
had great skill in Musick, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very much in it. He had a great
love to any he thought loved God. Once
a poor man came begging, that said he
had been taken by the Turks, and used
very cruelly; but rather than he would
deny Christ, he would be torn in pieces:
I cannot express how much my Husband
rejoyced to hear him say so, and he was
so taken with him, that he gave him
both Money and Cloaths. There was a
poor Woman that used to sit with the
rest of the Poor at his Servants Table,
and he heard she had the report of a
good Woman, he took her to his own
Table, and used her with much respect.
He had such humble thoughts of himself,
that for some time he would not allow
himself decent Burial: but afterwards
he consented to it, and desired his
Neighbours might accompany him to his
Grave. He often desired me to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
in the vault by him. I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in memory of a dream that he
told me of when he waked a little before


<pb facs="tcp:93040:9"/>
his last sickness; he dream'd that the
day of Judgment was come, and the
Lord appearing in the clouds, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Elect, he was left behind; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which being grievously afflicted he
prayed earnestly, and the Blessed Jesus
look'd back and called him: and he
went with great joy, and was received
into Heaven with the rest of the Elect.
He was full of fears as to his future
condition while he was here: But now
I question not but he is received into the
joy of the Lord. He was a sickly man
for many years, troubled with Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
Fits and shortness of breathing,
which made him fear sudden Death,
and pray dayly against it: But his last
sickness was the Yellow-jaundice, with a
very sore throat and a violent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Feaver.
And though he was in very much pain,
he bore it with a great deal of patience,
speaking comfortably to all about him:
so that they said they never were with
any one that made a better end. He
was much in Prayer, I think I heard
him say the Lords Prayer near twenty
times in one day, when he was so weak


<pb facs="tcp:93040:9"/>
that he could hardly bring out his words.
He desired me not to be troubled, and
said God would provide for me, and
prayed God to send us a happy meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
He often told me, his Prayer for
me was, That God would bless me with
the Blessings of his right hand and of
his left. I cannot remember half the
Heavenly Expressions he had when
Mr. <hi>Benson</hi> the Minister of our Parish
prayed by him. He said to me, Mr.
<hi>Benson</hi> is a good Man, he speaks so
sweetly when he speaks of God. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the Bell might be rung, and asked
many times after it, if it did not ring.
He departed this life on the <hi>10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> day
of <hi>May,</hi> 1678. being <hi>Friday,</hi> the
day after <hi>Ascension:</hi> And I hope he
hath received the benefit of the precious
Passion, and glorious Resurrection and
Ascension of our dearest Lord, and ever
blessed Saviour Jesus. He had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desired me not to be by him when he
was dying, lest seeing me should make
him unwilling to leave this world; and
lest I should by any sudden passion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
his soul departing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But at last


<pb facs="tcp:93040:10"/>
he very much called upon me not to leave
him, so I stayed with him to the last:
and though my trouble was not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
yet (I thank God) I did not
in the least disturb him. He endured
much pain in his sickness, but at last I
could not perceive he had any, but his
breath grew shorter and shorter, and
so he went away without the least gasp
or groan. His thoughts and discourse
were much of death long before; he
would say our life was but as a dream,
or the shadow of a dream, and as a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour.
And when he saw any disturbed
for fear of losses in this world, he would
say none are ever undone till they come
to Hell. He loved much to dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Religion, but once being disputing
against Predestination, and fearing he
had spoken something irreverent, he was
extremely afflicted; I never saw any
one express more sorrow, and writ what
I here set down, and have under his
own hand by me: <hi>I did immediately
strip my self of it, and threw my self
down before the Throne of Grace,
by which it had no propriety in me:


<pb facs="tcp:93040:10"/>
I did it whatever it was to vindicate
God's mercy: I have committed my
cause to God who knows my
thoughts, and let him deal with me
according to his infinite goodness
and wisdom: let Satan do what he
can against me, I know my Saviour
is the Captain of my Salvation.</hi> I
have here endeavoured to give what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
I can of my dear Husbands life;
but I know I come very short of what
might have been observed by one of a
better memory, that had been with him
so much as my self. I hope the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Reader, into whose hands these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
shall come, will pardon all imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in the Stile or Method, and
make the best use of what was so well
design'd by the Author. The fulfilling
of whose Will in setting forth his Book,
and discharging my duty, in clearing
him to the world, is the only cause I
venture to appear in Print,</p>

            <p>I <hi>Received a Letter from a very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Divine that gives this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my dear Husband, which I
write in his own words;</hi> That he was
in many respects the most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
instance of humility, the greatest
example of godly sorrow, and the
most admirable Precedent of self-denial
and sincere detestation of sin
in himself, and passionate care that
it might not infect others, which I
have known. And of this it pleased
the all-wise guider of all things to
make me a very heedful witness about
18 years ago, when I preached at the
<hi>Savoy</hi> for Dr. <hi>T. F.</hi> Not many daies
after, I was summon'd to wait on
Sir <hi>George Freman,</hi> a person then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unknown to me, whom he
entertained with a most doleful ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of affection, and with manly
(because Christian) showers of tears
spoke after this manner: Sir, <hi>You
are to me as I suppose I am to you, a
stranger. I thank you for your Sermon
at the</hi> Savoy, <hi>where I was your Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.


<pb facs="tcp:93040:12"/>
I do not think you aimed at me,
but sure I am your discourse pierced my
heart. I could scarce think any one
there besides concerned, I dare say none
more than my self. I am that mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
man, who have not remembred
my Creator in the daies of my Youth,</hi>
(my Text was <hi>Eccles.</hi> xii. 1.) <hi>and
now what shall I do, what shall I do?
give me your advice, assist me with
your Prayers.</hi> Thus in one person
perceiving many blessed marks of true
penitents, wounded with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

vowing amendment with <hi>David,</hi> and
commanding it in those under his
care; sending to me as good <hi>Josiah</hi>
did to <hi>Huldah</hi> the Prophetess. I did
as soon as I had recover'd my self
from that tumult of passions which a
sight so unexpected did raise, apply
my self, according to my poor abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with utmost compassion, to aid
the sorrowful patient of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
who was pleased, after diverse


<pb facs="tcp:93040:12"/>
weeks conference, prayers, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
on several Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and such like means used by
my self, and others of far more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
to raise up his troubled spirit,
bowed down with the dreadful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of God's heavy displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and to stay him with some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
hopes that our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would not cast him off for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
nor always shut up his loving
kindness and tender mercy. For
which with what singular expressions
of penitential sorrow he prepared
himself, I am not able to utter. With
what zealous indignation did he call
to mind his sins! With what affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
care did he dehort his Family
from all wicked and vain courses!
I was astonished to see and hear with
what awful reverence, prostration
and tears, with what inflamation of
soul, he kiss'd the sacred Book when
he solemnly renewed his Covenant
with God. I am too little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with virtue, to describe that mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
meekness, wherewith he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated


<pb facs="tcp:93040:13"/>
the injury he had done to
his meanest attendants by his former
example. I know too little of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
to tell you with what ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of spirit he declaimed against, and
disswaded his servants from the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his now abhorred practices,
and with penitent <hi>Manasses</hi> solemnly
resolved to command all under his
authority to serve the Lord, The
sincerity of these resolutions was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by his pious behaviour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I was till 1664. sometimes an eye-witness;
and by this did appear the
soundness of his judgment, for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he declared, that he knew how
dangerous and senseless a conceit it
is (which is too common) that men
may believe well without repentance,
and repent well without amendment,
live well without prayer, and pray
well without faith. And now, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
who can think he wants joy,
who thus sowed in tears? and why
should any bewail him who is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
than here he could be? Relieve
your self from sad thoughts with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting

upon that bliss and fulness of
pleasure, which he most earnestly
groaned for and now enjoys for ever.</p>

               <hi>The disswasive from Drunkenness</hi>

            <head>A Letter written to me upon
the Death of my Husband.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur loss is great, by reason of the
Death of your dear Husband:
however you have this comfort to allay
the grievance of the loss, the hope and
even confidence that he is gone to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Neither will it be accounted parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
in you, in thus charitably judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him; for it is very reasonable
that is thus concluded concerning him.
Contrary to the usual way of a Letter,
let me so method what I knew of him to
be very true:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> He was a person of great
reason, and had such a judgment as
would rightly distinguish betwixt good
and evil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He did not thwart his
Judgment and opinion of things by his
actions, but accordingly steered his
course, as nearly as frail humanity would
permit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93040:14"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He was a true son of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and wondred at
the opposition and contradictions of
others to its Christian tenents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> His Prayers were constant
unto God for the conversion of our
Churches Enemies. He laboured not
only by strong arguments when he met
with the Recusants, but at other times
also when he was alone, by his Prayers
to make them Proselytes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He was heavenly minded,
and his discourse was continually about
God and Eternity; and he affected no
mans company whose talke was world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for he accounted it frivolous and
vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Though a person of quality,
yet he was affable and courteous, and
strangely condescending, and chused
his Associates rather for their goodness
than for their greatness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> He was charitable, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to contribute towards the necessity of
the poor, and timed some of his liberal
gifts excellent well; encouraged many
of the poor Parishioners to come con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly


<pb facs="tcp:93040:15"/>
to the Church by entertaining
many of them at his own House every
<hi>Sunday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> He had a singular love for
you his affectionate and most loving
Wife: It was nothing but death that
could have separated him from you. I
might speak several things more, very
honourably of him, but I purpose brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Madam,</hi> I know, you lament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you have parted with so good and
vertuous an Husband as Sir <hi>George</hi>
was: but let his vertue and goodness be
an occasion of your rejoycing. He now
is possessed of that which we pray for to
enjoy, Everlasting bliss and happiness.</p>

                  <head>A BRIEF
APOLOGY
FOR THE
Lords Prayer.</head>
                  <p>I Have selected two Texts out
of the New Testament; one
is in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
the beginning of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
verse; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>After this manner therefore pray
ye,</hi> &amp;c. the other is in the eleventh
of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke</hi> at the second verse, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>And he said unto them, when you pray,
say, Our Father.</hi> Which two places
of Scripture will administer a redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy
of argument to prove what I


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93040:18"/>
have undertaken, namely, That it is
the duty of every Christian to use the
Lords Prayer constantly, both at his
publick and private Devotions. As
to the integrality, and exact compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of this Prayer, every man will
readily acknowledge it, because it
were sacrilegious impudence to say
otherwise: notwithstanding this, you
shall hear the most moderate of its
opposers say, that the assiduous use of
it is not necessary; and many since
our late dissensions began, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by their continued omission of
it, that it is not requisite at all, not
allowing it entertainment (although
the Lords Prayer) within the walls
of the Church, stiled by our Saviour
himself, <hi>the House of Prayer;</hi> nor into
their own houses at their Family Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and I have much reason to fear,
not into the most recluse corners,
when they have been at their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
devotions: Thus did they in
effect teach Assemblies, that prayer
as effectual as that, might be made
out of new molds of their own, and


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93040:18"/>
entertained them with nothing else,
but their own belches and eruptions.
On the contrary, I do assert the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of its use, both at all times of
prayer, and by all persons; first from
the primitive practice, and the high
esteem that all the Eminent Fathers
of the Church had of it: And next
I shall endeavour to prove it by Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall
deductions from the letter of
the Scripture, in one text, and by
unavoidable consequence from the
other, shewing that the place cited
out of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Matthew,</hi> must of necessity
hold Analogie with that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke:</hi>
I will begin with that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke,</hi>

                     </gap>, in

of <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>adverbium primarium,</hi> and

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93040:19"/>
all the times of Prayer: but
if you should put it thus, as a solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a question, namely, as if I
should ask a man when will you do
such a kindness for me? <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>;
and the answer be made,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Isidor.</hi> when you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
here supposing I had told him
before when I would return, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is
not indefinite, but joyn'd with <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
is an answer to the precedent
question, and points at some hour, or
day in the which I said I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
but in the Text it must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
comprehend all the times of
prayer: and therefore this injunction,
<hi>When you pray, say, Our Father,</hi> is,
and must of necessity be as much as
if our Saviour had said, whensoever
you pray, <hi>say, Our Father which art
in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Nor will it enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my apprehension, how this can
possibly admit of any other explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But to this they will object, if
so, that our Saviour enjoyns us when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
we pray, to say, <hi>Our Father;</hi>
the consequence will be, that we must


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93040:19"/>
say no other prayer: for when we
pray in another form, we pray; how
is this command then fulfilled, <hi>when
you pray, say, Our Father,</hi> if we take
a liberty to vary from it? I answer,
that by these words, <hi>when you pray,</hi>
is not to be understood all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
time of prayer, but some part
of that occasional, or assiduous pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
so that it is not spoken exclusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of all other prayers; for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul,
Ephes,</hi> 1. 16. tells them he ceaseth not
to pray for them; and verse the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
tells them in what manner, namely,
in words of his own, as you may there
read; and in another place, <hi>Acts 2.
42.</hi> it is said, <hi>And they continued in
the Apostles doctrine, and fellowship,
and breaking of bread, and prayers,</hi> in
the plural; so that it is much more
probable that they did use occasional
prayers, and not make a continued
repetition of the Lords Prayer: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
we find that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <hi>Augustine,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Bernard,</hi> and all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
took that liberty, neither was
it ever questioned; but however, if


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93040:20"/>
the Text did restrain us to it, those
that use it not at all would be the
more strongly refuted. From the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
then it will appear, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
prayer, these very words
(for they are the immediate subject
of that command) must be used by
every Christian, whensoever he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
himself to God in prayer: But
to this they will object, That the
Text in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Matthew</hi> gives a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from using these very words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it saith. <hi>pray after this manner,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, thus. To this I answer, If our
Saviour commandeth us in this Text
to pray after this Prayer, then he
doth implicitely, though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
enjoyn these very words; but
if it be supposed to be spoken exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
of the Lords Prayer, that is, as
if our Saviour had said, You need
not say my Prayer, or you need not
use it alwayes, but set it as a pattern,
and rest alwayes, or for the most
part, upon your own methods, which
you make in imitation of mine; what
would the consequence be, but a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93040:20"/>
one? namely, that our Saviour
did set a greater estimate upon those
subsequent prayers, which we were
afterwards to make in imitation of
his, than he did upon his own, which
will inevitably follow if we reflect
upon the ends of prayer. The chief
subordinate ends of prayer (for there
are many others inferiour to them)
are these, to prevail with God for
the communicating of Grace to the
soul, that so by faith and repentance
we may be interested in Christ, and
then by the application of his merits
to our souls, we are put into an
estate of salvation, which is the last
of those intermediate or subordinate
ends of prayer; for if we continue
in that, the next remove, we shall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at eternal salvation, which is the
ultimate end of prayer, and of all
the Ordinances of God. Thus then
I argue, If these be the ends of prayer,
then the best composed prayer must
needs be the most efficacious for the
procurement of these ends; but if
our Saviour commands us to make


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93040:21"/>
prayers after his, and gives a dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
to omit his own (though but
sometimes) the forementioned conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
will follow, that he prefers
our prayers before his own: for he
doth most certainly desire the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our souls, and doing so, hath
as certainly appointed the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
means thereunto; but if he
dispenseth with the continued use of
his own prayer, and enjoyns us to
make others after it, and those to be
our daily prayers, it will inevitably
follow, that he looks upon ours as
more efficacious than his own, which
is a most blasphemous consequence.
But again, suppose this Text, <hi>after
this manner pray ye,</hi> did not so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
enjoyn the use of the Lords
Prayer; yet the other doth, for it
saith, <hi>when you pray, say, Our Father,</hi>
&amp;c. This admits of no evasion, as I
suppose my self to have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
since these very words are the
immediate subject of the command,
whereupon I offer this argument; If
one place of Scripture do <hi>ipsis termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>


                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:93040:21"/>
and expresly command any one
Duty, and any other place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
seem to dispense with it, the
ambiguous Text must be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
to that which is conspicuous,
and clearly intelligible; for otherwise
we shall make the word of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to it self: then if my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
fail me not, it is evident, that
the Text in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Luke</hi> admits of no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and the other carries but a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
occasion of one, but this seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingness
(if there be such) must vail
to the other, which is so nervous and
evincing: as for that ridiculous cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they omit the use of it in
publick, lest men should idolize a
form; they may as well say, that the
Scriptures may be taken away from
them, because they may idolize the
mechanick part of it, namely, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and the binding, or the letters,
and not look at the system of Truth,
which is comprized in it. But besides
this, the Lords Prayer can no more
be accounted indifferent, as to its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
use (which is to be offer'd up


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93040:22"/>
to God in praying) than any other
places of Scripture, as to their proper
and peculiar uses; because the Lords
Prayer is a part of Scripture: Now
the Historical part of Scripture is to
be believed, the Doctrinal part is to
be believed, and practised, and urged
in polemical discourses, the supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
part is to be pray'd; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my Opinion is, That when men
do vary from this prayer (which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
is lawfull, prvided they
do not exclude it) their prayers
should be composed as near as they
can of sentences collected out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
To dispense with the use of
this Prayer is in the general, repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Theologie, which enjoyns
the greatest reverence, and esteem
that possibly can be for matters of
Divine Institution; and especially a
command which issued immediately,
and with so much clearness out of
the blessed mouth of Christ himself,
doth certainly call for our ready and
constant obedience; and it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all Christian practice, it hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93040:22"/>
ever been magnified in the Church
of God, and inconsistent w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Reason, if we take but a
moral view of it; for in all actions
the <hi>medium,</hi> or instrumental cause,
must be fitly proportion'd for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of what we design, and by
all requirable circumstances accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
to that end; or else we have
no certain grounds to expect the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement
of what we would have:
but here it is otherwise, if we sue for
blessings in our own deficient lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and indigested petitions, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
omitting this most accurate
form, which was composed by him,
who is the wisdom of the Father, by
which he made the world, the first
of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi> and the tenth verse: Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
therefore doth it, despiseth the
very wisdom of God, he is guilty <hi>lesae
Divinae Majestatis,</hi> of high treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King of heaven: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not strange, that during the
late eclipse of our Church, rebellion
did rouze up her self more and more,
till at last, with a bare and impudent


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93040:23"/>
face, she laught at the tenderness of
Allegiance; for there is great reason
to think, that the deliberate omission
of the Lords Prayer, was the sudden
admission of rebellion; for he that
dares despise the wisdom of God, and
by that means commit the highest
treason, and speak the greatest blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
against God, will easily slide
into a conspiracy of treason against
his Temporal Prince: and although
I am induced to believe, that there
was a <hi>fomes</hi> of rebellion and spleen
lodged, and lurking in the hearts of
many these late wars, which gave the
first spring to our dissensions; yet,
that by the neglect of this prayer,
joyntly with the discontinuance of
communicating in the Lords Supper,
and the removal of Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
and many other causes, I have
great reason to believe they were
very much promoted. As there is a
reason in Divinity, why the neglect
of this Prayer was a great inlet to
rebellion; so is there likewise in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Philosophy, for he that slights


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93040:23"/>
this most accurate form, will most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
not stick to oppose all other
forms in the Church, by an argument
<hi>à majore ad minus:</hi> and he that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
Set Forms, and Ecclesiastical
Constitutions, hath a principle of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness,
and independency in
him, which will be still administring
arguments to him <hi>(dato uno absurdis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo)</hi>
by a series of moral, or rather
immoral consequences against all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive
power, first in the Church,
and then in the State, which truth
hath been (though very deplorably)
yet evincingly laid down before us
in the late rebellion: concerning
which truth our dread Soveraign
<hi>Charles</hi> the second, having been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt along time satisfied, is
well prepared with instructions for
his own security; though I believe
his Piety more than his Regal Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
will cement him to the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> which is the repository
of primitive discipline and order.
Whether these arguments may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
with many others, I know not,


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93040:24"/>
but they are so much with me, that
I was exceedingly scandalized at the
publick omission of it, and am well
assured that a very great body of
Christians in <hi>England</hi> were so with
my self; and that it was not <hi>scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
acceptum</hi> on our side, but <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalum
datum</hi> on theirs who did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it: And I would very fain be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
how the Dissenters from Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Ceremonies can quarrel
with the Church of <hi>England</hi> for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
things in their own nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
that is, not prohibited by
God in his revealed will; how they
can, I say, except against the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of such lawfull things, and
plead it is for this reason, to avoid
giving offence to tender consciences,
which consciences cry out before they
are hurt, and yet maintain that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
may publickly omit this great
duty of saying the Lords Prayer, and
that to the offence of so many well-grounded
consciences, who can by no
means dispense with it. The Church
of <hi>England</hi> out of her prudent care


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93040:24"/>
to preserve Order and Uniformity in
the exteriour part of Gods worship,
imposeth a lawfull thing or action,
and that's a sin; the Presbyterian dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseth
with the not performing of a
necessary duty, and that's no sin.
The Church of <hi>England</hi> magnifies
Christs Prayer, and that's idolizing a
Form; the Presbyterian despiseth it,
and that's good Religion: The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England,</hi> of which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Church are a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
part, do cause the illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Covenant to be burnt, and that's
a great wickedness; the Presbyterian
slights the Divine Energy of the
Lords Prayer (legitimate, as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
calls it) which is far worse than
the bare action of burning the paper
wherein it is printed or written, and
that's not ill at all. But it may be
they will say to me, you make a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
concerning the excellency of
the Lords Prayer, we may ask you
the same question that one was asked,
who insisted long upon the praise of
<hi>Hercules, Quis unquam vituperavit


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93040:25"/>
Herculem?</hi> which of us ever spoke
against the excellency of the prayer?
It is true, I never heard any man <hi>in
terminis</hi> do it, as I said in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of my discourse (for that were
open blasphemy, and persistence in it
would merit excommunication from
the society of Christians) but you do
implicitely, and inclusively, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
why do you not use it? Actions
speak more than words, and cry aloud
in the ears of God either for reward
or judgment: But some of them do
object, that they do use it sometimes,
but they are not bound to use it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.
To this I answer, that the
intermitting of its use, doth imply
the setting of but a gradual esteem
upon it, and that they do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
its supereminency above
all other prayers. If a man that is
prescribed an excellent dyet-drink,
which never sail'd the cure of some
disease which he labours with, and is
ordered by his Physician to take it
every day; if he intermit but one day
it will argue that he doth not so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93040:25"/>
approve of it, that is, that he doth
disapprove of it, in a degree propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to the discontinuance of it:
So if any man do make use of the
Lords Prayer sometimes, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
useth it not; what doth this
omission of his (unless it be through
forgetfulness) but secretly whisper to
the understanding that he doth not
intensively and absolutely approve of
it, but partially and <hi>in gradibus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missis.</hi>
For to say the Lords Prayer
is the best prayer, and yet to say, it
is not requisite to use it at all times
of prayer, is a most absurd asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to be exploded by all judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
men; for if it be the best, and
that most transcendently, why should
any other prayer justle it out? It is
true, that many times there is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
upon the soul the guilt of so
many great and often repeated sins,
that the deep apprehension of the
spirit at such a time requires more
room, and a greater field of language
to rove up and down in, and to unbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
her remorse to God whom she


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93040:26"/>
hath offended; she would come to a
more particular repentance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon all the circumstances which
may aggravate her guilt, and be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of sorrow to her in her self-condemning,
that by her timely sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
upon her self she may avoid
that irrevocable sentence which Christ
at the last day will pronounce against
those who justifie themselves, and
therefore is not satisfied in her deep
recesses of grief, with that petition in
our Lords Prayer, <hi>Forgive us our tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes,
as we forgive them that trespass
against us:</hi> and therefore other
prayers are allowable, because the
soul doth by them as it were divide
her repentance into smaller parcels,
and make it more fine by sifting it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
single circumstances; but when
this penitent Soul hath recollected all
she can for the accusation of her self,
and finds that in her memory she can
discover no more, being troubled she
cannot; now let her make a sure
conclusion with this perfect prayer,
which is a summary of all her wants,


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93040:26"/>
in which she confesseth all her sins,
and asketh forgiveness for all; and not
for her own sins only, but for the
sins of the whole Church, by which
Petition of the Lords Prayer we are
most sweetly taught how diffusive
our Charity should be: and now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
confessed all her sins, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
pardon of God for all her own,
and others sins, she can strain at no
more, but finding in this prayer a
sweet repository of all her scruples,
commits her self to God, till the next
time that he shall honour her so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as to let her enter again into that
near Communion with himself which
Prayer gives us. So that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
though the Lords Prayer do
not exclude the use of other Prayers,
especially when they are collected out
of Scripture; yet it comes with full
commission for the use of it self: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
at the conclusion of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.
For then all other forms of
Prayer, which are like rivulets and
little streams, should retire into this
Prayer, as they into the Ocean to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93040:27"/>
their imperfections. One thing I
shall add more, and that concerning
the brevity of it: for although vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
expressions are allowed to the
Soul in her passions for sin, which
when they are found in the concerns
of repentance, are most exceeding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God in Christ; yet that
is caused by the unaptitude of the
body to answer readily to the first
motions of the soul. And therefore
the soul cannot communicate her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
but by a longer successiveness of
discourse; but those that have most
evaded their passions, and are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
nearer to a ready use of their
noble faculties, may with the Lords
Prayer, perform the act of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
thoroughly, and obtain pardon
for their sins, with all temporal bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
without a fear, or groan, or any
farther enlargements of themselves,
and rise up as much advanced as any
others, in all the concernments of
their salvation.</p>

sake unto the end, that thou mayest
receive the end of thy hope, even the
salvation of thy soul; which upon
thy continuance in well-doing, thou
shalt most certainly accomplish, to
thy unspeakable comfort: but if thou
art a captive to the false, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
pleasures of sin, as I have been;
hearken unto me, who can upon too
too long an experience (Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
my many relapses) assure thee,
that what fair appearances soever sin
presents thee with in its first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
it will leave a sting behind,
and after the commission of every
sinfull act, thou wilt most certainly
be so far removed from God as the
greatness of thy sin was; and as the
testimonies of a good conscience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
so will the accusations of an evil
one come in their room, till insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
thou fall into horror and despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies
of spirit, one of the least of
which is far too dear a price for all
the pleasures the world can afford
thee. These are the entrances of Hell
into thy soul, upon the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93040:28"/>
of God, and spiritual consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
without which the soul lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth,
as the body fainteth upon
a decay of the animal, or vital spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
this must thou look for after
the continuance in any known, and
presumptuous sin, but if thou find it
not, thy condition is dangerous, for
the obduration, or hardening of the
heart is the threshold of Hell: look
quickly then and seriously into thy
soul; labour to get a sight of thy
sins in the Book of Conscience, whiles
they may be blotted out; pray earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly
to God for a true sense of them,
(for Prayer is the Key of Heaven;)
consider often of Death, Judgment,
Heaven and Hell; think how odious
the sin of ingratitude is between man
and man, and that unthankfulness
for the Blood of Christ is the highest
of that kind: think of the shortness
of mans life, and the great business is
to be done in that little life: that
thy short life is posting to an end; O
the folly, and madness of sin! it is a
continual acting against reason, a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93040:29"/>
up of wrath with the God of
all Power, a providing for the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Devils, and damned souls, who
will be cursing their Maker, and one
another to all eternity; 'tis that
which only is dishonourable to man,
a disturbance to Commonwealths; it
is the satisfaction of Devils (if they
could have any,) the trouble of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and blessed souls, nay, the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the Holy Ghost, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
murthering of the Son of God.
I have no design in this short Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
but the Glory of God, the
conversion of souls, and the dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of my own Conscience, by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
to as many as I can, the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of my former life, that so the
ill consequences of my example may
be in some measure repaired by this
publication of my self: and therefore
wish to that end that all may see this,
that saw my debauchery: and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
God to give me boldness in the
confession of my faults, and to make
me only shamefull of recommitting
them. Above all things I advise men


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93040:29"/>
to beware of immoderate drinking,
which dulls the understanding, and
makes the soul impatient of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation:
it disposeth vehemently to
the pleasures of sense, and to a gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
impertinent mirth; it precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to the acts of uncleanness, and
exciteth all the passions, exposing men
to many and daily hazards both of
soul and body, and rendring them
unfit for any employment, either in
Ecclesiastical or Civil Affairs. And
since it is so, that some mens bodies
by their temperament do require
strong drinks more than others, it is
not a total abstinence but a moderate
use of it which is expected: for which
end, I think it a very good rule, by
which to set some observable bounds
to drinking; that men would drink
so far as to cherish the stomach, but
not to the least elevation of the
brain; and the stomach is satisfied
with a small quantity, unless a man
lie under the cheat of a habit: but
when the spirits of the wine, or any
strong liquor, begin to mount up to


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93040:30"/>
the brain, from whence the soul doth
principally, and most immediately
act; the contemplative power begins
to be disquieted, and unfixt, and the
soul now to fluctuating, as it were,
and wavering in her motion, (her
best, and steady operations being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred)
pleases her self with being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
about outward things, and
trivial objects, and lies more expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the danger of frequent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations:
this which I speak of is but
the first change of the brain, when
it is altered from its usual tone and
composure; and although a man may
drink to this pitch, and yet carry ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
about him, and a favourable
correspondence with men, because his
tongue doth not falter, neither is his
understanding so obscured, as to fail,
at least in matters of common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse;
yet this person who hath done
nothing unacceptable to the world,
hath so changed the Scene within
himself, that he is now more at the
command of his sensual appetite, than
before, and his noble faculties begin


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93040:30"/>
to lean towards the world, and stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in the sight of God, though his
legs stand firm before the eyes of them
that see him: I appeal to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of any such plausible drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
whether they do not find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
more cold in acts of devotion,
more fond of outward pleasures, more
affected with the thoughts of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
honours, and the favour of great
men, more than the love of Jesus.
Whether the contemplation of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and the estate of their souls in
reference to that being, doth so well
relish with them at that time? If they
did so, why do they not wave a
Stage-play, and go to publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which are at that time? Why,
instead of going to a wrangling Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming-house,
do they not study the
game of Christianity, that they may
beat that experienced Gamester the
Devil, and win their souls, which
lye continually at stake, and are in
imminent danger of being lost? What
a sad thing is it that so noble a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as man, should rest in, and be


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93040:31"/>
contented with trifles, for whom are
prepared the glories of eternity, if
here he will take upon him the easie
yoke, and light burden of Christ?
Now although many men that drink
not, may, and do often these things,
and far worse; yet drink betrayes
them more easily to vanities, and idle
pastimes; therefore be carefull to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
this degree of drinking, and
thou wilt then be secure from the
scandalous sin of visible drunkenness,
which is the beastly consummation of
the former. I do not speak this to
perswade men from society, and
chearfulness; as if Religion, and
Mirth were things inconsistent; since
I know that true Mirth is found no
where else: But we do for the most
part mistake Mirth the most of any
thing, accounting that it consists in
laughter only; whereas properly a
man may be most truly merry when
he laugheth least: For none laugh
more than Idiots, and men of weak
understanding, and sensualists; while
men advanced in knowledge, and


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93040:31"/>
quieted in mind, by serious and due
reflections on themselves, do it but
seldom: but none will deny but the
latter sort have the greater cause for
mirth, and consequently must needs
be more truly merry: for true mirth
is a complacency of the mind, arising
from the apprehension of our perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
happiness; yet while we are in
the body, laughter is natural, and if
it be kept within its bounds, and
placed upon right subjects, is both al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable,
and conducing to health;
but is not tyed to the Glass, or Bowl.
This caution against drinking, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
those chiefly whose bodies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
strong drinks in some small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
(for none do much) since
those who are of another tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
will abstain without any mans
counsel, or any virtue of their own,
which is only seen where there are
propensities to the contrary; though
some men of this sort may contract
habits to themselves, contrary to the
first requisites of nature. I cannot
methinks disswade men enough from


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93040:32"/>
this sin, because I have so often drawn
others into it, and therefore hope to
make some reparation for the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
hurt I may have done them who
are yet living, whiles for those of my
associates who are departed this life,
I hope the mercies of God did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them: and I wish from my soul
that the spiritual dangers which I
have experimented, and do know to
be in that which we call good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
or a chirping Cup (two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
terms) and the great scandal,
besides the sin it self, which is in stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
drunkenness, may have such
an influence upon those who have
no account to make for any thing
that they have yet done as to this sin,
that they may never commit it; and
for those who have, and do yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in it, that considering the great
dangers attending upon it, which
(though now drown'd in the lavers
of the Grape) will one day rise up
and shew themselves to their terrour,
they may start from it with as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
apprehensions, while they may


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93040:32"/>
prevent the danger, as the reprobate
will do at Hell when time is past, and
he cannot escape it. For my own
particular, I have habituated my self
to this vice from my youth, and of
later years have continued in it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a misapprehension, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy
of my temperament being
Melancholy, which is cold, and dry,
it did require the supply of some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
heat to correct it: but I do
now think I have mistaken my self
all this while, since looking back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my beginning, I do not find I was
so when I was under tutelage; and
therefore do impute it to a habit
contracted since, and some interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
causes of discontent: but since
it is so easie a thing to be cheated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an ill custom, and so dangerous
to be under it, it behoves us to be
very vigilant against this adversary,
which comes in the shape of nature,
and hath such great advantages upon
us. Custom hath an interest in the
actions of the whole world; in good
men it disposeth them to goodness,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93040:33"/>
though the first Principle that moves
in them is a Principle of Grace; but
when the sanctified Soul hath made
some progress in a good life, custom
comes in, and promotes it, and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litates
our perseverance: in bad men
likewise it disposeth, and enclines
them the more strongly to vice; and
you shall find, that men who accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
themselves to a constant after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons-draught
in the week dayes,
seldomest go to an afternoons Sermon
upon the Sunday, if they go at all;
because the ill habit prevails so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the vitiated stomach must
have its false wants supplyed, though
the soul miss of her spiritual repast.</p>
                  <p>To prevent the contracting of this
habit upon such as are yet free, and
to set those at liberty who are ensla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by it, I shall propose this general
remedy; be alwayes employed in
lawfull exercises: It is an Epidemical
disease amongst the Nobility and
Gentry of this Nation, to be sick of
their time; which is such a burthen
to them, that being tired with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousness


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93040:33"/>
of the day, they must either
drink or trifle it away to avoid a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit;
this as it is a disparagement to
their judgments, so it is an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
detriment to their souls: for since
man hath a soul which must be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
sav'd or damn'd, he is a fool
that thinks he wants employment, and
he doth every minute draw nearer to
the ruine of himself; therefore let
none of us ever pretend that we want
business. If I have no accounts to
take concerning my estate, no Law-suits
to follow; though I am not a
Magistrate, or a Divine, though I
have no Office at Court, though I
have the Gout and cannot walk;
though I am blind, or shut up in a
dungeon from conversing either with
Men or Books, or whatsoever can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
me; yet still I have a soul which
is in her militant estate, and in the
worst of these conditions, I can do
acts of repentance, reflecting with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and detestation upon my sins
past, and renewing my purposes of
amendment: I can meditate upon


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93040:34"/>
Gods Mercies and all his Attributes;
I can perform acts of Praise to him:
and for those publick actions which I
cannot do if I am denied the liberty
of my body, and the society of men,
yet I can have them in <hi>voto,</hi> and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to do what I am denied, and so
I can keep on my journey to Heaven,
though I lie shakled in a dungeon.
But indeed employment is as general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mistaken as mirth; for most men
think they want it, if their time be
not spent in some bodily exercise, or
upon some slight or common subject;
but for meditation upon God and the
Soul, the concernments of it, that's
accounted a symptom of Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and reading, writing, or discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of any thing that is serious, or
profitable, which comes the nearest to
it. A great cause of this evil ariseth,
either from the carelesness of Parents
in not giving their Children a literate
education, or their own neglect of
improving it, when they are at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from their Tutors, or Parents, or
whoever had the charge of them:


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93040:34"/>
for as the Principles of Learning and
Knowledge do wear out, so the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in superficial things grows more
strong and prevalent; because the
knowledge of any one thing, and the
delight in it, alwayes go, and come
together; since we cannot take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in any thing which we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of: therefore Hawking, Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Horse-matches, Gaming, Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays,
and the like, are made the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of our time, in which our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
do terminate, which should on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be used to unbend the mind, and
give it relief after serious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and to exercise the body for
the preservation of health, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
subordinate to greater ends:
and this is one reason why Taverns
are so much frequented; because Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries
are out of request, and holy,
learned, or serious communications do
not relish with us. But this is not
sufficient to excuse them; for though
men either want education, or stifle
it, yet they cannot extinguish Reason,
and lose the Principles of Religion,


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93040:35"/>
which they have in their Catechisms,
in their Bibles, and by Preaching; and
therefore upon that account it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by God, that they yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to him proportionably to this
common, and general Knowledge;
which if any man fails to do, want of
education will not be a sufficient plea,
because it will be found to be an act
of his will, running contrary to these
degrees of Knowledge: if any man
shall say at the Tribunal of Christ,
that he spent his time in drinking,
and idle pastimes, because he was not
brought up to Learning, what will
that avail him, who did live under
the means of Grace, which were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for his salvation? for though
he had no knowledge in Tongues,
and Sciences, yet he knew the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God, and could not
plead ignorance in presumptuous sins:
and though he that cannot read and
understand Greek, or Latin; yet if
he can read English, let him spend a
part of his time in reading the Bible,
and other good Books: and though


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93040:35"/>
he cannot discourse in Natural or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Philosophy, or in the Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks,
nor much in practical Divinity;
yet let him speak within the limits of
his knowledge, let him reprove com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sins, and give all encouragement
to the generals of a holy life, both
by word and example: and if he be
sooner tired with discourse, than men
of greater knowledge would be; then
let him betake himself (as I advised
before) to some honest divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but not to any thing that
hath the least appearance of evil in
it; the result of this is, that whether
a man be literate, or illiterate, he
may serve God: and those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of our Nation that are not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Commonwealth of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
may yet be members of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Body of Christ: and though
their delight in great Studies, in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemical
Discourses and Meditations
are lost, proportionably to the decay
of their Knowledge; yet their time
may be the more spent in the <hi>Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
of Religion, and they may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93040:36"/>
a more frequent use of lawfull
recreations, but not of drinking, though
but to good fellowship; which though
the word sounds finely, a man can
hardly do it and secure his innocence:
but since the remedy of continual em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
is not sufficient for an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
drinker, he must unravel the
habit by little and little, to which the
shunning of idleness will very much
help him. To conclude, Let us be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to resist all the species and kinds
of sin whatsoever; for it is only sin
which can deprive us of the favour of
God, which if once we are excluded
from, we are eternally lost; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the sin of Drinking, which is the
unhappy Parent of all other sins, and
therfore the more carefully to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
which care if this short Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
may but stir up in one soul, I
should more rejoyce to know, than to
have the greatest honour of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conferred upon me. <hi>Now to God the
Father, God the Son, and God the holy
Ghost, be all honour, glory, praise and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration,
given by me, and by all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

                     <p>MY Fathers care was such as not
to deny me any thing for my
Education: I lived in my Fathers
House with my dear Brother under
two Tutors, the last of which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
arrived to a greater measure of
understanding, had a great affection
to. He was of an affable disposition,
and exprest great love to us, even
with tears at his departing from us:
he was very Religious, which I may
say was not unpleasant to me when I
was very young; but the Vice of
Drinking did soon overtake me by
the reason of some loose acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
who gave me an ill Example,
so that I began to go with them to
Alehouses, which did soon initiate me
in an ill habit, which was much sooner
taken up, than it could be since re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved:
Thus I continued till I was
about thirteen years of age, at which
time I went with my Father to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
which was then a Garrison;


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93040:38"/>
there I being alone with my Father,
was much in his eye, which did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
me very well from drinking:
being likewise sent to <hi>All-Souls-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
where a Gentleman read Greek
to me in the mornings, I had there
likewise a civil play-fellow, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Sanderson,</hi> with whom I spent
my time in harmless Recreations; but
afterwards being very desirous to go
along with my Cousin <hi>Martin Harvy</hi>
to his Quarters, not far from <hi>Oxford,</hi>
who Commanded a Troop of Horse,
and was willing to shew me the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and some part of the Army,
for which I was very importunate
with my Father; but he would not
suffer me to go from him, but carried
me along with him back again to his
Countrey-house in <hi>Surrey.</hi> But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
my Father went back again to
<hi>Oxford</hi> to wait upon the King, and
I was more at liberty again, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
again with my old Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
especially after the departure of
my Tutor, which was not long after:
but in the midst of my idle and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93040:39"/>
life, I had intermissions of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
not without some trouble;
my bashfulness, which I always had
in a measure more than ordinary, did
much incline me to drink, finding
that did embolden me: for which
reason I have wisht I had been
brought up at some publick School,
rather than in my Fathers House; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that strange company, and
being from under the tender wing of
my dearest Mother, I might have
been rouzed up, by being put more
to my shifts; and my bashfulness aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by being accustomed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of strangers. And indeed I
found manifestly, that being so much
confined to home, through the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fear, and love both of my Father
and Mother, bashfulness and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
did so gain upon and take
root in me, that it was always a
great disturbance to my life: I found
likewise my memory both slow, and
not retentive, occasioned by that fixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which was upon me, and that
occasioned by the want of business to


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93040:39"/>
employ my memory, and inform my
judgment, and excite my thoughts,
which contributed much to fix me
more in melancholy, and want of
confidence; which though not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
of by my Father and Mother,
yet I found manifestly in my self, it
was a great occasion of mischief to
me, and did expose me to a loose
life: But Lord, had I stirred up in
my self that stock of Grace, and
those Divine Principles, which were
infused into me by thy self, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of holiness and purity, and the
instiller of holy motions, thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
undoubtedly have come into my
soul with such controuling power as
would have reduced my disordered
mind to an obedience to thy heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will, the absence of which hath
bred in me so great matter of discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
but if thy goodness shall spare
me for so much future obedience as
may place me in the favour of thy
self, I shall more esteem it than thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of Gold and Silver.</p>
                     <div type="prayer">

                        <head>A Prayer.</head>
                        <p>I Desire, Eternal Jesus, to call upon
Thee from the depth of my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;
upon Thee, O Divinity incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
whose mercies are bottomless,
and whose Merits can bury the most
vast extuberances of repented sin
from the eye of thy Fathers Justice,
and secure the relenting sinner from
the stroke of his Omnipotent hand;
which nothing can intercept but thy
self, who art all, and whose intire
Obedience can answer all the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Divine fury, and out-wrastle
Justice when she makes her greatest
assaults. But O my presumptuous
soul! though it be true that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God in Christ exceed all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
and that there are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
springs of compassion, which
are ever flowing from the breasts of
his goodness; yet how can that avail
thee, while thou art bathing thy self
in sensuality, and courting thy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
lusts, who were the murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93040:40"/>
of the blessed Jesus; whom if
thou chase from thee, which thou
must needs do, if thou welcome thy
sins, she goes along with the blessed
Lamb, and never leaves him; where
he is, she is still to be sound; and had
not he come into the visible world,
she had never presented her self to
mankind, but they must have been
ever separated from the Glories of
Eternity: What can the best extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
cordial do to a man who is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
dead? neither can these cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
of salvation advantage thee who
art spiritually so. Most blessed Lord
make me a subject capable of thy
mercy by faith and repentance, for
else the preparations of thy mercy
will be my greatest misery; to see re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
at a distance, causeth a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishment
of the soul here, if she
have any residues of Grace while
mercy is not irrecoverable: but to
see her removed, when she can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
return, yet so many times offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the day of Grace, is the most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ingredient of eternal misery.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:93040:41"/>
Suffer me most glorious Jesus, who
am but dust and ashes, to speak unto
my Lord; and let me ask at the
mouth of wisdom, how it comes to
pass that my heart should pant after
thee now, and anon grow cold and
disobedient? can Christ and <hi>Belial</hi>
be inmates together? If I love thee
and desire thee above all things to
day, why do I leave thee next, since
thou art more delectable the second
day than the first, and the third day
than the second; since thy essential
sweets do not like those thou hast
created, glut the appetite, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the more gratefull the more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they are tasted? Oh it is my
original corruption which strives to
demolish those reparations of Grace
which are in my soul by thy death,
and to obscure those reinfused sparks:
But Lord let thy additional Grace,
joyned to that twinkling light which
yet remains in me, improve it to such
a flame by thy frequent supplies, that
by its light I may discover my sins;
and by its heat they may be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93040:41"/>
who would betray me into that
fire which should ever light me and
ever burn me, but never consume
me: Blessed Redeemer, I have not
onely my own inherent sinfulness,
and the spirit of spirits separated from
thy self to encounter withall; but
there is another cause in nature which
depresses my soul from rising up to
her Lord, the flesh which is ever
warring against the spirit; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the usuall evils of it, there is
more in me than the bodies of men
do often bring with them; thou
know'st it Lord, for thou made'st
me, and since thou did'st, I am si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
I know thou madest me to thy
Glory: what though I have more of
earth in the composition of my body
than others have, by which the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my animal and vital spirits is
obstructed; though my apprehension
and memory be not so quick and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive,
if I obey my Redeemer, and
hearken to his charms, the spirit of
Jesus shall inspire and quicken my
soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which if it be nimble and active


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93040:42"/>
in its correspondencies to the Rules
of Christ, I shall have a large amends
for the splene and dulness of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
But when I have been troubled
with the incumbency of this weight,
I have not looked up unto my bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Jesus, whom I might have seen
through my thickest blood; since
that excellent spirit which I am by
Creation, doth not require the body
to its sublime operations; but instead
of this most injured Saviour, I have
run to thy Creatures for help, yet
that I might have done, for they had
not been but to preserve my being,
and support my natural life; but ah
wretch that I am, I have made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
use of them, and turned thy
blessings into my own curses instead
of putting my soul into a more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
estate for thy glory, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
the disproportions of my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament,
I have defaced her beauty
with intemperance, and exposed her
to the assaults of Lusts, and Devils:
But Oh most meek and mercifull Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
though I made a resignation of


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93040:42"/>
my self, thou didst not give me away
by substracting the residues of thy
Grace, but my spirit even in her most
deliberate aberrations from thy Rule,
was the object of thy infinite mercy;
and as thy Apostle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Peter</hi> in his
diffidence was supported by thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
extended Arm from being
drowned in the sea of waters, so was
my soul secured by thy stupendous
compassion from being overwhelmed
by the consequences of my sin: Most
dear Jesus, inflame my soul I beseech
thee so with thy love, that being set
on fire with thee, it may like unto
these elementary flames which thou
hast made, be still tending upwards
in heavenly aspirations, till its desire
shall arrive to a most happy fruition.
Sweet Jesus my Redeemer, pardon
thy Creature who dare thus to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate
with thee; the enquiries into
Men and Books return upon us with
a retinue of errours, unless we come
to Thee who art the Oracle of Divine
Truth: It is most true, Lord, that we
must use those means to attain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93040:43"/>
which thou hast laid before us;
and not dream for infusions of truth
to drop from thy treasures of wisdom
into the gaping idleness of our life;
such Enthusiastick Spirits must know
their ignorance of the value of truth,
that it should be so poorly attainable
before they can be in a capacity of
further information.</p>

                        <p>O Eternal and most merciful Lord
God, whose eyes are alwayes
upon the Children of men; look
down I humbly beseech thee upon
me, who in great distress of mind,
and anguish of spirit, do here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
my self both soul and body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy Divine Majesty, beseeching
thee (who art the God of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation)
to assist and comfort me
thy poor Servant (though exceeding
sinfull) with refreshments from thy
self, and let thy heavenly support be
alwayes ready to hold me up, that I


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93040:43"/>
may not sink under the burthen of
sad and melancholy apprehensions
which so incessantly oppress my soul:
Lord, let thy holy spirit from above
so raise my dejected spirit from the
depth of sorrow, and frightfull ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
which do continually as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
me. Dear Father, I confess, that
my life hath been a continual reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of sin, and daily repetition
of all wickedness and impiety; that
time which should have been mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
out in praising and magnifying
thy holy Name, hath been spent in
the service of Satan that grand ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of thy Truth and our Salvation;
I have made a profession of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in outward appearance, but have
denied the power thereof, as if I had
favoured Religion for no other end
but to preserve my Name from scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
and reproach; and so O Lord
have preferred my own temporary
credit before the honour of thy holy
Name, and my own eternal safety;
all the sins that in thy decalogue for
a Christians life thou hast forbidden


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93040:44"/>
to be done, do I stand guilty of O
Lord; and all the duties thou hast
commanded thy people to perform,
O Lord, I have neglected, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the judgments thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against sinners, O Lord, I
have most justly deserved: so that
most righteous God when I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thy Justice recorded in thy sacred
Word, and then behold my own sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
which I cannot see but in the
same glass, I find such a dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that nothing is then left to me
but the expectation of thy everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
displeasure: But dear Father, if
thou whose most pure eyes cannot
behold the least sin with approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
should'st strictly enquire into the
Lives of men, even the best men; and
be extream to mark what they have
done amiss, none were sufficient to
stand before thee and endure thy
touch, for there is none that doth
good, no not one: But thou Lord
hast another look wherein Mercy
reigns in abundant measure, and casts
so sweet regards towards the souls of


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93040:44"/>
repenting sinners, as can in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
raise them from death to life,
for which we bless thee, for which
we praise thee O sweet Jesus the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and finisher of our salvation,
who hast satisfied thy Fathers wrath,
and hast given us access by Grace
through thy infinite merits; and here
O Lord I am emboldened to renew
my petition, first, for the pardon of
all my sins past in his blood, and then
dear Father for all spiritual blessings
and temporal which thou seest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
for me; but especially, O
Lord, in this Prayer, I beg for a
chearfull heart, without which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
serve thee as I ought, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed
to those holy Duties which
thou requirest from me by the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency
of sadness, and a disturbed
phantasie, strange fears and deep ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
do take hold upon me, but
remove them I beseech thee, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
in me the fear of thy Name, and
no other fear, sorrow or sadness for
having sinned against thee; that I
may be alwayes merry in Jesus Christ,


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93040:45"/>
and may run with chearfulness the
race which thou hast set before me:
Lord hear me for the sake of thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Son, and my sweet Saviour, let
my prayers and daily cryings come
before thee, but let my sins be never
heard, O Lord; I will ever be lifting
up my voice unto thee, Lord send
me comfort from thy Holy Place, that
while I live in this world, I may be
a comfort and a delight unto my self,
and not a burthen, but above all
things, a persevering Christian through
Jesus Christ. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <hi>BElzebub</hi> the Lord of Flies (as
his Name signifies in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew)
is with his swarms of
revolted spirits continually
buzzing about the Souls of Men, and
suggesting to our minds falsities for
truths: perswading us, that not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
but External things are the
matter of true Pleasure, that so cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
us to erect our hopes upon a
rotten foundation, at the time of our
death when that shall fail, the stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
may fall to the ground, nay,
much lower, even into the Abyss of

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:93040:48"/>
The sad issues of this suggestion,
are much promoted by our Essential
consistency of Spirit and Body: the
material, and bodily part always dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
us to the pursuance of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, contrary to the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the Intellectual. But since
the depravation of Mans Will by the
fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> we are united to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and need not a Tempter to
lead us out of the way; for both the
Principles of our Being do now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us to wrong Objects: therefore
to lay open this grand Fallacy, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a matter of so great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as is the Eternal happiness or
perdition of Men; let us examine
what is requisite to the constituting
of true Pleasure. To the making up
then of true and real Pleasure, I shall
lay down these three Conditions as
requisite: First, That the Object be
suitable to the Soul. Secondly, That
the Soul be put into Fruition of this
suitable Object. Thirdly, That the
perpetuity of this Fruition be ensur'd
to it. Now let us enquire, whether


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93040:48"/>
External things, considered simply in
themselves, and not relatively, as they
have respect to greater ends, have
these three Conditions in them, or
no. First then: Is any External thing
an Object suitable to the mind of
Man? I answer, That no External
thing is: because they all want two
Qualifications which are requisite to
make an Object suitable to the mind;
the first of which is, That it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal
and of the same nature with
the Soul: that is, a substance imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
or spiritual. The second, that
it have in it a sufficiency to gratifie
all the Appetites of the Soul. First,
No outward thing is immaterial, or
spiritual, for a spiritual substance
comes not within the notice of our
senses: and though in Scripture we
read of the appearing of Angels, as
three to <hi>Abraham,</hi> two to <hi>Lot,</hi> one
to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> another to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter:</hi> yet
this must be suppos'd to have been
by the assumption of bodies, to which
they were united, not essentially, but
occasionally, and <hi>pro tempore:</hi> for in


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93040:49"/>
other places the Scripture tells us
what their natures are; calling them
Spirits, <hi>Psal. 104. vers. 4. Heb. chap.
1. vers.</hi> 14. and although I find no
decisive Text, for that Opinion of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that there is a
Tutelary, and a seducing Angel, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
upon every Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and likewise Children, which
was indeed held amongst the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
under the terms of <hi>bonus,</hi> and
<hi>malus Genius;</hi> yet it speaks indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. that <hi>they are all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
Spirits for the Elect:</hi> but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their presence appears
not to them, when they come in
their own Natures. So likewise the
Souls of Men are not within the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of our senses, being Spirits, and
incorporeal substances, as Angels are:
for which we have the testimony of
Scripture; Man was made after the
Image and Similitude of God. But
since the sense of these words, Image
and Similitude, is much controverted
in the Schools, let us look into the
twelfth of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> at the ninth


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93040:49"/>
verse, <hi>Furthermore, we had fathers of
our flesh which corrected us, and we
gave them reverence, shall we not much
rather be in subjection to the Father of
Spirits, and live?</hi> where Souls are
called Spirits in opposition to flesh.
Besides the Testimony of Scripture,
we have a demonstration of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the death of every Man, for
though the Soul be separated from
the body, yet the standers by see it
not: we hear nothing but the groans
of the dying person caus'd by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Parts; we feel nothing but a
coldness in the extremities of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
caused by the cessation of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
we smell nothing but a putrid
savour caus'd by the corruption of
humours, neither do we tast any
thing: On the contrary, all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and corporeal things are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to some one of our senses: for
instance; though we cannot hear the
Light, we can see it; though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see the Air, we can feel it; and
though we taste not the white of an
Egg, yet we can see it, or feel it;


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93040:50"/>
and though we cannot smell a piece
of Glass, yet we can likewise see it,
or feel it; and so of all material
things that are at a due distance from
the organs of our sense. And here
before we look into the second thing
requisite, let us examine why it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that the Object be of the same
nature with the Soul. Thus then;
the Soul of Man being immaterial,
that which makes it happy by the
fruition of it self, must likewise be
immaterial, for as it is a fundamental
in Physick, that Nutrition is made
by Similaries: so likewise is this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
true in the Metaphysical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
between the Soul, and the
Object; it cannot receive a proper
supply from any thing that doth not
bear an affinity with it in its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and qualities. This recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
delight between Parties is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable
in every species of Created
Beings, and in every action in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura
naturata.</hi> In Physicks, flame
and flame embrace one another; but
a furious conflict ariseth from the


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93040:50"/>
convention of fire and water: in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
goodness accords with goodness,
but vice will not be suffered to dwell
with virtue: and in the Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
action of the contemplation of
the Soul, we see experimentally, that
she cannot content her self with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Objects, but is still seeking to
her self some more excellent matter
of delight: which desires of the mind
intelligent men may take notice of
in themselves, if they will be self-observers.
This appetite of the Soul,
is the reason why <hi>Solomon</hi> was not
contented with all his clusters of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights;
though he turn'd over the
whole world, as it were, yet he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
not to the summ of his desires,
but still there remained in his spirit,
an appetite after something more than
any exteriour thing could furnish him
withall: so that at last he openly
proclaims them all to be (excuse the
catachresis) but full of emptiness. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
saith of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> that he
delighted to talk of laying down the
Scepter, and of betaking himself to a


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93040:51"/>
recluse life. And we read that the
Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth resigned
up the Low-Countries and <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
and afterward all the rest of his
Dominions, to his Son <hi>Philip</hi> in his
life-time. And of the Emperour <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius,</hi>
that he delivered up the charge
of the Empire to his two Sons <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
and <hi>Honorius,</hi> though with
power to resume it, which he never
did: and many other precedents of
the same kind doth History present
us withall, of which it is reasonable to
think, that it was not only the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
which usually attend Crowns,
caused this in them (others being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to bear the greatest burdens in
that kind) but rather, that all their
enlargements could not present them
with any thing agreeable to those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
appetites of their minds: and
this dissatisfaction there is in all the
entertainments of sense: by which it
appears, that the great capacities of
the Soul can never be filled up with
these lean, and scanty Objects: and
whiles that Capacity is unsupplyed,


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93040:51"/>
there will be a coveting of those
things which are the proper Objects
of its nature, and so long as there is
that appetite, the mind cannot be
said to enjoy true pleasure. But here
I expect to have it objected to me,
That upon this account, the Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Man, as well as the Sensualist,
cannot be said to enjoy true Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
because the former as well as
the latter, hath not while he is in the
body his appetite satisfied: To this
I answer, That when the mind is
once set right, and hath made a
choice of that which is intrinsecally
good, and suitable to its nature; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
it begins to enjoy true
Pleasure: because although it do still
desire more, yet doth it not covet
any thing better or of a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
nature, than it hath already tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, so that the desires of the mind
are stopt <hi>quoad rem;</hi> because it doth
not covet any thing contrary to, or
desperate from what it hath already
pitch't upon; but not <hi>quoad mensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
rei,</hi> because it desires to be put


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93040:52"/>
into a full fruition of that, which it
now enjoys but in part: upon which
account the Kingdom of Grace and
Glory, seem not to me to differ o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
than gradually; so that the
Spiritual man hath something of that
he desires, but not all: yet so much
as he hath sufficeth to bring him true
Pleasure; though not to make up
the integrality of it: while the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Man pursuing a wrong Object,
cannot possibly while he doth so, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at true pleasure. The second
thing requisite to constitute, or make
an Object suitable to the mind, is,
that it have wherewithal to gratifie
all the appetites of the Soul: but
no external thing can accommodate
the mind with more than it hath in
it self, that is, it cannot entertain it
with spiritual delights: how far short
will it prove then of satisfying the
Soul with all it is capable of in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals?
this being more than any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Intelligence can administer to it:
for though we find many excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in Angels, and the Souls of Men,


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93040:52"/>
by the reason that they are intelligent
Natures, yet they have not that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
in them which is requisite to
an Object that is in all respects sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the mind; which must not
only present it with something spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and incorporeal, but likewise
with whatsoever it can covet within
the genus of spiritual and immaterial
existencies; and this nothing can do,
but that satiating Plenitude, which is
only to be found in God: which
appears to be true by that propensity
which Men of large apprehensions
have to enquire into those remote
Truths which yet they cannot see
clearly into: there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
Rom. 1. 19. which hath such a
Magnetick virtue in it, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
drawing the Soul towards it
self, neither will the Spirit of Man be
ever at rest, till it be united to the
Son of God, and put into a full frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Deity. How do we hear
even young Students wrangle about
the dividing of a body into so small
parts, and that it is not capable of


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93040:53"/>
further division? for not conceiving
how it can be, that so long as there
remains something in quantity, that
quantity should not be capable of
being separated, at least <hi>Intellectu,</hi>
though not <hi>Actu,</hi> and yet not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
how a body can admit infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
separations, they are still search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into this Abstrusity which remains
with God. What Battologies have
we about Free-will and respective
Decrees? not being able to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
between the precognition of
God, and his concurrence of voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or necessitation? how are we
prying into the mystery of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation?
into the nature of the
Trinity? there are certain <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of to be in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles; which although they
are <hi>things hard to be understood,</hi> yet
are we still coveting to comprehend
them; which aspirations of the Soul
do shew, that it was created for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of a higher concernment, than
any created substance can furnish it
withall from themselves: for such


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93040:53"/>
things are to be found only in God,
inhesively, or subjectively, but they
may be communicated to us by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
who know them either by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,
or divine infusion: and
these tendencies of the mind, are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to me, that the Soul of Man
is capable of apprehending those ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
Truths, which it so covets
to know while it is in the body;
because our pressing to know, seem's
to me to be an immediate effect, of
our wanting, or being ignorant of
something which our minds are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of: and therefore Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
spirits cease to desire more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their capacities are fill'd; which
is perfect Happiness <hi>ad modum reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientis.</hi>
But it may be objected, That
the Angels which fell desired to be
equal with God, but it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
it should be so, therefore we
must not measure our capacities by our
desires. To this I answer: First, that
I do not believe they ever did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
it must seem to be below the
extent of their knowledge, which


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93040:54"/>
reached to so vast a height, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
with the least hopes such a chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
Ambition, but rather that their
Lapse did arise from a spleen, and
malice to God for advancing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
so high: or if it could be so:
we must distinguish between an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due,
and vitious, and a natural, or
necessary act of the will: I'le sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their's to have been an audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and arbitrary willing of that
which was <hi>ipso facto</hi> destructive to
their happiness; but these propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of our Souls, which God hath
so infused into us, that we cannot
suppress them, are continual willings
as it were against our wills, and are
therefore natural, and to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, as the effects of our present
defective state, and these I am indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to believe, will hereafter attain
to, what they have strain'd for here.
But not to make any farther digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
Let us enquire into the second
thing requisite to true Pleasure,
which is fruition. It is not enough
that there is in nature an Object sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93040:54"/>
to the mind, but there must
be such an application of it to our
persons, as may make us true Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors
of it: and here I cannot say
exclusively, that there is no fruition
in the Pleasures of sense, for were
there not, the Devil would have no
train at his heels, but they will be
found to be very inconsiderable, and
equivalent with none at all. And
first let us consider the Glutton, who
makes not that the end of eating
which he should, namely the support
of his natural life; as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>

How soon doth his sweet bit

and although he puts in another,
and another, yet it cannot be long
e're his stomack will be filled, and
then he must cease repeating it, till
Nature or Art have disposed of the
Load after a Scene of sick Qualms:


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93040:55"/>
in the mean time the whole Machine
is out of frame, especially the Brain
which can least be spared, and he
fitter to converse with the same Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Creatures wherewith he hath
filled his paunch, than with Men to
whom he bears but an outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
in the manner of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension,
and figure of his body. How
momentany is the lascivious man's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light!
he looks on a Woman, and
lusts after her: if he gain not his
purpose, her face is looked upon by
him, with an impetuous Lust, and
discomposure at her Chastity, so that
her presence is a positive torture to
him: if he gains her consent; his
furious lust hurries him to that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
act, where his fruition like a
flash of lightning, dies in its birth,
even in the midst of an impatient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.<note place="margin">Arist. Eth. lib. 7. cap 12.</note>

likewise the Miser, how narrow is his
Heaven! he procures his Money with


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93040:55"/>
bodily pains, hazard, and base sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
and the far greater part of
his time being usually run out before
he comes into his Kingdom, his reign
is very short; and although the fear
of not arriving to it, be vanisht, yet
the fear of loss, which is greater, rises
up in the place of the former, besides
the apprehension that so small a part
of his life remains to him, for the
enjoyment of what he has procured
with so much difficulty. The Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
man what enjoyment has he?
who after much busling in the world,
many dangers escaped, much expence
it may be of his purse, gains his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Honour, and then holds it in
Pride, which is a great pain to him
that gives entertainment to that Vice;
because his Reverence seldom, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
answers his expectation: for the
Wise and Virtuous, (who are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
part of the world) cut off
their respects to him, out of a just
disesteem of his Person, or it may be
out of charity to him; that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard
he meets with, may be to him


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93040:56"/>
as a Julep, to allay the Feaver of his
Pride; giving him only precedency,
his Title, and the compellations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it, out of Duty to the
King who hath conferred them upon
him. From the immorigerous Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Gentry, 'tis likely he receives
none at all; because their uncultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
stoutness will not stoop to any
circumstances of observance; and as
for the common scrapings that are
made to him, he values not those sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions,
because of the meanness of
the Honourers; it being a good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Thesis, that, <hi>Honor est in hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante.</hi>
And now for the good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
(as they are call'd,) what Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
have they? By the raising of the
Animal spirits to an undue pitch, they
draw down their Souls; the Soul and
the Body being in this case like a pair
of Buckets in a Well; as one rises,
so t'other sinks, and being fallen from
the delight of a sober Speculation, to
the pitifull ticklings of an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
mirth; what with broils, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from mistakes incident to such


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93040:56"/>
fantastick converses, or else the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
of a drowzy intoxication, he
hath very little time to enjoy his

saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Chrysostome;</hi> Intemperance
ends in nothing, or at least in no
good, which in the sense of the
Schools, is nothing: but those pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
or nothings, will I presume
in the end, from the sad consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that issue immediately from them
be concluded to be positive, and that
Mens Souls are not positively damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for doing nothing. But here it
may be objected: That although
there be little, or no pleasure in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
yet in the moderate use of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things there is. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
that there is indeed more, but
even this will be found to be very
inconsiderable: For External things
considered as they stand alone, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which notion I still consider them
in this discourse) and being not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
in reference to greater ends, yield
but very little Fruition to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents.
And one cause of this is,


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93040:57"/>
in that they alwayes glut
the mind by reason of
the deficiency of their
being.<note place="margin">The first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son taken from the deficiency of their being.</note> If a man would
please the sense of seeing by looking
upon a handsome Woman; when his
eye by often repeated searches (since
all the lineaments of Beauty were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
confined to the precincts of one
face) hath discovered all the attracts,
and impresses, with all the variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Aspects occasioned by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
motives either from within, or
from outward objects, till at last he
is entertained with nothing but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
returns of what he had seen
before, the disposedness of the mind
to a perfect object, makes him covet
to see some circumstance of Beauty,
which is not comprehended within
the Scene of that Womans person:
from whence presently ariseth dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
namely from the objects
insufficiency which is inconsistent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the duration or solidity
of Pleasure. Therefore Conjugal fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delities,
are restraints put upon the


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93040:57"/>
mind, whereby a man resolving to
comply with the Divine Will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinds
the irregularities of his own.
If we run through the whole series
of outward things we shall find them
so: whereas on the contrary, as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
tells us, <hi>Magis Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas

Outward things have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
great perplexity in
them,<note place="margin">A second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son drawn from their multiplicity.</note> which the Sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list
often meets with, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
from the Multiplicity of them:
and that is, many of them present
themselves to him at once, and
though they all differ from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in their kinds, yet many times
they are equal in their attractiveness,
and influence upon him; so that
many times he is put to a stand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Election, which is a pain
to him because it detains him from
Union; for where there is a love of
any thing, there is a desire of being


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93040:58"/>
united to it: but after a troublesom
pause, the mind fixeth upon one:
not because there is a decision made
of the question, and that the debate
is ended, which of them deserves
most; but because it is better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
one than none: so that all the
rest of them, being equally approved
of, he carries the Idea's of them all
in his fancy, though he do actually
enjoy but one: which Impresses and
Images in the Phansie, being many
in number, and likewise fresh, and
lively, draw him as forcibly to those
which he hath left (their number,
and the lively traces of them which
remain in the Memory, being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to this one, though present) and
thus is he set upon a Rack in the
midst of his fruition, and so much
the more, because the present enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
falls short of expectation: which
is another evil in outward things,
that they never give so much as they
promise:<note place="margin">A third reason, their false Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</note> for which there
are two reasons: The
first is, <hi>à parte Animae,</hi>


                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:93040:58"/>
because the preliminary, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
apprehensions, which the Soul
hath before enjoyment, do ever an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
more excellency and solidity
than is to be found in the object.
The second reason is <hi>à parte Rei,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all outward things are more in
appearance, than they are in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and acutual probation: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because the Soul looking on
them in their approach, and doting
on the gains which is coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, concludes they are as
thick in substance, as ravishing in
their anterior fairness; but after they
have met, and embraced, she finds,
that they are both in haste to be
gone, and are but a bare frontispiece
of Beauty; like the Portraictures of
Kings and Queens, painted upon a
flat, which behind, are nothing but
dusty canvase.<note place="margin">A fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son drawn from the minds self-accusation.</note> Another
thing which doth much
lessen the pleasure of
them, is, that the Soul in
her reflex actions, is still accusing her
self, and thus expostulating with her


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93040:59"/>
self: Why am I thus conversant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
transient things? how long have
I sought for true pleasure, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in them but cannot find it?
certainly I was design'd for matters
of a higher concernment; since I
find I can look above them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
them: how do I dishonour
those noble Objects, and injure my
self in descending to these mean en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments?
These and the like
contrariant thoughts, are a great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
to those imaginary pleasures, and
being mixt with the enjoyments, give
them a very disgustfull relish. These
circumstances well considered, will
I suppose very much shrink up that
bulk of delight, which to the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
fancy seems to be united to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things before enjoyment: even
within the limits of Moderation,
when it is distinct from Virtue. Let
us now look into the third Postula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
or circumstance required to
make up true pleasure, which is the
certainty of its Duration. The death
of all men is so confirmed to us by


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93040:59"/>
Arguments <hi>à parte ante,</hi> besides the
Physical reasons which are produced
for the necessity of it, that he that
should question the continuation of
it <hi>à Parte post,</hi> may carry about him
his Phantastick head, to dispute it
by himself, till it be laid at rest in its
own Grave, to receive conviction.
Here then the question is, Whether
the Sensualist hath any firm ground
of hope for a reversion of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
after Death. The Alchoran
makes fair promises to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that they shall meet with sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Pleasures again in the next
world, and if any Voluptuous man
shall presume to urge the authority
of it, he is but that in profession
now, which he was before in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:
But I do assert the contrary,
that it is impossible, that the Sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list
should be re-estated in the same
Species of delight, in which he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced
himself during his temporal life,
or in any other, from reasons Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
Moral and Theological. First
then; the body will most certainly


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93040:60"/>
at its re-union with the Soul, exist
after a manner as much different
from this which is temporal, as to be
eternally durable, differs from being
dissoluble, or in a state of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for eternal duration being that
Divine Boon which shall be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon the <hi>Totum Compositum,</hi> the
entire person of man both Soul and
Body; the Body which is the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
part, and which will be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
or intermediate cause, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God the Efficient, of its own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
being by the wisdom of God
fitted with those affections, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
which shall be requisite to
that great end of Eternal duration,
will in degrees proportionate to those
future consequences, differ from it
self, as it is now under a state of
corruption. For take any two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Effects in Nature, and it will
be found, that the proximate, and
immediate causes of them, do differ
between themselves in the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that the Effects do: <hi>Ex. Gra.</hi>
Take a piece of Wood and a piece


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93040:60"/>
of Iron; both of them smooth, and
of the same figure, and bigness; the
Wood swims, the Iron sinks: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
to the speediness of the
Irons sinking, it must differ in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity,
or closeness of parts, from the
Wood which swims. This simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
is very Analogical, and by the
same reason the consistency of the
Body in the state of Glory will as
much differ from its consistency
here, as the consequences of dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and dissolution do, these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likewise two Effects of two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
causes. Now then to come
to the thing that is to be proved:
therefore the objects of Pleasure
must be likewise disparate from, if
not adverse to what we meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
here, because these here are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
of which nature there will
be nothing after Death: For the
Body and the Soul being made du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to all Eternity, it is most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to think that all their Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Accommodations must be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
too; for else there would not


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93040:61"/>
be a completion of happiness, there
being a discrepancy between the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient,
and the object. But to go
a step farther: That a Sensual man
should meet with his old ones, or
any other sort of Pleasures after
death, is oppugnant to the precepts
of Morality. By a Sensual man I
mean, such a one, as makes the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of corruptible things his
ultimate end, whether under a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of moderation, or of excess:
and the word excess is to be taken
in a double consideration; either
excess as to the quantity
of the thing,<note place="margin">Excess as to the quantity.</note> or excess
as to the propriety of
the thing. First, let us consider the
person exceeding as to Quantity:
The Miser never hath pelf enough
to satisfie his avaritious mind; for
he is alwayes coveting more, while
his thoughts, and appetite do ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
in Gold, and Silver as the
ultimate object they aspire to: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he loves nothing beyond that,
or above it; for if he did, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93040:61"/>
of that would in process of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ime
cease, and he would desire some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beyond it, or above it, since
desire is a necessary effect of Love,
issuing immediately from it, as from
its proximate, and contiguous cause:
if then he loves nothing beyond it,
or above it, he sins against his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Conscience, which still presents
the Deity to him, as an object which
only merits the whole stream of his
affections; for ignorance of which
he hath no plea, since the universal
voice of nature proclaims a Divine
power; and in this every man is a
<hi>Plato</hi> to himself. Here then is a
Moral Trespass, or the Commission
of an Act against the secret impresses
of Nature. Now the mind present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enters into consideration, whether
it ought to run counter to these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
habits, or not: if a thought
propounds to it that it may; it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
asks, why then these Notions
were Imprinted in it? either they
were given in vain, or else that they
should be practised: If in vain; that


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93040:62"/>
clashes with a Moral Axiome, <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
semper agit propter finem;</hi> if to be
practised, then an accusation of Guilt
ensues: and from thence naturally
arises, not an expectation of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but of Mulct, from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Justice of that first Cause which
fixed these Principles in the Mind.
So much then for excess in Quantity
that I may avoid the surplusage of
Argument. In the next
place,<note place="margin">Excess as to Propriety.</note> I must take a view
of the Person who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
as to Propriety. Every Soul
not obstructed by some bodily De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
is created with apprehensions
and faculties able to discriminate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
common right, and common
wrong. For instance: To take any
thing from another man which he
holds by just right either of Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or of Legal descent; this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be apprehended by any clear
mind to be Morally Evil, that is, an
Action of such a nature, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
justifie the doing it by right
Reason. So is it in all cases of force,


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93040:62"/>
where men intrench upon that to
which they have not this Natural
Right: for I cannot trace Right or
Propriety farther than the first Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session:
whence, I see yet no reason
so valid to the contrary, as this is,
to make me conclude that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toplast
was Lord and Monarch of the
Universe, he being not only actually
seized of it, but having likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
an unlimited Commission from
God to exercise Authority over all
things as we may read <hi>G. C.</hi> 1. from
<hi>vers.</hi> 26. to the end: from whence it
appears, that absolute Monarchy was
the first Power that overlooked the
earth, and that it was afterwards
propagated in the world, (though
not individually, or under one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for the whole) as we may col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
from the Prerogatives which the
Kings of the Nations had in the time
of <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. Cap. 8.</note> (a place ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Salmatius</hi> in his
<hi>Defensio Regia)</hi> whereas there are no
forms of stipulated Government but
appear to be accidental, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93040:63"/>
by reason of succeeding dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions,
arising from great Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of men. But to return to my
purpose: If then there are such pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Aphorisms, and simple Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Truth, fixed in the Soul from
its first Creation, that man cannot
but rationally conclude himself an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
against that Eternal Truth
from whence these communicable no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were at first derived, who goes
contrary to them doth ill: for, as I
said before, either these Principles
are implanted in us in vain, or else
that we would conform our selves to
them: to say it was in vain, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely
to impute to God the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Ideots and Children, who do
Actions insignificant, and to no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
end or purpose; if then
they were given to be put into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
a mans natural Conscience must
of necessity bring him in guilty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his deviation from these rules; but
Guilt cannot expect a reversion of
the same, or an accession of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of Pleasures after death;


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93040:63"/>
but on the contrary, consigns the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent
to a certainty of future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment:
and if in the third place
any man shall say, that these Notions
were infused into us purposely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us, his objection deserves no
answer, it being so horrid and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Having spoken of excess I am
now to examine what attends upon
the moderate use of outward things;
and in short, the moderate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Sensualist will miss of future
happiness, because his love doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
in the thing: for 'tis not the
extravagancy of the Action, but the
proposed end, which separates it from
being good; therefore the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
serves for both, since these
two persons differ between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
no otherwise than gradually,
for no specifick difference doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
from the inequality of bad and
worse.<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. And now to come to my
third Argument; If the Disciples of
Nature cannot but expect correction,
then by an argument <hi>à minore ad
majus,</hi> such as have been brought up


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93040:64"/>
in the School of Christ, and have
known Gods revealed will, cannot
but expect confusion for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults,
instead of the return of the
former, or of any other kind of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
for as the Scripture saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 12. v. 47.</note>
                     <hi>And that servant that knew,</hi> &amp;c. Thus
have I made a short inspection into
the Nature of Externals, shewing
that they have none of those three
conditions in them which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the constituting of true Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
First, that they are not Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
suitable in their Natures, much
less adequate to the mind, since to
make an Object adequate it is not
only requisite, that it be
immaterial,<note place="margin">Ens unum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; bonum.</note> but likewise
that it be Divine. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that although there be some
fruition of them, yet it is so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinded,
and so much complicated,


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93040:64"/>
that it is not to be reckoned of: and
thirdly, that it is but temporary and
ends in Death: and after death, the
result of sensuality is inevitable mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
when we look at outward things
as our ultimate end, not using them
rightly, as instrumental to the great
designs of Religion: much more will
they prove destructive to such as are
vicious to so great a degree, as that
they run into intemperances, and
make these outward things become
noxious to them by offending in the
manner as well as in the
measure,<note place="margin">Miser qui lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ad miseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am descendit si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut stultus ad crucem. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact.</hi>
                     </note> of using them,
and so go on sporting
to everlasting ruine: but
if we be carefull in both
respects to make a right
use of Outward things,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. v. 13.</note>
they will prove Salutary to us, since
every thing is delivered out good to
us, by the hand and verbal approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Creator; but our abuses
of them poison them, and make
them destructive both to our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93040:65"/>
and Spiritual Life, whereas
they were prepared by God to usher
in the solid joyes of an Eternal
world.</p>
