            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Articles of the Earle of Bristoll, whereby
he chargeth the Duke of Buckingham.
Dated primo Maij Anno. 1626.</head>
            <p>THat the Duke of Buckingham did se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
combine and conspire with the
<hi>Conde de Gondomar</hi> Ambassadour for the
King of Spaine, before his the said Ambassadors
last returne into Spaine 1622. to carry his
now Majesty then Prince into Spaine, to the end
that he might be informed and instructed in the
Roman Religion, and thereby have perverted
the Prince, and subverted the true Religion esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in England, from which misery this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
next under Gods mercies, hath by the
wise, Religious and constant carriage of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
bin almost miraculously delivered, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the many bold and subtle attempts of the
said Duke in that kind.</p>
            <p>2 That M. <hi>Porter</hi> was acquainted with it, and
sent into Spain, &amp; such Messages at his return fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as might serve for a ground to set on foot
this conspiracy, which was done accordingly, and
thereby the King and Prince highly abused, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61214:3"/>
their consents thereby first gotten to the said
journey, that is to say, after the returne of the
said M. <hi>Porter,</hi> which was about the end of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember
or beginning of Ianuary, 1622. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the said Duke had plotted it many moneths
before.</p>
            <p>3 That the Duke at his arrivall in Spaine
nourished the Spanish Ministers, not onely in the
beleif of his own, being popishly affected, but did
(both by absenting himselfe from all exercises
of Religion constantly used in the Earle of
Bristolls house, and frequented by all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
English, and by conforming himselfe to
please the Spaniards in diverse rites of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
even so far as to kneele and adore their
Sacraments from time to time) give the Span<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
hope of the Prince his conversion, which he
endeavoured to procure by all meanes possible,
and thereby caused the Spanish Ministers to
propound far worse Questions for Religion than
they had been formerly by the Earle of Bristoll,
and sir <hi>Walter Asten</hi> setled and signed under their
Majesties Hands, with a clause in the King of
Spaine his Answer of the twelfth of December,
Anno 1622. That they held the Articles agreed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61214:3"/>
upon sufficient, and such as ought to induce the
Pope to the granting of the dispensation.</p>
            <p>4. That the Duke of Buckingham having se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
times in the presence of the <abbr>Ea:</abbr> of Bristoll
moved and pressed his late Majesty at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the <hi>Conde de Gondomar</hi> to write a letter
unto the Pope, and to that purpose having once
brought a letter ready drawn, wherwith the <abbr>Ea:</abbr>
of <hi>Bristoll</hi> by his Majesty being made acquainted
did so strongly oppose the writing of any such
letter, that during the abode of the sayd Earl in
England, the sayd Duke could not attain it, yet
not long after the sayd Earle was gone, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
such a letter to bee written from his late
Majesty unto the Pope, and to have him stiled
<hi>Sanctissimus Poter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. That the Pope being informed of the Duke
of <hi>Buckingham</hi> his inclination and intention, in
point of Religion, sent unto the sayd Duke a
particular Bull in parchment for to perswade and
encourage him in the pervertion of his Majesty
then Prince.</p>
            <p>6. That the Duke's behaviour in <hi>Spaine</hi> was
such, that he thereby so incensed the K. of <hi>Spain</hi>
and his Ministers that they would admit of no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61214:4"/>
reconciliation nor further dealing with them,
whereupon the Duke seeing that the match
would now be to his disadvantage, he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to break it, not for any service to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
nor dislike of the match it selfe, nor for
that he found (as since he hath pretended) that
the Spanyards did not really intend the same
match, but out of his particular ends and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>7. After that he intended to crosse the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
he put in practise diverse undue courses, as
namely making uses of the letters of his Majesty
then Prince, to his owne ends, and not to what
they were intended, as likewise concealing
things of high importance from his late Majesty,
and thereby overthrew his Majesties purposes,
and advanced his own ends.</p>
            <p>8. That the D. of <hi>Buckingham</hi> as hee had with
his skill and artifices formerly abused their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties,
so to the same end hee afterwards abused
both Houses of Parliament, by finister relations
of the carriage of affaires, as shall be made apeare
almost in every particular that hee spake to the
sayd Houses.</p>
            <p>9. As for his scandall given by his personall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61214:4"/>
as also the imploying of his power with
the King of Spayn for the procuring of favours
and Offices which hee bestowed upon base and
unworthy persons for the recompence and hire
of his lusts, these things as neither fit for the Earl
of <hi>Bristoll</hi> to speake, nor indeed for the house to
hear, hee leaveth to your Lordships wisedomes,
how far you will be pleased to have them exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
it hath indeed been great infamy and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to this Nation, that a person of the Dukes
quality and imployment a privy Counsellor, an
Ambassadour eminent in his Majesties favour,
solely trusted with the Prince, should leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him in a Forreign Court so much scandal as
he did by his ill behaviour.</p>
            <p>10. That the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> hath been in
great part the cause of the ruine and misfortune
of the Palsgrave and his estate, in asmuch as those
affairs had relation unto this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>11. That the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> in his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to both Houses of Parliament wronged the
Earl of <hi>Bristoll</hi> in point of his honour by many si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
aspersions which he hath layd upon him,
and in the point of his liberty by many undue
courses through his power and practises.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61214:5"/>12. That the Earl of <hi>Bristoll</hi> did reveale to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
late Majesty both by words and letter in what
sort the Duke had deceived him, and abused his
trust, and that the King by severall wayes sent
him word that hee should rest assured that hee
would heare him, but that hee should leave it to
him to take his owne time, and thereupon few
days before his sicknesse hee sent the Earle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
that he would hear him against the Duke, as well
as he had heard the Duke against him, which the
Duke heard, and not long after, his blessed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
sickned and dyed, having in the interim <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
