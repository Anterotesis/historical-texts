            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>With these and the like fascinorous fancies, he wearied himself almost all that night, but Phoebus flinging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Rayes to illuminate the world, <hi>Soto</hi> resorted unto him, using all possible perswasion to asswage his grief, but (alas) to no purpose, for the Fistula of Love had seized upon his very fundamentals, so that though he grew every day more and more

healthy, being now able to eat and drink devoutly, and traverse his Chamber as nimbly as a Berkshire Squirrell, yet within he was more sickly then a Subburb Letcher, or a drawl'd Prostitute, fitting her self for Fluxation, which <hi>Soto</hi> perceiving, thought it his duty to take him to task, and to endeavour to drive this Devill of <hi>Paphos</hi> out of him.</p>
               <p>How now my Lord, said he, will you cast away that life which was given you to redeem others from death and destruction <note n="*" place="margin">The Author disclaims this Invective as none of his, but Soto's.</note> for a Fis-gig, a flurt, a sickle, fantastick, fallacious, foolish Female? What do we get by these Gim-cracks? Satiation of our Iusts: What is this fruition we so much covet, but a kind of fulsome Recreation, that flags our Crests, and makes us look worse then stale Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, or losing Gamesters that have sat up all night to undo themselvs? Be your self (my Lord) the Son of <hi>Mars,</hi> and not the slave of <hi>Venus;</hi> these whim-crown'd tumors un-man us all, and are at best but coveted ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.</p>

This Satyricall Oration so much prevailed with the Champion, that he was now quite changed into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man; his heart which before was as soft as Curds, is now totally petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide, and more obdurate then steel or Hangmen, so that he who some mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes since was Loves creature, is now more then his Conquerour; tis true, he shed abundance of tears, sighing and sobbing, as was pittifull to see; but these showers were but the prelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums to Thunder-cracks. My Arms (quoth he) O my Arms, my Sword, Shield, and Mace, but above all my Belt, the sad vicissitudes of two dayes have laid a foundation of misery for many Ages, bitten by a Bear, baffled by <hi>Gylo,</hi> reproached by <hi>Simplicia,</hi> and denuded by <hi>Don Pantalone;</hi> what hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour has Fortune yet to inflict? My Lord, said <hi>Soto,</hi> Fortune was ever a foe to noble minds, letting others pass as not worthy her notice; the tallest Trees and highest Towers are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times levell'd, when sheds and shrubs remain untoucht: Engineers are sometimes blown up with their own

Shloughes and Boggs, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise might have been very banefull unto them.</p>
               <p>Having brought this Land to a period, they found themselves ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into a large, but very pleasant Wood, here were Trees of Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, farre taller and bigger of bulk then any Brittish Elme, with Beds of Camomile six yards high, the Grasse no gowtier then that of other Climates, yet so incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly stubborn, that the CHAMPION and SOTO passed over their tops without the least depressing of them, as on a Marble Pavement: In the midst of this Grove there ran a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulet, not so Chrystalline as they could have wished, in which were infinite numbers of Flying-Fishes, which sometime fought with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in the Ayre with incredible fiercenesse, many being slain on both sides, but dropping into their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Element they are recovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>These Feuds were maintained by these Aquatillians, meerly to please

the Genius of the place, called <hi>Diclon,</hi> who sate (inviconed with a Guard of Spectars) at the root of a Palme Tree, but his shape was so dreadfull, that neither the Champion nor <hi>Soto</hi> durst stand him, and therefore they departed towards the East side of the Grove, where the Champion espied that rare Beast which <hi>Lamia</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantresse had prophesied he should meet withall; this wondrous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had the shape of a Hogg, but farre bigger then an ordinary Horse, two wings expanding themselves on either side of him; his Saddle (very sumptuously imbossed with Gold) on his back, and his Bridle hanging loosly about his neck; he was feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very voraciously on the verdant Grasse, his teeth serving as a Sickle with which he mowed down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p>The CHAMPION was so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with joy to behold this Beast, that he remained for a time speechlesse, but at length recovering himselfe; See SOTO, said hee, where the winged Hogg (that gift
