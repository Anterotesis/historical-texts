            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is true that I muste fyght todaye with the false

Wherfore I shall tell you what in shall do, you shall aduertyse the crysten men that is in the cyte that none of them yssue out: but kepe them in harneys without ony noyse. And whan y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> paynyms shall be without the cyte they shal take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of the gates, in suche maner that whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sarazins wolde entre in to the cyte, that you shytte the gates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste them. And bydde the crysten men sende kynge Pepyn worde of this fayte, and that he kepe his men in armes, to the ende that whan it shall be tyme that he come rennynge vpon the sarazyns, and they of the cyte shall assayll them on the other syde. And by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne they shall be slayne and vaynquysshed to daye. And whan Ualentyne had tolde this to the preest he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hym, and after his confessyon the preest departed, and wente his waye, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him to god.

Than they rode bothe two toward the chefe gate of Rome. For on that side Kinge Pepyn had layde the siege.

And swore by god almyghty, if ony of them touched Orson with swerd or knyfe, he should be his preest what someuer myght happen therfore.

At these wordes the messenger of the duke Sauary retorned in to Acquytayne and tolde the tydynges and the lettyng of the kynge Pepyn.

So he thought that suche a man myght neuer be founden. But such a child is vpon the earth that shal fyght wyth hym and vaynquyssh hym that is Orson the sauage as you shal here afterwarde The duke Sauary and the grene knight fought longe togyder.

And the good duke Sauery reclaymed God and the virgin Marye in hys herte. Whan the chrystan men knew that the duke was taken, they retorned into Acquitayne heuy and sorow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full.

Thus complained Fezonne full soore wepyng, the which had the wil and courage to haue slayne her self, but the ladies letted her And the grene knyght in hys pauyllyon that made the good duke to be brought before him, &amp; sayde vnto hym ryght fyersly.

So I wyl leaue to speake of thys mater and wyll retorne vnto kynge Pepyn that goth toward the forest for to saue Ualentyne and preserue him from death.

So it was not long after that the dytches were fylled with wodde. And after they ap proched nere the walles and entred in to the castell by force of armes. When they were within the castell they toke all the traytours and bounde them streighly.

I counsayl you that you retourne agayne with me. Syr sayde valentyne, for goddes sake pardon me, for I shall neuer retourne vnto the tyme that I knowe what I am, and of what place extraught. Wherfore I take hehe leue of you as he that woulde serue you to my power. At these woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des they departed. Here leue I to speake of the kynge

Thus goeth Ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine and Orson together toward the countrey of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitayne. All the worlde ran for to se Orson that was all naked and rough as a beer. Euery body did laughe at him but he set not therby. Then Uale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine made for to make him a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now it happened that as they passed vpon their waye Ualentine espied a right faire squyer that passed therby, the whiche wepte full tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

Alas sayd the squier of all this I haue no doubte, but knowe that the thyng that causeth me for to wepe is my maister that I haue lost, the whiche was the moste courteous the moste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, and the moste valiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that was vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth.

Ha syr sayde the squyer for God goo not thether, for yf you fyght with him you shall lese your payne, and you are so fayre a knyght that I neuer sawe none such. Lese not your lyfe for to fyght with that deuill, for I haue sene hym put so many noble men vnto death that I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue great doubte of you if you fyght with hym. Squyer sayde Ualentyne in to Acquytayne will I goo, and of the grene knight I shall knowe the truthe, &amp; if he haue euill cause agaynst hym wyll I fyght, but if I may I wyll speake fyrst with the fayre lady Fezonne, and doo after her counsayle. And when Orson vnderstode him he made sygnes vnto Ualentyne that he longed for to fyght with the grene knyght, and that he wold loue the fayre Fezonne. When valentyne vnderstoode hym for great ioye he laughed. Thus go the two brethren wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng through the countrey for to go vnto Acquytayne So they haue ryden so muche that they are aryued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syde the tyrie.

Yea truly saide Ualentine. A sir you vndertake a great foly, for you shal neuer haue victory on him. Mounte vpon this litle hyland be hold where as hangeth vpon a tree moo then forty that he hath put to death. There is no more then fiftene dayes of respyte that the duke of Acquitayne shalbe constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for to geue vnto him his doughter the fayrest of the worlde, the whiche shall be great dommage.

Thus as vale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine spake vnto this man an auncient man came to warde him in the habyte of a pylgrym euill clothed the which had a great whyte bearde, and was of the aege of four score yeare.

And when I shall haue foughten with the grene knyght, if God my creature geue me victory against hym I shall retourne in to Fraunce with you. And for the loue of kyng Pepyn I vndertake this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle for I am more beholden vnto hym then vnto any man liuing.

And whan he had reposed hym and was awakened he rose vp vpon his fete for to mount on horsback, but there came and arryued ther a knight that was fyerse and proud, and that for his grete pryde was called the proud knyght, For he was so fyerse that neuer the dayes of his lyfe he had salued no man. And yet he was of such a condicion that he that salued hym not shuld haue bataill against hym, wher throughe he had made dyuers dye.

And if that you may do so much as to haue victory ouer him, you may wel vaunt you that of all knightes you are the moste doughty &amp; valiaunt, and that of none you ought to haue feare nor dreade.

Then I made the moste dyligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce that was possible for me, but or euer I was retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the noble lady had delyuered two fayre sonnes, of the whiche a wylde beere muche furiously bare away one of the children into the wodde, in suche maner that the Empresse Bellyssant after her power wende for to haue saued and sucouredit, but she wiste not where it became, she had folowed so long that I founde her ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the grasse in a swowne piteously aourned, the whiche semed better dead then on lyue.

And when I vnderstode those wordes I ledde her vnto the tree whereas I had left her, and there doubled her sorowe, for she founde not the other chylde that she had lefte there. And thus were the two children of your syster loste in the foreste. And other tydynges knowe I not. And if you doubte you of this thynge for to haue the more greater knowledge knowe syr that I am Blandymayn that was geuen all alone for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duyte your syster Bellissant, when she was sent in exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le by the Emperoure Alexander.

For it semeth him in sleping that they would haue taken awaye the honoure of his wyfe Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronue. And that besyde her was two theues that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spyred treason agaynst him. After hym thought that be syde a ponde he sawe two great herons that foughte with a hawke, and with all their puyssaunce enforced them for to slee hym. But the hawke defended hym so valiauntly that he trauayled the two herons in suche wyse that they had bene both dead if it hadde not bene a great multytude of lytell byrdes that descended vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hawke, and would haue slayne hym anone if there had not come an. Egle that succoured hym. In this dreame Orsou awakened that of this dreame was much amat ueyled and began for too saye. Ha veray God kepe me from treason, and comforce my brother Ualentyne in suche maner that of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble lady Clerymonde he may haue certayne tydinges.

Whan Garnyere sawe that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was gone out of the chambre, also sone as he might he yssued out and wente vnto hys lodgynge rennynge ful taste. And there he founde the two brethren Haufray and Henry &amp; wyth them Florent the whyche had great desyre and lust to knowe some tydynges of theyr cursed and dysloyall treason. Beware Garnyete that you tell vs the trouthe howe our enterpryse gothe. Lordes sayd Garnyere by the god almyghty that hath created al the worlde for all the rychesse of Fraunce I wolde not doo so muche agayne as I haue done. And as to the regarde of kynge Pepyn knowe that he is yet on lyue, for euen so as I thought for to haue slayne hym I was soo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed that my hearte faylled me, and wolde not haue had the courage for to haue dommaged hys body for all the golde in the worlde. But of another treason I aduy sed me, for I haue left the knyfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I bare in the kinges bedde. So I haue thought that we shall accuse Orson of treason and shall tell the kynge that they are. iiii. of one appoyntment that are delibered for to sle the king, of whome Orson is the pryncypall, and shall saye also that they wyl make the lytle Charles to dyefor to haue bytwene them foure the realme of Fraunce wyth the apperrenauntes. And for to preue oure feate the better and be byleued of thys thynge we shall tell how Orson hathe made redy hys geare, and lefte the knyfe wyth in the bedde.

And if that it happened by a benture that the worst turned vpon you my brother Henry &amp; I shall be wel garntshed of men for to succour you. Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des sayd Garnyere and Florent your delyberacion is right good, and we haue wel the courage for to acheue the enterprise. Thus was the treason the seconde time conspired against the noble knyght Orson, the whiche of all this dede was pure and innocent. The day was clere and the houre was come after that the kyng had herde masse that he entred in to the halle tyal and was sette at dyner. There was Haufray and Henry that ser ued at the cable, the whiche she wed good semblaunt vn to Orson, but with their hartes thei purchaced himmor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tall treason with all their puyssaunce.

Within a shorte time yssued out of the cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Constantinoble a great hoost of them of the coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey of Grece for to go vnto Cretophe to succoure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure agaynst Brandiffer.

And for the great beau te of her she had ben demaunded of her father Brandie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that same yeare by fourtene kynges strong and puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt. And because that Brandyffer woulde not mary her yet he made her to be kepte sumptuously in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell, because that it was the strongest of all his lande. That same castell was hyghe, and had manye greate thycke squate coutes, and wel fortefyed, in the middes of the castell was a dongeon of latyn which had a dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble gate of yron strong and thycke. The castell was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyroned with deye dytches full of rennyng water, and in the myddes of the castell and of the dyche there was a brydge composed so subtylly that there myght passe but one man at ones. For &amp; it twayne would haue pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed they should fall bothe in to the rennyng water and there be drowned. And at the ende of that same brydge, there was two horryble lyons and strong that kept the entre of the castell. In the dongeon was the mayden ga lazye kepte. And vnder the sayde dongeon was a caue ryght profounde and depe, in the whiche the Emperour and the grene knyght was put with ten other christen men the whiche remayned there in captyuyte by the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace of many yeares in great anguyshe.

And when he was pas sed a brydge he wende for to haue bene within the cytie, but or euer that he entred it behoued him for to passe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue gates, whereof he was muche amarueylled. And by himselfe he began for to consyder the fortification of that same place, iudgyng by estymacion in his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng that the same cytie was the moost strongest place that euer he hadde sene.

So Ualentyne demaunded after the Patryarke the whiche came too hym incontynente and demaunded hym of whence he was, and on whom

Syr sayd Ualentyne I beleue in Iesu christ Alas syr said the patriarke how haue you taken y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes for to come hether, for and the kyng of ynde had knowledge of you he would make you dye shamefully.
