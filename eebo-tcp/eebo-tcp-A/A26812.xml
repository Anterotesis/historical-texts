            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Quest. 1. <hi>WHat Sin may be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Man's own?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Generally,</hi> every one that he commits, may be named <hi>his own.</hi> All are Off-springs of the <hi>Lust,</hi> that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32005:3"/>
St. <hi>James</hi> calleth <hi>his own.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> can fasten no Guilt upon us without the consent of our Wills. But yet some Sins be more peculiarly and more eminently to be called our own. Namely, <hi>such as there is a stronger ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in us to commit, than others; such as our Wills and Affections are more engaged unto, than unto others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are of <hi>different kinds</hi> in the several <hi>unregenerate</hi> Persons; in all of whom they do reign. The <hi>Discovery of them,</hi> that is most level to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Christians, is made by their <hi>Causes,</hi> and by their <hi>Effects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Causes</hi> are either <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Moral. Natural,</hi> from the different <hi>Temperaments of Mens Bodies</hi> and <hi>Connexion of their Passions.</hi> These be the secret Springs of special <hi>Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> and <hi>Aversions.</hi> It is true, <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Nature</hi> includes <hi>all</hi> Sin. But
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32005:3"/>
there is not an equal inclination in <hi>every</hi> person unto <hi>all</hi> Sin. In waste Ground <hi>some Weeds</hi> be ranker than others, from the quality of the <hi>Soil:</hi> And in the Lives of Men, <hi>some Sins</hi> be more predominant than others, by reason of <hi>peculiar Dispositions.</hi> For <hi>bodily Dispositions</hi> incline the <hi>Soul.</hi> We see Men of <hi>Sanguine Constitutions</hi> are usually <hi>light and vain, sensual and riotous, bold and aspiring.</hi> Men of <hi>Phlegmatick Constitutions</hi> be <hi>idle and slow, cold and careless</hi> in things of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Men of <hi>Melancholick ones</hi> are <hi>suspicious, soure,</hi> and not <hi>easie to be sn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, jealous,</hi> and often <hi>revengeful.</hi> And <hi>Cholerick Constitutions</hi> of Body, make men <hi>heady, various, violent, troublesome to themselves and others.</hi> Moreover, vicious Affections run in several Channels, according unto the alterations made in Bodies in Mens se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages. The <hi>Spring</hi> of corrupt Nature is still the <hi>same</hi>; but the <hi>Course
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32005:4"/>
is different. Youth</hi> is <hi>carnal, presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, easie to be deceived,</hi> and <hi>refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to Reason. Middle Age</hi> is of <hi>cooler Passions, covetous, ambitious,</hi> turned unto <hi>more solemn</hi> and <hi>less scandalous Follies</hi> than those of Youth. <hi>Old Age</hi> has its peculiar Vices; it is <hi>querelous, impatient, covetous, vainly fearful</hi> of contempt or want. Now according to our <hi>Constitutions</hi> and <hi>Ages,</hi> we must make our enquiry for our Own Sin.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Passions</hi> be sensitive Cravings for <hi>apprehended good,</hi> or <hi>for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of apprehended evil.</hi> Now Sin being the <hi>disorder of our desiring Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi> we may discover what is our predominant Sin, by considering what Affection is <hi>most violent in us</hi>; and of <hi>what others it is productive.</hi> What is it we do most love, and when dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of it, do most hate, such as cause the disappointment? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:32005:4"/>The <hi>Moral Causes</hi> of special Sins are to be found <hi>in the several Callings wherein Men are engaged.</hi> In these, Satan lays his Snares. Secondly, <hi>In the opposite states of Prosperity and Adversity.</hi> Both of which have their special Temptations adherent; long trains of them. Thirdly, <hi>In the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety that we converse with.</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that we chuse, discovers us unto others, and may discover us unto our selves. Fourthly, <hi>In the Quality of the Times wherein we live.</hi> There are <hi>Days</hi> named <hi>Evil,</hi> in respect of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations concomitant, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire great <hi>circumspection</hi> to preserve our innocence. And in these, our swimming with the Stream, or resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Torrent, will discover much of our hearts. It was <hi>Jehosaphat</hi>'s ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that <hi>he walked in the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord, and not according to the doings in</hi> Israel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:32005:5"/>The <hi>Effects of peculiar Sin,</hi> by which it is made known, are now to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered; 1. <hi>The Sin that is frequently and easily committed, and is difficultly retracted, that Sin is a Man's own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar one.</hi> Frequent Actions are from Dispositions strongly bent. And when the power of a Temptation is quick and speedy, the sinful inclination must needs be strong. Add, that it must surely be a Darling-Lust that controlls the efficacy of the Principles of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science concerning Good and Evil. 2. <hi>That Lust to which others are subservient, has the supremacy in the Heart.</hi> Sins do serve one another. <hi>Covetousness</hi> serves <hi>Pride</hi>; and <hi>Pride</hi> is his Sin who robs and oppresses for Money wherewith to support his State and Pomp. 3. <hi>It is the darling Corruption that ingrosses the Thoughts.</hi> When the Mind is in continual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise to compass Riches, Covetousness is then the reigning Passion. 4. <hi>The
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32005:5"/>
Sin that you desire to conceal, and are apt to defend or to extenuate, and are impatient of Reproof for it, this is your own special Sin.</hi> All Sinners dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and paint their most beloved Sins with least odious Colours. Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men call <hi>Lust</hi> a <hi>humane Frailty.</hi> Many Men of fair Tempers will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil upon their Reprovers; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times recriminate, that they are as bad as themselves. 5. <hi>The Sin that enlightned Conscience reflects upon with most anguish and remorse, is usually the peculiar one.</hi> It is commonly that by which God has been most dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Sinner is then most tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with. 6. <hi>The Sin that is your own you must seek out among the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kinds of Sin.</hi> Is it <hi>Omission,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission? Spiritual,</hi> or <hi>Carnal? Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> or <hi>Relative?</hi> &amp;c. You must search, even where you may think there is little reason to expect it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:32005:6"/>Q. 2. <hi>What is it to preserve ones self from ones own Sin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It implies two things.</p>

               <item>1. <hi>Abstaining from the practice of that Sin.</hi>
               </item>

            <p>He keeps himself from it, who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether abhorrs the commission of it, and watches and prays against the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inclination unto it.</p>
            <p>Q. 3. <hi>How appears it that a Man's so keeping himself from his own special Sin, is an undeceiving evidence of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It appears, if we consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God approves it.</hi> Sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians only, and accepted ones, can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to God. And this <hi>David</hi> doth; <hi>I was upright before him.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:32005:6"/>2. <hi>This keeping ones self from ones own Sin, is equivalent to Perfection and Integrity; and it is opposite unto Guilt.</hi> 'Tis equivalent unto Perfection, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.37. <hi>Mark the perfect Man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Upright, the end of that man is peace.</hi> 'Tis opposite to Guile, <hi>John</hi> 1.47. <hi>Behold an</hi> Israelite <hi>indeed, in whom is no guile!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 4. <hi>What is hence to be learned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>Q. 5. <hi>What Motives are unto this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> These Six.</p>
            <p>M. 1. <hi>Habitual indulged Lusts are irreconcileable with the state of Grace.</hi> They render us uncapable of God's <hi>pardoning Mercy</hi> here, and of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32005:7"/>
               <hi>heavenly Glory</hi> hereafter. Continued in, they do so.</p>
            <p>M. 2. <hi>We may by Divine Grace, subdue the strongest Lusts, that from our Nature and Temper, from Custom, or from Interests carnal, have rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us.</hi> The new Covenant assures Believers, that <hi>sin shall not have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over them,</hi> because they are not under the <hi>Law</hi> but under <hi>Grace,</hi> Rom. 6.14.</p>
            <p>M. 3. <hi>Our subduing the ruling Lust, will make the Victory over other sins more easie.</hi> For that is the Root whence others do spring and are fed. And besides, <hi>one</hi> Victory inspires with courage to atchieve <hi>another.</hi> The <hi>Indians,</hi> when they had killed <hi>one Spaniard,</hi> took<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heart and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to Fight the rest. The <hi>Romans</hi> counted that they had killed an Host of their Enemies, in one <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates.</hi>

This purely Evangelical Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> has an admirable Efficacy to inspire <hi>Zeal,</hi> and make <hi>Sin</hi> odious. Even the <hi>Sin</hi> that has been as <hi>near</hi> to us as our <hi>Bosoms</hi>; as <hi>pleasant</hi> as our corrupt <hi>Inclinations,</hi> as <hi>familiar</hi> and <hi>intimate</hi> as <hi>Custom,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.</p>
            <p>M. 5. <hi>The blessed Reward of Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness, comprehends all good of Time, and of Eternity.</hi> God is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously ready to supply all their <hi>Wants,</hi> allay all their <hi>Sorrows,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all their <hi>Fears,</hi> satisfie all their <hi>Desires,</hi> when his Servants are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. And nothing but <hi>Experience,</hi> can make the greatness of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be understood. <hi>Light is sown for the Righteous, and Joy for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in Heart,</hi> Psal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:32005:8"/>M. 6. <hi>Woful are the Effects of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging your peculiar Sins; the Lusts that by Pleasure or Profit bribe you. Accusing Conscience</hi> begins <hi>Hell</hi> here. Sin's <hi>memory,</hi> in <hi>the approaches of Death</hi> is very ghastly. The power of God's wrath, is then more in sight. But the <hi>prepared Plagues in the next World,</hi> do exceed all the <hi>most fearful Apprehensions</hi> in this World. There is perfection of misery, <hi>A Life in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that never Dies, a Death that never ends.</hi> Well then,</p>
            <p>Q. 6. <hi>What are the Means requisite for preserving us from our special Sins?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Let it be considered, <hi>Medicines be not Sweet-meats.</hi> Rules for <hi>Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> and <hi>Preservation</hi> of Health will seem <hi>harsh,</hi> and be <hi>distastful</hi> unto Minds carnal. But, if we will <hi>keep our selves from our own Iniquity,</hi> we must follow them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:32005:8"/>R. 1. <hi>We must be inquisitive, and get to understand, intimately and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly what our own Sins be.</hi> Against <hi>undiscerned Enemies</hi> we cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of <hi>Defence</hi>; but must fall by them <hi>without Resistance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>R. 2. <hi>We must use diligent Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and Circumspection, to prevent and resist our special Sins.</hi> To wit, when we have gained the <hi>knowledge</hi> of them, and <hi>sense</hi> of our danger from them.</p>
            <p>R. 3. <hi>We must seriously Resolve and solemnly Engage our selves, not to yield unto our special Sins.</hi> This we must do, with Dependance upon the PRESENT and the PERPETUAL assistance of the Divine Grace. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, our Resolutions <hi>cannot be</hi> sincere, and <hi>will not</hi> be effectual. But be broke by the <hi>next tempting Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>; as easily as the strings of a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32005:9"/>
               <hi>Cobweb</hi> be broke by <hi>a strong gust of Wind</hi>; or Walls of <hi>Glass</hi> by the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of Cannon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>R. 4. <hi>We must rise by speedy and deep Repentance, when we have negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted our Watch, and fallen into the Sin that we are peculiarly prone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> This is necessary to <hi>recover</hi> God's favour, and to <hi>preserve</hi> us for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Many have been cut off in early Sins, and lost their <hi>Times,</hi> their <hi>Hopes,</hi> and their <hi>Souls</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. However, by continuance in Sin, the Heart grows both more UNABLE, and more UNWILLING to resist and mortifie it. Fresh Wounds are of easier Cure than inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Ulcers.</p>
            <p>R. 5. <hi>We must fervently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly pray for the Renewing Grace of God.</hi> It is <hi>by the Spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> that we are able to <hi>mortifie the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32005:9"/>
deeds of the Body.</hi> And if we inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Prayer, we must not expect the H. Spirit's aids thereunto.</p>
            <p>R. 6. <hi>We must act Faith in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</hi> This is the Soveraign and Effectual Means. Christ is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Inherent</hi> as well as of <hi>Imputed</hi> Righteousness. It is <hi>through Christ strengthning we can do all things.</hi> It is He <hi>gives Repentance.</hi> It is He <hi>blesses us in turning us from our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> Mortification of Sin is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to his Death, in respect of <hi>meritorious procurement</hi>; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of its being <hi>a Representation of it.</hi> Our <hi>crucifying the Flesh with its Affections and Lusts</hi> is a lively resemblance of his Death. Which was designed to be <hi>operative</hi> in us of the death of Sin, and to be <hi>significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of the same. Besides; Christ's Death mortifies Sin <hi>by Moral Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> As it expresses God's <hi>transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32005:10"/>
Love</hi> unto us; that <hi>draws</hi> us from Sin. And as it no less expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses God's <hi>holy severity against Sin,</hi> that <hi>affrights and drives</hi> us from Sin. Now, Faith in Christ both OBLIGES and ENCOURAGES us to subdue our Sins. And it has (in the word) a <hi>cleansing Vertue,</hi> and a <hi>victorious efficacy,</hi> attributed unto it. It <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the heart,</hi> and it <hi>overcomes the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the great Duty of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation to the disposing Will of God,</hi> observe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Entire Resignation</hi> to God's dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Will is our <hi>indispensible Duty</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>sharpest Afflictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 1. <hi>What is consistent with this Resignation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:32005:10"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. <hi>Earnest Prayer</hi> against im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Judgments, is consistent with it. Christ <hi>Resigned</hi> to God's will, yet <hi>Prayed</hi> the Cup might pass. 2. <hi>A mournful sense</hi> of Affliction is consistent with it. If we do not at all mourn, we despise God's Rod.</p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>What does Resignation to God's will, include in it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It includes, 1. Our <hi>Mind's as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> to the Righteousness and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of what God doth. 2. <hi>Our Wills consent</hi> and subjection to God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, though against our own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. 3. <hi>Our Affections composure</hi> unto a just temper; and their restraint from sinful excesses in their <hi>Degrees,</hi> and in their <hi>Continuance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 3. <hi>What are the Arguments for this Resignation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:32005:11"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. God has <hi>supreme right</hi> in our Persons, and in All we enjoy. 2. God is <hi>Righteous in all his ways,</hi> and will not wrong us. 3. God's <hi>Power is uncontroulable,</hi> and it is vain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with Him. 4. God's Fatherly <hi>afflictions deserve our Love</hi> and Thanks. 5. God's <hi>Wisdom orders all</hi> in the best manner <hi>for his Glory</hi>; which is to be preferred above all, our <hi>Life it self</hi>: And <hi>for our final Good,</hi> which is to be preferred above <hi>present Ease.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 4. <hi>What Directions are useful for our Resigning to God's Will?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. Look <hi>to Jesus Christ,</hi> the grand Exemplar; his <hi>Resignation</hi> and his <hi>Reward.</hi> 2. Look <hi>to Saints in all Ages. Jam.</hi> 5.10. 3. Look to <hi>all Creatures,</hi> how they obey God's Will. <hi>Angels</hi> above us; and those of rank below us, <hi>Ravens</hi> and <hi>Lions.</hi> 4. Look
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32005:11"/>
to the glorious <hi>excellency of the Wills that are united unto God's Will.</hi> 'Tis our highest Perfection. 5. Look to the <hi>Felicity that is in Resignation.</hi> It quiets our <hi>Hearts,</hi> it makes our <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> sure, and our <hi>Adoption.</hi> 6. Look how <hi>short your suffering Time</hi> is. Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endures but for a Night. Add hereto, it concerns you,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To Believe stedfastly God's <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> and <hi>Promises.</hi> 2. To make <hi>GOD the supreme Object of your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem and Affections.</hi> 3. To moderate your <hi>Valuations</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> to all things below. 4. To <hi>forecast possible</hi> evils as <hi>future,</hi> and as coming on you; and make it your Motto, <hi>Never se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</hi> 5. To reflect seriously and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon <hi>your guilt and deservings from God's Justice. In the day of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity consider, Godly</hi> sorrow, lessens <hi>Natural.</hi> 6. To apply your Minds to consider <hi>your Blessings</hi> as well as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32005:12"/>
               <hi>your Sufferings.</hi> 7. To Pray <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> and <hi>fervently. Is any afflicted? let him Pray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That your Prayers may prevail; Pray 1. With your Eye to God's <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and Christ's <hi>Merit.</hi> 2. With your Heart submissive to God's <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Wisdom.</hi> 3. With your Haste more for <hi>Grace,</hi> than for <hi>Comfort.</hi>
