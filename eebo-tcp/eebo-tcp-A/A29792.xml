            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>The</hi> Bookseller's <hi>Advertisement.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere being lately come out a Poem called the <hi>Anti-Weesils,</hi> in the Preface of which the Author of the <hi>Weesils</hi> is very highly Arrained, his Vindication against such scandalous Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being a Cause not worthy the drawing his own Pen; the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller as obliged to be Champion for his Authors, and even with his little Sense being able to inform the Gentleman's Misunderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, has begg'd a Blank Page in this Poem, to tell him, that the Author of the <hi>Weesils</hi> is not that Enemy of the Government that he maliciously misrepresents him, nor intended or writ any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon it, nor thought the taking of the present Oaths Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; or has he any ways vilisied the Noble Deserters of the late Cause, as he Barbarously suggests; there being not one Line in the whole Poem that can justly be perverted into any such villanous meaning.</p>
            <p>Neither this Gentleman (would he be candid,) nor any Person else (can well believe the little Rallery of that piece of Banter, as he is pleas'd to call it,) can carry any such perverse Signification. And 'tis almost ridiculous to think it should have the power to nettle so many of the <hi>Reverend,</hi> whom (as intended) it should rather divert than disgust, there being nothing in it but what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man has heard a Hundred times over in common Discourse. 'Tis a little odd (however like the rest of his Preface,) that the <hi>Anti-Weesilarian</hi> should be so dull, as to imagine that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Freeborn Brute</hi> should be an affront to an <hi>English-Man,</hi> when the Scene is laid in a Forest, and Brutes are the Represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Nor does he that way (as falsly charged) Impeach any Doctor of the Church for any Apostacy from King <hi>James,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for prevaricating against his own formerly avow'd Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100488:9"/>
As for his Accusation of want of Christianity, in relation to the Resurrection of the Knights Templers in his <hi>4th</hi> Line, if the Knights are not angry with him for his Rallery, I fancy this Gentleman might have spared his severe Sentiment; and I must freely tell him, he has more abused Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> in doubting his Church, who is known to be both a Learned and Religious Man, than the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has in his Verses any of the Cross Legg'd Heroes.</p>
            <p>As for the Poetical part of the <hi>Anti-Wesils,</hi> 'tis supposed the Author of the former, if he finds it worth his while, has Genius enough to answer himself; for my own part I think I have done enough for him for this time. <hi>Vale.</hi>
