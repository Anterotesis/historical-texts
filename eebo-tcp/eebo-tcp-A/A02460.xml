            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:20423:4"/>
iudgement for al his ſinnes: ſo this filleth the hart with ioy and bones with gladneſſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that God hath put away his ſinnes, and in great fauour hath reſpect vnto him for his good. In regard whereof it ſtandeth vs in hand that our heartes may be ſilled with this ſweetnes, and our ſoules haue their parte in this moſt heauenly ſolace, attentiuely to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apoſtle in this place. In the vnfolding of whoſe wordes, my purpoſe is, firſt briefly to lay downe his meaning, and then more amply to ſtand on thoſe points, which make for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation betweene God and man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now then are wee embaſſadors for Christ:</hi> as if the Apoſtle would ſay now then we come not of our owne heads, without lawfull war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, for God hath put this word of reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into our mouthes, he hath ſent vs in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage vnto you, and giuen vs in commiſſion thus to ſpeake: Wherefore for Chriſt ſake if you will doe any thing for him we pray you, nay Chriſt praieth you, for his place now we do ſupply, and not only he but God in vs, and by vs praieth and beſeecheth that you would be reconciled vnto him. If you deſire his friendſhip, but yet feare his preſence becauſe of your ſinnes; beholde his mercie, he will not impute vnto you your ſins, but vnto you they ſhall be as though they had neuer beene. If
<pb facs="tcp:20423:5"/>
yet you doubt how this may be, ſince that you know that God is iuſte and puniſheth ſinne whereſoeuer he findeth it; looke on your ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, &amp; that which God in mercy pardoneth in you, he puniſheth with all iuſtice in his ſonne. For he which was moſt innocent and knew no ſinne, hath your ſinnes imputed vnto him, and not onely imputed, but he is made ſinne for you, that is a ſacrifice for your ſins. Thus the chaſtiſement of your peace is layed on his ſhoulders, and for your ſins hee hath ſuffered, an hell of torments in his moſt bleſſed ſoule &amp; bodie. If yet you dare not preſume his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, becauſe you want your wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: conſider, that he was therefore made ſinne for you, that you ſhould be made, (you cannot make your ſelues) not the righteouſnes of man which is inherent in you, but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of God which is imputed to you. And to make all without doubt you are made this righteouſnes of God, not in your ſelues, but in him, euen in Chriſt Ieſu, which for your ſake hath ſanctified himſelfe, and fulfilled all righteouſnes for you, ſo that as your ſinnes were not inherent in him, but in your ſelues; yet ſo imputed to him, as though they were his: ſo this righteouſnes, by which you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteous before your maker, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in you but in him, yet as if it were
<pb facs="tcp:20423:5"/>
yours, through Gods great mercy it is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto you. Wherefore now let euery good Chriſtian, in a good aſſurance of hope, come with boldneſſe vnto the throne of grace, ſince now to his endleſſe comfort he feeleth, that Chriſt hath borne the puniſhment of his ſinne, that hee might enioy the fruite of Chriſtes righteouſnes, which is all grace in this world and hereafter euerlaſting life.</p>
            <p>Out of this ſhort explication of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles wordes, &amp; light touch of this moſt woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful doctrine, we may for our better inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obſerue, firſt who are to be reconciled, that is God and man: ſecondly by whom they are to be reconciled, that is by Ieſus Chriſt: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by what meanes Chriſt reconcileth man vnto God, which is by taking away from man that which is mans, that is his ſinne: and by giuing vnto man that which is not mans, but Gods, euen the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</p>

            <p>Now Ieſus is the man by whom God in his goodnes doth ſaue the worlde, and whom he hath made the mediatour of this couenaunt of peace: ſo it is expedient for the full ſatiſfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Chriſtian mindes, in him to conſider

            <p>Wherefore let vs firſt, conſider that this Ieſus is God, and the reaſons why it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that he ſo ſhould be: he is God, for <note n="a" place="margin">Col. 2.9</note> it pleaſed the father that in him ſhould dwel the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily and in truth, being the <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 3.17</note> ſonne of his father, not by adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as are we but by eſſence, not by grace but by nature, being <note n="c" place="margin">Col. 1.35 Hebr. 1 3</note> the very image of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the engrauen forme euen of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he could not but be God.

            <p>Now as our Sauiour is God of the ſame nature with his father, ſo it is worth our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to conſider, that it was moſt expedient y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſo ſhould be. For otherwiſe how could he ſatiſfie the wrath of his father due to our ſins, for when our ſins were infinite according to the infinite maieſtie of God whom they did treſpaſſe: it muſt needs be that he which is to ſatiſfie for thoſe infinite ſinnes, muſt either be of an infinite nature, or muſt for all infinity be for euer puniſhed. But now ſince the <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 2.24</note> ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of death are fully loſed in our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 19 30</note> and he himſelf ſpake of them <hi>Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum eſt,</hi> it is finiſhed, it muſt needes be

So that ſince Chriſt was to beare the burden of our ſinnes, which man and angell was not able to doe, it muſt needes be that he ſhould be greater then man or angell and that is God. Nay when he willed vs which <note n="k" place="margin">Iohn 14.1</note> beleeued on his father to beleeue alſo on him, and when we may not <note n="l" place="margin">Ier. 17.5</note> beleeue on any ſauing on the Lorde of hoſt, for if we do we bring a curſe vpon our ſoules, moſt conuenient it is that our ſauiour ſhould be God: eſpecially ſince the Lord ſaith of himſelfe that <note n="m" place="margin">Iſa. 43 11</note> beſide him there is no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.

Wherfore that he might be able to beare the burden of our ſin, and to ſatiſfie for the infinitie of the ſame, that
<pb facs="tcp:20423:15"/>
we might beleeue on him as we do on the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; that his merite might bee made auail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all, it is expedient that he ſhould bee God.</p>

But either to make <note n="c" place="margin">Iob 1 9</note> triall of our patience as he did of <hi>Iobs,</hi> or <note n="d" place="margin">2.

Wherefore as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
<pb facs="tcp:20423:25"/>
               <hi>Why doeſt thou wayle that thou doeſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi>

               <hi>it is a medicine to thee not a puniſhment, a caſtigation no damnation.</hi> But yet they reply that God ſendeth miſeries on his children for none of theſe endes, but to puniſh ſinne which they haue committed be it ſo as they ſay, yet I denie as is before made manifeſt, that which all the Papiſt do ſo greatly labour that theſe endured puniſhments, make any recompence to God for our ſinne, or any whit ſatiſfie the wrath of the father conceaued againſt them. True it is that in the infancie of the Church certaine temporall puniſhments were inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on offenders, &amp; canonicall ſatiſfaction was required, but yet not to ſatiſfie God but the Church, not to make due recompence for the ſinne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted but by this publike ſubmiſſion, to declare their vnfained ſorrow &amp; repentance for their ſinne,<note place="margin">Tertull. lib. de paenit.</note> the which kind of diſcipline as then, ſo now it is moſt behouefull for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church and houſe of God. For by thoſe means not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Church is in ſome ſorte ſatiſfied, which much grieueth at the fall of her children: but the offendant himſelfe is better occaſioned to conſider his wretched &amp; miſerable eſtate, and forced as it were to hate his ſinne, and to take held of the great mercy of his God. And not onely is this diſcipline behoueful for theſe, but for other alſo whereof ſome are in, other out of
<pb facs="tcp:20423:25"/>
the Church of God. For they that are in the church, by the puniſhment of other, are made more wary, leſt happily that which they ſee in other ſhould be alſo ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pled in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues; &amp; they that are out haue no cauſe to ſlander the good word of God, or to ſpeake euill of his ſpouſe, becauſe ſhee winketh not at the faultes of her children, or propoſeth vnto them liberty to ſin, but guideth their ſteps in the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, &amp; puniſheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they goe awrie. But to let this paſſe as a matter not pertinent to our purpoſe, out of that which hath bin ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſee, that Chriſt Ieſus hath our ſins im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto him, &amp; that by his obedience &amp; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed paſſion, he hath deliuered vs not onely fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome ſins, but from all: not from the guilt and filth of them, but from the paine &amp; puniſhment too: &amp; that not from the paine eternal only, but alſo from all paine temporall in this life.</p>
            <p>Now then as you haue heard how that he was made ſinne for vs, ſo now it foloweth that we ſhould declare, how we are made the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of God in him, where not what the Apoſtle ſpeaketh he was made ſinne not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner but ſinne: nether was he made by man but by God, and to what end, that wee ſhould be made, we cannot make our ſelues, for we are Gods workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhip, &amp; what not righteous but righteouſnes, not of man but of God, and that

not in our ſelues but in Chriſt.

               </hi> And after ſhewing how Chriſt was made a ſacrifice for ſinne, he ſaith, <hi>God to whom we were to be reconciled made him ſin for vs, that is a ſacrifice for our ſin, by whom he might reconcile vs ſo to himſelfe, he therefore was made ſin, that we might be made righteouſnes not ours but Gods, not in our ſelues but in him, euen as he that is Chriſt was made ſin not his owne but ours, not in himſelfe but in vs.</hi> And in the end he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, <hi>this is that righteouſnes of God not by which he himſelf is iuſt, but by which we are made righteous before him.</hi> So that as our ſins can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be inherent in Chriſt, but onely imputed vnto him, no more is his righteouſnes

            <p>But yet the weake Chriſtian will ſay, how can this be, one man may pay an others debt, but how can one ſatiſfie for an others ſinne, the Scripture ſayth,<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.2</note> the father ſhall not eate a ſower grape, and the childes tooth ſhalbe turned an edge,<note place="margin">verſ. 20</note> but that euery one ſhall beare his owne burden, and that the ſoule which ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſhall die the death.

<pb facs="tcp:20423:28"/>
one other, or they al vnto the head, as is Chriſt Ieſu vnto his Church, and to euery faithfull ſoule, that truſteth and beleeueth in him. And therefore ſometime we are ſaid to be <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 12.4</note> one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in him, ſometime <note n="b" place="margin">Eph. 4.16.</note> to growe vp into him which is our head, ſometime <note n="c" place="margin">1.

            <p>Then goe to let this bee graunted that Chriſt and the faithfull are but one, that he is the head of that miſticall body whereof they are members, &amp; then let vs ſee how the iuſtice of God is violated, whileſt he is puniſhed &amp; we rewarded. Thou ſayeſt in thy vſuall ſpeach that man ſeeth and man heareth, yet it is his eare that heareth, and eye that ſeeth, euen ſo thou mayeſt ſay that it is man that hath borne the puniſhment of ſin, although it is his head Chriſt Ieſu, that hath borne and endured the
<pb facs="tcp:20423:29"/>
ſame. For as in the naturall body that which is proper to the eye and to the eare, is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the whole, in reſpect of that neare coniunction which each parte hath with the whole: ſo in the miſticall body of Ieſu Chriſt in reſpect of that ſpirituall and bleſſed vnion, that which is proper onely vnto Chriſt is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed alſo to his Church. And therefore as wee ſee in ciuill pollicies, the wife is aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the honour of her huſband, and made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Counteſſe or Lady according to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her huſbands ſtate: euen ſo the church which is the ſpouſe of Chriſt, although ſhe be of her ſelfe a daughter of the earth, a woman of no price, yet in reſpect of Chriſt who in marriage hath aduaunced her, ſhe is full of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and pertaketh of all the honour of her head. So that of the faithfull we may ſay that wee <note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 1.16</note> all haue receaued of his grace euen grace for grace. And as the <note n="b" place="margin">Pſa. 131.2</note> oyle that was powred on <hi>Aarons</hi> head ranne downe to the ſkirtes of his garments and perfumed them, ſo the righteouſnes of our <hi>Aaron</hi> that is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, although powred on his head yet perfumeth vs, and maketh vs gratious in the ſight of God. So that now as euery member is liued of the head, and hath their ſence and moouing from it: euen ſo haue wee our life from him, and all our ſence and motion which
<pb facs="tcp:20423:29"/>
is vnto good. Nay as the viler partes of the bodie doe partake of the worſhip and glory of the head, and are then honored when it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and then diſpiſed when it is diſpiſed: euen ſo in this ſpirituall vnion betwixt Chriſt and his faithfull members, although they be more vile in compariſon to Chriſt, then are the baſeſt partes of the body inferiour to the head: yet are they honoured when he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, and with the crowne of righteouſneſſe that ſetteth on his head, are they alſo crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and made righteous. Thus then you ſee that it is not an other that hath ſuffered for you, nor an other by whom yee are made righteous, but it is the head that ſuffereth for his members, and the head that in himſelfe crowneth euery member, with the crowne of righteouſnes and of glory.</p>
            <p>Wherefore comfort your ſelues you that mourne in <hi>Sion,</hi> and are feared with Gods wrath, and the filth of your ſinne, for GOD which was your enimie is become your friend, and beſeecheth you to be reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and although your ſinnes haue kept you backe, and defaced image hath made you aſhamed to approch his preſence, yet now he hath ſent his ſonne the brightnes of his glory not only by his ſuffering to take away your ſinnes, but by his obedience to reſtore you to
<pb facs="tcp:20423:30"/>
your former bewty, and to preſent your fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe vnto himſelfe. Let vs therefore reſt on the goodnes of our God, and accept of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement perfourmed in his ſonne, let <note n="a" place="margin">Reu. 4.10.</note> vs caſt downe our crownes, and fall on our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and giue all glory to him that ſitteth on the throne, and to the Lambe for euermore, Amen. <note n="b" place="margin">Reu. 7.12.</note> Praiſe, glory &amp; wiſdome, and thanks, and honor, &amp; power, and might be vnto our God for euermore.
