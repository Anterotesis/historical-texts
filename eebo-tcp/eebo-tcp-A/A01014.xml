            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>VVherein the Sponge-bearers immodest carriage and behauiour towards his bretheren is detected; the bitter flames of his slanderous reports, are by the sharpe vineger of Truth corrected and quite extinguished: and lastly, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous validity of his Sponge, in wiping away of the Weapon-Salue, is crushed out and cleane abolished.</p>

            <p>The Assertion of Parson <hi>Foster</hi> and his Faction or Cabale, is this:</p>
            <p>The wonderfull manner of healing by the weapen-salue, is diaholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or effected onely by the inuention and power of the Deuill;</p>

                  <p>Thus farre I haue spoken with the mouth of the Prophets, our Sauiour, and his Apostles. But mine Aduersarie will reply and say, that Doctor <hi>Fludd</hi> is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2524:8"/>
a Magitian, and hath maintayned a damnable and diabolicall action, namely, the Curing by the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon-Salue to be good and lawfull, and therefore by warrant of Scripture he ought sharpely to be told of it, &amp;c. I answer, That from this obiection may arise a double question; whereof the first is, Whether the assertion of our aduersary be true or false? and then, whether it bee a brotherly part, first to diuulge it, though it were true indeede, vnto the eares of the people, before hee hath admonished his brother in priuate of his error. Touching the ground or scope of the first, namely, whether, according vnto his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, I am a Magitian or no, it shall bee fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed in the third Chapter of this present Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where I make no doubt to proue to each wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded person (and that to the burthen of my rash accusers conscience, if he haue any) that he is iustly ranked and numbred amongst those, at whom the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> our Sauiour CHRIST, and the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> haue aymed in the places aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. As for the second, our Lord IESVS resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it in these words: <hi>Si peccauerit in te frater tuus, vade &amp; corripe eum inter te &amp; ipsum solum; si te audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit,</hi>

What? Not one word with reason, nor yet any Syllable in good Rime, but all vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Letters <hi>G.</hi> and <hi>P?</hi> An excellent argument of a simple wit.</p>
                  <p>But touching that which seemeth most materiall in this pretty discourse, I will answere with the like obiection vnto that of our conceited Master of Arts: He would seeme to teach mee that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miger or Esquier ought to be set before the Doctor being that there is a question, whether a Knight or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2524:9"/>
a Doctor should challenge the first place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (saith hee) the Esquier was ill placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Doctor, being that the Doctor is the better man; verily I thinke that it ought to be so, and yet neuerthelesse, it is certaine that now adayes a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Esquier thinketh much to yeeld place vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Doctor: But this is not to our question. Hee seemes to accuse me because I say, <hi>Robertus Fluddus Armiger &amp; in Medicina Doctor: Robert Fludd Esquier and Doctor of Physicke.</hi> I will answere and pay him with his owne Coyne. Why doth hee put the Master of Arts before the Parson or Minister, being that the Minister is the better man, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Sanctitie of his Vocation. Hereupon it is that a Doctor of Diuinitie, though of a latter standing, taketh place of a Doctor of Physicke who had his degree before him. Againe, Why doth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Foster</hi> in his Dedicatory Epistle put the Baron of <hi>Wing</hi> before the Viscount of <hi>Ascot,</hi> and the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Ascot</hi> before the Earle of <hi>Carnaruon?</hi> And lastly, why doth hee Pag. 38. terme me Master Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, setting the Master before the Doctor? Verily, our wise brother findes a mote in mine eye, but will not looke vpon the beame in his owne. And now I will expresse the cause, why I put the Esquier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Doctor. It is for two considerations: first, because I was an Esquier, and gaue armes before I was a Doctor, as being a Knights sonne: next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, though a Doctor addeth gentilitie to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who by descent is ignoble; yet it is the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of most men, and especially of Heraulds, that a Gentleman of Antiquitie, is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2524:9"/>
any one of the first Head or Degree: And verily for mine owne part I had rather bee without any degree in Vniuersitie, than lose the honour was left me by my Ancestors. Thus farre I haue thought fit to satisfie the Gentleman in his humour, wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at nothing more, than that he should leaue the maine matter, to snarle at my gentilitie. Would he thinke it decent in mee to revile him for his low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of birth or ignobilitie? For I know what he is: God forbid such an absurditie should come from my pen, much lesse to vpbraid him with his gentili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if hee were a Gentleman indeed.</p>
                  <p>In another place hee inueigheth bitterly against me in this manner:</p>
                  <p>The Doctor, who impiously attributeth composition vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Foster p. <hi>48.</hi>
                     </note> God, dareth falsly to attribute corporalitie vnto De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; the contrarie of which, that they haue no manner of bodies, is the tenent of the Church.</p>
                  <p>I see that our Master in Arts is scarce in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Fludd.</note> his Arts master: hee talkes with <hi>Mersennus</hi> the Fryer his tongue, and therefore is but <hi>Mersennus</hi> his Parrat; wherefore as I haue answered him in Latine, so will I partly in the same sense satisfie this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Author in English; not with impious tearmes, according to his custome, but modestly. <hi>Mersennus</hi> maketh it an impietie in mee to say, that God filleth the heauenly Spirit of the World: whereupon hee concludes and saith, <hi>Facit proinde Deum compositionem cum hoc spiritu aethereo; hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore maketh God a composition with this aethereall spirit.</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:2524:10"/>
My answere to him is this, that <hi>the incorruptible spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord is in all things,</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>Hee filleth the heauens and viuifieth all things.</hi> What? And must I therefore attribute composition vnto God, or doe I make God part of composition? No verily; forasmuch as God in his essence is indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and therefore hee cannot bee a part in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; but hee is said to bee <hi>in all, and ouer all,</hi> as he is the Catholicke Actor of life, whereupon the Apostle teacheth vs, that hee viuifieth all things, and therefore hee is said to bee in the spirit of the world, and also without it, no diuision of his diuine Essence being made. So also it is said, that <hi>in God wee liue, moue, and haue our being:</hi> and yet God is not in vs as a part in composition, but as an eternall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in compositions; not mixed, but mingling the composition, in number, weight, and measure: that is, tempering and vniting euerie particle, as it were with the glew of perfect loue and harmonie. And to this purpose it is said in <hi>Iob, Sicut argillam fecisti me. Nonne sicut lac fudisti me, &amp; tanquam caseum coagulasti me, cute &amp; carne induisti me, ossibusque &amp;</hi>

                  <p>To conclude: I haue answered this point more at large in that Reply I made to <hi>Gassendus</hi> his Rete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my Philosophy, where I proue that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of God is in euerie thing, as it composeth all

things. But if I had said that God entred into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, was it so impious a thing, when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture auerreth that the Word was incarnated? I am too long in prouing that, which Master <hi>Foster</hi> taketh barely out of the Fryers mouth, but knoweth not, what eyther he, or I meane thereby; as for the deuils corporalitie, I will proue it elsewhere.</p>

                  <p>Surely, <hi>D.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2524:12"/>
wherin I produce the great dispute which did arise betweene the two famous Philosophers <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrie</hi> and <hi>Iamblicus,</hi> whereof the first did hold that a man might come to the knowledge of his owne Genius or good Angell by the Art of Astrologie, namely, by finding out the Planet and Nature of his spirit, that was Lord of the eleuenth house, the which by the Astrologians was for that cause cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bonus Daemon</hi> or the good Angell. But <hi>Iambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> his opinion was, that a man had neede of the Assistance and Knowledge of a higher Spirit, than was any of those which were Gouernours of Fata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, namely, of such Intelligences as were ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the rule and direction of the seuen Planets: wherefore I did thereupon expresse the superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ancients with the Impossibilitie thereof, that thereby I might the better descry it &amp; make it the more ridiculous to wise men. I then suspecting the captious Natures of some enuious persons, did there make an Apologie, to excuse my selfe and to shew the vanitie of the thing, and how full of idle superstition it was, and to shew it to bee onely Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie. But I seemed there to consent with <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicus,</hi> auerring with him, that without the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that high and heauenly Spirit, which was granted vnto the Elect, none could come to the familiaritie or knowledge of his good Angell. I proue it out of many places of Scripture: Loe, this is all! Now iudge (all yee that are vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and truely learned) what an offence was here to decide according vnto my power, that great Controuersie of these two notable and eminent
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2524:12"/>
Philosophers, which hath stucke and beene vndeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded euen vnto this day, being that I in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion ascribed the whole Glorie vnto that sole and onely Spirit, which is the Prince and Lord of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Spirits: I professed to write generally of all, but as I went along, I distinguished the good from the euill, that men might the better beware of, and refuse the one, and make choyce of the other. Now therefore, that I haue expressed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the ground, why this our Criticke and his CynickeMaster the Fryer <hi>Mersennus</hi> haue slandered me with the Title of a Magitian: I will proceed to the answer of euery member of his friuolous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections.</p>
                  <p>Doctor <hi>Fludds</hi> defence of the Weapon-salue is enough <note place="margin">Foster.</note> to make it suspected.</p>
                  <p>And why I pray you? <note place="margin">Fludd.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Marry because he himselfe is accused for a magitian by <note place="margin">Foster.</note> Marinus Mersennus.</p>
                  <p>The conclusion is much like the capacitie of the <note place="margin">Fludd.</note> concluder: Doctor <hi>Fludd</hi> is suspected for a Magiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: <hi>Ergo</hi> the purge of Rubarbe which he prescribeth, or rather any point in Philosophie or Physicke, by him maintained in writings, is Magicall. <hi>Non sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur argumentum:</hi> So <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> is accused for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, and a Magitian <hi>Ergo</hi> the Perspectiue or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke Science, hee writeth of, is deuilish and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, or at least wise to be suspected.</p>
                  <p>I but this Salue hath a Caco-magicall propertie in it, <note place="margin">Foster.</note> for it healeth a farre off, and not <hi>per contactum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So doth <hi>Bacons Opticke</hi> make vs to see the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <note place="margin">Flud.</note> of liue men to walke in the Ayre, and it is said,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2524:13"/>
that by his Art he made an Apparition of a man to walke from the top of <hi>Alhollows</hi> steeple in <hi>Oxford,</hi> to the top of S. <hi>Maries:</hi> Surely these Opticall conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons must be Magicall, and not by naturall reflection of glasses, because these are vtterly vnknowne to M. <hi>Foster</hi> and his adherents, and consequently are to bee condemned as diabolicall. But to come to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; M. <hi>Foster</hi> if his eies had beene so fauourable, and his will so charitable, as to haue looked on my answer to <hi>Mersennus</hi> in the defence of that point, before hee had iudged, he would without doubt, aswell as hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of other men, whereof some are Church-men, of no meane ranke, and many Doctors of Physicke of excellent learning, haue auerred, that D. <hi>Flud</hi> had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Mersennus</hi> so fully, aswell in that accusation, as all other points layd by him vnto his charge, that he could not bee able any way to reply against it. And it is well knowne heere in <hi>England</hi> to such as haue beene conuersant beyond the Seas, that the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of my answer hath so satisfied the learned, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in <hi>Germany</hi> as in <hi>France,</hi> that hee hath beene by them much condemned for his slanderous wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and esteemed of but meanely for his small lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and indiscretion. Now the ground of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice vnto me was, for that hee hauing written of the Harmony of the World, and finding that a Booke of that subiect set out by mee, was verie acceptable to his Countrey-men, hee inuented this slander against me and my Harmonie, that thereby hee might bring his owne into the better reputation. But what did I say? That hee was accused and condemned for that his slander by some in <hi>France,</hi> yea, verily his dearest

                     <hi>These are the very words of</hi> Mersennus <hi>his chiefe friend, which I interpret thus:</hi> And although (my <hi>Mersennus</hi>) the zeale wherewith you are moued against <hi>Fludd</hi> is to bee commended, neuerthelesse you cannot bee ignorant, how grieuous and intolerable a thing it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any man that liueth in the Christian world, to be called a Witch, or euill Magitian, a Hereticke-Magitian, or a teacher, or divulger of foule and horrible Magicke: and that such a teacher is not to bee suffered vnpunished, also to prouoke the King or Prince to punish him, and besides all this to threaten him; saying, that for that cause hee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2524:14"/>
should bee drowned or drenched in the eternall, Lake and so forth. Besides the Atheisme and Heresie, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so you obiect and lay to <hi>Fludds</hi> charge.

                  <p>In which words our English world may discerne first, how this my honest dealing and morall forren Aduersarie doth checke his vnciuill friend, whose part hee vndergoeth, for his immodestie and small discretion: and next doth teach my home-bred Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie a great deale of manners or behauiour in writing against an Aduersarie; namely, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with foule and scandalous language, but with acute arguments, and those to the purpose, armed with the truest reasons of Philosophie: Doth not Master <hi>Foster</hi> blush now to see his mightie and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Author <hi>Marinus Mersennus</hi> checked by his judicious friend, whom hee himselfe hath ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, aswell for Vmpeere as Stickler in his cause? Yea, and a chiefe Champion to defend it, for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me vniustly a Magitian and other misbeseeming names?

he careth not how he may disgrace any one, so that he might thereby the better serue his owne turne. Because I haue produced in my Mysticall Anatomy a naturall reason for the Weapon-Salue, which hee neyther can, nor, for all his poore reasons expressed in his Booke, shall be able to refell, therefore, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, I must be numbred amongst the Magitians. And wherefore? Marry because <hi>Mersennus</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the same censure on me. And who is <hi>Mersennus?</hi> A rayling Satyricall Babler, not able to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in his owne defence, and therefore being put to a <hi>Non plus,</hi> hee went like a second <hi>Iob</hi> in his greatest vexation to aske Counsell of the learnedst Doctors in <hi>Paris:</hi> And at last for all that, he fearing his cause, and finding himselfe insufficient, procured by much Intreatie his friend <hi>Peter Gassendus</hi> to helpe him, and called another of his friends vnto his assistance; namely, one Doctor <hi>Lanouius</hi> a seminarie Priest, as immorall as himselfe, and one that professeth in his Iudiciary Letter much, but performeth little. And in good faith, I may boldly say, that for three roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, bragging, and fresh-water Pseudophilosophers, I cannot paralell any in Europe, that are so like of a condition, as are <hi>Mersennus, Lanouius,</hi> and <hi>Foster:</hi> all three exceeding terrible in their bumbasting words, imagining to quell and make subiect vnto their thundering braues the stoutest Schollers of Europe, if they cared for them, and did esteeme them more than Bugbeares to skare away Crowes or frighten little Children. As for <hi>Peter Gassendus</hi> I finde him a good Philosopher, and an honest and well conditioned Gentleman, iust aswell vnto his

To this I answer that King <hi>Iames</hi> of euerlasting memorie for his Iustice, Pietie, and great Learning, was by some Enuious persons moued against mee, touching the same subiect; but when I came vnto him, and hee in his great wisedome had examined the truth and circumstance of euery point, touching this scandalous report, which irregularly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly was related of mee, hee found me so cleare in my answer, and I him so regally learned and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in himselfe, and so excellent and subtill in his inquisitiue Obiections, aswell touching other points as this, that in stead of a checke (I thanke my God) I had much grace and honour from him, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from that time forward many gracious fauours of him: And I found him my iust and kingly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron all the dayes of his life.

                  <p>But this Weapon-Salue worketh none of these wayes:</p>
                  <p>Ergo the Cures done by it are not lawfull; but presti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, Magicall and Diabolicall.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I proue it two manner of wayes. First, it is not by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine <note place="margin">Foster.</note> Institution, because it is no where registred in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Secondly, it workes not naturally, because it worketh after a different manner from all naturall Agents: For it is a Rule amongst Diuines and Philosophers, that <hi>nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum agens agit ad distans:</hi> whosoeuer worketh na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It worketh not by corporall Contact, for the bodies are disioyned some <hi>20.</hi> miles or more, wherefore (if lawfull) it must needes be performed by a vertuall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact. But not so neither, because all Agents working after this manner, worke within a certaine distant and limited sphaere of Actiuity. The Loadstone doth work but at a small distance.</p>
                  <p>Vnto your first reason I answer, that it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that because it is no where registred in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, therefore it is not of diuine Institution: what? because figgs, wine and oyle, yea, and clay temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>Whatsoeuer worketh Naturally, worketh by corporall <note place="margin">Foster.</note> or vertuall Contact; But this worketh by neither: Ergo it worketh not naturally.</p>

First, concerning that Axiome in Philosophy, I <note place="margin">Fludd.</note> know and can proue it by experience to bee false. For the fire heateth <hi>ad distans:</hi> The lightning out of the cloud blasteth <hi>ad distans.</hi> The Bay tree operateth against the power of thunder and lightning <hi>ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stans.</hi> The force of the canons bullet killeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching <hi>ad distans.</hi> The sunne and fire doe act in illuminating <hi>ad distans.</hi> The Loadstone doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate vpon the Iron <hi>ad distans.</hi> The plague, Dysen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, small pocks, infect <hi>ad distans,</hi> &amp;c. But to make all this good you adde to the Axiome and say: <hi>agit vel per corporalem vel virtualem contactum,</hi> instead of <hi>Agit ad distans:</hi> I will answer first, that the Maior is vnfirme. For I would haue you know, that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning may moue the Aire violently, and the Aire mooued by contact of the Agent, which is Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning may stupifie, and strike dead: so that in this case, there is neither vertuall or corporall contact of the Agent, but an Accidentall comming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the vertuall Agent and the Patient. The like is euident in the Canons bullet, which flying by a person, without any vertuall or corporall contact, doth cast the person on the ground; for the Agent being the bullet, moueth the <hi>Medium</hi> or the Aire violently, and the Aire being so moued casteth downe the person: But though I let the Maior passe for currant; yet neuerthelesse the Minor is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther halting. For I affirme, and it is euident to euery mans capacity, that this medicine doth cure by a vertual contact, namely, by a Simpathetical proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which doth operate <hi>inter terminum à quo &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>All Agents working by a vertuall Contact worke within a certaine distance, and limited spheare of Actiuity.

The Planets excell in virtuall operation all sublunarie A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.

For the lightning of heauen is more forcible in it's operation then our artificiall fire, for though it bee a of lesser compasse then the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred part of 10 miles; yet, it so inflameth the aire for many miles compasse, that it maketh the Creature to sweat againe with heate.

and starrie fire excelleth this so farre, that it pierceth many degrees further then the Elementall fire can doe: for though the Elementall fire be full of Actiuity; yet, it is cloathed with so thicke a spirit, in which it is carried, that though it be subtile, and of the fountaine of celestiall Fire in it selfe, yet by reason it cannot mooue but in his <hi>medium</hi> or thick vehicle, namely, the artificiall fire beneath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the thick fume or smoake of the thing combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible, and naturall, &amp; elementall without the clouds and aire, in which it is carried, it is for that cause impedited or hindred for making so great a spheare or Diameter in his Actiuity, because the vehicle, being thick, cannot without some resistance of the Aire penetrate into the same. But the celestiall fire which is the fountaine of the fire of life, by reason of his subtile spirit, which is his Aetheriall vehicle, pierceth all things, being nothing else but a subtile influence, which according to the best Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers aduice, doth pierce without any resistance, thorow rocks and stones, euen to the very center of the earth, as experience it selfe doth witnesse. For else (say the Philosophers) this Influence could not by little and little produce in the bowels of the earth the formes of metalls and precious stones more or lesse noble, according to the worthinesse of that starrie spirit, which sent downe that influence and purenesse of that mercuriall vapour which it ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth. But yet the life of man, I meane, that refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned spirit by which man liueth, is more subtile, pure, and exalted then it: And therefore of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Actiuity, as shall be manifested hereafter.</p>

The Starres celestiall excell all sublunarie Agents: the <note place="margin">Foster.</note> Sunns light goeth through the world; but yet a little cloud obscureth the light and abateth the heate. The earth keepeth the light from the Antipodes: The body of the Moone eclipseth the sunne, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If the starres celestiall excell the sublunarie A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, <note place="margin">Fludd.</note> then was Master <hi>Foster</hi> to blame, to say be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the terrestriall fire, was the most raging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and powerfullest Agent of all. But in this hee commeth to me: for if the celestiall Agents be more potent then the sublunarie, it argueth that it hath a greater spheare of Actiuity, and can send out his Diametrall beames, further then either Loadstone, fire, or such like sublunarie things, in which, though the agent celestiall be, yet it is so cloied and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with a grosse spirit, or compacted body, that it cannot operat, as in the graine of corne it appeareth, whose internall and centrall fire, except it be set at libertie, will not moue from the superficies of the Earth vp toward heauen and multiplie. But to the purpose: what a story doth our Author tell vs of the Sunne, the Sunns light, the Eclipse, the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Earth betwixt the Sunne in our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and the Antipodes, the impediting of the Sunns light by the interposition of a cloud? Verily, it is more to shew his small skill in Astronomy and Philosophie, then to touch truely any thing that is material to our argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For, I am sure, he is not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that there are two things more besides light which are exactly by Philosophers to be considered (to wit) motion and influence. If he will say that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence can be stoped by clouds, by interposition of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2524:24"/>
starres, by aire, by water, or by earth, he erreth and knoweth no Philosophy: <hi>motu, lumine, &amp; influentiâ operantur stellae, &amp; non solo lumine;</hi> The starres oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate by motion, light, and Influence, not by light onely. The visible light may bee obscured to vs, but the Influence will flow without resistance. And to this purpose speake the wisest Philosophers. <note place="margin">Foster.</note>

                  <p>Now then shall terrestriall agents by distance or interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition be totally, and celestiall be partly hindered, and shall this Weapon-salue worke from the weapon to the wound at all distances? Shall the interposition (I say) neither of ayre, woods, fire, water, walls, houses, castles cities, mountaine, &amp;c: hinder the deriuation of the vertue of it.</p>
                  <p>First, I say that the originall act in this cure issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Fludd.</note> from the wounded person to the ointment, and not (as he saith) from the ointment to the wound. Next, I told this busie Gentleman before, that makes so much adoe now about nothing; that for asmuch as this spirit proceedeth from a celestiall influence animated by God, therefore it hath no such stopps and rubbes; neither is this subtill of all subtill creatures any way impedited in his descent to feed &amp; nourish that <hi>species,</hi> vnto which, from the creation of the <hi>species</hi> it was ordained; but we must know thus much, that before it came downe it was Catholicke and generall; but after it did penetrate into bodies, it endueth a specificall and particular nature, and hath an especiall Sympathie with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture like it selfe, and for this reason, the wounded mans spirit penetrateth through the vehicle of Aire, in which the bloud is conuayed vnto the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and naturally affects the oyntment: so much
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2524:25"/>
the rather, because that bloud was ayre, and ayre is dilated bloud in his internall, and that I can ocular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrate: and also the principall ingredient of the oyntment was of the bloud; wherefore as we see the Sunne by his beames doth send out his spirit into a graine of corne in the Earth, and hath his liuely influence or essentiall beames of Emission continuate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with his like; nay, the very same that lurketh in the dead and corrupted graine, and so by little and little reuiueth, that which was as it were dead and buried in corruption, making it to thriue and vegetate with multiplication: euen so and no otherwise the Sunne of life in man liuing and mouing yet in man, as the Sunne in the great world, hath his liuely beame of influence continued vnto the spirituall sparke in the dead bloud, which is all one with the influe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce emitting, but buried in a dead bloody corporall graine, namely, the dead blood conueyed to the oyntment, the which oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we compare vnto a good, a wholesome or a comfortable earth, most proper for the nourishing of such a hidden spirit as lurketh in the bloud, being that they, namely, the ointment and the bloud trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred or committed vnto it, are no strangers to one an other, but as homogeneall, or rather as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted as one specificall body is vnto a Spirit of the same degree in nature, for as much as the body of the oyntment is compounded (according vnto my receipt) ofbloud, fat-flesh and the mosse or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresence of the bones of the same Microcosmicall <hi>Species,</hi> though not <hi>indiuiduum,</hi> all which are anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from that Spirit of life which abideth in mans
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2524:25"/>
bloud: The Influence therefore of life issuing from the Microcosmicall or humane Sonne and assisting reuiuifying and multiplying by little and little the hidden graine of life in the amputated bloud now in the oyntment, and also exciting the potentiall or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified Spirit in the oyntment, no otherwise then we see the Sunne of Heauen to stirre vp, in the spring time, the Spirits of the earth which the cold winter had stupefied and benummed, leaueth not to operate betweene both extremes, vntill the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth recouer.</p>
                  <p>This is the true Mystery of the Question, and I will stand to it, that the vse of the earth to rott, rayse vp, and multiplie the graine of wheat is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, Diabolicall and vnlawfull, if it can be truely demonstrated, that the vse of this oyntment is witchcraft and vnsufferable; for their mysterie of multiplication, reviuification and coniunction of the viuifying spirit of the one, with the viuified spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the other, is all one and the same. It was a type by which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> doth teach vs the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, namely, by the dying and rotting of corne in the earth; and as for the operation of the Sunne in the graines multiplication, euery plowman will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct you in it. Now for a conclusion vnto this, we see that sometimes the Sunne is further off, and somtimes nearer, and yet more or lesse, he doth not cease to operate by vegetating and multiplying in Animals, vegetables, and mettalls: I must now heare his conclusion.</p>

                  <p>As before we presume to build any stately Palace, wee must lay a strong foundation, to vphold the whole fabricke thereof: euen so before we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to establish or reare a strong Castle of defence to serue as a firmer Negatiue opposition against mine Aduersaries affirmation; I thinke it fit to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect some firme grounds or spirituall arguments, which, in lieu of corner stones may statuminate and prop vp the whole truth of the proposed Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and expresse the true resolution of it, to bee cleane adverse and different from that which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth shew of. I will therefore imitate him in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my entrance into this enquiry with this Sillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistical argument grounded on his owne confession which he maketh Pag. 7. <hi>The Angels of Heauen,</hi> saith he, <hi>cannot worke at such a distance onely God whose Essence is infinit, and is,</hi> omnia in omnibus, <hi>all in all, can worke thus:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If God therefore worketh all in all, by himselfe without the essentiall Assistance of any created spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or body, then the Diuell is no Actor in the Weapon Salue; but God worketh all in all of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, without the essentiall Assistance of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Therefore the Diuell operateth nothing of or by himselfe, although he in his office is euill and destructiue, much lesse in doing good, as is supposed by the curing through the Weapon-Salue, which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2524:29"/>
is vtterly against his condition, being created or ordained after his fall for another vse.</p>
                  <p>The Maior is euident; because a Generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth euery particular: And therefore if God operateth all in all, then the Diuell operateth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but curing is an operation, and therefore a worke onely of God.</p>
                  <p>The Minor or the assumption is iustified by the Apostle in these words: <hi>There are diuersitie of gifts,</hi>

A pretty, witty conclusion of Master <hi>Foster,</hi> and the Iesuiticall <hi>Ioan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Roberti</hi> his foster father, in this blind conceit.</p>
                  <p>But now I will be so bold as to produce an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this oyntment, not vnlike to that which Master <hi>Foster</hi> hath framed:</p>
                  <p>If there be no diuine institution or authority out of holy writ, to warrant any curing effect or Art by the diuell, eyther by supernaturall or naturall means, then is there no reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that the cure done by the weapon-salue is effected by the worke of the diuell.</p>
                  <p>But in holy writ, there is not found any such war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for the curing of wounds by the diuell, through the helpe eyther of Supernaturall or Naturall meanes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is not to be credited, that the curing by the weapon-salue can be effected by the Art or act of the diuell.</p>
                  <p>The Maior is of the selfe-same effect with that of M. <hi>Fosters</hi> argument, where he seemeth to auer, that because the vse of this weapon-salue is not effected by diuine institution, nor yet hath any testimony or
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2524:35"/>
example to confirme it out of holy writ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is prestigious. And againe (as is said before) what God hath originally decreed in the archetypi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>Idaea,</hi> that cannot be altered; but the diuell was ordained for another vse, quite contrary vnto the pious and mercifull act of healing.</p>

Psal. 33, 6.</note> that his very Spirit is in all things, the wise <hi>Salomon</hi> doth intimate expressely, saying, that <hi>the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Spirit of the Lord is in all things, and that from the Spirit of Gods mouth proceedeth the vertues of all things,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> telleth vs: which being so, it must consequently follow, that the essentiall forme or life of euery Creature in this world, must depend on this Spirit, and haue his centrall seate of Actiuity in proportion more or lesse from this Agent of Agents, who as it acteth in the Center of all things; so is it euen continuat vnto the circumference, that is, from <hi>Alpha</hi> or the Center, vnto <hi>Omega</hi> or the Circumference: for else would there bee a diuision of the diuine Essence, which is impossible. And for this cause is God said to fill all, and to operate all in all; wherefore the Apostle concludeth (as before) that the Ethnick Philosophy framed out by the tradition and inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans wisdome, is false and deceitfull; but that which is founded onely vpon Christ, is to bee embraced; because, that in him dwelleth the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Diuinity, which operateth all in all, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the will and decree of his Father: who is the head of all <hi>Potestates</hi> and principalities, and

Loe, this is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Theosophicall subiect, whereby I make my strickt Inquisition into the mystery of this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of healing by the Weapon-Salue, And thus much for a preamble to the discourse. Now to the purpose:</p>
                  <p>Wee must obserue in the cure done by this Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon-Salue three principall things, namely, the partie wounded, the Oyntment curing, and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the occulte actiuity, which raigneth in the blood and issueth from the blood vnto the Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The party wounded may rightly be compared to the world, and therefore is called a little world: he is composed of heauen and earth; namely, of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and body, and as the Creatour did send out his Spirit, which moued vpon the waters, and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, animate and viuifie them; so that (as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> saith) of them and by them were the heauens and the earth framed, and by this spirituall Word established vnto this day: euen so mans heauen and his earth are fashioned out by the same eternall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life, on which it relyeth and continueth in his specificall succession, euen vnto this very day. And therfore is it said, <hi>Ye are carued out of one and the same Spirituall Rocke,</hi> and that <hi>In him wee line, wee moue and haue our Being:</hi> and that <hi>we are the Temples</hi>

Contrariwise, hee shall finde, that the ayre included; feeling the heate of the externall ayre, by little and little, to get domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ouer the cold, will dilate it selfe, and by dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made more mobill, subtill and liuely; and therefore requireth a larger capacity, as is ocularly proued thus; namely, because the water is strucke down by so many degrees lower, by how many the externall heate doth vanquish the cold in the ayre.

much more that in the winds, is the act of God, and as wee finde that the incorruptible spirit doth moue and operate two manner of contrary wayes, namely, from the center, to the circumference, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </note> as this secret and mysticall spirit, hath breathed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dead a blast of life, so that very blast or breath is essentially of the nature, property, and Will of the Breather, which was to make aliue, by a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and not a stupifying spirit: and thereupon created spirits, which were before congealed and mortified, became now quickned and liuely, and were closed in an externall body, and in an ayery or bloody vehicle, which by vertue of this quickning blast, his spirit did moue in the channels or veines and arteries, being animated by the vertue of that spirit of life. And this is the reason that God did ordaine so strict precepts, touching the blood of the creatures (as is said before) namely, that it should not be eaten, as is aboue related, because, <hi>in it is the spirit of life, or the soule of the creature,</hi> in which is the spirituall vertue of the foure winds: For in this action of life, hee exerciseth the very same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in the heart of the creature, or little world, as hee doth in the heauenly sunne of the great world.

                  <p>But now, that I may in this place touch in few words, though somewhat allaterally, Master <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> Aristotelicall limited spheare of Actiuity, which the old Schoolemen haue so tumbled and tossed in their externall Phantasies, without any centrall regard vnto this true and essentiall viuify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and vegetating spirits dilatiue or contractiue power: I would faine know, whether any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly philosophicall Axiome can conclude or limit this princely spirit of the foure Winds, which bloweth and breatheth, as well in the great world, as little; when, where, how farre, and at what distance it pleaseth. I will first giue an example of his action from each wind in the great world, and shew you how it commandeth, carrieth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth the spirit of the vegetable Creature. Wee can gather and collect the virtuall operation of the vegetable <hi>ad distans,</hi> by no meanes, but by the scent; as for example, <hi>Rosemary and Sassaphras,</hi> &amp;c: Doe emitt their spirit into the Aire, at a proportionated distance more or lesse, according vnto the viuacity of the acting Spirit, which is in it; and yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2524:49"/>
wee see, that, if the blast of any strong wind, doth encounter the emitted spirit of the Creature, it dilateth it mightily from his centre or plant, and maketh a wonderfull large spheare of actiuity; and that greater or le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>er, according vnto the power of the wind. The case is apparant and found most true, by such as trauaile by sea neare Spaine: For, when the wind is Easterly, they can discerne the Aire thirty Leagues off the shore, to bee filled with the sweet odour of Rosemary, which groweth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly in those parts of Spaine: And euen in the very like manner about Guiana and Virginea, at the same or greater distance, the odoriferous scent of the <hi>Sassaphras,</hi> with other fweet woods, is scen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the nauigatours vpon those shores; and that somtimes before they can discerne any land. What shall wee then say of the same spirit, which a cteth in the little world or man, when his insensible breath or emanation tendeth affectionally towards the homogeniall place of his owne nature? I meane vnto the ointment, inwhich the selfe same indiuisible nature, either in the blood, adhering to the weapon, or hauing penetrated in the weapon, without any signe of external blood, is bathed? Shall wee not beleeue, that by his emanation, it can car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry along with it in the Ayre, the occult spirit of the vegetating nature of the wounded person, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded secretly in a volatile salt, to act in the oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vnto the reuiuifying of the sopified spirit in the oyntment? No mary, saith Master <hi>Foster!</hi> For, the <hi>Sassaphras</hi> woods odoriferous spirit, and that of the Rosemaries are knowne by sense, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2524:50"/>
so cannot the breath of such an emanating spirit, with his volatile vehicle of vegetation, be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. An excellent Argument in an externall and sensible Philosopher, who with Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> will beleeue nothing, but what he toucheth, smelleth, or tasteth: But intellectuall men may easily gather, that there is nothing that is externall and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; but was first internall and inuisible. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be conuertibly said, that, what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, was externall. For, there are an infinity of inuisible and internal actions performed by God, in the closet of Nature; which falleth not into the spheare, or capacity of the sensuall or naturall man; but are onely by faith to bee beleeued. And for this reason, the Apostle saith; <hi>Through Faith wee</hi>

                     <hi>vnderstand, that the world was ordained by the Word of God, so that the things that wee see, are not made of things which did appeare.</hi> By which it is euidently proued, that all things were first inuisible, before they were by sense to bee discerned: And consequently, it is the property of an externall and carnall man, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue nothing, but what hee perceiueth by sense, and to say, that if any thing appeare to sense, which was not knowne before, it is diabolicall and not of God; when the aforesaid text doth attribute all, reducing of inuisible actions, to the visible sense by the Word, not of the Deuill; but of God. All Philosophers therefore haue accorded, that it is one spirit of life, which onely operateth in mans body: But this spirit, according vnto his diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of distinct offices, indueth a diuers appellatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2524:50"/>
Rationall; in an other Concupiscible; and in a third Irascible. By the first, it is apt to be illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, to vnderstand things that are aboue it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it, and in it, and with it selfe. For, by this his propertie or faculty, it knoweth God aboue it selfe; the Angels which are ranked with it selfe, and whatsoeuer is comprehended in the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the heauens, beneath it selfe; such is his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall act of centrall emanation, by reason of that powerfull vertue, allotted her by God. By the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and the third it is inclined, either to desire and affect a thing, or to eschew and flye from it; that is, either to loue or hate, &amp;c: And by this propertie of hers, she doth exercise herselfe about the Sympathy or Antipathy of those things, which are either proper or dissonant vnto her specifick nature. And therefore in this her office, she work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mightily, in and about the effects of this Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon-Salue, being that from these two later opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in her, proceedeth euery affection. For, as of Concupiscibility proceedeth all ioy and hope, because <hi>Natura laetatur in sua naturâ, &amp;c:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the vnion of the liuely emanation, the dead or congealed spirit in the Salue, is quickned and viuified: So contrariwise, the liuing soule or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Spirit, in which the supernaturall Spirit doth act, is of it's owne nature obnoxious vnto a kind of spirituall dolor and feare, by reason of the Weapon that vsed violence vnto it, the which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions belong to, and are affected by the Irascible spirit; for asmuch as it either greiueth, or is made dolorous already at the violence offered, or sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2524:51"/>
to bee greiued or made dolorous by it. These foure affections of the spirit of man, are the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and as it were the common subiect of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and vicious actions, which befall vnto man. Now to expresse the large extension of that centrall spirit, which doth radically operate in the vitall spirit; the wisest Philosophers affirme, that it seeth it selfe in it selfe to the end, that it may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderstand it selfe in it selfe. And when it will know God, it eleuateth it selfe aboue it selfe, by it's mentallbeame; it penetrats all things, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth all things, as well present as absent; it is, when it pleaseth beyond the seas, and searcheth out things that are hidden: yea, and in one moment, it directeth and sendeth forth his beames vnto the farthest limits of the whole world, and searcheth out the secrets of it: it descendeth downe vnto the deepe, and mounteth vp againe from thence vnto heauen, and cleaueth fast to Christ, and is made all one with Christ. And must the infinite vertue of this all penetrating spirit, according vnto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Fosters</hi> tenent, bee limited by any imaginary spheare of actiuity, assigned by the vaine Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the Ethnicks, which as the Apostle saith, is framed out after the tradition of man and the world, and not by God? Doth he not warne vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that wee be not deceiued by such philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call doctrine, which doth disagree from the rules of Christ, in whom is the plenitude of the Godhood bodily? And must we now to obey Master <hi>Fosters</hi> phantasticall <hi>Idaea,</hi> breake the Lawes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, to be deluded by his false Philosophy? But

                  <p>All this which is aboue mentioned, being well considered, namely, the Catholike Nature of the Spirit, which breathed life into the creatures, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For, this reason therefore (I say) namely, because of the presence of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible spirit, in the blood of the creature, God in any case forbids the Israelites to eate of blood: because (saith the Text) <hi>the life of the flesh</hi>

It is easily therefore to be discerned, what a concatenation heere is of members in succession, which deriue their liues from one and the same radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call essence or spirit, and are made by it to sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thise with one and the same harmony in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures composition; being that he hath made of one blood all man-kinde, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth fitly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently being all flesh and bones, are made of one blood, there must be a great relation betweene them and mans blood in generall, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betweene the blood and the oyntment which is made of them.</p>
                  <p>These things therefore being rightly pondered, as infallible grounds, wee conclude thus: In the Question proposed, wee are to obserue these fiue obiects: namely, first the wound, secondly, the blood which issueth from the wound, thirdly, the manner of conueyance from the oyntment, to the wound, at any reasonable distance, fourthly, the nature of the oyntment, and lastly, the manner of operation, whereby the cure is effected.</p>
                  <p>First, therefore concerning the wound, it is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the worke, which the spirit of life did ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, namely, an effusion of blood, in which the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life is carryed and moueth, a hinderance and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>erting of the course of the naturall humors, a diuision, and solution of the fat, flesh, and other such like parts from their integrity and continuity, an offence vnto that peaceable act of life, effected by
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2524:52"/>
that incorruptible spirit of God, which by this his property, or attribute, is apt to viuifie all in all. For, this cause therefore is this radicall, acting spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed in this businesse, or vnnaturall action; as fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his worke hindered, and his essentiall action disturbed by the wound or violence offered: For, wheras the blood is the vehicle of it, and his viuify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act was to circulate in the organicall blood, and to cause transmutation of it into flesh, and other parts for vegetation &amp; multiplications sake, and for the preseruation of the <hi>induiduum;</hi> Now is the same blood slused out at the mouth of the wound, and made inutill and of none effect; the body (for the animating of the which this secret spirit is euer dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently enclined) is debilitated and made drooping. Wherefore as the incorruptible and viuifying na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath intended to rectifie his humane spirit by her liuely actiuity, so verily is she ready to oppose all violence offered, and to correct &amp; repaire againe, all that which violent irruption hath caused; much like the wise Spider, who when her web is made imperfect, and in part broken, doth her diligence to bring it againe to its wonted perfection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the blood, as it is the vehicle of the spirit of life, though it be by the wound voided out; yet retaineth in it this spirit of life; but in another property: for, it doth not now act to liue, that is to say, it doth not send forth his beames from the centre to the circumference to cause life; but contrarily, being as it were displeased with the violence of the act, contracteth it selfe from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference into the centre, that is, from action in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2524:53"/>
the circumference of the creature, into it selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contracted into the centre thereof, where it seemeth to rest, and so leaueth his bodily, and ayery vehicle as congealed, stupfied and dead; and here is that mystery discouered, namely, the reason, why the murtherer being brought before the murthered, the spirit centrally resting in the blood, doth mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously emanate and flow forth, and make fluent againe, the blood, as being stirred vp by the like spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit antipathetically, acting and agitating from the blood of the murtherer: For (as I said before) this spirit in his irascible property is as apt to hate, as in his concupiscible to loue: For this reason, the Text teacheth vs, that <hi>the blood of a slaine man is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>

yet the very bones, forasmuch as they participate of the nature of the most earthly part of the flesh. Hence was it, that when certaine theeues had cast the body of one whom they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Let this, I beseech you be remembred, that the touch of <hi>Eliseus</hi> his bones, caused the dead to rise from death to life.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, I come to the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueying of the blood from the wound vnto the oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The blood is taken from the liuing fountaine of blood in the wounded, eyther as it is smeared on the weapon that did the deed, or as it is fastened on some sticke, Iron, or other thing, and so conueyed vnto the oyntment, at any reasonable distance. Now a reason is to be shewed, how it is possible that there can be any certaine relation betweene the wound and the oyntment: For (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Foster</hi> saith) there may be Castles, hills, walls, and grosse ayre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the oyntment and the wounded, which may hinder the cure.</p>

                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:2524:54"/>
First, wee must remember, that wee haue expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in our precedent discourse, the excellency of the animating spirit, in whom is all the vertue, and each property of the foure winds, and being it is the spirit of spirits, <hi>Et spiritus spirat vbi vult,</hi> What (I pray you) can hinder his act or operation? And with what distance can his actiuity be limited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is the spirit of the winds, and the soule of the lightnings, and the essence of the Sunne and starres of heauen, which by his animation doe cast their beames periferically vnto euery angle of the Horison, or Hemispheare? Can this spirir, because contained in mans blood, not penatrate many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles by emanation out of his bloody vehicle, as it doth out of his cloudy Tabernacle in the forme, or rather vehicle, oflightning or, out from his <hi>Phoebean</hi> Palace in golden beames, whereupon it is said, <hi>In lumine numen, &amp; in numine lumen, In light is diuinity, and in diuinity is light:</hi> so saith the <hi>Psalmist:</hi>

and extensiue dimension; nor yet hindred in his passage, by any intermediate obstacle.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, that man that beleeueth and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on this spirit, may effect what he desireth: For, euen by the true knowledge and vse of it, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles did wonders, as well in curing as effecting matters of greater admiration. This spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit therefore, which is called intellectuall, as hee maketh to vnderstand; <hi>Inspiratio omnipotentis,</hi> saith <note place="margin">Iob 9. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Iob, facit intelligere:</hi> Vitall in respect of his viuificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Spiritus Dei fortis fecit me,</hi> saith he, &amp; <hi>spiraculum omnipotentis viuificauit me;</hi> And naturall in respect of <note place="margin">Iob 9.</note> vegetation and multiplication, <hi>visitatio tua</hi> (saith hee else where) <hi>conseruauit spiritum meum,</hi> doth act <note place="margin">Iob 11.</note> and shine forth by secret beames, v to that obiect of the dead blood, which is carryed from it vnto the oyntment, in which amputated blood, lurketh a portion of spirit, resting without action. Now the nature of the one, is reioyced in the nature of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forasmuch as both doe sympathise together, being that they are all of one consonance or degree, or vnison in vitall loue: as for example, I take two Lutes or Vialls, or any other such like instruments, I set one of them at one end of the table, &amp; set the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the other end, I put a small straw vpon one of the strings, of the one Lute, which importeth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la-mi-re,</hi> or <hi>De-la-sol-re,</hi> and then stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> the <hi>Gam-vt</hi> of the other Lute, and the straw will not once stirre, because theydoe not sympathise in one sound and proportion of wauing ayre, therefore haue they not a relation one vnto another: so also, if the blood be carryed vnto an oyntment heterogeneall in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2524:55"/>
vnto the party wounded, it will doe nothing in this cure; but if you put a straw on the <hi>Gam-vt,</hi> or <hi>A-re,</hi> of the one, and strike the other on <hi>Gam-vt,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re,</hi> being vnisons, you shall perceiue, the straw pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to leap of the other string, by reason of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer great vibration or louing actiuity, and like for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall proportion, which he sympatheticall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, betwixt each strings, causeth to other in the aire, yea, this effect wil happen, though there be put boords, or other such like obstacles, as may hinder the direct line of the vibration in the aire or <hi>medium</hi> betwixt the two Lutes; In which experiment you may note, that the string strucke, is aptly compared vnto the blood of the wounded, being stil animated in his body, who doth by a secret emanation or emission, and that by a naturall inclination, and sympathy, cause in the selfe-same tone a secret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between the still and occult spirit in the congealed blood, which is in the oyntment, which I compare to the string, which the straw hath on it: so that the string though it be of it selfe still, yet at the acting of that other chord, which is really moued with the actuall spirit, of the chord strucken, by meere concent, stirreth vp the still chord to act also, and by action to send backe againe a salutife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous harmony, vnto the acting spirit, which is as neere vnto his owne still or potentiall nature, as the tone of one Lute acting or strucke, vnto that of the other not strucke. For as both are but one spirit, though they seeme to differ in distance, as doe the chord of both Lutes, so likewise are those two tones but one tone; though they seeme to differ: and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2524:55"/>
therefore make but one vnisone. But because the one spirit cannot essentially be separated from the other, no more then can diuinity effentially be diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into parts, as also the one tone cannot be essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally distinguished from the other: therefore it doth liuely extend it selfe, <hi>à termino à quo, ad terminum ad quem:</hi> from the wound vnto the oyntment, as being all one spirit continuated, euen as wee see one thred extended from one end of a Chamber vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now being this spirit requireth a spirituall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle like it selfe, it is carried, <hi>quasi super alas venti, as it were vpon the wings of the wind,</hi> in the hidden spirit of the blood, which seemeth as a vehicle: no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then the essentiall spirit of the wind is carryed by the ayre, and obserueth no limited distance, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is hindred by mountaines, woods, or walls, to worke his effect: as wee see the Northwind doth produce in Lumbardy frost, Ice, snow, &amp;c. Although the high Alpin mountaines, piercing the very clouds, are interposed. But I will bring a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar example of the graine of Corne, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing considered in himselfe, without his mother earth, seemeth no way to act; for his vitall spirit doth lurke in the centre, and not operate to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumserence, eyther by way of vegetation, or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication. The fountaine from whence the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soule comes by multiplication, is the sunne of heauen, which worketh life in all vegetable things, by the vertue of the foresaid Catholike spirit of life, which did put his Tabernacle in the Sunne, giuing a naturall increase of life and vegetation to euery thing: For, though this spirit in it selfe be Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,

Whereupon <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that <hi>Sol &amp; homo generant hominem, the Sunne and a man, doe engender a man.</hi> As for example, it hath multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the successiue influence of this piercing spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in a graine of Wheat, being resuscitated (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith) after death and putrefaction in his proper earth, from one to twenty, and afterwards moueth vpwards in his ayery vehicle, with his strawie stalk, towards the fountaine of his being, and draweth by a sympatheticall, or magnetike vertue, his like from aboue, by the <hi>medium</hi> of the Carholike ayre.

The oyntment is the good ground, in which the bloudy graine doth dye and rise again, which I will now speake of.</p>
                  <p>The fourth to be considered, is the ointment and his nature. Who, but a meare Ideot can deny, that like doth desire his like, or that one Nature being stronger doth cherish, foster and releiue an other that is weaker, and the weaker reioyceth in the aide and comfort it bringeth? The ancient Physitians and Philosophers haue obserued, that lungs nourish lungs, and braines nourish braines that are weake, the spleene helps to fortifie the spleene, &amp; for weak gutts wee make Glysters of boyled gutts, the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke

In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion it is certaine, that <hi>simile agit naturali inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione in suum simile, like worketh in his like. Natura e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim laetatur suâ naturâ, natura naturâ gaudet: Nature reioyceth in his nature, Nature is glad at the presence of his nature.</hi> Now if wee looke into the composition of this medicince, we shall find, that it is of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull consonance with the blood of man, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, there is the selfe-same relation of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son betwixt this ointment with the blood in it and the wounded mans nature; as is between the string of one lute, that is proportioned vnto the other in the same tone: And for this cause will be apt to eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate &amp; quauer forth one mutuall consent of simpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall harmony, if that the spirits of both, by the vertuall contact of one anothers nature, be made by conueying the indiuiduall spirit of the one into the

Doth hee, or his sharpest witted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters know the certaine limits of actiuity in euery thing that hee concludeth thus boldly? <hi>Foelix qui potuit rerum talium cognoscere causas.</hi> But I am sure, I can discerne no such felicity in his reuelations or prescriptions of limits vnto naturall agents, much lesse vnto that spirit, which acteth and operateth all in all, and ouer all. <hi>Qui quicquid vult facit, tàm in virtutibus Coeli, quàm in habitatoribus terrae; which effecteth, what it pleaseth: and therefore, at what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance it listeth: as well with the vertues of heauen, as with the dwellers on the earth.</hi> If this great Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Weapon-Salue-Salue, would but consider the wonderfull operation, that this Catholicke spirit produceth in this cold and contracting facultie, as when he moueth from the North and maketh snow,

most potent spirit in question, or limit it (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the phantastick opinion of some men) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an imaginary spheare of actiuity, being that this spirit, is from him who filleth all, and operateth all, and in all: and therefore consequently effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the great works of contraction and dilatation, which are so apparant in euery Angle of the world. Will he circumscribe this action of eleuating foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and againe depressing them, within any spheare or orbe, except it bee that of the round world?

                  <p>It is euident therfore by this, which we haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, that this magneticall kind of cure is <hi>Donum Dei,</hi> the Gift of God, according vnto <hi>Paracelsus</hi> his opinion, and not the act of the Deuill, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Foster,</hi> most vnchristianly hath published; at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2524:59"/>
against reason and conscience, that vnto the Deuill, the worst and foulest of spirits (whose office is onely destructiue and wounding, and not constructiue or healing) which is the onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of this best, fayrest or purest of all spirits, on whom attend all good Angels, to doe his will, as the Deuill hath his bad angels to destroy.</p>
                  <p>You may therefore see by this (Gentle Reader) how life is breathed into the creature by Gods good Spirit of life: how his seate or vehicle, in which he moueth, is the blood, how that fat, flesh and bones haue their life and vegetation from the spirit, that moueth in the blood, how this spirit operateth, priuatiuely by contracting his beames of life, from the circumference vnto the center of the Creature where it resteth, or rather ceaseth to operate the effects of his office of life, as it is made manifest in the dead &amp; congealed blood or graineof wheat; and againe, it operateth positiuely to life, by which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiueth that which was dead, by sending out his act from the centre to the circumference of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it doth in the graine of Wheat, buryed in the ground, or the congealed blood, cleauing ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to stick or weapon, conueyed to the oyntment, as his most naturalest earth. I shewed you how the spirit is all one, and vndiuisible, and therefore that this which resideth in the salue, and that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateth in the body, are concatenated, or continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted essentially one to another, as being all one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, though it commeth from the foure winds: not diuided, I say, in essence, but onely differing in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, for it worketh contractingly by eold, &amp; dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2524:59"/>
by heate: also that there is but one common vehicle, which carryeth this spirit in the Etheriall substance of the blood. And lastly, that because the oyntment is made of mans blood, mans fat, mans flesh, or mummy, and the fumous excrescence of mans bones, called <hi>vznie</hi> or the <hi>mosse</hi> that groweth on the skull, according vnto my receit, and for that the nature of the Catholike spirit thus specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is in the oyntment, though not working, and is stirred vp to operate by the vnion which it hath now from the beames of the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore the mixtion of these two spirits now operating, in one viuifying vnion, makes them to tend vnto the fountaine of life, as the graine rifing out of the earth, would carry also his like, which was clad in earth, vpward toward his natiue home, did not the heauy coats of the elements hinder his further ascent. But because this earth or salue is more spirituall, it sendeth out his power vnto the blood, by that harmony, which the continuation of spirit doth effect, namely, as it were by an vnison, by reason of the vniformity of the specifick spirit belonging vnto man, by the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion whereof the foure discordant elements, and euery member of mans body are vnited vnto a fympatheticall harmony, adopted to the vse of life in the creature, yea, also forasmuch, as the

blood, flesh, fat, and bones in all other vnreasonable creatures, are framed out of one kinde of elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forme, and fashioned alike, by the same operating spirit; it is no maruell, if his blood being brought vnto the same oyntment, doe also cause health in the wounded creature, being it doth generally tend to life, which is proper to all bloody creatures, no exceptions had vnto each specifick difference. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this therefore (being well conceiued and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered euen by the very zealous, with little vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing) can appeare an act of the diuell, and not the blessed gift of God; I leaue it to the scanning of such as can better iudge of this matter then my selfe.</p>

There is another admirable experiment, tryed by a noble personage, of whom I wil make mention more at large in the sixt chapter of this member: for one of his men hauing deeply cut his finger, and that about the ioynt, with a sith, as he was mowing of grasse; his finger bled still, and could not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be staunched. Wherefore this Earle, wished them to knoke off the Sithe from the handle, and to bring it vnto him, that hee might anoynt it: the wounded fellow went about it himselfe, and at the very first knocke that hee gaue the weapon that had wounded him, the blood stanched, and he bled not one drop more. And verily he acknowledged, that though there were not a iot of blood to be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on the weapon; yet if hee anoynted the place of the instrument that made the wound (which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he confessed, he was forced to doe by guesse) hee did performe as well the cure, as if the blood had stucke vpon it. Out of which reuelation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection I gather, that all the mystery of this cure, consisteth in the secret and inuisible spirit, which is within the blood, as well remaining still, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating in the wounded body, as that which hath pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated inuisibly into the weapon: for, else, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the presence of the visible blood, it could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, yea, and out of that obseruation, namely, that the Sithe, or weapon being strucke, the blood did forth-with stanch; there is as great a mystery ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as when the presench of the murtherer, doth cause the congealed blood in the murthre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This Knight hauing good acquaintance with one Captaine <hi>Stiles,</hi> for asmuch as in times past he was his tenant, was with the said Captaine in the Company of very good and learned Diuines, at the making of the said Oyntment, who saw all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grediences apart, and after beheld an Apothecary to compound them together without any kinde of

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2524:63"/>
medicine applied by the Deuill; but rather this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of Master <hi>Fosters</hi> is deuillish, and the cure of the ointment naturall. For else, why should the ointment on the axe, being discouered or stuck off by the sword hilts, be an occasion of the suddaine alteration in the wound from better to worse? And why should the wound returne againe from his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous distemper vnto his wonted ease, after the re-anointing and couering anew of the Weapon?</p>
                  <p>His second History of this manner of curing was this: I (saith S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Nicholas Gilbourne</hi>) hauing giuen vnto mee the sewing of a pond at Charing; after I had done, the boyes of the towne went into it to seeke for fish. Among the rest <hi>Brent Deering</hi> (the Sonne of Master <hi>Finsh Deering</hi>) did goe into it for that purpose, and there had a Reed runne into the calfe of his leg: This bled much, &amp; put him to great paine, which caufed his mother to send vnto one <hi>Iohn Hart</hi> a Chirurgion of Charing to search and dresse the wound; but hee continued after dressing full of paine, and apt to faint. Whereupon his Sister was sent vnto me, to doe my best for his ease. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that I could doe no good, because he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready drefled by the Chirurgio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But that would not satisfie them: and therefore vpon their importunity, I aduised them (because they informed me that the orifice was very narrow) to wash away all the Chirugions work, and to put a knitting needle into the wound, so farre as it would goe, and to tye a thred where it would passe no further: they did so, and found that it went quite through to the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>kin on the other side. This knitting needle I did
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2524:63"/>
anoynt, and in foure or fiue dayes, it was well in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, sauing that vpon the top of the orifice, there was a dry scale. I was nothing well satisfied, to find that it was not perfectly well, but had still a scale remaining vpon it. And therefore I did new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anoynt the knitting needle ouer night, and the next morrow, there came out of the orifice, a small splinter of the Reed, and after that, it was in two or three dayes perfectly whole,</p>
                  <p>These are the very words of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Nicholas Gilborns</hi> letter: What will M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Foster</hi> say to this cure? What? Was it the diuell did this cure by other medicines, and not by this magnetike or sympatheticall oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? verily, the case is plaine, that all the curatiue power did consist in the salue: For, the effects in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring did testifie so much; but the principall agent is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued or rather did emanate from the wounded boy.</p>

                  <p>By Windsor, there was one, who had somewhat to doe in the Chase or Forrest, who, as he was mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a piece of medow, fell backeward vpon the edge of his Sithe, and cut all his back so dangerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly, that his life was greatly to be feared; the Sithe forthwith sent to London to Captaine <hi>Stiles,</hi> who was anoynted it, wrapped it vp, and laid it aside. Not long after, there came one to demand for Doctor <hi>Stiles,</hi> and he was sent vnto Do. <hi>Stiles;</hi> The Minister, who vnderstanding that it was about a thankes-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for a cure done by the weapon-salue, sent him vnto the Captaine; hee desires to speake with him: The Captaine being at dinner, or supper, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his friends, sent for the fellow into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning roome, and there hee told the Captaine, that the wounded man, did acknowledge of him his life vnder God, assuring him that the dangerous wound did heale a pace, after hee had sent his Sithe vnto him, and was thorowly cured without any other application. And for a part of recompence, and to expresse his thankfulnesse, hee presented him with a side of Red Deere.</p>
                  <p>Heere you may see, that this cure was performed at a distance of 20, miles betweene the wound and the oyntment.</p>

For which cause he did abstaine from the vse and practice thereof; although he did acknowledge the act of it to be wonderfull. And yet neuerthelesse, beause his curiosity did incite him, to diue a little further into the truth of this mystery; hee did at the last, desire to speake with one Captaine <hi>Stiles</hi> (a man well knowne by his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, to be both wise &amp; religious, as also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse vnto all superstitious actions, or ceremonies) because hee was noted to be a great practitioner in this manner of cure. His earnest desire of him, was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2524:65"/>
first to see with his owne eyes, for his better satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, euery particular ingredient apart, which went into the composition of this salue, and afterwards to obserue each ingredients preparation, and lastly, to behold their mixtion or vnion in composition, that thereby hee might the better discerne, whether any vnlawfull act, or diabolicall superstition, did concurre with the making thereof; the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine consenteth, whereupon this Noble man, to be the better informed in this matter, called vnto this composition a learned Diuine, and a well estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Doctor of Physicke, who with one consent, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the complement of the businesse, did affirme, that there was neither any damnable superstition in the making of this oyntment, as was falsely sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted; nor yet any Cacomagicall disposition in the ingredients, as was vainely surmised by some precise persons. And for that reason, they did ioyntly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that both the medicine, in it selfe, and the practice of this cure were naturall, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lawfull for any good Christian to vse. Hereupon this Honourable Personage, did for a twelue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths space, with happy and fortunate successe, practise this manner of cure, on many that were wounded; and yet for all this, it should appeare, that some busie Buzzards, or rather buzzing flies of this nature, did put into his head, new suspicions, insinuating vnto him, that the Captaine might vse some secret superstitious meanes, or vnknowne charmes in the collecting, or preparing of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ingredients, which he could not discerne, and that without this, those mysticall effects could not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2524:65"/>
be wrought, whereupon one twelue moneth being past, he vndertooke for his more assurance, to make the composition himselfe, and to haue the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, gotten and prepared by his owne direction, namely, the mosse of mans bones, &amp;c. And for this cause, hee maketh M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cooke,</hi> the Apothecary, to beat into fine powder, such of the ingrediences, as were to be powdred, and afterwards to compound it and to make it vp, which when he had effected, he found, that this his owne composition, had the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same healing vertue, and prosperous successe in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the other had; by reason whereof, hee rests euer since, so confident in the safety, and lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this cure, that not one of these phantasticall Butterflies, by their painted shewes without any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide substance, can alter his minde from this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; which when our valiant Sponge-carrier per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth, and seeing that all the vayne perswasions of his too too scrupulous and suspicious faction, could not effect, hee as a <hi>Praeco,</hi> or crying Orator, for the rest, vttereth forth these fragments of his outward and counterfeit zeale, for asmuch as it is stuffed internally, with an hypocriticall, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike intent; as shall be more at large expressed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

Is not this a pretty hood of zeale and religion, besmeared ouer with the fard of dissimulation; a smooth faced vaile (I say) of hypocrisie, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and conceale the nakednesse of a priuate world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly policy, namely, to apply vniustly, and make a wrong vse of the righteous words, of our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour lesus Christ, for the decrying and abolishing of that good gift of healing, which by his viuifying spirit is effected, vpon his wounded and infirm crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures', (and that which is worse) by attributing it falsly vnto the diuel, an enemy both to God &amp; man; and thereby to defraud the Creator and actor in all things of his right, and that before the face of all his reasonable creatures, whom he created after his owne Image, perswading them to beleeue, that all mysticall and occult healing, in these latter dayes, is the vertuous operation of the Father of lies, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of goodnesse? And that chiefely for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Chirurgions cause, as shall forth-with be more plainely expressed. As who should say, that God had in this last age of the world, lost all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratiue vertue and power in mysticall and hidden workings, as wel in his creatures, as by miracles: that good God (I say) the Creator both of heauen and earth, and therefore hee that worketh wonders e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastingly, as well occultly as manifestly, hath lost his operatiue vertue, or assigned it, as it were by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, ouer vnto the diuell. May not that Noble man, and many other religious persons, at which Master <hi>Foster</hi> in the precedent Text aymeth, with a better conscience, retort his foresaid speach, vpon him, and say,
<q>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:2524:66"/>
I am moued with a commiseration of the cause of this person, or Parson reputed, by reason of his profession religious, who condemneth, &amp; attempteth with his Sponge to wipe away the weapon-salue, &amp; to abolish the reputation of that vertue, which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on it for mans good, and for the reliefe of distressed wounded creatures. I pitty him, if he doe it of ignorance; for then I presume, he imagineth no harme, and therefore I will pray for him in <note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> our Sauiour Christ his owne words, Father, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue him, for he knoweth not what he doth. But if he doth it wittingly, and maketh vse of these holy words of Christ, for policies sake, or to procure the worldly gaine of others, I must speake vnto him in these very words, which Christ spake vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> Get thee behind mee, Satan, for thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandst <note place="margin">Marke 8.22.</note> not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now verily, I will make it appeare, that hee hideth his worldly craft vnder the cloke of sanctity, and consequently hee walloweth the deeper in the puddle of sinne, wherefore his reward must needes correspond with his desert: For, God who search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart and reynes of euery man, is iust and righteous. I would haue each obseruant Reader therefore to note, that there is a double reason, in this M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fosters</hi> endeauour, to wipe away the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon-salue, whereof the first is the weakest, namely, a witting ignorance, or an entire vnbeliefe in those inuisible vertues of Gods creatures, though they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare euidently by effect, and that vnto Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and distressed mens comforts.

                  <p>Of this kind of sharp and nimble witted persons, and bold iudges, that giue their counsell against Gods cause at randome, yea, and so peremptorily, would make the common sort of people to beleeue, that they are partakers of all Gods secret Mysteries; which are not reuealed vnto mankind, but by euent.

But I would faine see him demonstratiuely proue, that the vertue of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon-salue is magicall or superstitious; and not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall. As for the Arguments and proofes, which he hath hitherto produced, to disanull this kind of mysticall healing, I finde them before God and man so weake and faint, that they had need to haue a draught of strong <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> to keepe them from fainting at the aspect of verity: they are so poorely armed, that a small fillip of truth will knocke them on the head, and make them breathlesse.

                  <p>I had rather hazard mine owne reputation, then men should their saluation. My friends, at whose intreaty I <note place="margin">I. S. E. C.</note> condescended to this vndertaking, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Here you see his religious vaile: and againe, he discouereth his hidden policy. He pretendeth zeale for the saluation of many; and afterward hee saith, that hee condescended vnto it, at the intreaty of some of his friends, whereof some in plaine great Letters he quotes in the margent, namely, <hi>I. S.</hi> and <hi>E. C.</hi> now who these are explicitly, the title of his Latine Epistle expresseth: You will finde them (no doubt) when you know them stout iudicious persons and of a deepe reach, to determine so great a doubt as this which wee haue in hand: Stout Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-men (I say) to giue their verdit on so profound a Philosophicall Mystery.

Now this taske concernes none more (as I said) then theChirurgians, &amp; that he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemeth them his especiall friends, the consequence will confirme. The second obseruation is, because this our aduerse Author was a Barber Chirurgians sonne. Hence came that mighty reuerence, that he beareth them, in giuing them the title of Esquires. The third is made manifest, by that stately and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usuall Latin Epistle in an English booke, that hee hath dedicated vnto them. Lastly, because some of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2524:69"/>
them (as I am aduertised) did goe along with him to grace him, and to procure him the licensing of his booke to be printed, as well against the weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salue, as my selfe by name, whereas more modesty and discretion might haue guided them, then so earnestly to haue moued and pressed the licensing of a scandalousPamphlet, a part whereof (I say) doth in an ignominious and infamous maner, point at my selfe by name, of purpose to preiudice and wound (as far as in it lay) my vntainted reputation, and that immediately after the immodest and rash composer thereof had been reprehended, and repulsed by two discreete and learned personages for the very same, slanderous and immorall insolencies. I am much beholding vnto these fauourers, of mine aduersary, and so much the more, for as much also as vnto one or two of my fellow Collegues; some of them geered and scoffed at me, for those slanders, which he vauntingly had expressed in his booke against me, both before the licensing of it, and afterwards. But as I neglect their scorne, as being too shallow to drowne my reputation, so I pray God forgiue them their follies, and abate their malice; I accuse not all, but some: For, I know there are amongst them of a more learned, discreet, and modest carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; Vnto such therefore, because I deeme them free from this malignant action: I wish all happinesse, and desire their pardon, if I speake iustly, and that vnto the matter, when I find my selfe so spightfully netled, by some of their society, if I cared for them, or it. Wherefore, by their good leaues, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thus in my History.</p>

For (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you) obserue the words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (which if they moue in some degree the Ephesian siluer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths, they will much more nettle such couetous Chirurgians, as would suffocate and smoother, this excellent and diuine vertue in the Weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Salue, whose originall is ofblood:) The which words that you may with the better solidity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, you must gather or collect out of them, these three seuerall things: First, that the Lord of Lords is hee, who hath made heauen and earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon wee collect, tha the which hath made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

And againe: the spirit of the dead mans bones, and consequently their excrescence, which issued originally out of mans blood, in the which in part lurketh Gods Spirit of life, hath an homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniall reference, vnto the liuely blood of man, for as much as the Text saith, <hi>that all mankind is made of one blood onely:</hi> and therefore this vnion of symphoniacall or sympatheticall harmony, is not easily to bee limited, by Master <hi>Fosters</hi> phantasticall spheare of actiuity. For the text following vnto the Athenians is: <hi>In him wee liue. and moue, and haue our Being.</hi> And lastly, <hi>that wee are the Generation of God:</hi> and for that cause, Christ did not disdaine, to call vs his Brethren and the Sonnes of God. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it sufficient to say (as these precisians doe) that this is ment onely of the Beleeuers; and not of the Infidels. For Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> at that very time, when hee preached this doctrine, spake vnto the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, and such as worshiped vnknowne gods: and he did let them to know th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Gods Generation. All this hee truely taught, that thereby they might leaue their false gods, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselues vnto their right Lord &amp; only God, from whom, by whom, &amp; in whom they exist, and <note place="margin">Rom. 12.32.</note> persist in their being, as hee declareth else-where.

And lastly, let all couetuous Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans expectations be thorowly quashed, and disanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by this inuiolable assertion of the Apostle.</p>
                  <q>Though there be that are called Gods, whether in heauen or in earth, (as there be many gods and many lords) <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.5.</note> yet vnto vs there is but one God, which is that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of whom are all things, and wee in him, and one Lord, Iesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him: but euery man hath not that knowledge.</q>
                  <p>Let M. <hi>Foster</hi> mark this: as who shouldsay, though the Ephesian <hi>Demetrius</hi> with his complices, did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all power vnto the false Goddesse <hi>Diana,</hi> and <hi>Foster,</hi> the secret &amp; maruellous power of healing by the weapon-salue vnto the diuell, as the prince of this world, without any consideration vnto this Text; yet it is certaine, <hi>that it is God the Father, of whom are al things:</hi> and conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, this act in curing <hi>and by our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom are all things,</hi> and therefore each blessed gift of healing.

speake so bluntly, and against his conscience, for any pruiuate companies cause, or worldly affection, yea, it may appeare, that hee was troubled in his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when hee writ so staggeringly, and vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, touching the originall cause of this cure. For, first of all, pag. 8. he saith, <hi>that it is not the salue that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, but the diuell, by the secret applications of other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines:</hi> In another place, namely, pag. 17. hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, <hi>that the act of curing, is the salue but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth it to be magicall, by reason of the superstitious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations in the collection or gathering of the ingredien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in the anoynting of the weapon.</hi> Then pag. 39. hee seemeth to auerre, <hi>that it is the bathing of the wound with Vrin, and the keeping it cleane, which doth effect this cure;</hi> whereby hee taketh away all vertue from the salue, and acting power from the diuell. But pag. 7. hee saith, <hi>that it is onely God that cureth at such a distance, for as much as his essence is infinite, and is</hi> omnia in omnibus, <hi>and not any Angell.</hi> The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man you see is in many minds, God amend him, and make his head-piece more setled, and of a more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid consistence, and constant nature, or wee shall be troubled heereafter with many words; but little substance appertaining to the right matter.

                  <p>There are foure histories more, that I wil tell you, whereof the two first are forraine, and the two last were acted at home namely here in England.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:2524:74"/>
The first of the forraine Stories was acted in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, and hath beene there so famous and remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that vnto this present, it is as well in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue countrey-mans mouth, as in the report of such trauellers as haue passed thorow the countrey; yea, and there are authors of credit, that haue enrolled it in their written monuments. It was thus: There was a certaine Lord, or Nobleman of Italy, that by chance lost his nose in a fight or combate, this party was counselled by his Physicians to take one of his slaues, and make a wound in his arme, and immediately to ioyne his wounded nose to the wounded arme of the slaue, and to binde it fast, for a season, vntill the flesh of the one was vnited and assimulated vnto the other. The Noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man got one of his slaues to consent, for a large promise of liberty and reward; the double flesh was made all one, and a collop or gobbet of flesh was cut out of the slaues arme, and fashioned like a nose vnto the Lord, and so handled by the Chirurgion, that it serued for a naturall nose. The slaue being healed and rewarded, was manumitted, or set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and away he went to Naples. It happened, that the slaue fell sicke and dyed, at which instant, the Lords nose did gangrenate and rot; whereupon the part of the nose which hee had of the dead man, was by the Doctors aduice cut away, and hee being animated by the foresaid experience, followed the aduice of the same Phisician, which was to wound in like manner his owne arme, and to apply it to his wounded and mutilated nose, and to endure with patience, till all was compleate as before. He with animofity &amp; patience, did vndergoe the brunt,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2524:74"/>
and so his nose continued with him vntill his death.</p>
                  <p>What? Must wee esteeme this worke the act of Gods spirit in man, or a deceitfull and prestigious operation and trumpery of the diuell? Verily, it must needes by wise men be adiudged to proceed from that good act of Gods viuifying spirit, which did operate by way of life and vegetation in them both. Is it not strange therefore (the one liuing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bolongnia in Italy, and the other being in Naples) that according to Master <hi>Fosters</hi> tenent, neither the tall Hills of Hetruria; nor yet the high Appenine mountaines could stop the concourse and motion of these two spirits, or rather one spirit continuated in two bodies, as a line being stretched out from two extremes, of so farre a distance. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly M. <hi>Foster</hi> will say, this is Magicall and diabolicall.</p>
                  <p>The second forraine Story was this.</p>
                  <p>I was, whilest I did soiourne in Rome, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a very learned and skilfull personage, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Master <hi>Gruter,</hi> hee was by birth of Swisserland: and for his excellency in the Mathematick, and in the Art of motions and inuentions of Machins, he was much esteemed by the Cardinall Saint <hi>George:</hi> This Gentleman taught mee the best of my skill in those practices: and amongst the rest, hee deliuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this magneticall experiment vnto me, as a great secret, assuring me that it was tried in his Country, vpon many with good successe. When (said he) any one hath a withered and consumed member, as a dried arme, leg, foot, or such like, which phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians call an Atrophie of the lims, you must cut from that member, bee it foot or arme, the nailes, haire, or some part of the skin, then you must pierce
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2524:75"/>
a willow tree with an Auger or wimble vnto the pith, and afterward put into the hole the pared nailes and skin, and with a peg made of the same wood, you must stoppe it close: Obseruing that in this action the Moone be increasing, &amp; the good Planets in such a multiplying Signe, as is <hi>Gemini,</hi> and fortunate and powerfull ouer <hi>Saturne,</hi> which is a great dryer. The selfe-same effect (said hee) you shall finde in you, take the nailes and haire, which is cut off the member, and close them in the roote of an hasle tree, and shut vp the hole, with the barke of the tree, and after couer it with the earth, and (said he) it hath beene tried, that as the tree dayly groweth and flourisheth, so also by little and little, will the patient recouer his health. But you must with diligence obserue, the motion of the heanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bodies, and especially the places of the Sunne and Moone, when this is effected. And to this intent, he did disclose vnto me, the time and seasons when the preparion vnto such a cure should be effected. But alas! What haue I done? Now hath M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Foster</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cry out that this is Magick indeed; here is superstition in the highest degree: For did not he say pag. 17. <hi>that it is an astrologicall, and therefore superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus obseruation to collect any ingredient, or to doe any thing by attending and expecting, when the Moone should bee in such or such a house of heauen, and that by Scriptures, Astrologers, Magitians and Sorcerers, like birds of a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are linked together?</hi> A worshipfull exploit in in this demure Gentleman! His blindnesse leadeth him in this as in the rest. For first hee concludeth, that all Magick in generall is damnable and diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, because one <hi>species</hi> or member of it, is iustly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2524:75"/>
to be banished from Christian mens remembrance: as if there were not a naturall magick, by which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> did know all the mysteries in nature, and the operations thereof; yea, as if the three wise Kings of the East, did discouer, that the true King of the Iewes was borne, by diabolicall Magick. How now Master <hi>Foster,</hi> were these three wise men Cacoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall Magitians, or such as the Scripture did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of, and we Christians keepe a holy day in their remembrance? Right Friar <hi>Mersennus</hi> his ape! For he condemneth all <hi>Magia</hi> without exceptions of kinds; not remembring, that <hi>Magus</hi> is in the Persian tongue interpreted a wise man or a priest. And in the very same manner, this Gentleman, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Masters custome condemneth all Astrologie, for that members sake, which is truely superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vnlawfull; not considering, that the verity in both, the true Magick and Astrology hath been falsely contaminated and abused by superstitious worldlings, and thereupon made the good, in the eyes of the ignorant, to bee abolished and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the bad, for the bad sake: and so good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by vile men is swallowed, without any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by darknesse.</p>
                  <p>I would therefore haue our Sponge-bearing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary know, that there are foure parts or kinds of Astrology in generall. The first is conuersant about the mutation of the aire, and foretelling of tempests, diseases, famine, or plenty, &amp;c. The second foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the alterations of states, as also wars, or a paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick dispotion in the minds of men. The third intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the election of times, and of natiuities. The last is directed vnto the fabricating of characters,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2524:76"/>
seales and Images, the which, because it mingleth it selfe with superstitious actions, &amp; is made an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the abuses of impious persons; and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, because a diabolicall insinuation vnto vice and impiety, may easily be perceiued in it, is of all good Christians to be repudiated and condemned for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull What? Is the Almanack makers Science for this M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fosters</hi> exceptions, to be put downe, or must Physicians be forced to forsake or neglect their houres of election, ingathering of simples, or letting blood, or cutting the hayre and nailes, or stopping laxes, or making the belly lubricke for this mans ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat? Doth not <hi>Amicus medicorum</hi> auerre, <hi>that the influence of heauen, may helpe the working of medicines?</hi> For (saith hee) <hi>Oftentimes medicines laxatiue, are by vnskilfull Phisicians, giuen vnder an influence of heauen, that worketh a contrary or stiptick effect, &amp; so are hindred.</hi> Also saith he, <hi>Sometimes medicine is giuen to stop, when the disposition of the heauens are lubrick and laxactiue, and then the medicine loseth his effect.</hi> And for this cause, <hi>Haly</hi> saith, <hi>the Physician that is ignorant in Astrology, is as a blinde man, searching out his way without a staffe, gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and reeling this way and that way.</hi> And <hi>Ptolomeus, that a good Astrologian may auert many effects of the stars which are to come.</hi> Doth not <hi>Galene &amp; Hipocrates</hi> speake much in their critical treatises, of the necessity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing the Moones motion? But letting this passe: What say wee to the husbandmans obseruation of times and seasons, as well in sowing as in reaping? If this will not serue to stop our Aduersaries violence, wee will comevnto the testimonie of Scriptures: for the confirmation as well of election of seasons, as to proue that the influence of the heauens doth ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

as well good as euill effects. For the first it is said, <note place="margin">Eccl 3.</note>

                     <hi>God, that wee may resist the diuell in the vnfortunate day.</hi> Now, if the starres be the distinguisher and guider of times, as <hi>Moses</hi> telleth vs, surely the influence ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or bad for them, maketh good or bad Angells, to haue more or lesse dominion ouer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. That there are bad influences from aboue, these words of <hi>Dauid</hi> doe testifie: <hi>Deus est custos tuus, Sol &amp; non percutiet dierno tempore; nec Luna nocte: God is thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruer, the Sunne shall not strike or wound thee by day, nor the Moone by night, &amp;c.</hi> And is it not acknowledged, that the Moone is the procurer of the Epilepticke dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease? Where it is said in the Euangelist in plaine termes, <hi>that the possessed was Lunatick?</hi> Also that there are good influences from aboue, it is argued by this <note place="margin">Iob 38. 21.</note> Text of <hi>Iob, Canst thou restraine the sweet influences of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of</hi> Orion? <hi>Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in their time? Canst thou also guide</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturus <hi>with his sonnes? Knowest thou the course of heauen? or canst thou set the rule thereof on the earth, &amp;c?</hi> For in this Text, wee finde the good influences of the starres are mentioned: and heere also it is expressely noted, that the heauens haue their powers on the earth.</p>
                  <p>I boldly affirme therefore, that all Astrology is not forbidden for as much as there is an especiall obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to be had by wise men, of the influence of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2524:77"/>
stars. And for that purpose, there are houres of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, duely to be obserued according vnto this or that influence, which is most proper and conuenient for our worke. Againe, whereas M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Foster</hi> seemeth to make so slight account of the 12. Signes, and their es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall operations on the earth; he may see, that such as haue made their allaterall notes vpon the Text, doe interpret the word <hi>Mazzaroth,</hi> to signifie the 12. signes, which doe possesse the 12. houses of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, which being so, marke the Texts conclusion: <hi>Canst thou set the rule thereof on the earth?</hi> whereby it is euident, that the 12. signes, haue an especiall rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the earth, and the creatures thereof, and that by Gods ordinance and appointment.</p>
                  <p>By this it is made manifest, that there is no Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magicall superstition, in obseruing times, daies, or houres, in which this or that starre hath dominion, for the collecting of ingrediences, or preparation and adaption of medicines, or other matters, proper for the cure of man, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Foster</hi> doth vniustly auerre.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, therfore this point, we may discerne by the foresaid experiment, how the vegetatiue force of the plant operateth, in the excrementitious parts of the withered member, no otherwise then the ointment in the amputed blood, and how the spirit of those nailes and haire, and skin, do participate with that of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered member, no otherwise then that of the blood in the oyntment, doth with the bloody spirits of the wounded, or as the vrinall excrements, with the blood in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2524:77"/>
draw the vegetating spirit of the plant vnto it, that by the addition of its power, it might with the more speed prosper and recouer.</p>
                  <p>It is commonly obserued amongst vs, yea, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in old wiues practice, that if a piece of fresh beefe be rubbed well on warts, either in the hand or other member, and buried in the ground, the warts haue bin accustomed to fade by little and little, as the beefe doth rot and putrifie in the ground: and that if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that hath the warts be at a farre distance from the place, where the beefe is buried. Must this kind of cure also be cacomagicall, or diabolicall? yea, verily, as well as the rest, if that be true which M. <hi>Foster</hi> and his associates doe auerre.</p>
                  <p>I could remember each reader of many of these vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conclusions in naturall Magicke, which being well pondered, would, I imagine, proue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>farre enough in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery wise mans iudgement, from any diabolicall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice or commerce; but because I feare, I should be in doing, more tedious then delectable, vnto each curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I will come briefely vnto the two homebred hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, which I did promise vnto you before.</p>
                  <p>The first of our homebred histories is this: There is at this present, an honest religious Gentlewoman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout London, that taketh an herbe, called the Rose of the Sunne, which hath small husks about it, which will open and shut, and shee putteth it in plantain-water, and it shutteth and closeth vp. She therefore, when a woman with child beginneth her labour, giueth her a little plantain-water, and though the labouring wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, appeareth to the Midwife neuer so ready to be deliuered; yet if the Gentlewoman see the vegetable closed, she concludeth, that they are deceiued, and that
<pb facs="tcp:2524:78"/>
there is no such matter, and so it proueth indeed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, when the Midwife doubteth of her deliuery, and yet she is indeed neer it; The flower will open by little and little as the Matrix doth, and then the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bids the Midwife looke to it, assuring her, that she is ready for it, and it proueth so. This story was related very lately vnto mee, by a Noble man of worth, and confirmed by a reuerent Doctor and his Apothecary, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>erre, that certaine Midwiues doe at this day, make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of this naturall conclusion.</p>
                  <p>Now I know, that M. <hi>Foster</hi> will say, that this also is diabolicall and superstitious. Good God, what will this man leaue to be ascribed and attributed, to the onely actor in all operations, as well vulgar as mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, when there is nothing hidden, or rare in this world, which this greater agent for the diuell, then I am a witch, as he termeth me, doth not attribute to his Master, the diuell, so that God forsooth must be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to act only in vulgar and sensible things, but as for all hidden mysteries, the actiuity of those must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the diuell, and be only attributed vnto him. To conclude, we see an admirable sympathy, betwixt the vegetable, minerall and Animall, and the parts of mans body, as the coultsfoot, which is framed like the lungs, is good for the lungs: <hi>herniaria</hi> for the rupture, liuerwort for the liuer, eyebright for the eyes; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, among minerals, Gold for the heart, and Siluer for the braine, brimstone for the lungs, yron for the spleene, as also the spleenstone cureth the spleene, if it be worne on the wrest. And why may not the herbe haue the like relation and correspondence in nature with the matrix; And that by reason of the vehicle of plantainwater, which did communicate, the nature of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2524:78"/>
the one with the other, the ayre being the common <hi>medium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last hom ebred story is this: There is a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Personage in this kingdome of no meane descent, Title and ranke, among the English Nobility, a most wise, graue, aged, and religious Gentleman, I say, who hath cured a hundred in his time, of the yellow Iaunders, the patient being 10. 20. 30. 40. (yea, &amp; as he and others haue reported) almost 100. miles off from him: and many of them, that hee hath so cured, haue laine long drooping vnder the burthen of this disease, before they came to him, in so much that the vse of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon receits of physicians could not ouercome it. Hee hath both performed it by his seruants at home, and hath communicated the secret vnto some of his friends abroad, amongst whom he hath bin pleased to rank my selfe. The vrin therefore of the patient, is sent vnto this great Lord. His ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of cure is this, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ashes of a wood, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly knowne and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here amongst vs in England, hee maketh a past of this wood with the vrin, reseruing a little of the vrin a part for another purpose, this past so molded &amp; made vp with vrin, is diuided into 7. or 9 lumps or balls, and in the top of each of these, he maketh a small hole, and putteth in it a litle of the vrin remaining, &amp; into those parts of vrin, hee putteth a blade of saphron. And so without further doing, hee puts the lumps in a secret place, where they must not be stirred, left the cure be hindred. And experience hath taught the world, many a score of icteritiall men, or infected with the yellow Iaunders, haue by this simple meanes beene cured: and this is well knowne vnto a 1000. persons. Lord! What a diabolicall medicine will this appeare in the chaste
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2524:79"/>
eies of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Foster?</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e wil straight way cry out, This is abominable and diabolicall witch-craft, and they are witches and coniurers that do vse it! But beware M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Foster</hi> of railing, or calumniating this personage; for he is such a one, as will endure no coals, but will chastice any of your vnmannerly brauadoes. What, I say? Is the diuell in the sick mans water, or is it in the burnt ashes of the wood? (They say, that witches imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being burnt, causeth all magicall power to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish) or is it in the poore blades of saphron, that are drenched in the vrin; No truly, but rather in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits that dreame so. For it is most certaine, that the plant and the saphron haue hidden properties in them, to cure the Iaunders. All the mystery therefore of this cure, belongth vnto the respect or relation, which is between the blood of the infected, and the whay of the blood, which carrieth with it partly some of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall salt and tincture of the blood, and partly some of the relicks of the I cteritious humor, which maketh the vrin of so high a yellow. The spirit of blood therefore with his agent lurking in the tincture, and salt, which is in the watery serous, or whaiey excrement, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buried in that medicinable earth, or ashes, in which the salt of the plant dwelleth, or stirred vp by the continuation which it hath with that spirit of life, which yet dwelleth in the sick mans vaines. Therefore the water being inhumed and mingled, with that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall earth, and mixed with saphron, the viuifying spirit of the sick, tending to the preseruation of life, doth ayd the like in the vrin, and also exuscitate and reuiue that in the salt of the ashes, to act and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Icteritious humor in the vrin, which fading and being by little and little conquered, maketh his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2524:79"/>
like in the sicke body to dye and vanish. Besides all this, the spirit lurking in the salt, and exuscitated partly, by the excited spirit of the plant, and partly by the emanating spirit of the sicke body, doth send, or carry backe a curatiue property, vnto the whole bulke of the blood. I leaue this vnto the more serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the learned, who can better iudge of the hidden and abstruse operations of Gods incorruptible spirit, closing vp a-l in these very words of the Apostle: <hi>Deus operatur omnia in omnibus, God worketh all in all, &amp;</hi>

                        </gap>ne Lord Iesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. Ergò,</hi> it is vainely, and presumptuously said of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Foster,</hi> that the cure of the weapon-salue is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the diuell, the enemy of Iesus Christ, and not by Christ himselfe, being that Iesus is the only Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and curer or healer both of soule &amp; body, who, as he hath all powers &amp; potestates vnder his dominion, vseth his good Angels to work his goodnesse, and not the bad Angels, which hee did ordaine for a cleane contrary office. I will not say, that this assertion of his is a kinde of blasphemy; but it is little better. At the leastwise it is the grossest sort of Idolatry, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the good works of God, vnto the essentiall act of the worst and most wickedest of all his creatures, whom God instituted for a clean contraryvse, namely,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2524:80"/>
to be his punishing and destroying minister or angel.</p>
                  <p>Now, I will proceed vnto the particular defence, of mine owne doctrine, expressed in my mysticall Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, Against the which Master <hi>Foster</hi> doth enueigh so bitterly, and with so great a confidence. He crowes there like a Cocke on his owne dunghill, before hee hath occasion, and challengeth gloriously the palme, and proclaimeth the trophey of his owne prayses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath got the victory. The end crownes all: for truth is not boulstered vp with high and braging termes. It had beene best for Master <hi>Foster</hi> to haue heard me speake, before hee had publikely slandered me, and set vp the Titles of his booke on the posts of my doore in my disgrace: whether it was discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done of him, or not; I leaue it to the censure of the world: and so I moue to the last Member of this Treatise.</p>

But to come vnto our businesse; Hath this Chapter of mine, (iudicious Reader) in which our diligent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitor hath made so strict a search, and against which he hath framed so punctuall a confutation, any Cacomagicall busines in it, that I should so hardly be censured, by our quick-witted Confuter, at the very entrance into it? Doe you discerne in it any thing, that should cause our Aduersary to make such a scandalous, and vnchristian-like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression into the inquiry of it, that thereby the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler sort of men may deeme me a Witch or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician? As for such as are of the wiser sort, I am sure they laugh at it. But is not this an argument of enuy, founded on no solid foundation? And is not he, as well for his vnreasonable spight, as some things else, of each good Christian to be pittied? For what hath he in him should deserue enuy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he confesseth in his Epistle to the Reader, that he is <hi>infra inuidiam?</hi> As for my selfe, I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously concurre with the opinion of all the world, and say, <hi>that I had rather be enuied then pittied.</hi> But to our purpose: The subiect of this Chapter cited by me in my mysticall Anatomy, is onely a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2524:82"/>
discourse of the naturall reference, and Magnetick or attractiue and sympatheticall relation, which is obserued to be, betwixt two distinct substances of the like nature; but differing in the distance of place; as betweene the Loadstone and the Iron, betwixt the blood, and the salt of the same nature; in which the vegetating spirit, common vnto them both, doth occultly abide. And you must note also (courteous Reader) that in this particular Booke of my mysticall Anatomy, I did handle the secret and hidden properties of the spirituall or internall blood in the externall, citing therewithall, as neere as my small capacity would giue me leaue, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicall effects which it worketh, as well by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or immediate touch, as at a distance. I would faine know now, wherein I haue offended in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? or how I haue deserued M. <hi>Fosters</hi> slanderous ingression into his examination of this businesse? or whether in my naturall discourse vpon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, I mention Diabolicall Charmes, Circles, Witch-craft, or vnlawfull and forbidden Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, or such like? If you finde nothing appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto any such deuilish Magick, then giue your sentence, whether such a Prelude vnto this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was honest, decent, or any thing appertaining vnto the matter in handling. As for the vsage of the <hi>Weapon-Salue</hi> in it selfe, I protest before God and man, I neuer of my selfe did practise it vnto this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day; but in my conscience, and by reason of a more strict inquiry, which for this cause I haue made into it, I finde it so free from any Diabolicall superstition, (which, God is my witnesse, I haue
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2524:82"/>
euer hated, as I doe the Deuill and all his workes) and haue heard so much of the vertuous operation thereof, that from henceforward, malegree the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meure writers or speakers against it, I will both practise it, and defend the lawfulnesse of it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more assured now then euer, that it is the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vertue of God; and not any act of the Deuill, which operateth in it vnto the health and alledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods afflicted creatures.</p>

And then he disputeth <hi>ex non concessis,</hi> as is before said; and yet neuerthelesse I will giue him his way, and proue that all which his Spongy tongue hath vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for the wiping away of that truth, which hath bene here expressed by me, is of no validity, nor yet of any appearance or probability. I will therefore diuide this Confutation of his into two Branches or Members: whereof the first shal produce this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: <hi>namely, Whether Blood, Flesh, Fat, &amp; Bones, haue any naturall Balsam, or radicall moisture residing in them, sympathising with the Hypostaticall Balsam remaining with the liuing Man?</hi> The later containeth this: <hi>Whether a Horse haue a Balsam sympathising with the Balsam of Man?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first of these two, is flatly held by M. <hi>Foster</hi> negatiuely, and I in a surer confidence doe hold it affirmatiuely, and will proue it: first, by Naturall Reason: secondly, by the Authority of Holy writ: and lastly, by Common Experience.</p>
                     <p>In the first place therefore, I would haue M. <hi>Foster</hi> to learne, what a Balsamicke nature is, before hee thus rashly seeketh to censure the creatures to haue it, or to bee without it. I must therefore let him know, that it is nought else, but a volatill, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall salt, that is full of vegetating and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying vertue, which it receiueth from aboue, as a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2524:84"/>
precious soule to viuifie and animate it, the which vertue is that <hi>Calidum innatum,</hi> or <hi>Naturall heate,</hi> by whose vertue euery creature doth exist, and the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile vehicle, in which it is carried, is that <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Radicale,</hi> or <hi>Radicall Moisture,</hi> or <hi>Humidity,</hi> by which, and in which, the foresaid vertue doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately moue, and act vnto life, vegetation and multiplication. By the operation therefore of these essentiall actiue and passiue, Vegetables and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals doe manifestly, and Minerals occultly vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and multiply: and that as well in their forme or naturall fire, as in their substance. And for this cause the true Alchymists do cal this mystical Salt, <hi>Sal Sapientûm,</hi> the <hi>Salt of Wise men,</hi> for as much as in it consisteth the mystery of Nature. And others tearme it the true <hi>Balsamum Naturae,</hi> or <hi>Balsam of Nature,</hi> in which all the Mystery of Nature doth consist. Whereupon the wise Philosophers affirme: <hi>Quod sit in sale isto quicquid quaerunt Sapientes: That all that Wise men seeke after, is in salt.</hi> Touching the aë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall part, it is the volatile salt, which is euery where expansed in the open ayre, and it is the purest es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of and in the ayre, in which the graine of life is: and therefore other Wise men say, <hi>Est in aëre occultus vitae cibus: The hidden food of life is in the ayre, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not without a very mysticall and secret cause also, that our Sauiour Christ tooke an especiall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Salt. In one place he saith: <hi>Sal Terrae estis vos,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Ye are the Salt of the Earth;</hi> where hee meaneth the spirituall man, in which is the breath of life. And againe: <hi>Sal si euaneurit, in quo salietur? ad nihilum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>

It will be of no further value, saue onely to bee cast cut of doores, and to be troden on by men.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is euident, that nothing can exist, or be of any reckoning or estimation, without this Mysticall Salt, or Glew of Life, but will be quite dead and corrupt. There is Salt in the very dunghill, that giueth life and heart vnto the ground, whereby it multiplieth the Graine in a greater proportion, and sucketh vnto it more plentifully the Celestiall influence of life.</p>
                     <p>To conclude: the very essence of the Animall creatures blood in generall, consisteth in this Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samicke Salt. By it the body is animated: by it the flesh through apposition, vnion, and agglutination of parts is viuified, multiplied, and successiuely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. By this in the bread, and the flesh of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the blood in man is daily increased: in this therefore is the incorruptible spirit of life, which keepeth man aliue, and defendeth him from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: and vnlesse it acteth his viuifying office, man is quickly rotten or corrupted. Doe not Scriptures confirme thus much in many places<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

application, made either by a Reall, or Virtuall Contact. It followes therefore, that this Spirit being in the Blood, Fat, Bones, and Flesh of Man, for as much as they doe subsist by it, and were first animated, and engendered, and multiplyed by it, doe participate of this Spirit, which the Scripture saith, <hi>doth animate and heale all things.

This is the reason that this Oyntment cureth not onely by a Reall; but also Virtuall Contact: namely, by reason of that vertue, which it holdeth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2524:87"/>
from his first Creator: As who should say, that an herb or roote should lose all their sanatiue vertue, because they are gathered from the plant: namely, a Graine of Wheate, or an Apple, gathered from the Straw or Tree, should haue no Balsamick nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment in it, because they are now past growing; and yet the contrary is manifested, in that they haue still in them their vegetating and multiplying Spirit. For being put into the Earth, the very Atom of life lurking in them, doth manifest it selfe, and maketh them grow againe and multiply in their kinde. Neither are the flesh of Beasts destitute of their nourishing property; though they seeme dead, and are seuered from the liuing Creature. For the Scripture saith; <hi>Anima carnis est in sanguine: The life of the flesh is in the blood,</hi> which if it were not so; it would not nourish, or bee conuerted into mans bodily substance: namely, Blood, Flesh, Fat, and Bones: as also, if the viuifying Spirit did not lurke in the flesh of the dead Carkas, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that it should be conuerted into wormes by the exposition of it vnto the beames of the Sunne, as shall be told hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, I could shew this deepe Philosopher, that this viuifying Spirit, in the volatile Salt, is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly inbred.

and in the selfesame kinde is their reciprocall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; as is betweene the Patient and the Agent, or the Female and the Male. I could shew him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in a short space, the admirable power this vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Spirit hath, to cause vegetation in all things. And I haue proued it to be a soueraigne Balsam to cure wounds, and to take away aches: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it sympathiseth with the Hypostaticall Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam of man. For else it would not be conuerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same Image: namely, into Blood, and Flesh, and Fat, and Bones; and much more therefore the very Blood, Flesh, Fat, and Bones, of the selfesame <hi>species,</hi> being that <hi>simile magis nutritur à suo simili,</hi> like is nourished more by his like. Doe we not see mans blood; yea, the blood of euery creature, to consist of such a volatile Salt? If it were nothing but the vrine, which is the whayie excrement of the blood, it would witnesse so much, being that it is passing full of salt Armoniak, or volatile Animal Salt: and by reason of the Balsamick nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, mans vrine is so proper to mundifie and cure a slight greene wound; as also the Yellow-Iaunders is cured at such a distance from the patient, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared. You see therefore, with what ease, and that by a triple consideration, this dull Sponge of M. <hi>Fosters</hi> is squeesed: and how vnreasonable and vnprobable is his foresaid proposition. I come therefore to the examination of the second questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ariseth from it.</p>
                     <p>Touching the second question, which is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Horse haue a Balsam sympathising with that of man? Master <hi>Foster</hi> saith, <hi>There is no such sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:2524:89"/>
                        <hi>betweene Horse and Man.</hi> Hee saith much; but proued little or nothing. As who should say, M. <hi>Fosters</hi> wil is so, and therefore <hi>stet pro ratione voluntas,</hi> his wil must stand for a law. He imitateth exactly in this, his bragging M. <hi>Mersennus.</hi> But I wil be so bold as to instruct him better in this matter, and shew him that the bodily nature of the one, doth easily sympathise and communicate with that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the Flesh, Fat, and Bones of the one and the other, are of blood in a naturall generality; yea, and in speciality of bloods, though in number they vary. For (I beseech you) doth not the selfesame Flesh, Fat, and Blood of the Beast nourish the like in man? Is not the one transmuted into the other? Nay, doth not the Scripture speake this in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall sense, meaning all blood; namely, that the soule or life of the creature is in the blood, and that the life of all flesh is in the blood, and that for a diuine respect of that Spirit of life in the blood, we are commanded, not to eate of the blood of any creature? And againe: the blood of man, in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall respect, is to be demanded of the Beast that shed it. All which being rightly considered, who of wisedome can make any doubt, and not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely conclude, that the Beasts bodily nature doth sympathise and correspond with the parts of mans body? I confesse, that the Intellectuall nature of man, maketh it to differ from that of a Horse, for as much as he is said to be <hi>Animal rationale,</hi> and the Beast <hi>Animal irrationale;</hi> but these properties are onely seene in the specifying spirit, and doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerne or touch any action of life, or vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2524:90"/>
or multiplication, or healing. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore discourse in this manner: God hath endued man with a double gift, whereof the first is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life, which he hath imparted not onely vnto him, but also to all other creatures; and againe, he hath bestowed on him more then on any other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creature: for he hath giuen him vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and yet the Giuer of this double gift, is but onely one Spirit. And thereupon <hi>Iob</hi> saith: <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Deifecit me, &amp; inspiratio Omnipotentis viuificauit</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iob 33.4.</note> 
                        <hi>me: The Spirit of God made me, and the inspiration of the Euerlasting gaue me life.</hi> Now (as I haue said) this very same benefit was giuen vnto all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in all one property and office: whereby it is said: <hi>Deus viuificat omnia, God viuifieth all things.</hi> And <hi>Iudith: Misit Spiritum, &amp; creauit omnia, He sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</hi>

And this is the reason, and no other, that like is conuerted into his like; namely, blood into blood, flesh into blood and flesh, and fat into his like, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2524:90"/>
bones and marrow is made of both. Is it not most palpable, that any flesh, or blood, or fat of dead Beasts will be conuerted, by mutation of concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, into the substance of man? which it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doe; but that they egregiously doe sympathise in nature together, and doe vnite the Balsamick nature, or <hi>calidum innatum &amp; humidum radicale</hi> of the one with the other, and transmute the substance of the one, into that of the other, which originally is the blood, as well manifest as occult. But touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other extraordinary gift, it is said by <hi>Iob</hi> in another place: <hi>In homine est spiritus; sed inspiratio</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iob 9.</note>

                     <p>Ha, ha, he! <hi>Risum teneatis amici?</hi> Because he saith so, therefore it is so: <hi>stat pro ratione voluntas.</hi> Hee sayes it, and though he proueth nothing, yet hee must be beleeued. But this mans Assertion shall be proued ridiculous, as wel by a common and vulgar obseruation, as the manifold practicall experience of the Nobleman or Earle, which I mentioned in the 6. chapter of the 2. Member of this Treatise.</p>
                     <p>Touching the common vulgar obseruation, we see, that the flesh of all creatures (as I said before) be they Birds, or foure-footed Beasts, and therefore of a Horse, is easily conuerted, after it is digested in mans stomack, into his blood, flesh, fat, and bones: which is an euident Argument, that there is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest sympathy betweene a Horse his flesh and blood, and that of a man: yea, and that there resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in a Horse the like Balsamick nature, or Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call moysture, which is in a man: and that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the same Balsamick nature doth sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thise with the hypostaticall Balsam remaining in man. The case is apparent; for <hi>quod facit tale, est magis tale:</hi> and therefore if the blood or flesh of a Horse were not of such a nature as that of man, it would neuer be conuerted and made one in vnion, with the blood and flesh of man. But that it is so, euery Sot doth perceiue practically. Whereby it is euident, that the Balsamick nature of the one, doth most exactly agree with the other; or else they would neuer proue so homogeneall, as to include one nature. Againe, if they did not sympathise;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2524:91"/>
but Antipathise; the nature of the one would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the nature of the other; which experience proueth false. Againe, that there is a Balsamick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a Horse, sympathising with that in a man, the effect proueth. For the effect of a Balsamick nature, is to agglutinate wounds, and to incarnate and breed flesh, and that by a secret vertue of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation. But the flesh of a Horse doth render his Balsamick suck or iuyce vnto the liuer of a man, where it so sympathiseth with the nature thereof, that it condenseth it selfe, by a homogeneall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation into blood, and becommeth as fibrous and well compacted, as the other humane blood: and in conclusion, is made all one with it: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that by apposition, vnion, and assimulation (that I may vse <hi>Galen</hi> his owne words) it becommeth mans flesh. An infallible argument, that the Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick nature of these two creatures do consent and sympathise: for else they could not make one vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus our sharp-witted Remembrancer may see, that I doe not onely say, after his fashion; but also proue and demonstrate my case so palpably, that euery simple person may feelingly perceiue it.</p>
                     <p>I come now to such priuate experiments, as the Noble Earle aboue-mentioned hath made vpon Horses: whereof some haue beene pricked, and some wounded, or hurt otherwise. He was pleased to tell me of many of his Cures, as well on his own Horses, as on others, which by the vertue of this Oyntment, hee had performed. Now would I faine know, whether any person of worth or discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would rather beleeue that, which this Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2524:92"/>
affirmeth, and auowed vpon his owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and manifold experience, or else the threed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare assertion of M. <hi>Foster,</hi> who would perswade the world, and that by his meere asseueration one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any other proofe or practice, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles may be builded in the Ayre. What shall wee say then? shall we call a conuocation of these tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, incredulous, and all-iudging persons, to haue it decided: whether the Deuill did this Cure to gaine the Horses soule, or no? Alas! their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure worships wil, after the due pleading and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the cause, finde that his blacke Lordship would not bestow the paines for a soule, which is so fading, transitory, and not immortall, as is that of a man, after which he so eagerly thirsteth and gapeth. But if they reply that he doth it to delude the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Mediciner, and by that couert meanes to gaine his soule: I answer, that, <hi>Frustrà fit per plur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>, quod fieri potest per pauciora.</hi> The Mediciner cured many reasonable persons before, and would not that suffice the Deuils turne to gaine him; but hee must assist him also, in curing vnreasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to make the Obligation for the Practitioners soule the surer? I would perchance giue more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to these bold and high thundering Iudges or condemners, and vilifiers of <hi>Iehouah's</hi> power, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing that vnto the Deuill, which appertaineth vnto him, if one man had many soules to lose: but who is so foolish to cast the Dice twice, for that he hath surely wonne at once?</p>
                     <p>By this therefore, each wise and iudicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may plainely discerne, that M. <hi>Fosters</hi> Sponge

is herein also squeesed, for as much as it is most certaine, that the naturall Balsam of one Animal, doth sympathise with his like in the other, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that they haue both but one and the same act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue, and one generall Balsamick spirit in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and condition, which is common vnto euery specifick.</p>

But most sure it is, that the Blood is his fountaine, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by ocular demonstration. Which being so, I pray you good M. <hi>Foster,</hi> what error is it in me to say, that Blood is the beginner of Bones, when your selfe doth confesse, that their immediate being is of sperme, whose immediate existence is of Blood?

                     <p>Next, by Holy Scriptures, for (as is proued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly before) the blood spilled, and flesh kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is full of liuely spirits, though they remaine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially in them; or else why should the Israelites be commanded, not to eate the fat and blood? For it is said: <hi>because the blood is the seate of the soule or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life.</hi> For if that spirit of life were fled from it, what sinne had it beene to haue eaten it?

Surely a man so profound in diuine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, would not haue beene so absurd, as to haue offered them his food, if he had knowne that it would not naturally haue nourished them. The same absurdity might iustly haue beene imputed vnto <hi>Lot.</hi> Verily, it is aboue the reach of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to scan rightly, or discouer iustly this doubt. But suppose it be granted, that Angels and Deuils be not corporeall, but spirituall creatures; yet he confesseth elsewhere, that the Deuill can indue and put on an organicall body: namely, of a man, a Dog, or Cat, and consequently those Angels indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed humane shapes. I pray you, when a squirt, or syrynge, or boxing glasse draweth, is it the organ, or the spirit in the organ that draweth? Man ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2524:104"/>
not with his body, but with the inward spirit; neither doth blood act any thing of it selfe; but by the occult viuifying spirit, which acteth in it. Mans throat and tongue serue as organs of voyce; but it is the Spirit that acteth. If the Deuill enter into a body, as he did into the Swine, and humane bodies; did he not make vse of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicall voyce of the Beast, and those men to speak vnto Christ? But it was the spirituall act of the Deuill, which did mingle it selfe with the aëry spirit of the Beast, and man possessed and made it to answer, according to the will of the Agent; so, I say, that by the ayde of the creatures mouth and spirit, which it indued, it did suck the blood; not that the blood in his grosse nature did abide with the Deuill in his spirituall substance; but I say that the spirituall substance in the blood, which partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates of ayre, is easie to ioyne and make an vnion, by the contract with that of the Deuill: euen as we see, that Amber, when it is burnt, sendeth forth his spirit, which vniting or mingling it selfe with the ayre, infects it with his odoriferous nature, and so there is an actuall communication made betweene the ayre and the fume, betweene the spirit of the one and the other, betweene a Priuy-house, or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guy Botch infecting, and the spirit of the ayre infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the which ayre communicateth also that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection vnto the spirit of the smeller. Againe, doe we not see in one infected with the plague, that first it was a corrupt spirit, which by the virtuall contact ofit, did infect not the blood onely; but the inuisible spirits in the blood? And doe we not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2524:105"/>
see also, that the same inuisible spirit so infecting, doth inuisibly also infect the inuisible ayre about it; and though it be in part exspired out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood; yet it hath such communication with the blood; that for all that the inuisible fume infecteth abroad, not leauing neuerthelesse his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution at home.

Wherefore as we see, that after the Botch of the one hath touched the person of another, the spirit easily, by reason of the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall similitude of them, communicate with one another: so, that although the party that hath the Botch, departeth neuer so farre; yet neuerthelesse the malignant spirit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2524:107"/>
that Angels haue soules and bodies, or externall and internall. First, you must know, that if they were Identity, that is, of all one simple formall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they would be all one in essence with God their Creator, who is called <hi>Identitas,</hi> or absolute and simple vnity; but for as much as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two: namely, of light, which is the beame of God, which they receiue, to informe them and make them creatures, and spirit, which as polished Looking-glasse, receiueth the glory of that diuine light, they are called <hi>Alteritas</hi> or Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that is, composed of two.

And yet if we consider, that after he was risen, he did put on a spirituall body, euen that body for that cause, could <hi>deponere Tabernaculum suum visibile &amp; tangibile,</hi> and become by subtiliation and dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as subtile and impalpable, as the voluntie of him, who hath the spirituall body, pleaseth: and so can appeare and vanishat an instant. It is an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable speculation, to ponder and consider duely, how God worketh in this world by contraction and dilatation, by priuation and position, by dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and light, by apparition and disparition, as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2524:108"/>
we see, when his Spirit moueth from the North; the common ayre is by the contractiue nature of that spirit, turned from inuisibility to visibility, from transparency to opacity, from ayre to Snow, Haile, Frost, Ice: from leuity to ponderosity, from agility and mobility to fixation and immobility. Contrarywise, by his blast from the East or South, the said bodies are altered againe into water, and water into ayre, and ayre into fire, by dilatation, and in conclusion; corporeity terrestriall, into corporeity aëriall or celestiall, hardnesse into salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, grossenesse into subtility, opacity into tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparency, fixation into mobility, rest into action, darknesse into light: And to conclude, contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on caused by this Spirit of God, into dilatation, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility into inuisibility. What shall I say more? If Angels of all kindes haue their externall from the aëry spirit of the World, and their internall act, from this externall viuifying spirit, in whom is the property of the foure Windes (and therefore the Prophet said, <hi>Come, O Spirit, from the foure Windes;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 36.</note> whereby he did argue, that this one Spirit, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the essentiall actor in the foure Windes, had the properties of the foure Windes in himselfe, by the which he acted all things, whereupon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet called it from the foure Windes) wee ought not to make any question; but that by vertue of that internall act, and the substance of that their externall ayre, they may contract themselues from a spirituall fiery and aëry inuisibility, vnto a nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or watery, yea, and earthly visibility, or snowie or Icie nature: especially the grosse, malignant,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2524:109"/>
and darke spirits: which by their fall, haue indued the grosser ayre, (as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith:) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is Satan called by the Apostle, <hi>The Prince of the ayre.</hi> And this is the reason, that the Deuill, or euill spirits do in their contraction conuert themselues into solid or firme shapes of man or beast, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in touch to be so excessue cold (according to Master <hi>Fosters</hi> confession) namely, because the spirit by which they liue, contracting it selfe from the Circumference of dilated ayre, into the Center of contracted earth, leaueth the externall or aëry compacted composition chill and cold like Ice. For it is by his emanation or dilatation from the Center vnto the Circumference, that kindleth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heate in the externall of euery creature. To conclude against those that affirme that spirits haue no corporeity: It is most certaine, that where there is <hi>rarum &amp; densum, thin and thick,</hi> there conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is corporeity either thinne or thicke. For whatsoeuer is in his substance transmutable vnto a thinner or thicker body, must needs bee bodily, though not a visible body. So is a Starre of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen called <hi>Densior pars sui orbis,</hi> that is, <hi>The inuisible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And againe, that earth may be rarified into water, and water into ayre, and ayre into fire. For such is the naturall rotation of elements. Now the externall of Angels, must be created of the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all substance of the higher world, or not at all: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto <hi>Basils</hi> tenor, and consequently it is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2524:109"/>

                     <p>Thus, iudicious and vnpartiall Reader, you may perceiue by that which hath bene expressed in this Member, how vnable mine Aduersaries Sponge hath beene to wipe away the least tittle of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall value and diuine vertue, which in my mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Anatomy, I haue ascribed vnto the Weapon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Salue. And therefore for all I can see, hee may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent some more substantiall meanes, then is this windie Sponge (an expresse argument of a light braine or fantastick wit) to subuert a Medicine of so weighty an importance, and admirable power in working. Hee must haue, I say, strong Cable-ropes, in stead of a light Sponge, to remoue the foundation of verity; and yet, I feare, they will
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2524:110"/>
cracke too, before they will be able to draw wise men to beleeue, that the good gifts of healing in this Weapon-Salue, should proceed from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and not from God and his benigne mercies, which is the onely giuer of health and goodnesse.</p>
                     <p>And now I must remember you by the way of one absurdity in our Sponge-bearing Author. For he saith first, <hi>that this manner of cure is Diabolicall, and afterward hee seemeth to attribute the effect of it vnto the vrine of man.</hi> His words are these:</p>
                     <p>Doctor <hi>Fludds</hi> directions are, that the Weapon be left <note place="margin">Pag. 8.</note> in the Vnguent-pot, till the Patient bee cured, and that the wound bee kept cleane, with a linnen cloth, wet euery mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his vrine. Whether this be a fallacy or no, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the iudgement of those, who are expert in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery. For let the Doctor be sure to keepe a wound cleane, and I suppose they will tell him, that it will cicatrize with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Weapon-Salue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To this I answer, that</hi> Oportet mendacem esse me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morem: it behoueth a lyer to haue a good memory. <hi>For Master</hi> Foster <hi>must remember, that in another place he saith,</hi> The Deuill doth secretly apply some other virtuall operatiue Medicine, to cure the wound, and delude the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

(For since the maxime is: <hi>Quot homines, tot sentontiae,</hi> how is it possible to please and

And though the spongie <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> or proudly swelling and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulting Whale of Master <hi>Foster,</hi> did swallow for a time, into his paunch of obliuion, the honour and credit of both this Salue, and me for a season; yet (I thanke my God) he hath imparted vnto me the grace, so to squeese and crush this his prestigious Whale, or deuouring Sponge, which is also an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of the Sea, that now it is forced euen so to vomit vp againe that truth, vpon this our coast, not a little infected with the incredulity of this manner of curing, as the true Whale did in times past, the Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi> vpon the shore of the misbeleeuing Niniuites; that the infidelity and suspition of such icalous persons, as haue beene seduced by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> or spongie Monster, may the easier be abolished, by making the deuoured truth to be reuiued, and as it were, to shine forth, and rise againe, that by the light thereof, all those darke cloudes, which haue begot and fostered such incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, namely, the religious veile of Master <hi>Fosters</hi> worldly policy, the error of his doctrine, and the healing power, which he erroneously ascribeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Deuill, may be discouered vnto the eyes of each wise and iudicious Reader, and that the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers may with the Niniuites repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t their error, and turne from such Idolatrous inducements, as haue perswaded them, to ascribe the pious and charitable gifts of healing by the Weapon-Salue, vnto the false Prince of darknesse, who through mans error, doth vsurpe vnto himselfe, the title of Prince or Lord of this World, which of right, and

                  <p>Let them examine, I say, in their choycest thoughts, and that seriously, whether this Cure proceedeth from that vertuous gift, which God hath imparted in the creation, vnto these his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall creatures, and continued it in them, by succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of generation and multiplication, through his all-sufficient Word, euen vnto this day, or else from the meere act and assistance of the Deuill, whose property soone after his creation, by his fall became to strike, plague, and destroy, and not to

For the text saith: <hi>It is the Lord of Lords alone;</hi> and therefore not any creature to helpe him, or that is able to doe this without him: it is he (I say) onely; and consequently not the Deuill, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth wonders; But by euery mans acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, this manner of cure is wonderfull, for as much as the manner of working in it, passeth the capacity of worldly mens vnderstanding: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with <hi>Dauid</hi> I will say:
<q>Benedictus Deus, qui facit tale mirabile solus: <hi>and consequently, I may inferre thereupon (and that iustly)</hi> Maledictus homo qui diuina falsò attribuit Diabolo.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore I wish euery zealous and religious person, to haue this inuiolable Motto engrauen in his heart, that by the vertue thereof, he may fright away and banish from his thoughts, all such irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perswasions, as would moue him to derogate one <hi>Iota</hi> or tittle from Gods power, who is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the end of all things, to arrogate falsly vnto the vilest of creatures, who in himselfe is nothing but what God is pleased that he shall be: of himselfe hath nothing, but what God pleaseth to bestow on him: and by himselfe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2524:114"/>
can doe nothing: but what God is pleased to act in him, and by him, that he doth, and not any thing else: and therefore, what God will not, that he cannot doe. Let this then be your Motto:

And therefore in the period of this Treatise I may iustly put home, and allude vnto Master <hi>Foster</hi> and his Complices, the woe of <hi>Isaias,</hi> against such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which I did mention in the beginning of it, for as much as they presuming too too much on their worldly wisedome, doe mistakingly, and through their blindnesse, ascribe the things of God, vnto the Deuill; the deeds of goodnesse, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euill; and the effects of light, vnto darknesse.</p>

            <p>ANd now for a farewell vnto this my small Pamphlet, I would haue my well-minded Country-men to know, that, had not this rude and vnciuill Aduersary of mine, most vntruely and disgracefully calumniated mee, and laid without

any iust occasion vnto my charge, the vn suffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crime of Witch-craft, or Magick, which is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous both to God and man; I would not thus farre haue hindred my greater businesse, and more weighty occasions, to haue satisfied his v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>reafo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and immodest appetite. And yet, I protest before God and the World, that I am so farre from enuying at his good qualities, (if he haue any) that in the first place. I pitty his indiscretion, and want of that modest and morall wit and behauiour in his writing, which becommeth a true Philosopher, for as much as in them he appeareth more puffed vp externally with the empty blasts of selfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, begirt on euery side, with the blasted fruit of scandalous detraction and enuy at other mens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours, then stuffed internally with any solid va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity: Gay things (I say) to breed delight in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byes, or such as by reason of their darknesse in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, can not well discerne or distinguish the colours of Truth: But vnto the wiser sort (such, I meane, as regard with intellectuall eyes) they seeme as Bables, or things which prestigiously appeare vnto dull eyes, but in verity, are plaine nothing: and then in the second place, I wish him with all mine heart, more money in his purse, or else some good Benefice or Church-liuing to stop his mouth, the want whereof, (as it appeareth by his Epistle vnto the Reader) maketh him in his writing; first, so forgetfull of his Creators Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, that he presumptuously attributeth that, namely, the soueraigne gift of healing, vnto the Deuill, which from all eternity belonged vnto
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2524:115"/>
God: next, he most irreligiously and vniustly doth scandalize his Brethren, for ascribing that iustly vnto God, which only appertaineth vnto him; and consequently, not to any Deuill in Hell: and lastly, he seemeth to inueigh against some men of his owne Profession, yea, and also to murmur against his Superiours in the Church, as you may collect, partly out of his Dedicatory Epistle, and partly out of that vnto the Reader.</p>
            <p>I know his humour so wel, and his Pen hath made me so perfectly acquainted with his rayling and Satyricall disposition, that I expect nothing lesse from him, then a reply full of vnreasonable braua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and thundering exclamations. But although he should rayle and rore at me, as a Bull of <hi>Basan,</hi> or puffe forth the fire of his spight, and rage like one of the Buls of <hi>Colchus,</hi> yet shall my still patience serue in stead of another <hi>Iason,</hi> to charme his tongue, or dull the biting edge of his Pen, &amp; to extinguish the bitter flames of his malice against me. Let him therefore hereafter thunder forth, cry, &amp; proclaime what he please (for such is his vnciuill nature) I will from henceforth answer him (as a rayling and Cynick Writer ought to be,) with silence: for as much as I am assured, that neither by true Diuinity, or authenticall Philosophy, he will be able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twist that web of Truth, which this my small Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet hath wouen vnto him: But if he haue some other businesse or subiect that sticketh in his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack against me (as I haue heard he threatneth me with Mountaines, and I am assured they will proue in the end but Mole-hills, as well as the precedent)

I wish that Master <hi>Foster</hi> would imitate him, and bee his Scholler in these his vertues, &amp; then I should with the like true Christian affection bestow on him, being my home-bred Aduersary, the same commendations, which reason and vertue incite me to impart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Gassendus,</hi> although my forraigne Opposite.</p>
