            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

FROM THE

            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE relation of <hi>Friendship</hi> I have had
to <hi>Your Father,</hi> (before and ever since
You were Born) and the relation of
<hi>Service</hi> I have had unto <hi>Your Self</hi>
(ever since it pleased God to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
you to your present <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur)</hi>
will not suffer me to be altogether <hi>Unconcerned</hi>
in any Thing, wherein I think <hi>Your Highness</hi> to be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned</hi>
very much; especially in regard of Your <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
and <hi>Everlasting</hi> condition, in order whereunto I
have had the honour to be more particularly Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by You for many Years together.</p>
            <p>It was upon this Consideration, <hi>Madam,</hi> that in <hi>Lent</hi>
last I did presume to acquaint <hi>Your Highness</hi> with a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>
I had met with in many Places, and from several
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44344:3"/>
Persons, as well within as without the <hi>Court;</hi> and some
of them neither <hi>Yours,</hi> nor <hi>Your Fathers</hi> Enemies, but
rather very Well-wishers to You both, that <hi>Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
was generally suspected to be at least <hi>wavering</hi> in
Your <hi>Religion,</hi> if not totally <hi>alienated</hi> in Your heart
from it. And of this (besides the Brags of some <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
to that purpose) they alledged, to make the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion</hi>
the more probable, <hi>two Reasons;</hi> of which the
<hi>One</hi> was of Your absenting your self from two or three
<hi>Monthly Communions</hi> together, which you never had
done so much as once formerly: the <hi>Other,</hi> that in
matters of <hi>Difference</hi> both of Opinion, and Practise
betwixt <hi>Us</hi> and the <hi>Papists,</hi> Your <hi>Highness</hi> had often,
and openly declared Your self in favour of <hi>Them</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Us.</hi> Which though You might do, (as I told
them I suppose you did) by way of <hi>Discourse,</hi> or for
<hi>Dispute</hi> sake only; yet because it was otherwise <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted</hi>
and <hi>Reported</hi> by Those that heard it, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Believed</hi> and <hi>Talked</hi> of by the Generality of the
People, especially in and about <hi>London,</hi> to the very
great Grief and Trouble of those that are indeed Your
<hi>Friends,</hi> and to the very great Joy and Exultation of
those that may <hi>seem</hi> perhaps to be your <hi>Friends,</hi> but are
indeed your <hi>Mortal Enemies,</hi> and have sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
themselves to be so: I could not chuse but let
<hi>Your Highness</hi> know what I had heard, that I might
have from Your own mouth wherewithall to stop
Theirs, that were so loudly and so maliciously opened
against You. And so I thought I had, when <hi>Your
Highness</hi> was pleased to tell me that the <hi>Report</hi> I spoke
of (whomsoever it came from) was false and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44344:3"/>
For as to what was said of your omitting to
<hi>Receive</hi> twice or thrice, though it were true in point
of <hi>Fact,</hi> yet the Conjecture that was made upon it
had no Truth in it; for it was (as you said) an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition
in your <hi>Body,</hi> and not any Change in your
<hi>Mind,</hi> that kept you from it, as it shall (said you) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by my receiving of it at <hi>Easter,</hi> which was then
near, and when indeed you did receive it; adding,
that you would not receive the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> no not so
much as <hi>once,</hi> (though it were to save your life) if
you were not of that <hi>Church</hi> wherein you did receive
it; so that your receiving with us, (as you said you
would) the <hi>Easter</hi> following, after such and so solemn
a <hi>Protestation</hi> as You then made, I could desire no
greater an <hi>Evidence</hi> for mine own Satisfaction, nor no
stronger a <hi>Proof</hi> to convince others, that <hi>Your Highness</hi>
was still the same you had been always formerly, in
point of <hi>Religion;</hi> and consequently, enough to silence
all Discourses, and to stifle all Reports, whereby Men
were made to <hi>believe</hi> or <hi>suspect</hi> otherwise of You. But
when after all my Indeavours to that purpose I found
I could not, I began to Consider with <hi>my self,</hi> and to
Enquire of <hi>others</hi> that were your Friends, what might
be the true Cause and Ground of the <hi>continuance</hi> and
<hi>increase</hi> of those false and malicious <hi>Misreports</hi> of You,
notwithstanding your own open <hi>Profession</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise</hi>
to the contrary. And we were all of that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that it was <hi>partly</hi> the Malice of your Enemies,
and <hi>partly</hi> the Vanity and Artifice of the <hi>Romish Party,</hi>
and <hi>Romish Priests</hi> themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44344:4"/>
And first the <hi>Malice</hi> of your <hi>Enemies,</hi> who thinking
Themselves to be in Danger, as long as You are Safe,
and knowing how great an Interest you had gotten in
the hearts of the People, by being so glorious a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor</hi>
of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and withall so great an
<hi>Ornament</hi> and <hi>Support to it,</hi> and consequently that it
would be a vain and desperate <hi>Attempt</hi> to indeavour to
ruin you in your <hi>Person,</hi> and in your <hi>Relations,</hi> before
they had first ruin'd you in your <hi>Reputation</hi> and <hi>Esteem</hi>
with the People: they thought it their surest and their
readiest <hi>way,</hi> and the safest too, to give it out, and to
make it to be believed, that whatsoever you had been
heretofore, or seemed to be now, you were indeed a
<hi>Papist,</hi> or at least <hi>Popishly affected</hi> in your heart, and
would shortly declare your self to be so. This they
at first gave out in <hi>Whispers,</hi> but such as were to be
whisper'd from Ear to Ear, until it became the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Discourse</hi> in <hi>Coffee</hi> Houses, and consequently the
<hi>publick Talk</hi> of all sorts of People in all Places, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
intending (as much as in them lay) to make as
many as were either averse from <hi>Popery,</hi> or afraid of
it, (which I take to be 99 Parts in a hundred of the
whole <hi>Nation)</hi> to be as much your <hi>Enemies,</hi> as they
were themselves, and consequently not to care what
should be done to <hi>You,</hi> or become of <hi>You,</hi> or of <hi>your
Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Rebels</hi> stole away the hearts of the People
from the late <hi>King of most blessed Memory,</hi> who though
he was so sincere, and so zealous a <hi>Professor</hi> and <hi>Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
of the Religion of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that at
length he became a <hi>Martyr</hi> for it, yet his <hi>Enemies</hi> by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44344:4"/>
raising and spreading such malicious and scandalous
<hi>Reports</hi> against him, (as are now raised and dispersed
against You) made the credulous People believe, that
he was indeed a <hi>Papist</hi> and intended to bring in <hi>Popery:</hi>
upon which account only they raised many <hi>Thousands</hi>
against him, without whose assistance they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have over-power'd and oppressed him as they did.
And the Success they had thereby against the <hi>Father,</hi>
incouraged them to make use of the same Engine
against his <hi>Son,</hi> by giving it out that the <hi>KING</hi>
by living so long abroad in <hi>Popish Countries</hi> was so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in his <hi>Religion,</hi> that if he were suffered to return
he would bring home <hi>Popery</hi> along with him. So that
with this groundless <hi>Fear,</hi> I found many very <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
and very much <hi>Interested</hi> Persons to be possest, when
I was sent into <hi>England,</hi> about two months before the
<hi>Kings</hi> return; most of which time I spent in undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all I met with, especially the Heads and Leaders
of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Parties (who seemed
to be most afraid of such a Change) by assuring them
that those <hi>Misreports</hi> they had heard of the <hi>KING</hi>
and his <hi>Brothers,</hi> were nothing else but the malicious
Inventions of those, that were either in <hi>fact,</hi> or in
<hi>consent,</hi> the Murderers of their <hi>Father,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
irreconcileable and implacable Enemies unto his
<hi>Children.</hi> For (said I) to my certain Knowledg, who
was almost always an Eye-witness of their actions,
the <hi>KING</hi> and both his <hi>Brothers</hi> did not only by
their <hi>Profession,</hi> but by their <hi>Practise</hi> declare and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
themselves to be true Sons of the <hi>Church of England</hi>
(even in the midst of its Enemies) by coming <hi>daily</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:44344:5"/>
to our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>weekly</hi> to our <hi>Sermons,</hi> and <hi>frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
to our <hi>Communnions.</hi> Which I do not now Repeat
by way of <hi>Boasting</hi> of what I did; for though it was
all I <hi>could</hi> do, yet perhaps it was less, I am sure it was
no more than I am <hi>bound</hi> to do. But I repeat this, and
what I said before of the late <hi>King,</hi> to let <hi>your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
see, how dangerous a thing it is for any of the <hi>Royal
Family</hi> to suffer themselves to be traduced to the People
by any such Reports and Discourses, as now are made
of <hi>your Highness:</hi> which certainly ought not to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
or neglected, but carefully and seriously to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
into, and speedily to be suppressed by a severe
and exemplary Punishment of the <hi>Authors</hi> and <hi>Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
of them.</p>
            <p>It was very well and wisely done therefore of our
present <hi>Sovereign,</hi> (remembring his <hi>Fathers</hi> Fate and
the Cause of it) to pass an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> presently
after his coming home, whereby, the saying that the
<hi>King</hi> is a <hi>Papist</hi> or that he indeavours to introduce <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
is made punishable in a very high degree. And it
is observable, that this <hi>Act</hi> wherein this <hi>Clause</hi> is, is in
the <hi>Title</hi> of it called An <hi>Act for the safety and preservation
of the KINGS Person and Government;</hi> thereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
that the raising and spreading of such <hi>Reports,</hi>
must needs be very <hi>Dangerous,</hi> and consequently, those
that raise or spread them very <hi>Criminal;</hi> as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the greatest Enemies both of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi>
which though it be most true, when such <hi>Reports</hi>
reflect immediately on the <hi>KING</hi> himself, yet is
it in proportion true likewise, when any of the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Family</hi> are concerned in it. So that they are the <hi>Kings
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44344:5"/>
and Kingdoms Enemies,</hi> as well as <hi>Yours</hi> and <hi>your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,</hi>
and <hi>your Childrens,</hi> that were the <hi>Authors,</hi> and
are the <hi>Abettors</hi> of what is so generally spoken, and
seems to be so generally believed of <hi>your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
in this particular: to the divulging and the belief
whereof, I do verily think that none have been more
Active, nor so much Instrumental, as some of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Party,</hi> and amongst them especially the <hi>Popish
Priests</hi> themselves, and that partly out of <hi>Vanity,</hi> and
partly out of <hi>Cunning.</hi> For, as some of our <hi>Secular Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants</hi>
do, out of <hi>Vanity</hi> only, sometimes boast of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
they have received from such or such <hi>Women</hi> of
known Honour and Virtue, though they never did nor
ever durst speak so much as one word to any of Them
to any such purpose, so do many of the <hi>Clergy Cavaliers</hi>
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as vainly vaunt, how Many
and how Great <hi>Proselytes</hi> they have made, and of how
many considerable Persons, of both Sexes, they have
gained from <hi>our</hi> Church unto <hi>theirs;</hi> which though it
be too true in too many, yet as to some whom they
most boast of, and would fain have it believed they
have prevail'd with, (as particularly and especially
with <hi>your Royal Highness)</hi> I am confident it is but a
vain Brag; and yet I do not think 'tis done out of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
only, but out of <hi>Artifice</hi> and <hi>Cunning</hi> also; because
they have good Reason to hope, that if they can make
it to be believed that they have gained but one such
<hi>Proselyte</hi> as your <hi>Highness,</hi> it would be the most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Means, they can make use of, to perswade
Others; and consequently the most compendious way
they can take in Order to their main End.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:44344:6"/>
In the mean time, it is another notable Effect
of their <hi>Fineness</hi> and <hi>Subtilty,</hi> that when They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have been the <hi>Authors</hi> and <hi>Divulgers</hi> of such
a malicious and scandalous <hi>Report,</hi> and done You
all the Mischief they can by it, than if they find
Those that are most Concerned in it, to be Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum'd
with it, and to resent it with that indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as so bold and so injurious a Practise ought
indeed to be resented withall; then, I say, the next
thing they do, is by such <hi>Instruments</hi> (as they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
want about <hi>great Persons</hi> upon such Occasions)
to perswade the Parties concerned in such Reports,
that all the Noise which they hear, and which seems
to disquiet them so much, is not from the howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of those <hi>Wolves,</hi> but from the barking of their
own <hi>Dogs,</hi> who being as they say more afraid than
hurt, do by giving too soon and too loud a Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a <hi>Danger</hi> which they think to be greater
and nearer than it is, rather increase than lessen
the Noise which was made before, and which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
would have ceased of it self, if too much
Notice had not been taken, as there was of it.</p>
            <p>And such an <hi>Artifice</hi> as this it was to inform your
<hi>Highness</hi> (as some body did,) that this Clamour
against <hi>your Highness</hi> from whomsoever it had its
first <hi>Rise,</hi> it had its <hi>Growth</hi> from some of <hi>our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
and particularly from <hi>Me</hi> for One; as if I had
given some body or other some Cause to Believe
it, and consequently made it more to be Suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and Spoken of by others than it was before;
which, (as I then said) I hope there is none knows
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44344:6"/>
me, can think Me (though I was never so <hi>Wicked)</hi>
to be so very a <hi>Fool,</hi> as to believe of me. For
what <hi>End</hi> could I have, (especially having had such,
and so long a Relation to <hi>your Highness,</hi> as I had)
what End (I say) could I have in making <hi>your
Highness</hi> Believed, or Suspected to be a <hi>Papist,</hi> unless
it were to make my self to be believed to be a <hi>Papist</hi>
also? and consequently to be an old arrant <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite;</hi>
seeing I always <hi>did,</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> and ever <hi>shall,</hi>
by the Grace of God, profess the contrary, though
I were to dye at a stake for so doing. No, no,
<hi>Maddam!</hi> it was neither I, nor, as I verily believe,
any of <hi>our Priests</hi> or <hi>Bishops</hi> but as I then said, they
were some of the <hi>Priests</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi>
that in all probability were both the <hi>Authors</hi> and
<hi>Abettors</hi> of this <hi>Scandal:</hi> and that I was told no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ago than the night before, by a <hi>Person of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
and <hi>Title,</hi> that the very day before he came to
me, he was told by a <hi>Romish Priest,</hi> that <hi>your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
was already of their Church, and would very
shortly declare your self to be so: Whereunto my
Reply was, that although I did believe his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
yet I did not, and hoped he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Priest</hi> that told him so; because your
<hi>Highness</hi> had been pleased, (as I told his <hi>Lordship)</hi>
not long before, to give me all the Assurance I
could desire to the contrary; with which Answer I
sent him away very well satisfied; for he came to
<hi>Chelsey</hi> on purpose to enquire of me, whether what
the <hi>Priest</hi> had newly and confidently told him were
true or no. And so did many other of <hi>Quality,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:44344:7"/>
both Men and Women, to whom I gave the same
Answer, and (as I believe) with the same Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
And this is All that either before or since I
have done, to Increase or Countenance that <hi>Report.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (as I presently after informed <hi>your Highness</hi>
your self) it was not, nor ever would be in my
power, nor in the power of any, or of all His or
Your <hi>Highnesses</hi> Friends or Servants, to silence this
Report, or to hinder the People from giving cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to it; unless You your self would appear in it,
and would openly upon all occasions declare your
Detestation of it, as of a most false and a most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
<hi>Slander,</hi> devised and designed by your <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
to do you all the Mischief they could, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ground or colour of ground for it; and
that you would not nor could not take them for
your <hi>Friends,</hi> that either did believe it Themselves,
or that did not do what they could, that it might
not be believed by Others. For without some such
<hi>Protestation</hi> as this (as I then told your <hi>Highness)</hi>
seriously and seasonably Made, and publickly and
frequently Repeated by You to such <hi>Persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
and <hi>Interest</hi> of both Sexes, as came daily to wait
upon you, I did then, and do still think it almost,
if not altogether Impossible to undeceive the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or to make them think otherwise than your
<hi>Enemies</hi> by their malicious Reports have made them
to think and to speak of You: though nothing but
your own <hi>Declaration</hi> of your self to be as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
you (which I hope I shall never live to see
or hear of) shall ever make me believe, that you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44344:7"/>
are not still in point of <hi>Religion</hi> the same that you
were when I had the Honour to wait upon you,
and as I am sure You was, when I left you.</p>
            <p>And this I am the rather obliged to believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the last time I had any discourse with <hi>your
Highness</hi> of things of this nature, you did seriously
affirm to me, that never any Priest of the <hi>Church
of Rome</hi> had ever been so bold as to enter into any
discourse of <hi>Religion</hi> with you. Whereupon when I
humbly besought <hi>your Highness,</hi> that if any of them
should be so bold at any time afterwards, and you
should think fit to hear what they could say either
for their own Church, or against ours; your <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
would be pleased to command them to give it
you in Writing, and that you would be pleased to
shew me, or my Lord of <hi>Oxford,</hi> any such Papers
or Paper, they should give you to consider of, and
to reply to: the which because You were pleased to
promise me you would do and have never as yet
done, (not to <hi>Me</hi> I am sure, nor to <hi>Him</hi> neither,
for ought I know) I cannot believe that any thing
of that Kind hath been as yet said to you, at least
not so, as to make any Impression in you; and
much less to gain an absolute Belief from you, that
there is no Salvation to be had but in the <hi>Church
of Rome</hi> only; and consequently, that if ever you
mean to be saved, you must of necessity quit <hi>our</hi>
Communion, and embrace <hi>theirs.</hi> I cannot believe
(I say) that any such <hi>Discourse</hi> hath as yet been
made to You, because whatsoever is talked of by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44344:8"/>
               <hi>Others,</hi> you have said nothing <hi>Your self</hi> to me of it,
which certainly you would have done, (if there had
been any such thing) having obliged your self by
promise to do so, and having had several opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of so doing; especially, when you were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to honour my House at <hi>Farnham</hi> with your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
for so many days together, where and when
I did indeed expect You would have said something
to me (according to your promise, if there had
been cause for it) which because You did not I
concluded there had been no such Attempt made;
and consequently, that there was no need of my
saying any thing to You of it, as if I had doubted
whether you had or would keep your Word with
me or no.</p>
            <p>And truly, <hi>Madam,</hi> though you had made no such
<hi>Promise;</hi> I cannot but believe that if there had any
such <hi>Scruple</hi> been suggested to you from <hi>within,</hi> or
offer'd to you from <hi>without,</hi> you would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
Me or the Bishop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> or some other
of our Order or Profession with it; especially if
the Doubts or Scruples had been such as you your
self could not answer. For though God hath given
you an extraordinary good <hi>Understanding,</hi> yet I am
sure, you have not so high an Opinion of it, as to
conclude, that what You cannot answer, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Unanswerable in it self; or that it cannot be
answered by Others; and particularly by some of
Those, whose <hi>Profession</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> it is to defend the
truth of our Church, and the truth of the Doctrine
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44344:8"/>
that is profess'd in it, and taught by it, against all
Objections that either by <hi>Schismaticks</hi> or <hi>Hereticks</hi>
are or can be made against it; so that whatsoever
they may whisper in Corners to the contrary, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the One, nor the Other shall ever be able to
prove either that there is any thing necessary to be
<hi>Believed</hi> or <hi>Practised</hi> for the saving of Souls which
we do not teach, or that we do teach any thing
that is destructive of <hi>Salvation,</hi> or which is inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or <hi>Holiness of life,</hi> which
was at first delivered by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and
which was afterwards held by the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi>
in the most antient and purest Ages of the Church;
and consequently whatsoever may be pretended, it
never was nor ever can be proved, but that those
that live and die in the <hi>Profession</hi> and <hi>Practise</hi> of
what they are taught to <hi>believe</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> by the
Doctrine of <hi>our Church,</hi> must needs be in the right
way, which will undoubtedly bring them into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
if they continue in it. Whereas if they depart
from it, they will be in a worse, and in a much
more dangerous condition than if they had never
known it.</p>
            <p>For although we have so much <hi>Charity</hi> for some
that live and die in the <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Practise</hi> of some
<hi>erroneous Doctrines,</hi> and of some <hi>superstitious Usances</hi>
of the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> supposing they do both the
one and the other out of <hi>invincible Ignorance,</hi> and
supposing too, that they would have continued in
neither, if they had known or suspected them to be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44344:9"/>
either <hi>erroneous</hi> or <hi>superstitious,</hi> and consequently, that
they had a preparation of mind to <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise</hi>
the contrary Truths, if they had been made
known unto them, or rather, if they had not by
their false Teachers been concealed from them: and
lastly supposing likewise that as they do <hi>actually</hi> and
<hi>particularly</hi> repent of all their <hi>known sins,</hi> so they do
<hi>habitually,</hi> or <hi>in the general,</hi> truly and heartily repent
before they die of all their <hi>unknown sins</hi> also; or of
all such sins of theirs which God knows to be sins,
though they do not; and consequently of all such
<hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Superstitions</hi> as they have ignorantly, and
unwittingly, and unwillingly lived in. Although
(I say) we have so much <hi>Charity</hi> for some that have
been born, and lived, and died in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> as not to deny upon the
aforesaid <hi>Suppositions</hi> they may be Saved, not <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
but <hi>Notwithstanding</hi> they lived and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that <hi>Church,</hi> which is no more than the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which upon the same supposition they have for
us, or for those that live and die in <hi>our Church:</hi>
yet we have not, nor cannot have the same <hi>Hope</hi> for
<hi>Those</hi> that having been born and bred in <hi>our Church,</hi>
and sufficiently instructed in the Doctrine of it, do
afterwards become <hi>Apostates</hi> from it, and <hi>Proselytes</hi>
to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> by renouncing those Truths
they were taught in the <hi>one,</hi> and professing those
Falsities they are made to believe in the <hi>other:</hi>
for whom (as I said) we have no such <hi>hope,</hi> nor
indeed any hope at all, unless they do actually and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44344:9"/>
particularly repent of <hi>this,</hi> as well as of all other their
known sins, and withall do testifie the truth of that
Repentance, by returning again unto Us, and by
asking <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> forgiveness for the <hi>Sin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>one,</hi> and for their <hi>Scandal</hi> against the <hi>other,</hi>
by their going away from us, if at least they have
time and opportunity to do it.</p>
            <p>Now this (according to our Opinion) being the
difference betwixt those that after the Knowledg and
Profession of the Truth, go out from us, and those
that would (if they had known the Truth) have
come over to us, it is manifest, that the <hi>Charity</hi> we
have for the <hi>One,</hi> though they live and die in the
<hi>Church of Rome,</hi> can be no Motive or Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for those of the <hi>Other</hi> sort to go and live and
die there, no more than it can be any Warrant for
a Sound man to go out of an healthy Air and to
put himself in a <hi>Pest-House,</hi> because there is a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
that some one or a few may not die of the
Plague there. And this I do the rather Observe,
because, from this Charitable opinion of ours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
some that live and die in their <hi>Communion,</hi> they
usually infer (as a <hi>Preface</hi> to their making of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes)</hi>
that it must needs be much better and safer
to be of <hi>Their</hi> Religion than of <hi>Ours,</hi> because we
confess that some may be <hi>saved</hi> among <hi>Then,</hi> but
they do all deny there is any <hi>Salvation</hi> to be had
amongst <hi>Us.</hi> Which if it were true (as indeed it
is not) they might from thence infer as well that
it was better and safer to be of the <hi>Donatists</hi> Religion,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44344:10"/>
who were condemned Hereticks, than of St. <hi>Austins;</hi>
because that St. <hi>Austin</hi> did not deny that some among
the <hi>Donatists</hi> could be saved, but all the <hi>Donatists</hi> did
affirm that none that were not, or would not be <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
could be saved. Which is the very same which
the <hi>Papists</hi> affirm now, and for which they may as
well now, as the <hi>Donatists</hi> were then, be called <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi>
for excluding as the <hi>Donatists</hi> did all Christians
but themselves, from a capacity or possibility of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And why so? because (forsooth say they)
there is no <hi>Salvation</hi> to be had but in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
and no man is of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> that is not of
<hi>their Church,</hi> because the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is <hi>their Church,</hi>
and <hi>their Church</hi> is the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
he that is not of the <hi>one,</hi> cannot be of the
<hi>other.</hi> And did not the <hi>Donatists</hi> say so too? and was
it not for their so saying that they were pronounced
<hi>Hereticks?</hi> And the <hi>Papists</hi> may as well and truly say,
that because a man is not in <hi>Rome,</hi> therefore he is not
in <hi>Italy,</hi> or because he is not in <hi>London,</hi> therefore he is
not in <hi>England;</hi> or because this Part is not a part of
that part, therefore it is not a part of the whole, which
they must prove before they can make any reasonable
man to believe that we cannot be <hi>Catholicks,</hi> unless we
will be <hi>Papists,</hi> or which is all one that we cannot be
<hi>Catholicks</hi> at all, unless we be <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we may be <hi>Catholicks,</hi> by submitting to the Laws of
<hi>Christ</hi> contained in the Gospel: but we cannot be <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks,</hi> but by submitting to the dictates of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Popish Councils,</hi> particularly to that of <hi>Trent</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44344:10"/>
and the <hi>Canons</hi> thereof, which are many of them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
akin to the <hi>Canon of the Scriptures.</hi> For <hi>drink ye
all of this,</hi> saith the <hi>Canon of Scripture,</hi> but you shall
not drink <hi>all</hi> of this, saith the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Canons</hi> of his
<hi>Councils;</hi> and many other the like Instances might be
given in other particulars.</p>
            <p>But I forget what I was a doing, which was not to
<hi>dispute</hi> with Them, 'till they have been so bold as to
dispute with You; which I do all this while suppose
they have not done yet, because you have not yet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me any Intimation of it, as I am confident you
would have done, not only because you <hi>promis'd</hi> you
would do so, but because without any such <hi>Promise,</hi> I
presume you would have thought your self concerned
in point of <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi> and of <hi>Conscience</hi> too,
having heard what could be said by any of them to
draw you from us, to hear likewise what could be
said by some of Us to keep you with us. For to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in favour of <hi>one</hi> side without hearing of the <hi>other,</hi>
is that which cannot be done either in <hi>Equity</hi> or <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
though you your self were to gain never so much
by it; whereas in this Case if you should be surpris'd
and prevail'd with for want of <hi>Advice</hi> or <hi>Counsel</hi> to assist
you, you might have lost Your self and your soul by
it, which is too pretious a Gage, and cost too dear to
be hazarded upon Confidence of Ones strength against
such subtil <hi>Gamesters</hi> as they are. For what would
this have been, but to do as <hi>Eve</hi> did? who entring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
into the Lists with the <hi>Serpent</hi> (though she had
much more wit than any of her Sex had since) she
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44344:11"/>
was easily foyl'd by him, as perhaps she would not
have been, if it had not been in the absence of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
or if after she had heard what the <hi>Tempter</hi> could
say, she had afterwards suspended, at least her Consent
to the <hi>Temptation</hi> until she had acquainted the Man
with it, and heard what he was able to reply to it;
which because (relying too much upon her own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
she neglected to do, we see she did as much as
in her lay to undo, and undo for ever, <hi>Herself</hi> and <hi>her
Husband,</hi> and all their <hi>Posterity</hi> by the loss of all their
Enjoyments for the <hi>present,</hi> and of all their Hopes for
the <hi>future</hi> also. so rash and so dangerous a thing it is
for any (though of never so great a Sufficiency) to rely
too much upon Themselves, when all their Concerns,
both here and hereafter, are at stake.</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>Madam!</hi> being so prudent a Person
as you are, and knowing so well as you do, how great a
Hazard you may run of losing all that is or ought to be
Dear to you, I am confident, you will not suffer your
self to be disputed out of your <hi>Religion</hi> for want of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds</hi>
to assist you; which seeing you have not hitherto
called for, or made use of, I do and must concluded,
that hitherto the <hi>Adversaries</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> have either
made no Attempt upon you, or have been rejected
with Indignation by you. And in this Belief I am more
and more confirm'd, because you still joyn with us in
the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as having them daily by your
own Appointment read in your Hearing; which
though <hi>Some</hi> perhaps of those that are departed from Us
with their hearts, may be content to do, in Compliance
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44344:11"/>
with some present worldly Interest; yet I am sure you
cannot dispense with Your self, nor suffer Your self to
be dispensed with, in any thing of that nature; because
<hi>You</hi> your self have told me more than once (even since
this false Report hath been rais'd of you) that you
would not do any thing, whereby you might seem to
be of a <hi>Church,</hi> or of a <hi>Religion</hi> which you are not of
indeed; no, not for any worldly Consideration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
Which is indeed such an <hi>Ingenuity</hi> as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a <hi>Christian,</hi> especially of your <hi>Quality,</hi> and such
as gives me an Assurance, that You are still <hi>ours;</hi> and
that you will continue to be so, until You your self by
your Words or Actions shall declare the contrary,
which I hope you never will, and I am sure you never
can with a good Conscience, until you have heard and
considered all that can be said on both sides. For if
your should do otherwise, it will never be believed that
your leaving of Our <hi>Church,</hi> wherein you were born
and bred, to go to Theirs, is only out of love to the
<hi>Truth;</hi> or because They, and not We, are in the right
way to Heaven; (of which without hearing what we
can say for our way, and against theirs, it is Impossible
for you to judg) but from some Byas or by-end from
without; which because I know it is that which you
abhor should be thought or suspected of you, therefore
(as I have said often already) I will not, I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that you have or ever will make any such <hi>Change</hi>
without hearing what we have to say against it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that will be not only an <hi>Argument,</hi> but almost an
<hi>Evidence</hi> that it is from some other Motive, rather
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44344:12"/>
than Conscience, because you did not all you <hi>might</hi> and
<hi>ought</hi> in Conscience to have done, to warrant such a
<hi>Change</hi> before you made it; nay, it will be thought,
and said, You were afraid to hear what could be said
against it, lest thereby you might be diverted from it.</p>
            <p>Which <hi>Consideration</hi> I beseech you to remember,
whensoever there shall be, (though I hope there never
will be) an Occasion to make use of it; yet, in the
mean time, there being no such Change made yet, I
humbly conceive <hi>your Highness</hi> is obliged in <hi>Conscience</hi>
as well as in <hi>Prudence</hi> to make some such <hi>Declaration</hi> (as
I before spake of) namely, that the <hi>Report</hi> of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
changed in your Religion, or that you intend any
such Change, or are at all inclined to it, is <hi>false</hi> and
<hi>scandalous,</hi> devised and published by the Malice of your
<hi>Enemies</hi> to make you lose the Affections of your <hi>Friends,</hi>
and to alienate the hearts of the People from <hi>You</hi> and
from your <hi>Children:</hi> and that You never did nor ever
will give any just Cause for the Belief of it.</p>
            <p>Some such <hi>Declaration</hi> I say (as I humbly conceive)
<hi>your Highness</hi> is bound in <hi>conscience,</hi> as well as in <hi>prudence</hi>
to make, to prevent such Mischiefs as the Continuance
and Increase and Belief of this odious Report may
bring upon <hi>You,</hi> and upon all your <hi>Relations.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that be true which you are wont to say, that no
worldly, either <hi>Advantage</hi> or <hi>Prejudice,</hi> is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
when the gaining of the One, or the avoiding of
the Other comes into Competition with the hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or securing of our spiritual and everlasting Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
of our Souls; and consequently, that if you were
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44344:12"/>
Convinced there were no <hi>Salvation</hi> to be had but in the
<hi>Church of Rome,</hi> no Consideration either of <hi>Loss</hi> or of
<hi>Danger</hi> here in this World you might incur by it, should
keep you from it: yet when you are not so perswaded,
(as I do all this while suppose You are not) then I
hope you may and ought to do what you can, that you
may not be believed or suspected to be so; especially
