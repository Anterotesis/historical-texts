            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi>
the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
of the <hi>Lacedemonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi>
was a great
States-man, and obtained an
immortall glorie by the Lawes
and Statutes which he left unto
the <hi>Spartans.</hi> Yet I finde that
he was very faulty in pemitting
his Citizens to live in continuall
robberie; for what was this, but
to nourish the fire of dissention,
by which hee might have set on
fire his new erected Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
and indeed there needed
the courage of <hi>Theseus,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:4304:3"/>
the strength of <hi>Hercules</hi> to
purge a kingdome infected with
the swarme of such people, for it
is a poison which (as saith the
Poet)
<q>Latius &amp; latius vires acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
eundo.</q>
It is like unto rivers, which (the
farther they runne from their
fountaine) the more they swell
and inlarge themselves.</p>
            <p>But before I represent unto
you the divers stratagems which
these Rake hells usually put in
practise to gain their living; I wil
first shew you their originall, it
being no new thing since men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be wicked: and surely this
vice must be very old, since the
heathen gods sometimes exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the same trade: For <hi>Lucian</hi>
(in his Dialogue of <hi>Apollo)</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4304:3"/>
and <hi>Vulcan)</hi> relates that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi>
was one of the subtillest
theeves that ever lived, for hee
was scarce out of his shell, when
hee stole away the tooles of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
he made what ever he found
in his way his owne: and one day
having overcome <hi>Cupid</hi> at the
Lute, as <hi>Venus</hi> came to imbrace
him, and congratulate his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
he slilie stole from her that
admirable girdle whereof <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
maketh such esteeme: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, he by the sweetnesse of
his musick so charmed <hi>Apollo,</hi>
whiles hee kept the Kine of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metus,</hi>
that he fell asleep, and in
the mean time stole away his herd,
(wherein you may note how blinde
the ancients were in their belief,
to worship a cow-herd and a theef
for gods) nay ever <hi>Jupiter</hi> could
not keep himself from the flights
of this theef, for he stole from
<pb facs="tcp:4304:4"/>
him his Scepter, and would no
doubt, have carried away his
Thunderbolt had it not been too
hot: Wherefore <hi>Homer</hi> in the
Hymne which hee made in his
praise, calls him <hi>(Arcon Phily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teon)</hi>
the Prince of Theeves; and
indeed it is a thing very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that there is no vice which
hath not been authorised by gods,
to the end that the Ancients
might not be scrupelous in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
their actions, which was
the devils policie to draw men to
be his followers, by introducing
(by the means of false Gods) vice
in stead of vertue, and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
making use of things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
sacred, to make his poison
to bee swallowed the more easilie;
for who would not have stole his
neighbours goods, since god <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi>
himself was of the trade, or
who was there among them, who
<pb facs="tcp:4304:4"/>
esteemed it not an honour to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the steps of so brave a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion?
<q>
                  <l>—cui fas per limen utrum<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>

                  <l>Solus habet geminoque facit

               </q>
as saith <hi>Claudian,</hi> like Master,
like servant; such a Prince, such
a subject; If the Gods in times
past were Theeves, it must needs
bee that their worshippers must
follow their example: and wee
have seene the effects thereof; for
during the space of foure or five
thousand yeeres, since that <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
by an insupportable arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie
placed the first stone in the
tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> the world hath
been full of nothing but confusion,
murder, and theft. The <hi>Assyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
spoiled and ransacked all
their neighbour countreys, to lay
the foundation of their Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie;
but it proved no other then
<pb facs="tcp:4304:5"/>
the preparation of a Trophee for
the <hi>Medes,</hi> who invading them,
spoiled them of all that which
they had ransaked from others:
The <hi>Medes</hi> injoyed for a time
their spoiles, but they were soone
stript by the <hi>Persians,</hi> thus one
nation robbed another, untill that
the <hi>Romans</hi> became Masters of
the whole. And what happened at
lèngth, even after revolutions of
ages, this great <hi>Collossus</hi> (whose
shadow strook a feare into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the remotest Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
was dismembred by peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale
and at length remained as
naked as <hi>Esops</hi> bird, and it was
according to reason, that the end
should bee correspondent to the
beginning; for seeing this famous
Republique had not its originall
and increase, but by theeveries,
rapes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and massacres under <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi>
and others; there was no
<pb facs="tcp:4304:5"/>
other likelihood but that it would
return to its first originall.</p>
            <p>But yet I finde some mention
of theeves before all these, for
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were the first af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the deluge that began to rob,
a custome which hath been so long
continued by this Nation, that
they are yet seen to run by troopes
from kingdome to kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
tell fooles their fortunes, &amp; were
it not that men looke more unto
their hands then their feet, they
would make a horrible havock in
villages and solitary houses.</p>
            <p>The barbarous <hi>Scythes,</hi> by the
report of <hi>Herodottus,</hi> were also
very subject to this wicked vice.
for they thought all goods to bee
common, both to men, and other
living creatures, but especially
food, for they made it no scruple
to intrude themselves into any
mans house, where they might find
<pb facs="tcp:4304:6"/>
meat wherewith to satisfie their
hungry appetites.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Lydians</hi> were yet
much more rude, for they held it
for an infallible Maxime, that it
was not fit that a man should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from any place without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
himself with something;
and it may well be said, that there
there are two many Collonies of
this race planted among us, for it
is too apparent, that the one half
of the world robs the other; the
greater theeves robbing the
lesse: For this is so miserable an
age, that the great ones rejoice at
the tottering of the lesse; and
many are seene standing under
the Gallowes to be as spectatours
of the execution of others, who
have more often deserved death
then they have committed
thefts: and though I might here
take occasion to speake much of
<pb facs="tcp:4304:6"/>
the great theeves in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
yet considering, that
<hi>Quae supra nos nihil ad nos,</hi>
I will forbeare, and come unto
the lesse, with sorrow that I must
leave one of the Principall parts
of this Historie untouched: or,
know therefore, courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that for thy good I have set
forth this various, and pleasant
Historie, which will shew thee,
how thou mayest avoid many
dangers, and how others more
wickedly inclined, may (by the
punishments which these reap as
just rewards for their evill cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
be led from the precipice of
perdition, into the safe way of
vertue and honestie.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4304:9"/>

but rashly doe whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is presented unto us by
our vaine imaginations. This
is the cause that man cannot
so easily see what he is, nor
whence he draweth his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall.</p>
               <p>At that time when as Peace
began to flowrish in this
Kingdome, and that the fury
of a long warre was appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
It happened that five
or sixe cashiered Souldiers,
not knowing what shifts to
make, departed out of <hi>Paris,</hi>
resolving among themselvs,
that sithence unconstant For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
seemed to deny them
sufficient Commodities for
their sustenance, they would
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4304:9"/>
use their greatest cunning
and utmost endeavor to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it. These people that
before had plenty of all
things, could not now brook
a scarcity, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to make a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to their former for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
though by any indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
meanes, neither were
they long to seek: For as it
often comes to passe, that
when men perceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
sinking into the deepest
misery, even then they finde
out a meanes of reliefe.: So
now Necessity dictates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these cheating fellows,
an invention by which they
for a time shift off these hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
wants which were now
ready to oppresse them.
They in their way chanced
to meet with a youth about
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4304:10"/>
the age of tenne or twelue
yeeres, who had been sent
from about twelue Leagves
distant from thence with a
Letter to one in <hi>Paris,</hi> whom
they staying, one among the
rest (intending to practise his
wit and to recreate both
himselfe and companions by
an invention (adviseth them
to cloathe him after the best
manner they could possibly,
and telleth them, that as for
the rest, he doubted not but
that he should so well act his
part, that they should all fare
the better for his enterprize.
They all follow his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and at length by their
joynt endeavours, they so
well apparell him that one
would have taken him for
some young Lord, although
there was a kinde of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4304:10"/>
in his behaviour, and
that by his actions he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
shewed of what stocke
he was. The tree is knowne
by the fruit, and the leafe
partly manifests the kinde
and the quality of the stalke.
For Generosity appeareth as
well by the outward behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
as it doth by Vertue
which is the inward orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and whosoever will
cloathe a Rustick in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
of a Gentleman, shall
notwithstanding finde in
him the effects of his rude
breeding and incivility. This
youth being thus revested,
hatched conceits which lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him up even unto the
clouds, he already thought
himselfe one of the great
Lords of <hi>France;</hi> yet for
all his high conceits, they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4304:11"/>
become his Lawgiver; and
after mountaines of golden
promises, they command him
upon paine of death, not to
speake to any one upon any
occasion whatsoever more
then these two words <hi>Etiam</hi>
and <hi>Maxime.</hi> Having thus
grounded their intended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
they went to take up
their lodgings in one of the
best Inns about <hi>Paris,</hi> where
being arrived, they fained
themselves to be of the house
of the extraordinary Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
of <hi>Holland,</hi> and told
the Host, that without faile,
within foure or five dayes
the said Ambassadour would
passe that way; and for an
assured testimony of what
they spake, they shewed unto
him the young Gentlemen,
saying, that he was Nephew
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4304:11"/>
unto the Ambassadour: The
Master of the house (who
deeply considered not what
they spake) beleeving them,
entertained them very sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously
with whatsover
they demanded: and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
he tooke during their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
in his house, that all of
them in generall were (sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively)
respective unto
their young Master. (whom
they blazed to be the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
Minion) made
him and the rest of the Inne
verely beleeve, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
which they shewed
unto this youth was unfain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and what they spake was
undoubtedly true.</p>
               <p>Five dayes were now past
wherein there was no newes
of the Ambassador, but what
they themselves made in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4304:12"/>
house in the midst of their
Jollities and Banquets. The
Host knew not what to think
of it, but not being able to
sound the depth of their my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
he causeth his doubt
to reflect upon the reverence
which he saw was yeelded
unto this new made Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
this withholdeth him
from any outward shew of
suspition, and feedes him
with the hope of the future
comming of the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.
At length eight dayes
being pleasantly slipped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and no Ambassadour
appearing, our Vagabond
Souldiers begin to dreame
that it was now time for
them to take the ayre. And
to finish their well projected
Enterprise, one of them sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
forth his Masters Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4304:12"/>
in fight of the Host, to
give notice when the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
approached, (but
he kept not his promise in
comming, for he was not yet
parted from his house (and
had before privately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to returne by
three of the clocke the next
morning, to give them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that their Master was
drawing neere unto the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
This Gullery was well
practised, the Lackey failed
not to come at the appointed
houre, and knocking at the
Gate, delivered unto them
the welcome newes of their
masters approach: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they all start up with
speed, and having comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that their horses should
be prepared, the Master of
the Inne ariseth, calleth up
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4304:13"/>
his servants, and all of them
confidently settle themselvs
in expectation of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour:
when their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were ready, one of them
came boldly unto the Host,
and told him, that they must
of necessity goe meet their
Master, that he must prepare
a breakfast against their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
which would be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two or three houres at fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest,
and in the meane time
they would leave their yong
Master with him: so they all
parted and forraged the
Countrey, having merrily
recreated themselves at the
expence of their Host.</p>
               <p>In the meane time they
prepare all the Lodgings for
the Ambassador; but noone
being already past, and hee
not appearing, the Host be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4304:13"/>
to perceive the deceit;
He therefore ascends up into
the Chamber, but was much
amazed when he saw there
no other then a Countrey
Clowne in an old Hurden
suite; the Host straitly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amineth
him, and demands
who he is, who those were
that came to lodge in his
Inne? to which he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not a word, and hardly
could he draw from him,
more then these two words,
<hi>Etiam</hi> and <hi>Maxime:</hi> the
Host notwithstanding who
had been at extraordinary
cost in entertaining them,
could not be satisfied with
Latine, he takes therefore
my young Clowne, and
with the smarting blowes
of good rods teacheth him
French; thus passed their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4304:14"/>
deceit, their well acted Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
thus ending in a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</p>

went to visite the sicke in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
parts of the City, one
of the most notable and

that he should make a very
good booty if he could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
him, for he was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a very rich and wealthy
man, by reason of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
practise: this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
breed a Resolution and
this Resolution brought
forth its effect; for on a
Saturday about nine a clock
at night, as the said <hi>Alcander</hi>
went to receive severall sums
of money from divers houses
where he had finished par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Cures; this fellow
who could not have chosen
out a fitter opportunity, nor

subtill device to overreach
<hi>Alcander,</hi> being confident
that he had then good store
of Monies about him, and
that he could not escape him;
Having long attended his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
in a little bye street,
and at length perceiving him
afarre off, comes unto him
in great haste, and with a

Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is long since I have

Sir, God forbid that
I should refuse to doe my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

If I can effect any

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4304:16"/>
will attend you thither with
as good a will as my charge
requireth. Upon these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
this notable Wag
brings him from streete to
street into his lodging, where
having shut the doore, he
takes in the one hand a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoll,
and in the other hand a
great purse, and turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
furiously towards the
Physician, Behold here (saith
he) my wife which hath for
a long time been tormented
with the Flux in her belly, it
is you that must finde out a

otherwise I my selfe am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved

this Pistoll. The Physician
trembling, and much dismay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

by which these men
have sought to maintaine
themselves by an irreligious

               <p>About the end of IVLY
1611. when as the Court
was not much troubled with
rumours of Warrs; Theeves
were much spoken of at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
among others, there were
two who conceived they
might shew a trick of activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to a young Mercer newly
married, which they put in
practise after this manner.</p>
               <p>They both long since
knew, that most commonly
there was but one boy in the
shop; so that watching a
time when the Master was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4304:18"/>
out of the way, one of them
went unto a Chyrurgion
dwelling in the street, called
<gap reason="illegible: obscured" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
aside, desired that when
he brought unto him a youth
of such and such a complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(describing unto him, the
age, visage, and stature of the
Mercers boy) he would be
pleased to conduct him into
his Chamber, for that he had
a secret infirmity to acquaint
him with, and that although
he perhaps would at first bee
bashfull and unwilling to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
unto him his griefe, yet
his parents would have him
constrained to undergoe the
Cure.</p>
               <p>The Chyrurgion (who
doubted not but that what
he spake was true, his words
being delivered with such a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4304:18"/>
naturall livelinesse (promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him not to neglect what
he propounded, but that he
would so deale in the busines
that he should have cause to
rest satisfied; and would not
onely draw the boy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
his infirmity, but would
undertake perfectly to cure
him: whereupon this crafty
Knave (joyfull of this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which promised unto
him good successe) came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Comrade, and told
him of that which he had so
well performed: consulting
together how they should
draw the boy who kept the
hope to the said Chyrurgion,
which they having contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he who had begun the
Plot, came into the shop, and
asked to see some wares; but
by ill fortune, as the boy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4304:19"/>
them, the Mistris of
the house came also, which
made him doubt that hee
should not finish his well
projected enterprise; hee
could then willingly have
wished himselfe further off,
and that he had not enter'd,
since, as the case stood, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
promised him a good
issue in his affaires: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
to forsake a thing so
well forwarded, argued Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardise,
hee therefore at
length resolved to try his
fortune.</p>
               <p>He causeth to be brought
unto him all sorts of the best
Stuffes, and bargained for a
whole piece of that he best
liked, saying, that his Master
a very rich Chyrurgion
(whose name he telleth, and
the streete wherein he resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4304:19"/>
sent him to make choise
of a piece; He therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the Mistris to permit
the boy to bring the Stuffe
away with him unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and that then he should
receive the moneyes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to agreement: This
young woman little doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that her new Chapman
would have deceived her)
commands the boy to follow
the Gentleman with the
Stuffe, and remember, said
she, to bring money for it,
upon these words they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
and had no sooner
turned their backes but this
fellowes Companion meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them as it were by
chance; and the better to
act their parts, he demandes
of his Comrade whence he
came? he answered, from
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4304:20"/>
his Master, and that he was
sent to let one blood, but
have you, said he, done that
which my Master comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you? have you bought
the Stuffes? The boy who
heard all these words, verely
beleeved what they spake to
be true. Our two Vagabonds
being parted one from the
other, he who conducted the
Mercers boy, tooke occasion
to tell him that the other
was his companion, and so
wrought, that he made him
more and more confidently
beleeve what he said; now
as for the businesse in hand,
when you come to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
said he, you may leave
your Stuffe below in the
shop, and may ascend with
him into the chamber, where
he will pay you your money,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4304:20"/>
perhaps he will seeke to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
of the price, but for
all that, when he knoweth
that I have agreed with you
for it, he will not fail to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
you: The young youth
being thus instructed, they at
length came unto the house,
and entred into the shop,
where the Chyrurgion see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
joyfull to see his new
Patient, Is this (said he) the
youth of whom you told
me? Yes Sir, answered the
other, you may if it please
you take him into your
Chamber to give him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
I pray you walke up
said the Chyrurgion, at
which words the boy leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Stuffe he had under
his Cloake in the shop, and
followeth the Chyrurgion
directly to the Chamber; the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4304:21"/>
other seeing the shop voyd
of people, takes the Stuffe
and runs away with it: The
Chyrurgion in the meane
time examineth the youth
concerning his disease; and
told him that there was no
danger for him to discover it
unto him, and that if humane
remedies could give him
ease, he hoped quickly to
cure him of his malady.</p>
               <p>The boy, quite amazed,
not knowing what the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion
meaned, answered,
That (he thanked God) he
was free from any disease.</p>
               <p>The Chyrurgion, who was
intreated to presse him by
threatnings if he would not
make knowne his griefe by
faire meanes, persisteth in his
remonstrances, My friend,
said he unto him, diseases the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4304:21"/>
more inveterate they are, the
more difficult they are to be
cured, the griefe that waxeth
old, taketh root, and men are
often constrained to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
where (if applyed in
time) there needed not more
then an ordinary Plaister.</p>
               <p>The youth, who expected
nothing from him but mony
(that being the best salve in
these dayes) told him, That
he came for no other cause
but to receive money for his
Stuffes.</p>
               <p>The Chyrurgion percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that he used all his faire
perswasions to little or no
purpose, thought he might
draw him to tell him his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
by threatning; he
therefore began to waxe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rough with him, but when
he heard him speak of Stuffes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4304:22"/>
and Ware, he began to smell
out the cheat, and asked him
of what Ware he spake; the
boy exclaimed wonderfully
against him, calling him
Cheater, and told him that
he should pay for the stuffe:
but in the end he was turned
home without either Money
or Stuffe. This may serve as
a warning to young Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises,
not to suffer themselves
to be led by the faire words
of any man, but to be carefull
of their affaires, and to be
watchfull of those things
committed to their custody,
by which meanes they shall
deserve praise of all men, and
avoyd many the like dangers
which they shall run into.</p>

as he was one day at <hi>Paris,</hi>
walking from place to place,
as he was still accustomed,
the better to entrap Novices;
took notice of two Citizens,
who having not for a long

welcomed, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
rejoyced one in each
others company: Hee who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4304:23"/>
still kept one eare for the
Towne, and another for the
Countrey, perceiving them
discourse of their particular
affaires, drew by little and
little neere unto them, yet
without seeming any way
desirous to participate of
their discourse; At length,
after much talke, the one of
these earnestly intreated the
other to come the next day
by eleven of the clock to his
house, there to take part of a
poore dinner with him, and
to bring with him some
friend to bear him company;
the other faithfully promised
him not to faile to endeavor
the increase of his happines,
by visiting him at the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
houre, and withall, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that he much honoured
him by his invitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:4304:23"/>
                  <hi>Garandine,</hi> who had with
an attentive eare hearkned to
this loving invitation, was
perswaded that hee might
then performe some exploit:
He resolves therefore to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his intended Host afarr
off, and to learne the streete
and place where he resided,
to the end that he might not
faile the next day to be there
as well as he who was invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
which having taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, he failed not the next
day at the prefixed houre, to
take his walke about the
place, expecting when he
who was invited to dinner
would come, that he might
serve him for an Vmbra; as
the ancients were accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
who when any were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited

               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:4304:24"/>
He having at length per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the invited guest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
afarre off, so ordered
his steps that they both met
at the same instant, just over
against the very doore; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
the Marchant thinking
that <hi>Gerandine</hi> had been invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the master of the
house, contested in humility
who should enter last; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would not doe as the
shadow which lead <hi>Socrates</hi>
one day to a banquet and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
before its Master, which
was contrary to custome, this
was the cause that he entred
last: Where being both wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
by the master of the
house, they sate downe, and
while dinner was preparing
they entertained themselves
in discourses of Newes,
and relations of such things
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4304:24"/>
as passed in Court. <hi>Garan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi>
in the meane time had
not his eyes setled but in
their unsetled motions, he
gazed every way to spie out
an opportunity to provide
for himselfe before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture:
The table being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
while they wash their
hands, <hi>Garandine</hi> cast his eye
on the Bason (which was of
silver, and well worth 200
crownes) and tooke notice
that they had left it in the
roome adjoyning, which
was the Kitchin.</p>
               <p>The Master of the house
thought that his friend had
brought <hi>Gerandine</hi> with him,
and that he was of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
And the other
on the contrary, thought
that the Master of the house
had invited him to dinner.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4304:25"/>
It must needs be that <hi>Geran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi>
had a good wit, and that
he carryed himself very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
knavish in this place;
for he was examined by
both, and answered very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
to all that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
Dinner being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and the cloth taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
they for a time recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselves with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
untill that <hi>Garandine</hi>
having perceived that the
servant was gone forth, and
that the Mistris of the house
was gone into an upper
Chamber, Sirs (said he) I
pray you excuse me if I am
somewhat unmannerly, there
are some urgent occasions
which call me hence, but I
will not faile to returne unto
you within this quarter of an
houre at most; and so having
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4304:25"/>
taken his leave of them, he
descended into the Kitchin,
and tooke the silver Bason
under his arme, and fled.</p>
               <p>He was no sooner depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but that the two Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
(but especially he who
was invited) began to inquire
who that honest Gentleman
was? The other answered
that he knew him not, and
that he thought him to have
been some friendly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his; whereupon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them mightily astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
they call the Mistris, to
whom they relate the whole
Story, but in the meane time
they thought not of their
Bason which was stollen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
an houre after, when the
servant was returned from
the City it was found mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and the Theefe known.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4304:26"/>
Thus got <hi>Garandine</hi> his din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4304:26"/>
and which by our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
becomming habituall,
changeth it selfe into a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the end: We may see
a notable example thereof in
the person of <hi>Amertis,</hi> a man
who had travelled through

a man who had great corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondencies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
both in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Countrey and among
forraine Nations, and one
who was much practised in
the affaires of the World.</p>
               <p>As this man one day walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Hall of the Palace,
with an intent to spie out
mens actions, he saw a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
of <hi>Lions,</hi> who was with
one of his associates, talking
about some Wares which he
had formerly delivered unto
him: <hi>Amertis</hi> seriously view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Marchant, and in a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4304:27"/>
deep contemplation, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
with himselfe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he could invent some
trick to surprise him; but as
he ruminated on the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his not yet resolved
enterprise, he heard three or
foure Gentlemen talking of
him; the one said that hee
was of <hi>Lions,</hi> and that hee
knew him very well; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
said that he had made a
Voyage into <hi>Italy</hi> with him,
and that he yet owed him
some Monies which he had
lent the Merchant at <hi>Millan:</hi>
To all which <hi>Amertis</hi> very
attentively listened, so that
at length, he by this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
discourse learned who
he was, where he had beene,
and about what time; to be
briefe, with the memory he
had, which was very quick,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4304:27"/>
he retained all that which
he heard spoken of him.</p>
               <p>Not long after, he came
unto him (finding him among
three or foure men of quality
with whom he sometimes
dealt) and saluteth him with
a profound reverence; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
having never seene him,
before, turneth towards him,
and resalutes him with these
words; Sir, excuse me, I pray
you, I cannot call to minde
the remembrance of you, and
yet methinks I have seen you
some where: Sir (replied he
unto him) I have had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to make a Voyage into
<hi>Italy</hi> with you; The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
who could not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
all those who fifteene
yeeres since had beene in his
company, being twelve or
thirteene in number, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4304:28"/>
that he said true, and
tooke upon him to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amertis</hi> conjecturing well
of this new fained old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
after much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of severall things
which hee affirmed to have
happened since they last saw
one another, began to tell
him, That he should doe him
a very great pleasure if he
could now helpe him to the
hundred Crownes hee had
formerly lent him; whereat
the Marchant being much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed,
and not knowing
what <hi>Amertis</hi> intended by
those words, answered that
he ought him nothing; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
beleeve, replyed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that a man of your rank
and quality (who seemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to have esteemed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4304:28"/>
and ever made professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

now have so bad a Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
as to deny mee that
which is my due, that were
not only to violate the Rites
of friendship and of all civill
conversation, but also to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
that good opinion men
have hitherto conceived of
you both at <hi>Lions</hi> and in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi>
doe not you remember
that I lent you this summe in
<hi>Millan?</hi> you can by no just
meanes deny it, you will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
a generall blame if you
should seeke to inrich your
selfe with the goods of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The Merchant being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,
not knowing what
answere to make to his so
impudent demand, told him,
That perhaps hee had lent
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4304:29"/>
him some Money in his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
but that surely he had
long since repayed; The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
denying it, persisteth
eagerly in his first demand.</p>
               <p>Those that were with the
Marchant, perceiving some
appearance of truth in <hi>Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>
words (not discovering
the falshood that lay hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them) were of opinion
that the Marchant wronged
him, in refusing to pay him a
due debt: And truely, a man
who had never seen the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
and countenance of
<hi>Amertis,</hi> would never have
judged that he had intended
deceit.</p>
               <p>Upon this contestation
they all retire to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
houses, but <hi>Amertis</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
his old friend, even unto
his lodging, to the end he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4304:29"/>
might constraine him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;
at length, being not
able at that time to prevaile,
he remits his cause untill the
next morning, and then find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in an honourable
assembly, he mooved him
concerning his former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>The Marchant being much
discontented to see himselfe
so hardly pressed by this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
affronter, before such
worthy company, fearing to
hazard the losse of reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and undergoe an unjust
censure for it, intreats one of
his company to take this
debt upon him in his name,
that they might try how this
busines would that way suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
whereupon, he that had
received the watch-word,
seeing that <hi>Amertis</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4304:30"/>
bent to pursue the
marchant, came in full assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and said unto him, Sir,
you wrong your selfe, to take
this man for him that ought
you the debt whereof you
speak, you are mistaken Sir, it
is not he, but I that owe it,
(and yet everyman knew that
he had never been in <hi>Italy.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amertis,</hi> as crafty as a man
could possibly be, tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
by the lock, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
him, Sir, it is very
true as you your selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
before these worthy
Gentlemen, that you owe me
one hundred Crownes, for
your part you cannot deny it,
but this is not the debt, for I
lent him this summe in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and he must of necessity pay
it. Thus he so strongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
them both, the one by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4304:30"/>
probable circumstances, and
the other by his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession;
that for feare of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their reputation in so
honourable a presence, and
to be rid of his importunity,
and future trouble, they were
constrained to pay him the
one halfe in hand, promising
him the rest shortly after,
which he with much intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
accepted of.</p>

whereof he was accustomed
to carry in a great Purse,
which so heavily weighed
downe his pocket, as if the

               <p>This Purse was noated by
cheating Rascalls (who are

oftentimes passed and
repassed by the shop of this
<hi>Clarinde,</hi> and considering
with himselfe what plot he
might put in practise to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive

of thoughts, resolved
to make tryall of one of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4304:31"/>
strangest inventions that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was heard of. He takes
one of his Companions upon
the New-bridge (for that is
the place of their ordinary
retreat) and cloathing both
himselfe and his Companion
like Husbandmen, they for a
time consult whether it were
best for him to enter or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre,
for he saw many Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the shop, which made
him despaire of arriving at
the period of his designes;
for if he should have entred
in among so many people, he
could not have practised his
invention with a cleere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance;
againe, the habit
which he had taken purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for that intent, urged him
not to desist from his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
enterprise, but to try the
favour of fortune; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4304:32"/>
his Companion so farr
pressed him, that he was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
as it were betweene
two contrary opinions; In
this case stood the Cutpurse,
he durst neither goe forward
nor backward; the neerer
boldnes made him approach,
the more the feare of being
perceived willed him retire;
at length he resolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
untill that the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who were then in the
shop, were departed, and to
this he was the rather indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
by the hope he had to
increase the gaine by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
for he conceived (as it
prooved true indeed) that
the Marchant having sold
that which they in the shop
were bargaining for, there
would arise the more profit
unto him, if he should have
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4304:32"/>
the good fortune to obtaine
his Purse: In the meane time
his companion seemed much
discontented, that he saw not
as yet, the expected issue of
that which his Comrade had
so confidently undertaken;
the other encouraged him
the best he could, to attend a
little while, untill that the
shop were voyd, which he
did, but with much impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>At length, he that was
Captaine in this exploit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
noated that the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were departed, came to
advertise his Companion,
that he should stand Sentinel
on the end of the Marchants
Bridge, there to receive from
him what he brought; he in
the meane time goes into the
shop, where finding the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4304:33"/>
alone, he causeth him
to open divers Copes, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him that he was a Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioner
of <hi>Gentilly,</hi> and that
being not long since chosen
Church-warden, he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to buy a faire Cope
for the Parson of the Parish,
he desired him therefore to
shew him those that were
good, and to use him well in
the price. <hi>Clarinde,</hi> who thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
inwardly with the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
desire of gaine, sheweth
him divers sorts of Copes,
among these the Cutpurse
made choise of one to which
he seemed to have a better
liking then the rest, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cheapens it, but before
he would fully agree on the
price, he tells him that hee
would desire to see whether
the Cope were well made,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4304:33"/>
and whether for size or
length it would fit the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
of the Parish, who he
said was much about his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
he therefore intreats
him to doe him so much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
as to assay it; <hi>Clarinde</hi>
(nothing at all doubting of
that which his pretended
Church-warden would do)
puts on the Cope on his
back, which the Church-warden
having exactly view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
seemed to dislike, for
shortnesse, in that part where
the Pouch hung; the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
supposing the cause of
this seeming shortnesse to be
no other then the bearing
out of his Pouch underneath,
unhang'd it and laid it by on
the Counter; his Chapman
reviewing him, said hee now
liked it well, but his Purse
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4304:34"/>
better; with that he nimbly
snatcht it, and ran away; the
Marchant in his Cope (for
he had no leasure to put it
off) ran after, the one for his
money, the other for his life;
the Cutpurse, who had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
him about fourty paces,
told the people by the way
as he ran, that they must not
by any meanes stay him, for
that hee that ran after him
was distracted, to others he
said, that he ran for a wager;
<hi>Clarind</hi> notwithstanding cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not his pursute, but his
legs being too stiffe, and his
joynts not well suppled, and
the world gazing more on
the fluttring of his gay Cope
then on him or his Cutpurse,
he at length lost sight of his

constrained, with shame, to

returne to his house, with the

alwayes been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ordinary refuge and
retreate of Theeves and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds,
and (which one
would admire) many of them
maintaine themselvs so well,
and go so compleate in their
apparell, conforming their
discourse and outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor
thereunto, that men
would often take them for
the chief gentlemen in court.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:4304:35"/>
Let us now see what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to <hi>Polidamor</hi> by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises
of some of these
night-walking Vagabonds.
<hi>Polidamor</hi> was an Advocate,
as famous for his wisdome,
as renowned for his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
he onely was spoken
of in the Palace and Courts
of Pleadings; his name was
the ordinary discourse of
men of honour, and he was
admired of all that knew
him.</p>
               <p>These plotters of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
who lie alwayes in
Ambush, expecting their
prey, hearing some talke of
this worthy man, resolved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves to try their
cunning to entrap him: The
complot being resolved on,
and they (knowing his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which was not far from
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4304:35"/>
the Cordeliers) often sought
the opportunity to surprise
him, but yet for three or
foure times they failed; but
at length, he comming onely
attended on by a little Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,
neere Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi>
of Arts, three of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
perceived him, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beset him, and there rifle
him; but finding no store of
money about him, they took
from him a new Cloake of
very fine Spanish-cloth lin'd
through with Plush: <hi>Polida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi>
who wonderfully vexed
that he had been after such a
sort un-Cloak'd, said unto
them; Sirs, I humbly intreat
you to affoord mee so much
favour as to permit me (since
you have taken away my
Cloake) to redeeme it upon
reasonable termes, I shall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4304:36"/>
willingly give unto you for
it more then it wil elsewhere
affoord you; if therefore my
proposition bee acceptable
unto you, to morrow, at what
houre you shall please to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
I will bring you mony
for it: the Theeves hearing
him speake after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that sort, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
him, That he should
not faile the next day, by six
a clock at night, to be in that
place, and that then they
would restore unto him his
Cloak, but withall, told him,
That they were already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of his lodging and
quality, and therefore char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him not to bring any one
with him to serve him for a
safe Convoy, for if he did,
they vowed his ruine, and
gave him just cause to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire
(if he came accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied)
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4304:36"/>
of ever returning to
his house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polidamor,</hi> terrified with
such threatnings, promised
them not to faile to bee there
alone at th'appointed houre,
in the meane time hee was
constrained to returne to his
house without his Cloake,
which he thought very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely
in a man of his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and could hardly digest
it, he being a man not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to such rude enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainements;
but in this case
he must make a vertue of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
by enduring it with
patience, not knowing well
how to remedy it.</p>
               <p>On the morrow he takes
his purse well furnished with
money, and departs from his
house about halfe an houre
after five, and came to the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4304:37"/>
place where the former night
he had lost his Cloake, there
he for a time attended; at
length, immediately after
sixe, he perceived a Coach
with three or foure Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in it, <hi>Polidamor</hi> little
thought those whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
were such kinde of
people; these men seeing him
stand at the appointed place,
caused likewise their Coach
to stop, whereupon, one of
them privately enquires of
him, whether he were the
man from whom they had,
the night before, taken away
a Cloake lined with Plush?
he answered, That he was
the man, and that he came
thither upon no other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but to redeem it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his promise; Upon
this answere, one of them
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4304:37"/>
came unto him, and whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him in his eare, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
whether he were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied,
or not, and told him
that if he were, his life was
in hazard: he having vowed
unto them that he was alone,
was taken up by them, and
placed in the midst of the
Coach, where they hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winke
him, one of them hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a Pistoll at his breast
lest he should make an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry;
behold <hi>Polidamor</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amaz'd and terrified, but
he was much incouraged
when they promised not any
way to hurt him, or doe him
mischiefe; they presently
cause the boote of the Coach
to be shut close, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Coachman to drive
away with speed: <hi>Polidamor</hi>
in the meane time remained
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4304:38"/>
as it were in a trance, not
knowing whither hee was
conveyed.</p>
               <p>Having swiftly hurried
from street to street, they
came at length to a most
stately house, where the gate
being presently opened, they
enter; then began <hi>Polidamor</hi>
to redouble his feare, and to
expect the houre of his
death, for he never thought
to escape; at length, his eyes
being uncovered, they led
him straight to a great Hall,
where hee found the Tables
covered with all kindes of
most exquisite meates, hee
was mightily astonished to
see himselfe in the midst of
so many people, all in good
order, and so well clothed,
that a man would have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to have been of some
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4304:38"/>
high quality: They told him
that he needed not to feare,
for that he was in good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and that they had not
brought him thither, but that
he might doe them the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to take part of a poore
Supper with them, but <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi>
could have wisht him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
at Supper elsewhere in
a place of more security; for
he could not devise, either in
what part of the city he then
was, nor conceive what they
were with whom hee was to
Suppe.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, having
washed their hands, every
one tooke his place, and had
they been Princes they could
not have been better atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
yet they caused <hi>Polida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi>
to sit at the upper end of
the Table, who had he been
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4304:39"/>
further from both ends
would have had a better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite;
He notwithstanding
made shew of eating with
the rest, judging, that seeing
he was in the middest of
Wolves, he could not doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
then imitate their
actions; When they had all
Supped, and that the Tables
were uncovered and Cloth
taken away, some of them
came to discourse with <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor,</hi>
and after a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
manner, told him,
That they were sorry that he
had eaten so little with them;
to which he knew not what
to answere, for he feared lest
by the rash utterance of some
word which might be wrong
taken, he should provoke
them to anger, and to draw
on his owne ruine, yet hee
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4304:39"/>
took courage, and deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave them respective an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
While some of them
were in discourse, one tooke
a Lute, another a Violl, and
so recreated themselves; At
length, after much talke, he,
who the day before had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Cloake from <hi>Polida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi>
came unto him, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him whether hee had
brought the Mony which he
promised? <hi>Polidamor</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that it was ready, and
thereupon told out thirty
pistols upon the end of the
Table (the Cloak being well
worth fourty:) This being
done, they shewed unto him
a little private Chamber,
which seemed unto him a
very rich Wardrobe, hanged
round about with Coats and
Cloakes of great value, there
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4304:40"/>
they bade him cull out his;
<hi>Polidamor</hi> was amazed to see
such costly Cloakes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to take courage; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found his Cloak among
the rest, he returned againe
into the Hall, behaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
towards them with all
submissive respects, for he
feared that hee should not
part upon so good termes,
neither did he; for when he
was ready to depart, one
came and told him, That the
Coachman who had brought
him thither, and was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
him backe, must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for his paines with a
pistolet, and that hee must
likewise pay for his Supper
with them: <hi>Polidamor,</hi> unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
liberall, giveth them
two pistolets more, and so
took his leave of them: The
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4304:40"/>
Coach was suddenly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
whereinto he entring,
and having his eyes bound
up, he was brought unto the
same place where they had
formerly taken him up, there
did they uncover his eyes
and set him on foot, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him a Billet, sealed with
greene Wax, wherein was
written these words in great
Letters,
THE GREAT BANDE HATH
LET HIM PASSE.
and withall, advised him if
he met with any one that
would offer him any kinde
of violence, to shew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him this Passeport; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him, That by that means
he should be permitted qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
to passe, So <hi>Polidamor</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:4304:41"/>
parted from them, happy to
have escaped out of their
hands with life: But scarce
had he gone into the second
street, but he found three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Theeves ready to rifle
him; and now he who at first
made no account of the Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
which they had given
him, bethought himselfe that
perhaps it might stand him
in stead; he therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
it unto them, which was
read by one of them that
carried a dark Lanthorne, so
they suffred him to passe and
return unto his house, where
his wife remained in great
perplexity, not knowing
what was become of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
but her anxious feare
was soone turned into joy by
his presence, and into delight
by the Relation which hee
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4304:41"/>
made unto her of his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
She, like a loving wife,
not regarding the losse
which he had sustained, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
smile-frowning Fortune
had shewed her constant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy,
by converting his
former losse and danger, into
a safe returne.</p>

but our latter Age
hath noated out one above

fearefull, as beyond the
sence and common opinion
of men.</p>
               <p>There hath not past an
Age wherein the great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
hath not made some
signes of his just indignation
appeare, to punish the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries
of those that imbrace
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4304:42"/>
actions so wicked and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
as if hatcht in hell,
rather then sprung from
mans invention. The History
which I now describe unto
you is true, and happened
not long since; the sequell
whereof is as much to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
as his end, who was
the cause of it, was prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and horrible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valesio</hi> was borne in <hi>Berne</hi>
a Canton of Switzerland,
and was sent by his father
to the City of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> to
bee there instructed; hee
had a spirit full of subtilty,
and fit to undergoe great
matters, had he been honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enclined: In <hi>Lucerne</hi> hee
for a time studied the Law,
where during his abode hee
often resorted to the house
of an Inn-keeper, named
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4304:43"/>
                  <hi>Lucio</hi> of <hi>Zurich,</hi> a man rich
and wealthy, with whom he
grew so familiarly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that he could neither eat
nor drinke but in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
he lodged over against
his house, and it seem'd that
heaven was not favourable
unto him when he enjoyed
not the company of this
man; but his affection increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
when it had taken foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
within his house, and
when hee became enamor'd
with the beauty of his onely
daughter: This yong <hi>Valesio</hi>
being inflamed with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desire of injoying the
feature of this maid, the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
frequented the house, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of visiting the
Father, when as indeed his
greatest happinesse consisted
in beholding the beauty of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4304:43"/>
the daughter; their eyes had
already given to each other
friendly enterchanges, and
had privately practised an
alliance in their thoughts, by
the encounter of their rayes;
and their hearts quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of that within, which
their eyes had practised
without; so that <hi>Valesio</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
his affection secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by a favourable Zephir,
resolved to acquaint his
Love with that which his
heart as yet concealed; The
father being advertised ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and perceiving that the
inclinations and affections of
these Lovers were mutuall,
knit them together in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
under the sweete bonds
of <hi>Hymen;</hi> happy, and thrice
happy had they been, had
they not abused it, but finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4304:44"/>
the number of their yeres,
without straying from the
path of Vertue. They lived
two yeeres and an halfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
in all sorts of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
delight; at the end
whereof, the father died of a
lingering feaver, happy in
that he survived not to bee a
spectator of the ensuing Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.
By the death of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi>
all the inheritance fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the possession of <hi>Valesio,</hi>
(for his wives mother decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
long before.) He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
resolved to take the
same course of life, as his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in law had done before
him, being that he found the
house so well furnished: The
good entertainment which
he at the beginning gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his guests, purchased him
a good report of every one;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4304:44"/>
so that if any man desired to
entertaine a friend sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
whither must they go
but to the house of <hi>Valesio;</hi>
there were they joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved,
and used with all
kinde of contentment; but at
length, the swinge which
<hi>Valesio</hi> had taken, made him
so swell with pride, that he
began to forget his family,
that he might the better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
himselfe; the courtesie
which he formerly shewed
unto his guests, was now
changed into most cruell ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
which he often exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
upon travellers, killing
and massacring them like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another <hi>Licaon:</hi> his house
heretofore the receptacle
and seat of courtesie, was
now become the cut-throat
and deadly place where poor
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4304:45"/>
Passengers were entrapped;
he hacked them most cruelly
in peeces, and made Pies
therewith (an unnaturall and
monstrous barbarisme,) hee
durst not have practised
these cruelties towards the
Citizens of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> for so
his wickednesse had beene
discovered: the delicate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of his meat which hee
provided, drew unto him a
multitude of guests, which
they with joyful greedinesse
devoure, whiles that he (Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine)
laughs at their simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
little thinking, that he
himselfe should shortly feele
the just judgement of God,
heavily lighting upon him
for his monstrous and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
cruelties. A strange
blindnesse in humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
which perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4304:45"/>
that there is no Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to revenge or punish
their heynous crimes and
misdeeds; we so flatter our
selves in our wicked prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
that we cannot beleeve
we shall ever fall into those
miserable punishments w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
wee deserve. <hi>Valeio</hi> could
never beleeve, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
would reveale or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the death of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Soules, which hee
had most barbarously slaine:
but the Great mover of the
Heavens could no longer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
so cruell crimes: the
bloud of so many poore
wretches unjustly shed, cried
for vengeance before the
glorious majesty of his face;
and yet this great and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
God staied for a time the
furie of his justice, to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4304:46"/>
to the sweet requests of
mercy, but hee (wretched
Caitiffe) deferred so long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for his heinous
misdeeds, untill the weight
of so many deadly crimes,
drew the arme of the just
vengeance of God to punish
him, as severely and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily,
as the faults deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>It hapned after the secret
murthers of so many people,
that a certaine Merchant of
<hi>France</hi> returning from <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
was in passing that way
desirous to see the Cantons
of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the City of <hi>Lucerne;</hi> he
therefore came unto this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
where being arrived he
inquires for an Inne, and was
directed to the house of <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio,</hi>
as the best and most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4304:46"/>
Inne of the City; he
goes thither, and was favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
received and welco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by those cruell Syrens,
who allured passengers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them by the harmonious
consorts of their voices, that
they might afterward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure
them, and make them
their prey: he having visited
the City, and viewed part of
the rarities thereof, (as the
stately Monastery, and the
River <hi>Russi,</hi> which passeth
through the Towne, and
runneth forth of a great Lake
as doth the River <hi>Rhine,</hi> out
of the Lake of <hi>Constance)</hi> was
desirous to take his rest: Here
the confidence which the
guest ordinarily reposeth (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custome of
<hi>France)</hi> in the Master of the
Inne, made the Merchant
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4304:47"/>
disburthen himselfe of two
thousand Crownes which
he had in gold, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Valesio,</hi> a place
where he might put them in
safe keeping: this Inne-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
who was alwayes double
in his workes, had a strong
and massie Cupbord and two
Keyes which might easily
open it; whereof he gave one
unto the Merchant to put his
money in safegard, but kept
the other close unto himself,
to serve his own opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
night approaching, he
was tempted to bereave his
guest, both of life and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
but whether it were
that God would otherwise
dispose of him, or that his
owne life was already come
to its period; his wife who
noated a comelinesse and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4304:47"/>
courtesie more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in this Merchant, disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him from so bloudy a
designe, and urged him to
imbrace another lesse cruell,
but such as must cost him his
life.</p>
               <p>The Merchant rose early
in the morning to view the
rest of the City, which hee
had not seen the day before.
<hi>Valesio</hi> in the meane time ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the Cupbord, rippeth
the bottome of the bag, and
taketh a note in writing of
the quantity of all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes
in generall, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of every sort of coyne
in particular which he there
found; then having neatly
stitched up the bottome of
the bag, he locked the Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord,
and acted his part with
such subtill dexterity, that it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4304:48"/>
was impossible for a man to
discerne that it had beene
touched: but he who pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
into the depth of our
most secret thoughts, easily
discovered this craft, as may
be noted by that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues.</p>
               <p>The Marchant having sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
his curiosity, and seen
(in passing) that which was
most worthy of noate in the
Towne, returned to his Inne;
and having payed what they
demanded, he took forth his
bagge and went to horse-back.
<hi>Valesio</hi> presently think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he had in vaine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Theatre (and begun
the Play) if he finished not
the Tragedy, breakes open
the bottom of his Cupboord,
and presently begins to raise
Hue and Cry after the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4304:48"/>
Theef, pretending that the
Marchant had robbed him;
His neighbours were instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in an uproare, (for he had
so long worne the cloake of
Dissimulation, and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
behaved himself, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man esteemed his word as
an Oracle) insomuch that
many of his best friends pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
themselves for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute;
the Host sheweth them
which way his guest went,
they hasten after and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
him two Leagues from
<hi>Lucerne;</hi> they seize on his
person, as on a malefactor; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him of theft, and bring
him backe bound hand and
foot into the Towne; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
he being amazed, seemes,
by his silence, as it were to
confesse the deed: They lead
him before a Justice, who sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4304:49"/>
him to prison. That
part of the Tragedy being
acted, they prepare his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement;
and the Host shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his memoriall, intreateth
them not to examine him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they had perused his
noate; He makes it apparent
that his Cupboord was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
and upon the opening
of the bags, the Judges found
therein the same summe and
sorts of Coyne specified in
the Hosts noate. The most
wary and wisest Judge might
have been incumbred, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vershot
themselves in so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
a businesse. The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the deed being thus
almost sifted out (in mans
judgement) caused the poore
Marchant to be shut up in a
strait dungeon, and there to
be laden with Irons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:4304:49"/>
Thus this poore innocent
groaned in darkesome caves,
not knowing any meanes of
his delivery: Wretch that I
am (would he say) must I
needs perish in this obscure
place, not having so much as
intended that whereof they
accuse me? What Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
powers have I so offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that I should be reduced
to such misery? was I borne
under so cruell Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that my own innocence
should betray me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave
me of my life? O great
God! who in thy just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
canst penetrate into
the depth of this secret and
unjust accusation, Wilt thou
suffer my fault to be made
criminall in this sort? And
must I be the shuttle-cocke
and sport of treason? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4304:50"/>
and reveale this their
injustice, (I beseech thee)
and suffer me not to perish in
this depth of misery. As
he pronounced these words
with an extreame griefe and
unexpressable passion, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
appeared unto him in an
humane shape, wearing on
his head a red Cap, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
him, inquires,
what his griefe was, and
tels him, that if hee would
give him his soule, he would
deliver him out of those Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
wherein he was wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
shackled? Many in these
dayes, and alwayes have bin,
who would have redeemed
themselves out of these tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
paines, to have cast
themselves into the eternall,
therby to have regain'd their
over-valued liberty; but this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4304:50"/>
Merchant having firme hope
in the Divine Providence,
answered, that he was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
never to commit so hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
a crime, and that he had
rather dye innocent of the
offence, whereof they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him, then to live guilty
of renouncing his Creator.
This Devil, destinated by the
Almighty for to be a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Valesio's</hi> wickednes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
offereth him
his service, &amp; promiseth him
certainly to procure his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
provided, he would
follow his advice; he then
told him, that the very day
whereon they would bring
him to execution, he would
be present to defend his cause
that he should therfore bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make choice of him for
his advocate, against the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4304:51"/>
of his Host, that he
should know him by his red
Cap, and that he by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
should be by him cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
freed from his innocent
danger. Now it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that when any among
the Cantons of the Switzers,
wil condemn a man to death,
the Senate pronounceth his
sentence in the midst of
the Assembly upon a Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
and giveth permission
to the condemned to make
choise of any of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to defend his cause: this
custome hath beene ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practised, and yet is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
unto this day.</p>
               <p>The day being come, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Criminell should be
punished, he was brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the place of execution,
where an infinite number of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4304:51"/>
people attended him, all of
them being verely perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that this crime (whereof
he was falsly accused) should
be rigourously punished, for
an example to others for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
times: They bring him
on the Scaffold, his Host
being there present, and
pronounce the sentence of
his death, demanding of
him (according unto custom)
whether he had any one in
the Company that would
plead for him; he, in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
plight lookes about
him, and espying the red
Bonnet among the rest. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
(sayes he) my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
speakes sufficiently of
it selfe to justifie my actions,
having alwaies lived honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in good credit, yet
since I may claime the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4304:52"/>
of your custome, I make
choice of him in the red Cap,
whom you may there see, to
justifie me: upon these words
every one looking upon the
Man, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he spake, could
not tell what to imagine, for
he looked not like a Switzer,
either in habit or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
he ascends upon the
Scaffold, causeth the Host
to approach, begins to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the naked truth of the
matter, confronts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
the witnesses, strikes a
feare &amp; terror into the hearts
and consciences of his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
and plainly layes open
the wickednes of <hi>Valesio.</hi> The
people in the meane time
wonder at his boldnesse, and
admire his eloquence, he at
le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth declares the fraud, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it appeare the bags were
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4304:52"/>
ripped: then he brings the
Judges to the Inne, where he
discovers unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place
where they were accustomed
to hide humane flesh; <hi>Valesio</hi>
notwithstanding insisteth on
the contrary, and by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
reasons, indeavours to
palliate his wickednesse, still
affirming that the Merchant
had stollen the said money
from him; the Devill willing
to catch him in his trap, said
unto him, sithence thou assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
with such probabilities
that this innocent is guilty of
death, and that he hath rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
thee, wilt thou on thy
faith sweare that hee hath
done it? The Host presently,
the better to confirme the
justnesse of his accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
said, it was hee alone
which stole away my mony,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4304:53"/>
and if it were not so as I have
affirmed, I wish to God that
the Devill may carry me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
both body and soul; the
Devill without prolonging
the matter, takes upon him a
most horrible shape, snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him up, and carrieth him
away through the midst of
the wide ayre: thus payed he
for treacherosly accusing the
poore innocent, and so inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
massacring those,
who he should have kindly
entertained.</p>
               <p>The Marchant was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
set at liberty, with his
Monies restored unto him,
the Judges desiring pardon
for committing so great an
errour, in so rashly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him; For which, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
no other satisfaction at
his departure, but an Act to

               <p>THat I may recreate your

sad relation, I shal here relate
unto you, a bolde deede and
pleasant History, performed
in the Churchyard of Saint
<hi>Innocents</hi> in <hi>Paris;</hi> the trueth
whereof many of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Marchants can yet
witnesse, and it was in this
manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:4304:54"/>
There was a young Boy
newly arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> who
had associated himselfe with
divers Vagabonds and Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purses,
there did this Boy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
for the space of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
dayes, without doing
any thing that might be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
notorious: at length,
(as every thing hath a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
the assembly of Rogues
resolved, sithence that hee
would be of their society, to
make him free: for in this
trade, it is not as in others,
wherein men must bee first
Scholers, before they be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
or Aprentices, before
they become Freemen: here
is but a word and a blow,
one nip takes a Purse, and
in the subtilty thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
the perfection of the
Trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:4304:54"/>
Now there was one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
who was enjoyned to
take this Boy abroad, and
to appoint him some kinde
of triall, whereby they
might bee assured of his
courage and aptnesse to the
performance of exploits. He
therefore takes forth his
new Comerade, and brings
him from one part of the
Towne to the other, still
expecting an oportunity of
doing mischiefe; at length
being come into the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Saint <hi>Innocent,</hi> they
perceived an old Woman
kneeling on a Tombe,
there praying for the
soules departed; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this old Hang-man told
the Boy, that if he would
become Master of his Trade
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4304:55"/>
and bee of their fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he must with a resolute
subtilty go and cut the old
Womans purse; to whom
the Boy answered, that it
was impossible for him so to
doe without being percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and therefore desired
to goe try in some other
place where there were a
throng of people, that hee
might the better performe
what he intended without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
dange, for that to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
cutting off her purse,
she kneeling by her selfe, there
being store of people in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places of the Church,
which might easily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him, was as hee said,
meere madnesse: but the old
Fox so urged him by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
and threatnings,
that he was at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4304:55"/>
to undertake it;
so the Boy approached
the Tombe, and kneeled
downe close by the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
she (nothing doubting
of the intended roguery, but
contrarywise thinking that
Devotion had brought him
thither) held on in her pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and was not a jot inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in them: Now the
young Rogue was in great
perplexity of minde, not
knowing whether it were
best for him to adventure, or
not; which his guide mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubting
(by reason of his
long stay) came and made a
signe unto him to dispatch;
whereupon, the boy incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the hope of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
free by that exploit, slie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut her Purse; and so with
a slow pace withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4304:56"/>
and being very joyfull
of what he had done, came
unto his guide, who expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
him in the Cloyster:
but when as the old Villane
had look't into the Purse, and
found but little in it, he told
his young Companion, that
he had not yet passed Master
of his art, for that he would
shew him one trick of his
Trade, which he had not yet
learned; whereupon he took
him by the hand, and griping
him fast, cried out unto the
Woman, that that young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
had cut her Purse; the
Woman presently looking
about her, found her strings
there, but her Purse gone: as
soone as the people heard
it, they hastned towards the
Boy; but the newes was no
sooner spread, but the Boy
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4304:56"/>
was gone, yet not so far, but
that whole troopes followed
him, who being overtaken,
was soundly beaten with
Cudgels, every one throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to see the young Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purse;
among others, there
were divers Merchants of
the street, who came out of
their Shops with little Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
by their sides, which
the old Villane taking notice
of, thrust himselfe into the
thickest of the throng, and
there cut off foure or five of
their Pouches: the Merchants
at length perceiving, that
while they were expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the Boy, some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cut their Pouches, which
they wondred at, and well
noating the behaviour of the
old Theefe, they upon the
sudden found him cutting off
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4304:57"/>
another: this made all the
people to forsake the Boy,
and to follow him, by which
meanes the Boy escaped; but
the old Cutpurse was by one
of the nimblest footmen
overtaken, who trusting too
much to the hold which he
had of one of his eares, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him likewise to escape
from him; for this crafty old
Hang-man, having formerly
lost his eares, for some such
mischievous exploit, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
others to be so artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made, that they seemed as
naturall as others: by one
of these was he taken, which
easily comming off, gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of wonder to those
that pursued him; and the
meane while that they stood
wondring at that, he escaped
to the Grove, into a throng
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4304:57"/>
of people, who were there
assembled to see an Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of one who was broken
on the Wheele; from which
place, he carried two Purses
more to his fellowes, where
hee found his young Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purse
much discontented,
that he had so treacherously
dealt with him: Thus passed
this young Boy Master in his
Trade, after he had beene
well beaten, though not so
well as he justly deserved.</p>

               <p>When wee have once lost

lose that which we strictly

exemplified in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
History, of one <hi>Iames,</hi>
who being about the age of
fifteene Yeares, forsook his
Parents (who were too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of his education,) with
a full resolution, to betake
himselfe to a debaucht kinde
of life: and finding a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
stole from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4304:59"/>
a great some of money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and so fled. Not long after
hee enrolled himselfe as a
Souldier, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of a Lord, who at that
time conducted a great Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
(this was in those first
troubles, wherein <hi>France,</hi> for
a time, lost the sweet repose
of peace, by the dissention
of some great Peares in the
State, who were retired from
the Kings service to Canto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
it in divers Provinces of
the Kingdome.) While he
was in the Army, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a thousand insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
and though but little in
age and stature, yet he grew
to that height of wickednes,
that he was therein inferiour
to none. He seldome stayed
long in a place, and where he
remained least, he sometimes
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4304:59"/>
left the greatest marks of his
cruelty: those who suffered
most by him, were poore
Country people: some wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he would cause to be
stretched out before a fire,
and so by scorching and
burning the soles of their
feet, would force them to
confesse where their money
lay: hee would slash and
cut the flesh of others, who
would not suddenly bring
unto him his appointed ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
and would also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ravish those Maids hee
by chance met: he grew so
couragious that no man durst
doe him an affront: for in
foure yeares wherein he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Arrmy, he had slain
five in single combat; who
not being patient enough to
indure his bravadoes) had
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4304:60"/>
challenged him; of which
murthers he soone obtained
remission, (being much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
of some Great ones)
and so escaped unpunished.</p>
               <p>The Army being at length
cashier'd, he was constrain'd
(being never bred to labour)
either to steale, or beg: hee
therefore betook himselfe to
the Forrest of <hi>Senlis,</hi> where
he robbed divers Passengers;
thence hee went as farre as
<hi>Cleremont,</hi> with five or six of
his Companions, who being
armed with Pistols, there
robbed the Waggon of <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens:</hi>
thence he betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
so many thefts, that
he was at length, by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Cutpurses, chosen
Ringleader of their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
he carried himselfe so
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4304:60"/>
subtilly in his affaires, that
his most trusty companions
could never know where his
lodging was; only when they
met together, he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
them a rendivous wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
meet the next day; and
would often punish, and
sometimes stab, those who
the day before had executed
no enterprize of noate. He
would sometimes be clothed
in the habit of a Physitian,
in which he would often go
to the houses of sick persons,
and having noated the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
they should not faile the
next day to finde themselves
robbed: he would hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
sometimes a whole
day together, in a House,
and at night would open
the doores to his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
at other times he would
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4304:61"/>
cause himselfe to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by foure or five Tagrags,
and would hastily come to
the house of some Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
when he thought most of
the houshold servants were
elsewhere imployed, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
earnestly demanded to
speak with him, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor
should no sooner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
but little <hi>Iames</hi> (for
so they called him) would
have a Pistoll at his brest,
and then force him to furnish
him with what money he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>
               <p>He, with two or three of
his Companions, being one
day in the faire S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Germain,</hi>
perceived a certain Atturney
cheapning a silver Basin of a
Goldsmith, who not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the price, put the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
(which hee had offered
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4304:61"/>
downe for payment) into his
pocket; whereupon, little
<hi>Iames</hi> shewing this Atturney
to one of his Comrades com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to dive into the
bottome of his pocket for
that Gudgeon, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they two should
not bee good friends; which
the other refused to doe, as
impossible without eminent
danger; he thereupon called
unto him another, from
whom he received the like
deniall: He seeing that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them would obey his
commands, conceived a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
hatred against them; and
intending shortly to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged,
he said unto them,
You will not undertake this
enterprise, to ease me of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
difficulties, but assure
your selves (if I loose it) you
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4304:62"/>
shall soundly pay for it: he
having thus spoken left
them, and came unto the
Attourney, who was then
bargaining with another
Goldsmith, because he could
not agree on the price with
the first: and finding an
opportunity, by reason of
the throng then about him,
thrust him with such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that his Hat fell to
the ground, which while
the Attourney tooke up, he
gently put his hand into
his Pocket and tooke his
Purse, so that the Attourney
having afterward agreed
with the Goldsmith for
the Basin, found no money
to pay him, which was like
to have caused dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in regard that the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith
would have forced
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4304:62"/>
the Basin on him. Little
<hi>Iames</hi> having thus acted
his part, returned unto his
Companions, and shewed
them the Purse, whereat
they rejoyced, but this their
joy was short: for Little
<hi>Iames</hi> hating them deadly
for their disobedience, led
them to a by-place, called
Mount <hi>Pernassus,</hi> where hee
commanded the one to
stay for him; and having
drawne the other about a
Flight-shot from thence, told
him in great fury, that he
could hardly forbeare to
kill him, whereupon his
Comrade desired to know
the cause of his anger,
and the reason why hee
spoke such words; but Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Iames</hi> perceiving that he
saucily reasoned with him,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4304:63"/>
suddenly drew forth his
Sword and ranne him tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:
thence he came back
to the other, whom he had
commanded to stay for him
on the Mount; but lest his
companion should suspect
any harme or ill intent from
him, he drew neere unto him
with a smiling countenance;
when the other asking him
where his Comrade was, he
snatcht forth a Poniard, and
stabbing him therewith, he
said, behold, there he is, go
thou to him.</p>
               <p>He once killed a begging
Frier; and having taken on
him his habit and Letters of
Order, came unto the Friers
at S. <hi>Vincents,</hi> where he was
by them for the space of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
dayes kindly entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
and being resolved to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4304:63"/>
furnish himselfe before his
departure, he brought with
him from <hi>Paris</hi> divers sorts
of Pick-lock instruments,
with which hee (while the
rest of the Convent, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
midnight (as their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
is) at Mattens,) excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
himselfe for his absence
(as being constrained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to)
by in-disposition of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
pickt open a doore where
their money lay, which hee
having taken away, cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shut the doore and went
to bed: the next day he arose
early, and taking his leave of
the Superiour, returned to
<hi>Paris;</hi> where by his begging
from doore to doore, hee
greatly distressed those that
were of that Order: for when
any of them went forth to
beg provision, they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4304:64"/>
that they were ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
already, and that they
had given it to one of their
fellowes, whereat the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were mightily amazed,
and could not conceive by
any meanes who it was that
so grosly abused them: by
this meanes did Little <hi>Iames</hi>
commit sundry great thefts
within the Citizens houses,
he having free entrance, by
reason of his habit: but it
came to passe at length,
that the Fryers of Saint <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents</hi>
having found out his
arch knavery, desired some
Officers within the City to
search for him; but their
labour was in vaine; untill
it hapned that one of those
Fryers (not long after,)
entring into a certaine house
for an almes, met this <hi>Iames</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:4304:64"/>
comming forth of the same
House; whereupon hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
the Servants to lay
hands on him, which they
did; and having lustily bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
him, were about to have
led him to a Justice: but
by the comming of some
of his Associates, who guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, hee was rescued;
Little <hi>Iames</hi> taking an especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
notice of them, came the
the next morning, (having
changed his habit,) neere
unto the place where those
Servants dwelt, and crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enquires their names,
and the names of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
which having fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
he appointed 2. or
3. of his companions to meet
him at a house not far from
thence, at w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> time he wrote
this Letter unto one of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4304:65"/>
Lackeys which had beaten
him, whose name was <hi>Francis

               <p>Having sealed this Letter,
he directs one of his young
Cut-purses unto the house
where this <hi>Maire</hi> dwelt; who
having received it, failed not
to come with his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
where being arrived, he
was informed that his father
was gone into the City, and
had left command for them
to goe to Breakfast, and not
to stay for him: They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
being earnestly intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to sit down, did; but they
had not sate long, before lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<hi>Iames</hi> entred and saluted
them, but they at first knew
him not, untill he withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4304:66"/>
himselfe into an inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roome,
presently came forth
in his Fryers habit; then
were the Lackyes in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
perplexity, and would
have forsaken the Table; but
Little <hi>Iames</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
suddenly seazed on
them, and stripping them
naked, he first lashed them
with Stirrop-leathers; then
with a more then barbarous
cruelty, caused their skins
to bee gashed, and after,
(they being all bloudy) hee
put them into a great Tub of
feathers, where they had
little ease; nothing could
their cryes availe them, by
reason that the House stood
in a by-place, farre from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
common resort; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having done them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other injuries, hee at
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4304:66"/>
mid-night sent them away
feathered like so many
Fowle; and immediately he
and his company forsooke
the house.</p>
               <p>Having discoursed of the
manner of his Life, let us
come now unto his Death;
and see, whether it bee as
tragick, as the actions of his
life did prognosticate. The
fame of this notorious Theef
augmented daily in <hi>Paris,</hi>
and twenty Leagues round
there about; so that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost
thought it a part of
his duty to make diligent
search after him, hee gives
strict order therefore to his
Troopes deligently to give
attendance, with whom hee
made a Rode towards the
Forrest of <hi>Fountaine-bleau,</hi>
it being the common place
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4304:67"/>
where he lurked: but the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
of little <hi>Iames</hi> deceived
him; for he having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of it, disguising him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
like a country Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
passed through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of them, and came to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
without being knowne:
but in vaine escapes he who
drawes his punishment after
him. For he being one day
in a Tennis Court, was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
noated by some of the
Provosts men, who were
going to play, which excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
daunted him: yet
without seeming to feare or
suspect any thing, he passed
by them; but the Officers
presently following him,
saw him enter into a house
where a yong Wench dwelt,
whom he had debaucht, and
and at that time maintained:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4304:67"/>
whereupon, they besetting
the house, and one of them
knocking at the doore, hee
himselfe came to the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and demanded their
businesse, (although hee too
well knew their intent:) the
Officers, without using many
words, began to break open
the doore; when little <hi>Iames</hi>
on the other side, arming
himselfe with a fierce resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
foreseeing that he could
not escape death, resolved to
sell his life at a deare rate,
and to that end he barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed
himselfe within the
house, turning the Table and
Stooles topsie turvie against
the doore.</p>
               <p>The newes being spread
that little <hi>Iames</hi> was within
the house, made diverse peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
flock together to see the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4304:68"/>
issue; among others, many
of the Guard hastned thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and endeavoured by
Ladders to enter through the
Window; but Little <hi>Iames</hi>
having charged two Pistols
and two Muskets with them,
watching his opportunity,
when their thoughts were at
the highest, humbled eleven
of them to the ground: his
Wench at the same time
charging as fast as hee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged:
and by that last of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
testified the greatnesse
of her courage and affection.
As for him he was so anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with rage and dispaire,
that he often thrust out his
head at the Window, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to hasten his assured
death, by the honourable
blow of some Musket, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escape
the dis-honour of the
Gallowes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:4304:68"/>
The people assembled more
and more, and about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
persons had now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed
the House, armed
with Muskets, Pikes, and
Halberds: little <hi>Iames,</hi> after
he had discharged divers shot,
at last fell into a scarcity of
Bullets, which being percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
some mounted upon the
Ladders, whilst others broke
open the doores: every one
admired the desperate stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of this Theefe, in resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so many people: but hee
resisted in vain, for his houre
was then come; yet would
he not for a long time yeeld
himselfe, but would have
killed himselfe, had not his
Wench hindred him: at
length, the multitude entring
he was forced to yeeld to the
fury of the people, who
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4304:69"/>
drag'd him to prison, where
hee lay not long before hee
was condemned to bee bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
on the Wheele.</p>
               <p>The day of his death being
spread abroad, caused a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of people to be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in the place of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
every one wondring to
see one so yong to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated
halfe so many vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies.
Some pittied his
youth; others rejoyced to
see him cut off so timely: as
for me, I must confesse I was
not a jot moved with pitty,
but was glad to see him pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts.
Behold here, the Life
and death of this notorious
Rogue; whereby it may be
considered, how much it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooves
Parents to chastise
their children in their youth,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:4304:69"/>
and not to suffer them to live
in too great a liberty.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Story of Pallioly and
his Choake-peare.</head>
               <p>WE may compare youth
to a young twigge,
whose tendernesse yeelds to
the least motion, and is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bended either to the right
or left hand; being made
fruitful or barren, according
to the industry or negligence
of the Owner. So is it with
youth, if he once findes the
path of vertue by the care of
his Parents, he may be made
continue and increase in the
same: but contrary acts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
contrary effects: and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4304:70"/>
wee cannot expect a greater
comfort and joy from those
that are vertuous, then sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and griefe from those
that continue in a vicious
course of life. I would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
advise all Parents and
Guardians, to be exceeding
carefull and wary in the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of their Children; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
to beware of the
poyson of ill example; not
suffering them to frequent
the company of such as are
debaucht: for we naturally
follow, with eagernes, those
actions which we see autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
by former presidents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pallioly</hi> was a pretty well
favoured youth, a fit lodging
to entertaine vertue, as no
doubt he would have done,
had not the over fond affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his Father, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4304:70"/>
him to make choice of
those courses which are most
opposite to vertue, and best
pleasing our sensuall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
and inclination. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
was such that had he
beene trained up vertuously,
his wisdome might have
made him as famous as his
wit, wrongly imployed, hath
now made him infamous: he
was borne neere unto <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse,</hi>
where he remained not
long, but out of a vaine curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity,
and curious vanity, he
first (forsaking his earthly
father, that hee might the
better forget his heavenly,)
betook himselfe towards <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
where he abode not long,
before his riot and excesse
had wholly emptied his
Purse of coyne; and his wits
being quickned by necessity,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4304:71"/>
he studied to supply his want
by this following device.
Hee first makes a paire of
hands of Wax, and fastens
them to his shoulders so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially,
that he could when
he pleased put them through
his Cloak: with these hee
goes to the Church of S. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric,</hi>
where he understood
that a great concourse of
people would that day be,
by reason of a learned Man
that then intended to preach:
being come into the Church,
hee espies a Gentlewoman
with a silver Watch by her
side, who was praying in the
body of the Church among
many others, who every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
expected the Preachers
comming out of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell:
by her he kneeles, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
a Book on these his arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4304:71"/>
hands, and seemes to
fix his eyes on both: The
Gentlewoman wonders at
his rudenesse, in comming so
neere her, and conceives it
to be only want of breeding
in him: she casts her eyes on
him, and sees him with a
Book in his hand and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
modesty permitted her
to look, but not too earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to gaze on him; she there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without mistrust holds
on her devotion, and he his;
she hers to God, and he his
to the Devill, as appeared by
the sequell; for while she at
the elevation of the Host
bowes downe to the ground,
and in humility kisseth it, he
nips off the Watch; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
likewise hypocritically
kissed the ground, departed.</p>
               <p>Not long after, he goes to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4304:72"/>
a Smith of his acquaintance,
a very skilfull man in his
Trade, and one wholly at his
beck, and gives him instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
how to make a kinde of
Instrument, in the likenesse
of a little Bowle; which by
the helpe of small springs
within it, might open and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
it selfe; so that being
clapt into a mans mouth it
could not be removed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Key purposely made
to that end: this being fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
according to his minde,
and brought unto him, he
termed a Choke-peare; he
might have termed it a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
Peare, for never was
there a worse tasted fruit.
<hi>Eridas</hi> a rich Citizen, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
about the Royall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
was the first who
made triall how hard this
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4304:72"/>
Peare was of digestion; for
<hi>Pallioly</hi> knowing, by common
report, that he was rich,
chose out his opportunity
when all his houshold ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
were busied in country
affaires, and none at home
with him but one Lackey;
and then being accompanied
with three or foure such
spend-thrifs, as himselfe, he
came to the house, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desired to speake with
<hi>Eridas;</hi> the Lackey suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them to have been Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of worth, by reason
of their decent apparell,
went unto his Master, and
told him that there were
some Gentlemen below that
desired to speake with him:
but <hi>Eridas</hi> comming unto
them, and desiring to know
their pleasure, was taken
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4304:73"/>
aside by <hi>Pallioly,</hi> who in no
lesse brief then rough terms,
told him, that they were
poore Souldiers pinched by
poverty, whose wants must
be releeved by his excesse,
that it was needlesse for him
to endeavour resistance, for
nothing should satisfie him
but money, and of that, no
small quantity: <hi>Eridas</hi> (who
loved his money as his life,
and nothing so well as his
life but money, being loth to
lose either, and fearing the
losse of both,) began to cry
for helpe; but at the instant
one of them griping him by
the throat, made him so gape
for breath, that it was no
hard matter for the other to
give him the Peare; which
being entred, his mouth ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
so wide, that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4304:73"/>
by reason of sharp points
of iron which were on each
side of the Peare, to gape as
wide (in expectation of ease)
as possibly he could. Thus
remained poore <hi>Eridas</hi> like a
Statue, not being able to
speak a word, or expresse his
griefe, but by signes, whiles
they having taken the Keyes
out of his pocket, furnished
themselves with money, and
so departed. <hi>Eridas</hi> being
rid of his guests, would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
be rid of his torment
to: he to that end goes unto
his neighbours with a wide
mouth, &amp; endeavours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
by his signes, what he
was not able to utter in
words: they are ready to
laugh at his action, before
they know the cause of his
sorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but finding by his
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4304:74"/>
signes and other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in what intollerable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he then was, they seeke
to excuse their former igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his paine, by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
endeavouring his ease:
but when neither their Will,
or Art, could invent a means
to ease him, there comes a
Porter with a Letter (and
therein a small Key inclosed)
written to this effect:</p>

               <p>Not long after, he tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:4304:74"/>
with him a youth (that
was not as then become free,
nor throughly experienced
in his profession) and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him to the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
where he perceived a
plaine Countrey-fellow sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in a corner of the street,
compassed about with divers
pots, whereof some were full
of rare Fruits, and others
emptied by sale: <hi>Pallioly</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of it, and espying
the fellows purse, indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
well stufft, hanging about
his neck and put into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
he commands the Boy
to fetch him that purse if he
would be admitted as free of
his Society: the Boy thinkes
the purse is in too safe keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him to compasse it,
he therefore flatly refuseth
to fetch it, as a thing impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:4304:75"/>
to be done, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perceived; whereupon
<hi>Pallioly</hi> bids him learne of
him, and without farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
goes to the fellow, and
tels him some thorn had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
in betweene his shirt and
his back, and desired his help
to pull it out, for that it much
troubled him, and so bowed
himselfe downewards; the
country man in the meane
time puts his hand in at his
choller, and while he seekes
to finde the straw that so
troubled him, <hi>Pallioly</hi> cuts
his Purse, and takes his leave
with thanks.</p>
               <p>The Boy being encouraged
by his good successe, shortly
after endeavoured the like
exploit; but being caught in
the action, was so soundly
beaten, that hee was scarce
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:4304:75"/>
able to returne home: at

divers the like thefts,
was constrained, for safety of
his life, to flye his country;
and after a long exile, was
killed with a Musket-shot,
being too good a punishment
for his many mischiefs.</p>

               <head type="sub">The wicked Servant.</head>
               <p>IN the City of Paris there
dwelt a Citizen named
<hi>Melander,</hi> a man both honest
and rich; two qualities sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
meeting in one and the
same person: amongst other
good qualities wherein hee
excelled, he was a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect,
and much sought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4304:76"/>
for his skill therein: This
man had a servant which was
married named <hi>Alexis,</hi> a rude
and surely fellow, whom his
master <hi>Melander,</hi> for the
space of six yeres, retained in
his service, in regard of his
skill in the same Art: The
great love and favour which
his master bare towards him,
puffed him with the wind of
pride and Ambition, which
did so powerfully reign in
him, that despising the due
respect wherein he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
towards his master, he
contrived his ruine in this
manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melander</hi> had a house neer
<hi>Paris,</hi> wherein he sometimes
recreated himselfe for the
space of sixe weekes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<hi>Alexis</hi> who was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
and had many children,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4304:76"/>
mooved with a covetous
desire, resolved to rob his
Master of what was most
precious in it: but as often
as this thought presented it
selfe, so often did he reject it,
because hee knew not how,
safely to contrive the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so bold and bloody
an enterprize, untill that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
by the Devills entise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
associated himself with
some of the most notorious
Rogues in <hi>Paris,</hi> he intreated
them to meet at a place by
him appointed, where hee
would open unto them a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that might conduce both
to their owne profit and his:
These Rogues hearing him
thus speake, promised not to
faile meeting him at the time
and place appointed; where
meeting to the number of 5,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4304:77"/>
(one whereof was a Tapster,
another a Mason, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
three neerely allyed)
They being set at dinner, and
having drunk till their brains
were well heated, <hi>Alexis</hi> thus
began to discover unto them
his intended plot, saying;
Sirs, I have a Master both
rich and wealthy, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
seeing that we are
poore, we may finde a means
by him to raise our fortunes,
by secretly murthering him
and seazing on his goods and
money: these words being
heard by his Companions,
some approved his councell,
others disliked it; but at last
it was concluded betweene
them, that <hi>Alexis</hi> should bee
chiefe conductor in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
as being best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
in the house, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:4304:77"/>
that the other five should o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
what hee commanded:
whereupon one of the five,
upon the set day, brought a
Boat down the River to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
away the booty (for the
House of <hi>Melander</hi> was sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
neere the River) and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it to the bankside; hee
came by night with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
led by <hi>Alexis</hi> to the
said house of <hi>Melander,</hi> who
was at that time there, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the time of Vintage.</p>
               <p>When they were all come
to the doore, <hi>Alexis</hi> knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and the servant (in regard
it was late) demanded who
was there, but hearing <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi>
answer, and knowing his
voice, shee misdoubting no
cause of feare, presently ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it; yet was she much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
when she saw five o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4304:78"/>
enter with him at so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
a time. No soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
were they entred but
they killed this servant, not
giving her so much time as
to crave helpe either of God
or man.</p>
               <p>They having thus begun,
<hi>Alexis</hi> in a furious haste lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them up into a Chamber,
where <hi>Melander</hi> meets them,
and demands of <hi>Alexis</hi> what
furie had so farr transported
him as to make such a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacking
of his house; To
which <hi>Alexis</hi> (having his
eyes and eares shut from the
respect which he owed unto
his Master) answered, that he
was resolved to kill him, and
that therefore he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
himselfe to God:
<hi>Melander</hi> in this extremity
knew not what to doe, but
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4304:78"/>
being resolved, in his old
age, to sell his life to them at
a deare rate, he suddenly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to seize upon an
Halbert which was at his
beds head; but <hi>Alexis</hi> with
his Companions, to prevent
it, rushed upon him, and gave
him 20. or 30. blows with
Clubs, wherewith they dasht
out his brains: behold these
barbarous cruelties commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by a servant; yet that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
followeth seemes inhumane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melander</hi> brought with him
into the same house one of
his daughters, exceeding fair,
to looke unto his houshold-affaires:
this maid was mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageable,
and might have been
well matched, had not the
cruelty of these Rogues cut
the threed of her life: Shee
lay in the next Chamber
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4304:79"/>
to that of <hi>Melander,</hi> when
hearing the out-cry of her
Father, she hid her selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the bed and the wall,
thinking so to avoid her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
death: <hi>Alexis</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
(who was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with every corner
of the House,) having slaine
<hi>Melander,</hi> came into the maids
chamber, and having espied
her, commanded his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
to draw her forth,
who held her whilest he like
a bruit beast, ravisht her; and
not content with this, hee
caused his Companions to
doe the like. To expresse
this action fully, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
meanes she made,
seeing her selfe brought into
this so miserable estate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the Pen of one more
eloquent. These her lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4304:79"/>
might have broken
an heart of Adamant, but it
was so farre from molifying
of theirs, that they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
yet further; for without
compassion of her tender age,
beauty, or Sex, they there
bereaved her of her life.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Alexis</hi> being thus
master of the House, caused
the doors to be barricadoed,
and so fell to ransaking and
rifling the whole house, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
themselvs to be gone
the next night: they spent
the next day in jollity and
mirth; but night being come,
they having loaded the Boat
with the best housholdstuffe,
and themselves with money,
in all, to the value of two
thousand pounds, they about
midnight departed, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perceived of any; which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:4304:80"/>
made <hi>Alexis</hi> confident of his
safety: but God, who seeth
both things past, things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and things to come,
would not permit so impious
an act to scape undiscovered;
it being in vaine for humane
wisdome to thinke to avoide
the irrevocable Decree of
the Almighty.</p>
               <p>Two dayes passed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was no news of <hi>Melander,</hi>
the Vine-dressers wondred
to find no body at his house,
which made one of them goe
to <hi>Paris</hi> to see whether hee
were not there; where meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Alexis</hi> (who now
lay rioting and swaggering
in Taverns) he asked him for
his Master, at which demand
he seem'd to wonder, saying,
That hee supposed to have
found him at his Countrey-house,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:4304:80"/>
and as if he had been
much troubled at the news;
he suddenly forsook his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and hastened towards
the house of <hi>Melander,</hi> where
he with foure or five others
(having for a long time
knocked at the doore, and
no body answering) broke
into the house, where, upon
their first entrance, they
found the maid (stretched
forth) dead upon the floore,
whereat they were amazed,
but <hi>Alexis</hi> chiefly seemed to
take on, crying out that there
had been theeves in the
house: thence they ascended
up into the chamber, where
they found <hi>Melander</hi> likewise
murdered: Then did <hi>Alexis</hi>
fall down and kisse the corps
of his dead master; saying,
Alas, alas, What doe mine
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:4304:81"/>
eyes behold! Is it you my
deare master that are so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
murdered, whilest I
by my too long absence
could not yeeld thee suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour?
Ah miserable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<hi>Alexis,</hi> How great
is this dayes losse? Thou
hast lost all thy support and
fortune, on which thou hast
grounded the anchor of thy
hopes; thou hast lost that
which thou hast most affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
and to be short, thou
hast lost thy most kinde and
dearly beloved master. O
God, thou revenger of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
punish this crime, and
suffer not the authours to lie
concealed. He spake this
with so cunning a dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that those who were
present, seeing his Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles-teares,
beleeved that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:4304:81"/>
those bewailing lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
proceeded from his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
love, and extreme affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Then searching the
rest of the chambers, they
found the poore daughter of
<hi>Melander</hi> likewise massacred,
whereat he again powred
forth a torrent of teares, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
the standers by that
his griefes were much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by this wofull spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle.</p>
               <p>The bruit and rumour of
this massacre was quickly
spread abroad, which caused
a great concourse of people
to come see so bloudy and
seldome heard of tragedie:
<hi>Alexis</hi> in the meane time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
in the house as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the same; receives all
those that come to see it, and
by his unusuall sadnesse, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:4304:82"/>
to cloke his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
and to make it an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of his fidelity; but
some wiser then others, pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
further into this busines,
began not onely to doubt of
his fidelity, but secretly see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to accuse him to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of the murder; some
said that those teares were
but fained, and that so many
sobs and sighs in a meere ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
no way allied unto him,
could not proceed but from
a deep dissimulation: others
excused him, and said, that
<hi>Alexis</hi> having for a long time
been in the service of <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
with hope by him to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his fortune, had just cause
exceedingly to grieve at
this losse so disadvantagious
to his good; but among all,
some pleaded so strongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:4304:82"/>
him, that he was by
their advice seized upon and
imprisoned; at which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much astonished, called
the heavens to be witnesses,
and revengers of their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie;
vowing that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the least thought of so
barbarous a cruelty; but they
notwithstanding having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
him, prepared his
enditement, and made dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
enquiry where and how
he had spent the last two
dayes; but the murderers had
so secretly managed their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
that no man could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
any thing against them,
God onely and their own
consciences accusing them,
so that the prisoner was for
that time set at liberty.</p>
               <p>He was no sooner dismist,
but he began to blaze abroad
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4304:83"/>
his innocencie, and accuse
them who had imprisoned
him of injustice: six moneths
were already past wherein
this crime was as it were
smothered in silence, and
buried in oblivion, and the
murderers were confident
that it would be no more
questioned; but they were
much deceived in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
for not long after, foure
of the said murderers (which
were the Father, sonne, sonne
in law, and a Mason, as we
have said) met in a certain
village neere <hi>Paris,</hi> and being
willing to renew their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
leagues, they went to the
next Taverne, where they
began to carouse and be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
but as they were in the
midst of their mirth, there
came ten or twelve of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:4304:83"/>
Marshalls men, who being
wearied (with some pursuit
which they had made) came
by chance to refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the same place; and
being entred, they put off
their coats, meaning to sit
down at the end of the same
table; then the marks of their
office appearing, put these
cruell confederates in such a
feare, as if a thunderbolt had
fallen among them; and all
their bold mirth is now tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into whispering, and
their joy into sorrow, they
are hungry but cannot eat,
and a cold trembling so pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth
them thorowout, that
they seeme rather dead then
alive, imagining these men
pursued no other but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>These officers called for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:4304:84"/>
wine, and intended onely
their owne recreation, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
nothing against them;
but they much wondred that
upon the sudden those that
sate neere them had taken
their flight, and left their
wine and meat on the table,
departing without paying
the shot. All which the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
well noting, demanded
of the Host, what was the
cause of their sudden flight;
to which the Host said, that
he could not chuse but much
wonder thereat, and told
them what kinde of people
they were, and how well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with money, being
formerly very poore and
needy people.</p>
               <p>Then the officers consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together, and concluded
that there was something
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:4304:84"/>
more then ordinary in the
matter, and that these men
(their consciences accusing
them of some offence by
them committed) and fearing
them as officers, had taken
their flight, and that it was
requisite they should be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued;
which being resolved
on, they presently put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution:
and parting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
some one way, and
some another, by their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and speed overtook
them, they then stayed them
in the Kings Name, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
them to confesse
the cause of their flight, they
told them that if they would
not by fair meanes, they
would constraine them by
force, and thereupon took
the eldest of them and gave
him the Strapado, which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:4304:85"/>
made the old fellow quickly
confesse that they had all
foure deserved death, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the murdering of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander:</hi>
at the which his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
grew inraged, he
with the rest having before
resolved to endure all the
tortures that could be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
upon them, rather then
they would confesse: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
the said old man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that he had been the
cause of the deaths of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
persons, whom he at
severall times taking into his
barge, under pretence of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them over the River,
had tied stones about their
necks, and having so drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them, at night took them
up, and so stripped them: he
moreover related unto them,
that he had one day most
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:4304:85"/>
wickedly killed a boy about
the age of seventeen yeers,
who had no more then
twelve pence about him, and
that of all the thefts and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
he had committed, he
had never grieved but for
that, as being the cause of the
death of one of the most
comely and hopefull young
men that ever he saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexis</hi> having notice of
their taking, (for it is to be
noted, that of foure which
were pursued, one escaped,
and advised <hi>Alexis</hi> and his
companion, who was a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to take their flight) <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xis</hi>
fled into <hi>England,</hi> and the
Mason into <hi>Touraine,</hi> where
we will anon overtake them.
The officers having thus
done their devoire, led the
offenders unto <hi>Paris,</hi> where
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:4304:86"/>
they were condemned first
to have their hands cut off,
and their bodies to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
on the wheele before the
house of <hi>Melander,</hi> which was
performed in the sight of a
multitude of people.</p>
               <p>One of those (which were
thus broken) confessed, that
he was accustomed in the
woods neer <hi>Paris,</hi> to strangle
the passengers with a cord,
which he for that purpose
carried about him; and that
when any demanded of him
whither he went, he would
answer, he went to buy a calf,
shewing unto them the cord.</p>
               <p>We will now return to our
Renegadoes; he which was
at <hi>Tours,</hi> having escaped the
danger which threatned him,
had changed his name, and
lived by his trade, being
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:4304:86"/>
welcome among others of
the same profession in those
parts, by reason of his great
skill therein: he being at
length become amorous of a
young maid in the countrey,
by the consent of her parents
married her: Behold him at
the height of his desires;
but yet so troubled in his
conscience, that he could not
rest, for the bloud of those
innocent souls, which he had
shed, ceased not to cry for
vengeance: but the mischiefs
which troubled him, happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
chiefly, in that he (either
in malice or jollity) so char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Cod-peece-point of
one of his neighbours, that
he could not make use of his
own wife, which being done,
he came about three or foure
dayes after unto the married
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:4304:87"/>
man, and told him that he
partly knew that his point
had been knit with a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
knot, and that if he
would give him a reasonable
reward, he would untie it:
The man who desired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then to be freed
of this infirmity, yet without
thinking that the Mason had
charmed it, promised to give
him twenty shillings in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and twenty shillings
more when he was eased
thereof; of he received the
twenty shillings, and his
neighbour being cured, he
demanded of him the other
twenty shillings according
to promise; who then called
him Sorcerer, and told him
that he was a Witch, and had
bewitched him, and deserved
to be burnt; the Mason not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:4304:87"/>
being able to beare such lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
called him in question
for scandalizing his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Judges having seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
considered the matter,
by a common consent agreed
that hee was the sole cause
whence proceeded this evill;
which being after a sort
prooved (for that about ten
dayes after the marriage, the
said Mason had publikely
bragged unto some that hee
had done it, which was proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
against him) he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to be whipt through
the Market-place and then
banished; which to avoid,
he presently appeales to the
Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> whither
he was sent, and where hee
found his death: The time
being come wherein he must
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:4304:88"/>
be recompensed according
to his merit; for being come
to <hi>Paris,</hi> he is heard of by
some of the inhabitants of
the said Village, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
gave notice and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
the heires of <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
who so eagerly pursued
him, that by the deposition
of the former witnesses, he
was forced to confesse the
deed, and so was judged to
the same punishment as his
companions, which last Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
was done, in the yeere
1616. five yeeres after the
murder of <hi>Melander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There remaines now one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Alexis</hi> who passing by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
it happened (as theeves
cannot forbeare misdoing)
that he entred the house of a
rich Merchant, and stole
from him a great summe of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:4304:88"/>
money, while he was at
Masse: he is thereupon taken,
and condemned to be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Thus were they (by the
Divine justice) deservedly
put to death, who so cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had murdered <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>

                  <hi>Colyrias</hi> was of such a gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
humor, that he resolved
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:4304:89"/>
(without his Vncles consent)
to make a Voyage towards
<hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
pilfred from his Vncle
a round sum of money, and
therewith privily departed:
He had not sojourned there
long, but he was taken with
a desire of seeing <hi>Paris,</hi> but
before he arived there, hee
took up his lodging in a
Town, seated upon the <hi>Loire,</hi>
at an Inne, the Host where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
prooved a meere Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throat:
here <hi>Colyrias</hi> with
two others, by him acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
met, having supped
together, were conducted
all to one Chamber where
were three Beds; every one
makes choise of his owne,
and having lockt the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
doore, they all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
them to their rest:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:4304:90"/>
But the Host having a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
doore which entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same chamber, about
midnight, when he thought
that a deepe sleepe had sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
upon their senses, soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entred, and comming
into their chamber approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
their beds; <hi>Colyrias</hi>
being by chance awake,
saw them passing along the
midst of the chamber, and
at length staying at the
next bed, which made him
jealous that they had some
attempt against their lives:
hee therefore began by
snorting, to make shew
that hee was in a deepe
sleepe, although hee were
indeed much perplexed with
the apprehension of an ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mischiefe.</p>
               <p>The Host having visited
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:4304:90"/>
the bed of his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
came and handled
his flesh also; and having
so done, hee heard them
say, that his flesh was but
tough, and that the other
two would proove dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
meat, they then went
to the others beds, and (like
bloudy miscreants) misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
killed the companions
of <hi>Colyrias;</hi> whereat hee
was so amazed, that hee
knew not what course to
take, for hee expected the
same entertainment, as had
his poore companions; yet
beyond his thought was the
Host more mercifull to him,
then unto the others, for
having disposed of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of his companions, he
came unto him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken away from him
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4304:91"/>
his moneys, which amounted
to twenty pounds and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
causing him to arise,
he conducted him thorow a
gallery, wherein he had
made a trap, in the forme of
a draw-bridge, which by the
meanes of a barre of iron fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
under, it would rise
and fall with the least
weight that came upon it;
<hi>Colyrias</hi> being come upon it,
immediatly fell down into
an unfrequented street, where
while he with teares lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his hard misfortunes,
two theeves perceiving him,
demanded of him the cause
of his complaints, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he declared unto them all
his former accidents, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they answered, that ill
fortune indeed had given
him just cause of sorrow; but
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:4304:91"/>
that patience ought to serve
him as a buckler against so
many miseries; and that they
so much pitied him, that if
he would he should partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of their better fortunes:
upon this promise he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them, little thinking
that he had fallen out of the
frying pan into the fire; but
being come into the next
street, they there for a time
stayed, expecting an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to take some booty,
they then going up another
street, came unto a well,
where one of them, desirous
to quench his thirst, found
that the buckets were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which made him intreat
<hi>Colyrias</hi> to descend into the
well for water; but he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they would play
some scurvy trick with him,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:4304:92"/>
at first refused; yet at length,
constrained by their earnest
intreaties, he adventured it:
he was no sooner down, but
the watch appeared in sight
of his companions, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they forsaking the rope
by which <hi>Colyrias</hi> held, fled;
so that had it not been that
<hi>Colyrias</hi> had taken footing
upon a stone, which jutted
forth of the side of the well,
he had there perished: as
soon as the watch came unto
the well, one of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
being desirous likewise
to quench his thirst (it being
in the heat of Summer) think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the bucket had been
in the bottome of the water,
began to draw at the rope;
<hi>Colyrias</hi> (thinking that his
companions had drawn) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their promise,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:4304:92"/>
seazing upon the rope, was
by little and little lifted up;
but he finding the weight
heavier then was usuall,
called unto his companions
for help; saying, That sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there was something
more then water in the buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket;
at length, by their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
forces, they drew up
<hi>Colyrias;</hi> when they saw
him appear at the top of
the Well, they being ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
ranne away as if the
Devill had been at their
heels, so suddenly loosing
their hold of the rope,
that if he had not cast his
hand quickly upon the
mouth of the Well, he
could not have escaped
the danger of tumbling in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>It happened that about
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:4304:93"/>
four or five dayes before the
arrivall of <hi>Colyrias,</hi> that the
Bishop of the Diocesse being
dead, was buried with a Ring
and rich Crosier staff in the
presence of these his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
which made them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desire by some plot or
other to steal them: and to
that end desired the assistance
of <hi>Colyrias,</hi> whereunto,
though unwilling, he was
constrained to give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
they then came unto the
Church door, which being
opened by Picklocks, they
entred, shewing him the
Tombe, and threatening him
with death if he refused to go
in, or failed to bring unto
them the Ring and Crosier:
whereupon, they having
with iron-crows, and other
instruments, lifted up the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:4304:93"/>
stone of the vault, he entred;
and putting his hands upon
the Coffin, pulled up the
planck that covered him, and
taking the Crosier and Ring
away, he came unto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and told them, that
as for the Crosier, he had
brought it; but as for the
Ring, it was not to be found
in the Coffin; thinking by
this means to keep the Ring
for himself: but they, who
had been at the Bishops Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
and knew assuredly
that the Ring was inclosed
in the Coffin, so threatened
<hi>Colyrias,</hi> that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to go into the Vault
the second time; where, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
as if he searched far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and having told them,
that certainly it was not
there, they forthwith let fall
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:4304:94"/>
the stone, and buried him
in the sepulchre with the
Corps of the dead Bishop;
<hi>Colyrias</hi> had already escaped
two imminent dangers, but
now thought assuredly, he
should never escape the
third, but that he should pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in the vault.</p>
               <p>Whilest he was in this
great perplexitie, there came
two Priests, who being pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with the sacrilegious
desire of robbing the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
sepulchre, lifted up
the stone, and one of them
being about to enter, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrias</hi>
caught hold of his
legs, who imagining that
the dead Bishop was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and had caught him
by the legs, being filled with
fear and amazement, he
strived to withdraw his legs,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4304:94"/>
and so drew our <hi>Colyrias,</hi>
who imagining his conceit,
ranne after him to the place
where he entred, and got
forth, and having escaped
out of the Church, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
out of the town with
the Ring, that was worth
two hundred crowns, so
that he returned home with
some recompence for the
many dangers and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that he had already suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>

               <p>IN the yeer 1615. there
was in the town of <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi>
a young man whose

forsook his Parents by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of some private quarrels

                  <hi>Germain,</hi> with whom he
kept company untill they

Letter, wished to have been
so fortunate, as to have
found it; whereunto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
answered, that if he
had a liking unto the chain,
he should have it upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
tearms, what it cost
appeareth by the Letter, and
therefore in regard it was
not fit for his wearing, he
would part with it for the
one half that it cost: at
length <hi>Dorilis</hi> after some ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
gave him ten crowns
for it.</p>
               <p>This first encounter was
but a forewarning of his
future mishap; He never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
not suspecting any
deceit, blessed the houre
wherein hee lighted upon
this good fortune: not long
after, as hee was passing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:4304:97"/>
thorow the Faire, he espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some gamesters playing at
Dice, whereupon he drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, and desired to
bee halfe with one of them
that played, whereby hee
quickly gained a Noble; this
provoked <hi>Dorilis</hi> to play for
himselfe, thinking thereby to
better his fortune: but these
two Cheaters (who had at
the beginning fained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be strangers one to
the other) having perceived
that he setled himself to
play, handled their false
Dice so cunningly, that they
suddenly gained from him
three pounds, and had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt got more, if the
earnest desire of seeing the
Faire had not withdrawne
him. Thence <hi>Dorilis</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
farther into the Fair,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:4304:97"/>
when he (according to his
rude custome) gazing about
him, espied a Lottery; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he drew neer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the Adventurers; where
being noted by some Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who had complotted
with the Master to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to gain when they
would, he was by one of
them intreated to participate
with him in this Adventure,
which after <hi>Dorilis</hi> (fearing
again to be cheated) refused,
upon this answer, the Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having drawn, openeth
the Billet, and findeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a silver Bason; which he
having received of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Lottery, shewed
to <hi>Dorilis,</hi> reproaching him
for refusing to be halfes with
him in the Lot, and so to
have gained the one half of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:4304:98"/>
the Ewer, whereupon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
induced by this mans ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
gain, begins to draw
Lots, and ceased not untill
he had emptied his purse of
twentie crowns, and yet
received not the worth of
twentie pence, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all this, he was not
any whit dejected, being
confident that his Gold
chain would make him a
saver.</p>
               <p>After he had beene in
divers parts of <hi>Paris,</hi> and
had seene all that which
was most worthy of note
in the city, he returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Inne, where he no
sooner entred, but he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that he had lost his
purse: then did the long
way which he had to go, the
hazards of sicknesse which
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:4304:98"/>
he might fall into, and a
thousand other misfortunes
came into his minde, yet
did the finding of his chain
in the other pocket, in part
qualifie the extremity of his
griefe, but Fortune had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated
him more crosses:
For as he was in the Inne
bemoaning his misfortunes,
a Cheater, that was in the
next chamber, hearing him,
came, and seeming to pitie
him, perswaded him by any
meanes not to suffer griefe
to have the predomination;
telling him that teares were
but in vaine, since they
could not redeem that which
was already lost, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to him if occasion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the assistance both of his
purse and person; and using
many other good words,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:4304:99"/>
perswaded <hi>Dorilis</hi> to Suppe
with him, which hee condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
unto; so that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
being ended, when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that he who had invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him would have paid for
his Supper, he upon the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
found his friend depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(who under pretence of
going to make water had left
him) and having long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
his returne in vaine,
his former losses made him
jealous of his Cloke, which
he searching for found want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Now was his onely
hope in his chaine of Gold;
but that being offered as a
Gage for his expences, was
rejected as counterfeit: then
was hee wholly oppressed
with sorrow, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
just cause, for he on the
morrow was constrained to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4304:99"/>
exchange his rich apparell
for farre meaner, thereby to
discharge his former expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which made him (like
the prodigall sonne) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
home something wiser,
but farre poorer then when
he forsooke his father.</p>

               <p>IN the Country of <hi>Burgoin</hi>
there lived one named <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigny,</hi>
who from his youth
made a practise of Theeving,
for which he had been often

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:4304:100"/>
goe unto <hi>Paris,</hi> where hee
thought hee might with

there, he committed so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

became dreadfull to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
and their whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
was of his notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

walkes being in the
night, and those that did
see him, did little think that
he whom they saw, was the
man of whom they so much
talked.</p>
               <p>One day being desirous
to put one of his inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in practise, He being
like a Tradesman apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
came unto a rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
named <hi>Syriander,</hi> and
told him that he understood
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:4304:100"/>
that he returned much ware
into the Countie of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi>
to one Master <hi>Vernon,</hi> a
man with whom hee was
well acquainted; wherefore
he (having fained that hee
had a Trunk full of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
to send to the same
man) signified that he should
be much obliged unto him,
if hee would bee pleased to
convay his also thither,
whereunto this Merchant
(little mistrusting his quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
condiscended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rapignus</hi> having thus farre
proceeded, caused a Trunk
to bee brought unto him so
cunningly contrived, that it
might bee easily unlocked
by one within; he therefore
causeth a little boy (an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
in his theeving
trade) to be put within it, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:4304:101"/>
having charged him upon
his life not to speake or make
any noise in the Trunk, but
about mid-night to come
foorth, and having opened
the shop doores, to give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
to his companions,
he locked him therein; and
having so done, he caused
this Trunk to be brought to
the house of <hi>Syriander,</hi> who
not doubting of what was
inclosed therein, received it,
and placed it in his shop.</p>
               <p>Evening was already past,
and night, the favourer of
theeves, had with her black
mantle overspread the earth,
when this young Boy (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
by the quietnesse of
all things, that the houshold
servants were long before
retired, and therefore in all
likelihood in a deep sleep)
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:4304:101"/>
gently opened the Trunk
wherein he was inclosed, but
comming to the door found
not the key therein as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
at which being much
perplexed, he was about to
give over his enterprize, and
to retire into his shell; but
he at length bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of opening the shop win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
which he performed
with much dexterity, none
awaking at the noise; and
having let in his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who there attended him,
every one furnished himself
with a parcell of the best
wares in the shop, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
The theft was soon

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:4304:102"/>
casket of Rings, and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
which he much desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the fingering of, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
barren a long time of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
invention, whereby he
might gain it, at last he went
unto a Joyner, to whom hee
gave directions for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a casket like unto
that which the Goldsmith
had; which being made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his minde, he one
day having perceived that
there was at that time in the
house but one servant, and a
little boy, son to the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith,
entred into the shop
carrying this Box under his
cloke; when he came in, he
desired them to shew him
choice of Rings, whereupon
the patern of this new casket
was presently fetcht, but he
perceiving that he could not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4304:103"/>
easily bring to passe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
project whilest that
both of them were in the
shop, he delivered the boy a
piece of gold to change, and
in the mean time causing the
Box to be opened, he chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
the Rings; and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to mislike of the price,
he desireth the servant to
shew him others, but whilest
he turned his back to fetch
them, this fellow taking his
opportunity, suddenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
Boxes, putting his
Box in the place of the other;
then faining that he could
not tarry to look upon the
other Rings, in regard he
promised to give a friend the
meeting where he knew he
was by that time expected;
he desired the Apprentice to
keep the money (which the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:4304:103"/>
other was not yet come
with) till he came again, and
so departed: But he joyned
not long in this cheat, but
within fifteen dayes after
was taken, and had no doubt
at that time been executed,
had he not had some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
means to escape;
as thus, he sent a boy to one
in the city, an Abettour of
his stollen goods, to entreat
him that he would make for
him an Hare-Pie, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
him at the eating of it,
which he (mindfull of his
former familiarity) perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and having brought it to
the Jayle, where his friend
was, did there sup with him
&amp; the Jaylor. Having supped,
his friend called him aside,
and told him that the cause
of bespeaking this Pie, was
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4304:104"/>
to prevent any mistrust
which the Jayler might have
had, had he not seen this;
he having so said, proceeded
to a second request, which
was to work his delivery out
of this place, by a plot
which hee would suggest;
whereunto this Citizen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
his best endeavour,
he signified unto him that
the only way for his escape,
was by sending unto him
another Pie made like the
former, where in stead of
flesh, should put a long rope,
and some Picklock instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
which being made,
and sent according to his
appointment, he opened it,
and taking forth the things
inclosed, made so good use
of them, that hee the same
night escaped; but having
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:4304:104"/>
escaped, hee was the same
night apprehended, for a
robbery suddenly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after his departure out of
prison, and being brought to
the same place, was shortly
after, for this and his former
robberies, executed.</p>

               <p>A Certain Gentleman of

came to <hi>Paris</hi> about
the dispatch of some busines
of importance, which he had
at Court; and had brought
with him store of moneys, as
well to discharge the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
of his journey, as

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:4304:105"/>
being arrived, another gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of his Countrey sent
unto him, by an expresse
messenger, to intreat him
that he would be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of a great suit which he
had then depending in the
great Chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Morindor,</hi> who would not
disoblige his friend, tooke
this cause in hand; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he were somewhat
hindered by his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

ceased not to solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
in his friends behalfe:
but whilest he passed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
thorow the Palace,
and that he thus sollicited,
both for his own and friends
right, he was perceived by
two Cutpurses, who resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
among themselves, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the first opportunity, to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:4304:105"/>
shew him a trick of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;
and to that end, they
divers times drew neer him,
but durst not adventure, a
hand into his pocket, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that he knowing that the
Palace was alwayes frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by such a base crew, was
very circumspect to avoid
all such mischievous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents:
but the subtilty and
sleight of these Cutpurses,
surpassing his care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
he was at length sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised,
for he being one day
in a throng in the great
Chamber, was rudely thrust
by these fellowes, and while
hee looked about to see
whence that thrusting and
violent motion proceeded,
one of them thrust his hand
into his pocket, and stole
thence his purse, which hee
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:4304:106"/>
knew not till two houres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when he (intending to
have paid for some bookes,
which he had bought in the
Gallerie of Booke-sellers)
missed it; but could not on the
sudden guesse at what time
hee was so robbed by them,
what in this case to doe hee
knew not; nature had indued
him with more wit then to
chafe &amp; fume at that he could
not remedy, or by impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for loosing a little, to
injure him who gave him all.</p>
               <p>At last (he being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the craftinesse
of the times) he resolved to be
revenged, wherfore he being
willing to requite them,
went to a Smith, of whom he
bespake a springe to put into
his pocket which might shut
of it selfe, and suddenly
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:4304:106"/>
catch whatsoever touched
it: The Smith, being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
experienced in his
Art, made him one of the
fairest, and most ingenious
pieces that could be devised,
and that with such Art and
cunning, that it far exceeded
the manner of <hi>Morindors</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
who having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
the Smith, caused it to
be placed in the same pocket
from whence his purse was
stollen; &amp; having so done, he
walked in the Palace foure
dayes, but on the fift day, he
viewing the portraictures of
the kings which are upon the
Pillars in the Hall, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the same cutpurse;
who incouraged by the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his first purchase, he
resolved to adventure again,
then drawing neere to him,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:4304:107"/>
and watching his time when
the people came thronging
upon him out of the great
Chamber, he gently put his
hand into his pocket, but it
no sooner entred, but this
spring disbanded, so that
where he thought to take, he
was taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Morindor,</hi> who felt the
springe disband, seemed
not to take notice of the
Cutpurse, but began to take
his walke from the one side
of the Hall unto the other,
thence into the great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
the Galleries of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and so about; the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purse
(though unwilling)
was forced to follow him
foot by foot, for hee could
not withdraw himselfe hee
was so straitly fastened in
the springe; sometime <hi>Morin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:4304:107"/>
taking a short turne,
would suddenly thrust away
the Cutpurse, as though he
came too neere him; then
did the other, with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
countenance, entreat him
not to disgrace him further,
but to accept of some indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
satisfaction from him.
To which <hi>Morindor</hi> seeming
deafe, continued on his
walke, so that it was not
long before that many of the
Palace perceived it, who
gladly flocked together to
see him led after that sort.
At length, <hi>Morindor</hi> having
for a long time walked from
place to place, and by the
shortnes of his turns lengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the pains of the Cutpurse:
Hee turned himselfe, and
with a cholericke visage said
unto him, What makes you

follow me step by step Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Theefe? It was you Sir
that stole away my purse,
and you shall deerly answer
it: At these words the other
fell on his knees, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
pardon, faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to restore it, if hee
would release him; but <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindor</hi>
would not take words
for deeds, but kept the Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purse
thus shamefully impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,
untill his Purse was
brought unto him by one of
the theeves Comrades, who
had thither accompanied
him: Thus was the deceiver

a notable Cutpurse.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>AMboise la Forge</hi> was
brought up in <hi>Picardie,</hi>
and as he increased in yeers,
so did he in wickednesse; he
began with Pins, and ended
with Pounds, which had
weighed him downe to hell,
had not his present repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and temporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by Gods mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the eternall, which
we charitably conceive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as the one halfe of his
life was spent in evill, so the
the other half was worn out
in punishment; The one you
shall see in the beginning, the
other in the end of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
History.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:4304:109"/>
This young fellow being
past his childish tricks, as
stealing Pins, Points, and the
like, begins his youthfull
pranks thus:</p>
               <p>He goes one night to a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
house, and there (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
formerly noted where
his Poultry usually roosted)
steales a Turkey, two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
&amp; foure Pullets; which
he having conveyed away
(by his Companion in evill)
he the same night breakes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
a Bakers shop, furnisheth
himselfe with a sufficiency of
Bread; and afterwards, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by a Taverne, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Grates of the
Cellar to be large, made shift
to wreath himselfe in, where
having found three or foure
good Flaggons, he fills them
with Wine, and having made
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:4304:109"/>
himself frollike, refills them:
The next morning hee goes
early unto this Farmor, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
and Vintner, and kindly
invites them to dinner, they
wonder at his free entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and wish each of them,
that what they had lost the
last night had been there
likewise, as more fitting for
their bellies then for those
Rogues that stole it: On that
condition, replyed <hi>Amboise,</hi>
you would (I beleeve) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them their riot; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they cheerefully answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
with all their hearts; but
(said one of them) farewell
it, what we have lost there,
wee have gained here: Tis
true indeed (said <hi>Amboise)</hi>
for what I stole from each of
you, your selves have among
you eaten, which I wish may
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:4304:110"/>
do you much good: at which
words, each of them tooke
the more especiall notice, of
what they were entertained
with; and the Farmer found
that he had the like Poultrie,
as he that night had lost, and
the Baker the like bread, and
the Vintner the like wine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in in the like Pots; all
which being considered, they
found that his words were in
earnest, and so they tooke
them; for they suddenly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
would have forsaken
the room, in the heat of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
but he perswades them
that they could not eat their
meat in better company, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
therein the young
Greek, who having perceived
particular notice that his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
had lost the battell,
came into the market-place,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:4304:110"/>
and proclamed that they had
got the victory, upon which
false rumor, he caused among
the citizens a publike joy for
three dayes, but when the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
newes of their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
was brought by some
souldiers, fled from the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
every one was ready to
kill this false messenger, who
had caused them to be filled
with joy, in a time when they
had just cause to be drowned
in tears and sorrows: but he
answered them, that they had
more cause to thanke him,
then to murmure against him,
because that he had changed
their cause of discomfort, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
comfort, and their mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into a publike rejoycing.</p>
               <p>But this first exploit of
youth, was nothing in respect
of what he did after, for it
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:4304:111"/>
was not long before he came
to one of the fairest women
of the Parish, and sought ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
to entice her to lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
but what he could not
by faire words effect, hee at
last obtained upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of twenty Crownes,
which he (as then being not
able to give) compassed by
this meanes: He goes spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to a rich Churle of the
Parish, and desired to know
of him, whether hee could
help him to five Crownes in
Gold for Silver; whereunto
he answered, That he had so
much, but was loath to part
with it: whereupon <hi>la <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
promised him two shillings
on condition that hee would
bring it to his lodging, and
let him have it in exchange
for as much Silver as it came
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:4304:111"/>
unto: This Clowne (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the gaine which hee
should make by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change)
condiscended to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>la Forge</hi> unto his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
where the money being
told out on a Table before
two others of <hi>la Forge</hi> his
Society, he suddenly takes it
up, and casts down an acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of five Crownes in lieu
of it, and having so done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted;
The Country-fellow
followed him and demanded
his money, but <hi>la Forge</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That he owed him
long since that money, and
that now paying it, hee had
given him an acquittance for
his discharge, and desired to
know what he would have
more. By this meanes he got
the five Crownes, and by
those Crowns he attained e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:4304:112"/>
to the glutting of his
lustfull desires, for it was not
long before he grew willing
to surrender up that costly
place to another; yet it vexed
him that he had parted with
his mony on so light termes;
and bethinkes himselfe on a
course how he might regain
his 5 crowns so ill bestowed;
to that end, he comes to his
Lemman, &amp; told her he was
pursued (for a small debt) by
a company of Sergeants, and
that he should be constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
either to pawne, or sell, a
cloake worth foure or five
pounds, unlesse she would
furnish him with five or six
crowns; he signifies, that if
shee would assist him, hee
would leave his cloke, and
ever rest indebted unto her:
she conceiving that she could
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:4304:112"/>
not possibly loose any thing
by the lending him the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
as long as she had so
good a pawne; wished him
to bring his cloke, and hee
should not fail to receive the
money, both which was
done accordingly. <hi>La Forge</hi>
soone after had notice that
this Gossip had invited some
of her friends, lately mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
to a feast; thither hee
comes, and desires the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of this dainty dame, to
help him to a cloke which
his wife had borrowed for
him when he went to the
wedding of his invited
guests; The good man of the
house answered, hee heard
not of it, and for his part he
had no use of it if his wife
had borrowed it: hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
asketh his wife whether
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:4304:113"/>
she had borrowed any such
cloke for him, or not, which
she (suspecting that he meant
to cheat her of her cloke and
money) flatly denied even in
his presence, whereat <hi>la Forge</hi>
being inraged, deeply swore
that she had it, and therefore
desired him that he would
be pleased to looke in her
trunke, and hee made no
doubt, but that hee should
there finde it: the good man
being amazed at the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the theefe, went and
looked in her trunke accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his desire, and there
found to his great discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and her disgrace, what
he there looked for; the
greatnesse of which discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
in the presence of her
best friends, so grieved, that
she pined away with extreme
griefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:4304:113"/>
After this he goes towards
<hi>Paris,</hi> and by the way overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a young Scholer going
thither to see his friends, he
discoursed with him until he
came to the corner of a great
wood; then he resolutely
told him, that either he must
part with his suit of clothes
or his life; the poore young
man soone made his choice,
and quickly gave his clothes
that he might after live to
enjoy others; so this our ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scall
entered into <hi>Paris</hi> all
new, where he was not long,
but by reason of his many
bold, and impudent prancks,
he was thought fit to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
Captaine, or Ringleader
of the infamously famous
crew of Cutpurses, Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and the like; the which
place that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:4304:114"/>
seeme to deserve, he took
upon him to cheat, or by
some other way to surprize,
one <hi>Messager,</hi> a crafty fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
who could never bee
circumvented by any; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that divers of his
predecessours had endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the hazard of their
necks, and some with their
lives to have done it. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heard of the warinesse
of this fellow, began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
with himselfe, that he
was not to be surprised by
any ordinary way, wherfore
setting his wits on the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-hookes,
hee at length o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verreached
him thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>La Forge</hi> understanding that
this <hi>Messager</hi> was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
daily to go over the
new Bridge, he came thither
very well apparelled, &amp; long
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:4304:114"/>
expected his comming; at
length hee perceived him
viewing the Samaritane, and
the little garden below it,
whereupon he tooke occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to give him the Bonjour,
and to entertaine him with
other discourses concerning
the affairs of the time; <hi>Messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
nothing suspecting him,
because of his rich apparell,
as they were in talke, there
draws neer unto them, one of
<hi>la Forges</hi> companions, being
very well acoutred, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
himself on the other side
of <hi>Messager. La Forge</hi> seeing
his companion come (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whom he hoped not to
effect any thing) casts his
eyes downe towards the
river, and wisheth them
to take notice what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
strong Boate there
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:4304:115"/>
was that did not sinke with
such an extreme weight of
iron, his companion who
stood on the other side of
<hi>Messager,</hi> said unto him, I pray
pardon me sir, if I say that
you have a bad eye-sight, for
you mistake wood for iron,
that Boat is laden with Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
and not with Iron; for
it is impossible that it should
beare so much Iron and not
sinke: Sir (answered <hi>la Forge)</hi>
I thanke God, my sight is
very good, and I know that
there are some Boats laden
with Faggots, Billets, or the
like; but that Boat which
I point at with my finger,
being the second Boat from
the banke, is laden with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
and I dare lay a good
wager that that which I say
is true.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:4304:115"/>
                  <hi>Messager,</hi> who saw plainly
that the Boat was laden with
Wood, was silent, yet smiled
to himselfe at so great a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
little dreaming where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
their contestation ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>At length their contention
grew so hot, that they seem'd
like to have fallen from
words to blowes; in the end
it came to a wager of ten
Crownes, which was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
into the hands of <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sager,</hi>
untill it were decided
by a neerer view; They ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so done, call unto them
the Boat-man and enquire of
him wherewith his Boat was
laden? hee answeres, with
Wood: but <hi>la Forge,</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to cover his intent, would
not beleeve the Boat-man,
but would passe from Boat to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:4304:116"/>
Boate (the better to colour
his intent) by touching that
which was the subject of his
wager; which having done,
he confessed that he had lost,
and seemed wonderfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
at his so great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take;
the other laughing and
winking on <hi>Messager,</hi> told <hi>la
Forge,</hi> that being he had won
his money, he would bestow
a Breakfast on him if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to accept of it: which
motion being embraced by
<hi>la Forge,</hi> they both intreat
<hi>Messager</hi> his companie, in
regard that he was present at
the Wager; which he at first
refused, excusing himselfe
by reason of some businesse
of importance that he had to
dispatch in the City; but at
last they perswade him to go
with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:4304:116"/>
They then enter into one
of the most noted Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
bespeake dinner, and
whiles it is preparing, drinke
healths at his cost that won
the wager; at last, towards
the latter end of dinner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Peare and the
Cheese, the other Cheater
began to challenge <hi>la Forge,</hi>
to play with him three casts
at dice for the worth of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
breakfast, but <hi>la Forge</hi>
refused it, as having no great
skill in gaming, but wished
<hi>Messager</hi> to have a bout with
him, which he likewise refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
This their plot not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
according to their
expectation, <hi>la Forge</hi> signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
unto <hi>Messager,</hi> that hee
was to goe within two dayes
towards <hi>Lyons,</hi> and was well
provided of moneys for his
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:4304:117"/>
journey, but that it was in sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which weighed heavily,
and would prove trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
in his journey; he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
therefore to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he could change 10. or
12<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. of silver into gold, and
offered him 2<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. for the
change; <hi>Messager</hi> considering
the promised gaine, told him
he should have his desire, and
presently drew forth a little
bag which he had in his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
and begun to tell out his
money at the end of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
whilst <hi>la Forge</hi> counts his
at the other end; at length
the ten pounds being ready
told, <hi>Messager</hi> came and told
him that the money was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
told, and desired his in
exchange; <hi>la Forge</hi> telleth
the silver over againe, to
see whether there was the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:4304:117"/>
full summe, or any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus;
and watching his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
drawes together
likewise the others gold,
in the meane while that
the other Cheater heapes
up his money, and drawes
three Dice out of his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
saying, that hee had
wonne all; <hi>la Forge</hi> his
companion cryes out, by
my faith it was a brave
cast; other Cheaters, who
by <hi>la Forge</hi> his appointment
were in the next Chamber,
inquire concerning the cast,
and asked whether <hi>la Forge</hi>
had played, who present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
protested, and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
swore, that hee had
gained ten pounds at one
cast; MESSAGER stands
as mute as a Statue, and
being much amazed knew
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:4304:118"/>
not what to say; but seeing
them seaze on his money, he
began to cry out that they
were theeves; the Host ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
to the cry, but <hi>la Forge</hi>
and his companions tell him,
that it is bootlesse to cry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hee had lost his money,
for if that he had been afraid
of loosing it, he should not
have hazarded it; thus would
they have forced <hi>Messager</hi> to
beleeve that he had lost his
money at dice, when it was
at Noddie; neither could his
words, or other meanes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
for want of competent
witnesse, what they had in
possession could never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
from them. This <hi>la
Forge</hi> within one fortnight
after this feat, was taken by
the Marshalls men, and for
this, and other the like
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:4304:118"/>
cheats and robberies, was
condemned for ever to the
Gallies.</p>

with those who first brought

tells him that he came from

good and bad newes, the bad
newes consisting in the death
of his brother <hi>Francis,</hi> for
whom hee could not but
grieve: the good, in that he
had made him his Heire and
Overseer of his whole Will.
The Merchant hearing this
newes was much afflicted
for the death of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whom hee dearly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:4304:119"/>

friend, said hee to <hi>Mutio,</hi>
Have you no letter for me?
How came you to heare this

to tell you the truth, I came
late yesternight into the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
without as much as one

to pawne my dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet,
wherein was sowed a

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:4304:120"/>
by reason of my weary jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney)
hindred mee that hee

               <p>The Merchant having read
this Letter, communicates it
to his wife, who being of a
covetous disposition, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
shee were without
children, conceived more joy
at the wealth fallen to her
and her husband, then sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for her brothers death;
wherefore she kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
him that brought the
newes, which made <hi>Mutio</hi>
hope well for a happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of his enterprise: for he
was resolved, that if he were
admitted to lodg in the house
he would open the door unto
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:4304:121"/>
his companions, and so make
them way to take thence
what they thought fit, as he
afterwards did: for hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
entertained within the
house, did in the night
open the shop window, and
cast forth a good piece of
cloth to his companions, and
having so done, did on the
morrow hasten to bee pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
but it happened, that
before hee was either gone,
or discovered, that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
wife grew very sicke,
which made <hi>Mutio</hi> quickly
conceive, that this her sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
would slacken her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
voyage, he therefore
returns to <hi>Chartres</hi> to use the
same cheat to the Merchants
brother, as he had done to
the Merchant himselfe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being come, hee wrote
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:4304:122"/>

and signifying that he was
his brothers servant, presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him the Letter; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
whereof, being by him
read, wonderfully grieved
him, for that he dearly loved
this his brother, and for his
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:4304:123"/>
sake kindly entertained this
his pretended servant: Hee
and his mother prepare
themselves mourning ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell,
and dispose and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their affaires at home, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their intended journey
to <hi>Paris,</hi> whither hee and
his mother are now resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to goe: in the meane
time <hi>Mutio</hi> is not idle, but
watching his opportunity,
(whiles most of the house
were at Church, and the rest
not suspecting him) pilfereth
two or three rich Diamonds
out of a small Casket, which
he (being his Crafts-master)
so neately closed againe, that
it could not be suddenly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
               <p>To conclude, hee framed
such a simple and harmelesse
countenance, and thereto
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:4304:123"/>
used so naturall a behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in his demeanour, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that both he and his
mother take their journeys
towards <hi>Paris;</hi> the one to
proove the Will, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to confort her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolate
daughter: so that
now there are two severall
men parted from severall
places, and going to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
places about one and
the same cause, both of
them enjoying their perfect
health, both each by other
thought to bee dead, and
both of them building Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
in the aire, with the
conceited wealth left by
the one unto the other:
neither of them as yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the cunning theft of
<hi>Mutio.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:4304:124"/>
It was not long after the
departure of <hi>Mutio</hi> out of
<hi>Paris,</hi> before the wife of
<hi>Charles Destampes,</hi> began to
recover; her husband there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
begins his intended
journey toward <hi>Chartres,</hi> to
settle his brothers affaires,
whiles he likewise was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
toward <hi>Paris:</hi> Now it
happened, that he (being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
better horsed, or setting
forth sooner then his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
came with his mother
unto an Inne being in the
mid-way betweene both
places; and because they
were very weary, they there
tooke up their lodging; and
having supped, went into
two severall beds in the
same chamber; <hi>Charles</hi> on the
other side comming from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
somewhat late into the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:4304:124"/>
same village, and inquiring
for the best Inne, was dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to the very same place;
where hee having supped,
was brought into Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
thorow which he (that
had occasion to go to or fro
thorow his brothers Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
must of necessity passe.</p>
               <p>It happened, that this man
about midnight, heard his
brother speake unto his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(for there was but a thin
wainscot partition betweene
them) so that it was easie for
him to heare what they said;
the voice hee heard, made
him apprehend that it was
surely his brothers spirit;
but afterward considering
that it might be some other
that had the like voice, hee
blowes out the candle, and
resolves to settle himselfe to
sleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:4304:125"/>
About an houre after, the
younger brother who lay in
the other Chamber, being
troubled with the Squerte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
called up the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine
to bring him a Candle,
which being come, hee takes
his Cloke and passeth close
by the bed where his brother
lay, talking by the way unto
the Chamberlaine; his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
awakes at the noise, and
began to be in a terrible fear,
for now he thought he heard
him speake more distinctly,
and saw a glimpse of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.
The other holds on
his way, but in his returne
towards his Chamber, hee
became so curious, as with
his Candle to take a more
full view of him that lay so
neere him, who opening his
eyes knew his countenance,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:4304:125"/>
and shrinkes under the cloths
that he might no more bee
troubled with his sight, for
his whole body trembled by
reason of his extream feare.</p>
               <p>Young <hi>D'estampes</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
to see his brother
there whom hee certainely
held for dead, let fall the
Candle and ran away as fast
as his legs could carry him;
he hath the same conceit that
his brother hath, and thinkes
that he saw, to bee his Spirit,
so that both of them were
wonderfully troubled at
their strange visions: the
young man tells his mother
what he had seen; she being as
other women, of a weak spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
confirmed his opinion by
telling him, that he had left
some vow unperformed, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
was the cause that his Spirit
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:4304:126"/>
walked; so that the extremity
of feare presenting divers
objects to their thoughts,
they continued all night wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
in great perplexity;
at length, day appearing, the
elder brother ariseth first,
and dresseth himselfe in his
mourning apparell, the
younger likewise forsakes
his bed at the same time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both dressed, this man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
the door thinking to go
downe, and there to inquire
of the Host who it was that
lay in the adjoyning Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but seeing his brother
in his mourning clothes, hee
amazedly retired; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being no lesse afraid,
goes downe, and having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
who they were that
lay in the inner Chamber,
he was answered, that they
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:4304:126"/>
were of <hi>Chartres,</hi> &amp; that they
were one man and one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
then began he to take
courage, thinking it might be
that the newes of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
death was false; but
then he wondred why (if it
were his brother) he should
mourne: To conclude, the
Host interposing betweene
both parties, the two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
came and imbraced
each other, greatly wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at so strange an accident;
Each of them relate unto the
other the roguerie of <hi>Mutio,</hi>
in delivering fained letters:
so having spent together
some time in mirth, each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to his owne home;
where the one found that
<hi>Mutio</hi> his fingers had bin bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
among his jewels, and the
other among his best stuffes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:4304:127"/>
This fellow shortly after
was taken in the company
of some Cutpurses, and for
his villanies being found
guilty; first burned with the
Kings marke, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

melanchollie humours from
him, but to small purpose;
how ever, I hope that your
advice, and holy admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
will more effectually
worke upon his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
You may bring him hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(said the Frier) I will
use my best endeavours to
settle his minde; this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
out of a drynesse of
the braine, caused by his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:4304:129"/>
and extreame griefe:
Upon these words <hi>Maillard</hi>
returnes, being very glad
that hee had laid his nets
so handsomely to catch the
first Partridge: hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
returns unto his Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades,
and certifies them of
his plot and purpose: the
next morning very early, he
takes one of his companions
with him, being clothed in
the habit of a Priest, goes
unto the Exchange bridge,
and there cheapeneth a silver
Chalice which was worth
eight pounds: The Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith
doubted nothing of
the deceit, supposing that
his companion being like a
Priest should have payed
him for it; they having
agreed upon the price, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illard</hi>
desires him to send it
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:4304:129"/>
by his man along with them
to the Covent of <hi>Cordeliers,</hi>
and that there he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his money; they thence
went strait to the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi>
about nine of the clocke in
the morning, and by the
way entertained the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths
man with so good
discourse, that hee never
dreamed ought of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
deceit: Being come to
the gate, <hi>Maillard</hi> seeming
to be well acquainted with
the house, rang the Bell, and
demanded to speake with
such a Father; the Porter
answered that hee was at
Church with a Gentleman:
Sir, then said he to the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith,
you may leave the
Plate with the Porter, whilst
we goe heare Masse, and as
soone as it is done, you shall
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:4304:130"/>
receive your money; to the
which he being willing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
it to <hi>Maillards</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
who gave it to the
Porter; so they went into
the Vestry, where the Frier
was putting on his Cope to
say Masse, <hi>Maillard</hi> taking
his opportunity, steps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and tells him that
that was his brother of
whom hee had spoken the
day before.</p>
               <p>The Frier dreaming no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the deceit, turnes to
the Goldsmith, my friend,
saith hee, have a little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
till Masse be ended, and
I will satisfie you.</p>
               <p>The Goldsmith imagining
that he should certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
money after Masse,
was content to stay and
take his place in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:4304:130"/>
whither <hi>Maillard</hi> and
his Comerade bare him
company till the time of
offering: But not being
willing to let goe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
occasion, hee whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Goldsmith in the
eare, that they would goe
before to the next Taverne
(which they named) to
drinke a quart of wine, and
there they would expect his
company: content (quoth
the Goldsmith) and so they
parted. The Goldsmith yet
doubted not of any deceit,
or fraud, in their discourse,
or carriage, but thought it
sufficient that hee had the
Friers words for his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and that hee had
seene the Plate delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of the Porter of
the Covent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:4304:131"/>
                  <hi>Maillard</hi> (meane while)
comes with his Comerade
unto the Porter, and askes
for the Chalice which hee
had left with him, faining
that he would goe say Masse
in a Chappel neer adjoyning,
at the request of some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
ones, as the manner is in
<hi>Paris:</hi> The Porter beleeving
that according to the usuall
custome hee would goe say
Masse, delivered him the
Chalice, who immediately
departed, and being out at
the gate, you may conceive,
they lost little time in going,
for they were not troubled
with the Gout.</p>
               <p>The Frier (the mean while)
who knew nothing of the
deceit, having said Masse,
came into the Vestrie, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Goldsmith follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:4304:131"/>
him pricking his ears like
an Hare, and preparing his
Bag and Gold-weights to
receive money for his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
to whom the good Frier
(drawing him aside) began
this discourse.</p>
               <p>My friend (saith he) is it
long since your wife died,
and that you have been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with this malady? for I
must know the cause and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
thereof, that I may
the better apply a Remedy.</p>
               <p>What wife (said the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith)
I am not married,
this is not the matter that
brought me hither: I know
well (said the Frier) that you
are not married, for then you
would soone have forgot
your former wife, and it
is not likely, being you
bare her so great affection,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:4304:132"/>
that you would so soon seeke
a new one, but it is good to
know the time since she died,
that I may the better ease
you of your griefe.</p>
               <p>But Sir (said the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith)
I suppose you take me
for some other, I have no
Wife, neither yet intend to
have one; I come onely for
to receive money that is due
unto me: My friend, said the
Frier, I knew very well you
would demand money, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
I doubt not but
to restore you to your perfect
minde: Have you beene at
Confession since you percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
your selfe troubled with
this disease? Have you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
your conscience from
the evill deeds you have
done, by Confession and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?
for sometimes
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:4304:132"/>
God doth afflict us for our
sinnes and offences; excuse
me if I search so narrowly
into your affairs, it is not but
for your good. Sir, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Goldsmith, excuse me
if I must needs say one of us
wants his sences, and is not
in his right minde; I have
nothing to do with your Tale
of a Cock and a Bull, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
eight pounds which
you are to pay me, or deliver
my ware again, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all these crafry shifts
and mockeries.</p>
               <p>Have patience my friend
(said the Frier) I will do my
best to give you content, but
what I say unto you is for
your good, you ought not to
be so Cholerick; and to tell
you my minde in few words,
I think it most necessary that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:4304:133"/>
you first seeke remedy for
your Soul, and after, that you
take Physicke to cure your
Body; for all these violent
passions proceed from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition
and drynes of the
Braine. You pay me fairely
said the Goldsmith, Is this
the money that you mean to
give me? Good Sir, either
pay me my 8<hi rend="sup">l</hi> which we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
for, or else restore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me my Chalice; It is not
reason that you should detain
my masters goods, and fobb
me off with an idle discourse.</p>
               <p>The Frier all this while not
discerning any signe or token
of distraction in him, began
to suspect some deceit; and to
this, the absence of <hi>Maillard</hi>
added more cause of suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Of what Chalice speake
you, said he, have you given
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:4304:133"/>
me a Chalice? I demand mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
(answered the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith)
for the Chalice, for
which you sent two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to whom you spake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Masse; the price agreed
upon was 8<hi rend="sup">l</hi> wee have left it
with the Porter to deliver to
you; if you desire a further
proofe you may speake with
the Porter himselfe, or send
for those that came with me,
they are not farre off, for
they stay for me at the next
Taverne, where I promised
to come unto them.</p>
               <p>The Frier hearing this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
began to change his
tune. It is true (said hee)
that he which came halfe an
houre agoe unto me, came
also unto me yesterday, and
certified me that hee had a
brother much troubled in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:4304:134"/>
minde, because of the losse
of his Wife, whom hee so
dearely loved, that he began
(through griefe and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly)
to bee besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
often imagining that he
saw her and talked to her
Ghost; and that I would do
a worke of Charity to use my
endeavour to settle him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in his right minde:
Wherefore I crave pardon
for this my frivilous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
for I supposed you to
bee the man of whom hee
spake; but as for the Chalice
of which you speak, I know
nothing of it, perhaps hee
took me for the Guardian of
<hi>Compeigne</hi> who much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
me; you may do well to
goe to him, I will goe along
with you to him: Whither
being come, the Guardian an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:4304:134"/>
that hee knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the businesse, and
that for his part he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
no order to any to buy a
Chalice.</p>
               <p>The Goldsmith at this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to doubt of the deceit,
and goes unto the Porter to
demand his Chalice; who
answers him, that it was true
they delivered one unto him
while they went to Masse,
but the Priest who delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it unto him, had taken
it to go say Masse, and that
questionlesse he should finde
him in some Chappell neere
thereabouts: Whereupon,
all in a rage, hee began to
threaten the Porter to sue
him: but hee told him, hee
could not any way hurt him,
for that he had delivered it
to him that gave it into his
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:4304:135"/>
hand: After many angry
words had past betweene
them, the Goldsmith was
constrained to goe search a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
in the Taverne and
Chappels neere adjoyning,
to finde out either the Priest
or his Companion; but hee
might as well search for a
needle in a bottle of Hay, for
at last he returns home with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either Chalice or money.</p>
               <p>Hereby may yong Novices
take warning to beware how
they trust to outward shews,
lest they dearely pay for it in
the end.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Maillard</hi> came cleere
off with his Cup worth eight
pounds, of whom you shall
yet heare related further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of deceit; that being
forewarned, you may bee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
against the like dangers
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:4304:135"/>
to avoyd them: whereof one
is as followeth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maillard</hi> having shared his
former prey, and soone spent
his part, (according to the
vulgar proverb, <hi>Lightly come,
lightly goe,)</hi> was againe driven
to his shifts, but resolved to
play at small game rather
then sit out. And having
learned that a Citizen of
Saint <hi>Anthonies</hi> street had a
Farme at a place called <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
not very farre from
<hi>Paris:</hi> he goes thither, and
learnes divers particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
as the name of the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and his servants, &amp;c.
Now he returns to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
gives notice to his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
of his intended plot:
and having chosen his time,
apparells himselfe in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of an husbandman, and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:4304:136"/>
taking a Goad in his hand,
as if hee were some brave
Carter in a leatherne jacket,
comes unto the Citizen, and
after a clownish manner, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes
him with these words;
God give you good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
sir, I thinke your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
does not know me, it is
but eight dayes since I came
to live with your Farmer,
<hi>Martin Clare,</hi> at <hi>Turon:</hi> but
alas, sir; a shrewd misfortune
hath befallen us: The Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
and his wife being much
troubled with these words,
began to feare that the house
was burnt, or the Farmer
dead, or some bad accident
had happened; and hastily
demands what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Sir, answered <hi>Maillard,</hi>
a sad mischance happened
unto us; as your Farmer and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:4304:136"/>
my self were coming to <hi>Paris</hi>
with a Cart laden with Corn
to sell, as ill hap would, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the bad way, my
Master got up upon the Cart,
but as we came to the end of
the Towne, beyond Saint
<hi>Martins</hi> in the suburbs, one
of the wheeles brake, so that
my Master falling, hath
broke his leg quite asunder;
this accident hath much
troubled me; but making a
vertue of necessity, I was
forced to take one of my
horses, &amp; to carry him to the
Bone-setters neere S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi>
Crosse, the whilest I got
his sonne to looke to the
Cart; and having given
order to have two new
wheeles made, meane while
my master sent me hither to
intreat your Worship that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:4304:137"/>
you would bee pleased to
come unto him, for he is in
great danger.</p>
               <p>The Citizen hearing this
sad news rose up, shewing by
his lookes that he was much
grieved for this sorrowfull
mischance, his wife also
seemed much troubled, and
would have beene content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have gone with her
husband to see him; but
he was unwilling, and goes
himselfe along with this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Carter, talking with
him (as hee went) about his
lands at the Farme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Maillard</hi> so satisfied him,
that hee thought him to bee
an honest and understanding
fellow.</p>
               <p>But as they came neere to
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Martins,</hi> and were turning
into S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Honore</hi> street, <hi>Maillard</hi>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:4304:137"/>
began to give him just in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
where to finde
his Master, and where the
Bone-setter dwelt, telling
him that hee must returne
to his horses, and haste
to have the Wheeles
fitted to his Cart; saying,
that hee wanted money, as
ill hap was, to pay the
Wheel-wright, wherfore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
him, that if he had two
or three and twenty shillings
about him, to let him have
it, otherwise hee should
come too late to the market;
saying withall, that he would
not make two mishaps of one,
and that his Master would
pay him againe. The Citizen
without any difficulty deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
him 20<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. saying that
that was all hee had about
him, and goes on his way
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:4304:138"/>
with all speed supposing to
finde his Farmer in great
danger of death, and little
misdoubting of the deceit,
for <hi>Maillard</hi> had named unto
him his grounds, how and
where they were seated, and
what store of Corne they
were like to yeeld that yeer,
and many other particulars,
which he had learned at the
Farmers owne house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maillard</hi> returnes, and not
contented with the twenty
shillings hee had cheated of
the Citizen, resolves to doe
the like to his wife: he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
makes all possible haste
to the Citizens house, where
hee found the wife dressing
her selfe, and saith unto her,
Mistris, your husbands wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
hath sent me hither, (he
is now with the Bone-setter,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:4304:138"/>
who gives us good hope and
assurance of the recovery of
my Master) hee desires your
worship to send him twenty
shillings to give the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in hand towards the
Cure, my Master will pay
you assoone as his Corne is
sold.</p>
               <p>The good woman being
glad to hear that the Farmer
was in good hope of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
makes no scruple, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
him twenty shillings;
so he departs the house, and
goes to his companions, to
whom he related his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
but hee did not long
glory in his wickednesse, for
the Goldsmith, from whom
he had cheated the Chalice,
chanced to espie him in Saint
<hi>Germains</hi> Faire, lying in wait
to entrap others, and by him
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:4304:139"/>
was himself entrapped; and
for that, and other the like
cheats and robberies, hee
was broken upon the wheele
as hee most justly deserved;
Divine Justice seldome suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
any long to escape,
who so unjustly lay hands on
the goods of others, and
lead their lives, as it were,
in deffiance of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
who hath said,
Thou shalt not steale, but
shalt love thy neighbour as
selfe, and doe unto others,
as thou wouldest bee done
unto.</p>

another, besides the water
which hee puts in it, and
when the wine, being often
baptized, hath lost his
strength, hee hangs in the
vessell a little bag full of
Cloves, Pepper, Juniper,
and other Drugs; with
which hee makes it yet
seeme good and right.</p>
               <p>The Butcher robbes,
blowing the pieces of
flesh with a quill to make
them seeme a great deale
fairer, and that they may
yeeld more then they are
worth.</p>
               <p>The Perfumer robs, by
sophisticating the perfumes,
and by multiplying the
muske with the burnt liver
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:4304:143"/>
of a Cow, the Amber with
Sope and Sand, and Civet
with Butter.</p>
               <p>The Scholer robs, stealing
from Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,
&amp;c.</hi> the best of their
workes, and utters their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
as his owne, seeming
an Inventour of that hee is
not.</p>
               <p>Thus you see all rob, and

way and particular craft, for
the deceitfull working of his

               <p>SIr, you may perhaps
thinke that wee live dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly,
without either
Lawes or Discipline, but
you are therein mistaken; for
wee have first our Captaine
or Superiour, who ordaineth
and disposeth what Thefts
shall bee committed, by
whom and how: under his
Command are all sorts of
Theeves, Highway Theeves,
Tirelaines, Skipjackes, Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockes,
Church-robbers,
Cutpurses, Nightwalkers,
Boudgets, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:4304:144"/>
High-way Theeves rob on
great Rodes, and Deserts,
with great cruelty and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;
for they seldome
commit a Robbery without
a murder, fearing to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to the Justice: The
meanes and slights they use
in their Exploits, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
for sometimes, as
in a Citie, they dog a man
for a fortnight together,
untill hee departs out of
Towne, and the better to
intrap him, one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
goes disguised in the
habit of a Merchant to
lodge in the same Inne,
with cloake-bag or packe
stuffed with old cloth, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
out, that hee is a
strange Merchant, and that
hee is fearefull to goe on
his intended journey alone;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:4304:144"/>
with this his dissembling
hee discourseth with the
poor Merchant or Passenger,
and so drawing from him
cunningly what hee desires
to know; as whence he is,
whither hee goes, what
sort of merchandise he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or what other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
brought him thither,
and at what time hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts;
thus hee gathereth
by his discourse, of the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his Bootie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hee gives notice to his
Consorts, who attend him
in some place fitting their
purpose; others hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
behinde some well
growne bushes, and when
they perceive afarre off a
Passenger comming, then
they cast into the way a
Purse, or a Budget, or some
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:4304:145"/>
such thing, to the end that
when he alights and staies to
take it up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they may lay hands
on him and all hee hath: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
keeping themselves a
little from the high-way,
faine a lamentable voyce, by
which they urge the Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to stay and see what the
matter is; and whiles the
Plaintiffe dissemblingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
unto him his grief, the
Ambush breakes foorth and
strips him to his shirt.</p>
               <p>The Tirelaines take their
names from the Theft they
commit, which is to steale
Cloakes in the night; and
these use no other subtilty
then meere occasion. They
goe alwayes three and three,
or foure and foure together,
between nine and ten in the
night; and if they finde oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:4304:145"/>
in the mid-day they
will not lose it: They goe
forth to steale Clokes, most
commonly, in the darkest
nights and most rainie; and
to those by places which are
not much frequented, that
the cryes of those they rob
may not cause their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension:
They are somtimes
accustomed to bee clothed
like Lackeys, and to enter
where there is any Maske
or great Feast, faining that
they seeke for their Masters;
and with this liberty they
finde an heape of Cloakes
(which the Gentlemen, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
leave in the Hall, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
themselves that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
would there offer to
touch them) and so in the
sight of many they boldly
take them away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:4304:146"/>
The Skipjacks take their
names from Shipboyes, who
mount nimbly, by Cords, to
the top of the highest Mast:
Those who beare this name,
rob by night, mounting light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a Ladder of Cords, at
the end whereof are fastened
two little nooses, or hookes
of Iron, to the end that cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to the window it may
take hold and fasten, and
that they may easily get in
and out of the house, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
away what ever comes to
their hands, and having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
their exploit, they
readily fasten a small Corde
to the very point of the two
little hookes, which being
drawne, after their descent,
raiseth up the hookes, so that
the Ladder falleth without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
trace or marke of theft.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:4304:146"/>
Picklockes, are those that
carry sundry kinds of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with which they open
all sorts of doores.</p>
               <p>Church-robbers, are those
who lie lurking in some Pue
when Evening Prayers are
ended, and the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
having furnished them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with what purchase
they can get, at last pick open
the Church-doore, or breake
through one of the windows
and so depart.</p>
               <p>Cutpurses are the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Theevs of our Common
wealth, whose chiefest Art
consists either in neatly cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or nimbly, yet warily
taking a Purse out of ones
Pocket, without either being
perceived or suspected: these
(most commonly) frequent
Churches, Sermons, Faires, &amp;
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:4304:147"/>
other publique Assemblies,
that in the middest of the
throng they may the safer
act their feats of activitie;
they are accustomed to goe
well apparelled, to the end,
that if they approach any
Gentleman of quality, they
may have the lesse cause to
suspect them: they for the
most part seeke out stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
such as are the High
and Low Dutch, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to stand gaping
and gazing with open mouth
on some rarities, being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with such wonder
and amazement, that in their
study and trance, their shirt
might almost bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from them: They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
goe two to take a
Purse, and as soone as hee
that is appointed for the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:4304:147"/>
feat, hath performed it, hee
gives what he hath taken to
his companion, who stands
by him; so that if he bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
hee may more boldly
deny the act, and justifie
his innocencie before the
world.</p>
               <p>I will tell you the industry
which I once used; the last
yeere there came unto the
City of <hi>Lyons,</hi> a Merchant of
<hi>Italy,</hi> rich, courteous, and
of good carriage, who being
noted by our spies, I was
commanded to undertake
him. I arose early that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that I might not loose
any occasion, and having
followed him thorow divers
streets and Churches, (for
hee was very zealous) wee
came unto an assembly of
Merchants, which are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:4304:148"/>
to meet about ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the Clock; I seeing
him there alone approached
him, and began to enter
into a discourse concerning
a Traffique which might
prove very commodious and
profitable to him; to which
my discourse he attentively
listened, and after much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
the company great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encreasing, while my
Companion seconded my
discourse, and he attentively
hearkened unto him, not
observing me, I softly put
my fingers into his pocket
to search, or try, its depth
and widenesse, and quickly
found that it was capable
of my whole hand, so that
at the first adventure I got
his Purse, and at the second,
a Silver Watch fastened to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:4304:148"/>
a small Chaine of Gold; with
which I might have beene
well contented, if The every
had any limits, but be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ing
resolved to adventure the
third time, to try whether I
could draw from thence a
dainty fine wrought Holland
Handkercher (which I had
seene him use but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
but I could not bee
so dexterous in this third
feate, nor my Companion so
sweetly eloquent in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
but he felt me, and
hastening with his hand to
his pocket could not but
meet with mine; whereat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much troubled, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Purse and his Watch
gone, he seized on my Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and said I was a Theefe:
I now foreseeing the danger
which might happen to me
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:4304:149"/>
by my rashnesse, gave my
Purse and Watch to my
Comerade under my cloake
as soone as I had stole them.
Wherefore being assured
that he could not finde about
me that wherewith he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
mee, I laughed at what
he said, and gave him the lie
a thousand times: The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
notwithstanding, held
mee fast, demanding his
Purse with a loud voyce, in
so much that by reason of
the noise, much people were
gathered about the place;
but my Comerade tendring
my honour and safety, and
fearing the danger I was in,
hastened to a Cryer, which
hee found not farre off, and
procured him to cry, that if
any one had lost a Purse and
Watch, they should come
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:4304:149"/>
to such an Inne, and there
they should heare of them,
and upon a reasonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
for the finding,
and the markes told, hee
would deliver them; scarce
had this good <hi>Italian</hi> heard
the cry, but he leaves me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
me, with great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
to pardon his rash
censuring of mee, which I
did at the intreaty of those
that were by, and so left
them: He as swift as a Roe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucke
hastens to the Cryer,
tells him the making of his
Purse and Watch, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it appeare that hee lost
them, but hee who had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him to make the Cry,
was not to bee found:
And thus I narrowly esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the danger that I ran
into.</p>

The Night-walkers, are
those who take their walke
about the Towne towards
the beginning of evening,
and finding some doore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
they softly enter, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themselves in some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
place, till midnight,
when they cast out at the
windowes whatsoever they
finde within the house. I
once adventured to doe the
like; but to my cost. It
happened that on an Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
after Evening Prayer,
going to seeke my fortune,
it was my ill lucke to
spie a doore halfe open,
thorow the which putting
my head, I perceived that
all my body might enter;
which having done, I
went along a Ladder un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a great Chamber, very
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:4304:150"/>
well furnished, and being
confident that I might lie
safe under a bed which was
therein, untill the houshold
was all retired to their
rests, I tooke that course:
after I had layen some foure
houres on the ground, I sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
heard a noise of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
comming up towards
the Chamber, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the light of a Candle,
which they brought with
them, I espied the feet of
two or three servants, who
covered a table with a great
deale of care, and (as I
found afterward to my
cost) it was there the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the house intended
to sup: The Table being
furnished with divers sorts
of meates, foure or five
persons sate them downe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:4304:151"/>
thereto, (besides Children
that were in the house ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their supper with divers
Discourses: I was at that
time so affrighted, that I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
thinke (if the noise of
them and their Childrens
voyces had not hindered it)
they might easily have heard
the shaking of my thighes
one against another: by ill
luck there was a little Dog
in the house, which went up
and downe gnawing those
bones which were cast under
the Table; and one of the
Children casting downe a
Bone, a Cat which watched
at the end of the Table (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more diligent then the
Dog) took it and ran with it
from the Dog under the Bed;
the Dog runs after the Cat,
snarling at her, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:4304:151"/>
to take away the bone;
But the Cat, by the helpe of
her clawes, so well defended
her selfe, that having given
the Dog two or three scrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
so angred him that they
made a fearefull noise, which
made one of the Lackeys
take up a Fire-shovell out of
the Chimney, and cast it so
fiercely under the Bed, that
if it had hit my nose with the
edge, (as it did my Breech
with the handle) it had taken
it away cleane: but with
much adoe hee made the Cat
go from under the Bed, yet
did the Dog remaine behind,
grumbling and barking, with
such eagernesse, that neither
cheering him, nor threatning
could appease him; at which
they who served at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
being offended, began to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:4304:152"/>
beat him, and cast him almost
into the fire, leaving me as if
I were breathing my last:
The confusion that the Dog
wrought being ended, there
was another that began to
increase in my guts, with
such violence (by reason of
the apprehension and feare
that I was in) that being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to sneeze thrice, I
could not but offend my
Breeches twice. These two
noises meeting, and by their
conjunction augmenting, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
those at the Table to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
and see what this was;
so that I was taken with the
present offence, and was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the rigour of their
vengeance; no Plea that I
could make being sufficient
to defend mee: They stript
me starke naked, and binding
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:4304:152"/>
my hands and my feet, began
to scorch mee with their
Lights, not without a great
deale of laughter and scorne;
and having satisfied their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they delivered mee into
the hands of the Justice, from
whom I parted signed and
sealed.</p>
               <p>The Budgets, are Theeves
which runne themselves into
divers inconveniencies and
dangers, for they sometimes
cause themselves to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
in some Bale, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or Trunke, as if they
were some merchandise, and
to bee brought and left in
some rich mans house, to be
convayed to some countrey
Chapman to whom they
fain they would send it; to the
end that in the night, every
one being asleepe, hee may
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:4304:153"/>
with his knife or key make
way out, and so rob the
house; which tricke I once
acted to my great disgrace;
for a friend of mine faining
that hee had foure Bales
which hee desired to have
conveyed into the countrey,
inclosed mee within one of
them; and having so done,
convayed them to a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths
shop to be there kept
(as for a friend of the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths
whom hee had named
to him) untill the Carrier ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived:
The Goldsmith little
mistrusting any roguery to
be intentended, willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them into his house,
in regard that the time was
not long that they were to
trouble the house; but it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
happened that
in the night, when I thought
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:4304:153"/>
to have performed my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
exploit, three or
foure Apprentices who had
made a match to spend an
houre or two in mirth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the shop, setled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
some on one Bale and
some on another; and that
wherein I was inclosed,
was not so free, but that I
soone felt a burden, yet
not so great, but that I
could indifferently well
beare it; but having drunke
themselves merry, they at
the last betooke them to
their rest, which was no
rest to me, for whereas they
were severed before, they
now made choice of that
Bale wherein I was inclosed,
for their bed, &amp; theron slept
so profoundly, that a man
might have drawne them a
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:4304:154"/>
mile from their Couch and
not have wakened them: At
length (being almost stifled
with excessive waight) I mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a little, and perceiving
the immobility of that which
was on me, I verely thought
that they had put on me ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bale: with which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
and the extreame tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that I suffered, I drew
my knife, and cut a hole
through that wherein I was
inclosed, and made a large
gash in the Buttocks of him
who lay upon me; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he arose like Lightning,
and cry'd out unto the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
for help, thinking that
one of his companions wold
have killed him: the cry was
so great, that it not onely rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
divers of the neighbours,
but also hastened the Officer,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:4304:154"/>
who entring, found the poor
fellow that was hurt, and the
rest in great perplexity; he
examines the man that was
hurt, without taking notice
of the Bale, thinking it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
to enquire in what part
he had received his wound,
but to know the person that
gave it. The Goldsmith,
considering the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
began to thinke that the
abundance of blood which
he had lost had surely spoil'd
the Stuffes; and approaching
the Bale, he found it open;
and putting his finger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
to feele in what case the
Bale was, he lighted on my
Beard; I lay still, in hope
that hee would not guesse
what it was: but he taking a
Candle in his hand, drew
neere againe, and holding
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:4304:155"/>
downe the candle more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
to search what was in
it, the scalding liquor of
the candle fell upon my face,
which forced me to stirre a
little; whereupon he sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cried out, theeves, theeves,
so I was instantly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and at length, after a
sound whipping, condemned
to serve in the Gallies for
ten yeeres, and thus was I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
according to my
misdeeds.</p>

he having formerly heard
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:4304:155"/>
it from the mouth of him to
whom the chance happened.</p>
               <p>A young man of <hi>Poictou,</hi>
named <hi>Cyran,</hi> sonne of a
Merchant was sent to <hi>Tours</hi>
by his father to dispatch
some businesse which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained
to traffique. This
young man was naturally
pitifull, and from his youth
inclined to give almes
without distinction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
The honour of the
King of glory which may
bee much advanced by
workes, ought to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
with judgement:
for at length discretion is
the touchstone of humane
actions, and it is not enough
to doe good, a man must
doe it, and it must be done
to purpose. Almes is one
of the most excellent and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:4304:156"/>
most acceptable actions w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
those to whom God hath
given meanes can doe, (for
as the Divine Psalmist hath
sung; He that hath distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and given to the Poore,
his justice shall remaine from
age to age, and his horne,
(that is to say) his power
shall bee exalted in glory)
but it must bee performed
with a judicious distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
otherwise it will bee a
confused scattering, rather
then a charitable disposing:
And it may bee done to
such, as to whom to give
were no better then to put a
sword into a madmans hand,
or to give meanes to men
to commit Riotous excesse:
it is true that Vertue consists
in a meane, equally distant
from erronious extreames:
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:4304:156"/>
and as to give inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is rather a profuse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality
then a true liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
so also to take heede of
too many circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces when
one gives an Almes, argueth
rather a pinching niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
then a good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And likewise, as wee
must not too narrowly sifte
the qualities of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to whom we shew our
Charity, so must wee not
bee altogether blindefold
in our gifts; And among
these uncertainties, we must
so frame our intentions, as
not to consider onely to
whom we give, but also for
whose sake, even for his
sake who hath promised to
require the least Alms given
for the love of him. There
are Iliades of hard hearts
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:4304:157"/>
which finde fault with the
greatest part of these poore
creatures who beg of them.
This man (say they) is
strong enough to gaine his
living; that is a counterfeit,
this not too old, that not
too young, all are in their
judgements unworthy; and
this is onely to have in
shew a just pretence to
keepe in their purse that
metall (wherewith they
make their Idoll) without
purchasing the name of
covetousnesse: There bee
others which have open
hands, and more for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
then for pity give, or
through pity cast away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
to all, without
considering that it is to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
the lasinesse of a great
many vagabonds, who stand
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:4304:157"/>
more in need of a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
almes by a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
then of a temporall,
which they abuse in lewd
and strange deboistnesse:
But who can have a spirit
so truly discerning, sithence
there is nothing in the
world more deceiving then
outward appearance. For
example, there runne tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the streets of Townns,
and thorow the Countreys,
a multitude of vagabonds,
who under the name of
poore souldiers (that are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey)
demand almes, when
oft times such are notorious
theeves, who in begging
seeke nothing more then fair
occasions to commit foule
thefts, murders, pillage, and
the like; these men have
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:4304:158"/>
God altogether in their
mouthes, and the Devill in
their hearts; and yet as God
did heretofore draw fire out
of the mud, when <hi>Ismael</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from the Captivity of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> so from among these
Bandetti he retires one good
theefe, as you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by that which ensueth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyran</hi> passing thorow the
streets of <hi>Tours</hi> (which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
as a flower in the
midst of the garden of
<hi>France)</hi> meets with a poore
souldier, who though but
meanly apparelled, yet kept
still a good countenance.
This souldier demanded of
him an almes, with such a
kinde of disgracefull grace,
that hee found himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
excited to give him
one; but being extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:4304:158"/>
moved, he put his hand
into his pocket, and thinking
to have taken thence once
Sol, he lighted on a piece of
five, which he with a good
will gave him, and with
words of honour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
wisheth him a good
returne into his countrey,
and a better Art then that of
warre, where there is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
nothing to bee gained
but knockes: The souldier
after a modest and civill
manner answered, Sir God
give me grace and power to
doe you some good service,
conformable to the desire I
have thereunto: you have
shewed mee your bounty in
my pinching necessity, which
I never shall be unmindfull
of, for therein you have
done little lesse then saved
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:4304:159"/>
my life; after these words of
Complement they parted.
Some few dayes, after the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
which hindered this
Poictevin at <hi>Tours,</hi> being fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
he takes his leave, and
thence returnes towards his
Countrey; but as he crossed
a Wood, behold there sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
rushed out three
Theeves, whereof the one
seazed on the Bridle of his
Horse, and another setting a
sword to his throat, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
him to alight and
to follow them into the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
of the Wood; a rude en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement,
and an imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
kinde of command, yet
such as must bee fulfilled;
most commands presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a necessity of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
When they had lead
him into the most uncouth
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:4304:159"/>
and obscure part of the
Wood, they there rifled
him, and tooke from him all
the Money that hee had,
which amounted to the sum
of one hundred Crownes,
or thereabouts; and having
likewise deprived him of
his Cloke and best Wares,
they began to deliberate
whether they should kill
him, or not? Let us said
one of them, I know (by
his language) that hee is
one of this Countrey, and
therefore may raise Hue and
Cry after us, and so disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us: 'Tis well said (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
another) if such men
had killed him whom they
stript in such a Forrest, they
would not now have made
so many wry mouthes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Gibbet at poor wearied
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:4304:160"/>
passengers. The third (who
was the man to whom <hi>Cyran</hi>
had some few dayes before
given the almes of five sols:)
Companions said hee, what
good will his life doe us, his
bloud will cry louder against
us for vengeance then his
voyce: we shall have a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
replyed one of the
others, those that use the
trade that we exercise, ought
to stop their eares against
these considerations, which
are good for none but old
men and children; the dead
bite no more, neither doe
they speake a word, the
voyce of blood hath no
eyes, and hee will bee
well nigh rotten before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
can possibly finde him in
this place.</p>
               <p>Friends (replyed the good
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:4304:160"/>
Theefe) I beg of you his
life, for it I will willingly
forsake that part of the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
due unto me: I will tell
you a very good course to
spare his life, and yet to
provide for our own safetie;
let us binde him to some
tree, and so leave him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Gods protection, so we
shall not bee defiled with
his blood. This advice was
by his earnest perswasions
followed, and <hi>Cyran</hi> was
bound to a tree w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall
of his horse, and his own
garters, the theeves taking
away his horse and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but the good Theefe
bowing himselfe toward
<hi>Cyran,</hi> (as if hee had beene
busied in tying him) said soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto him, Friend take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
I will come this night
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:4304:161"/>
to unbinde thee, I have not
forgot thine almes; Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
words, but proceeding
from the mouth of a Theefe,
therefore not greatly to bee
relied upon; yet hee made
a vertue of necessity, and that
hee might not seeme despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
ungratefull, he thanks
him for a benefit not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
thus he remaines fast
bound all the rest of that
day, trusting in the mercy
and providence of God, and
expecting the uncertaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of the Purse-takers
most certaine promise: but
at night he entred into the
horrour of death, when in
the duskenesse of the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
hee heard the yeelling
and howling of the Wolves
which were in that Forrest;
two of them were so bold as
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:4304:161"/>
to approach him, but having
for a time viewed him, and
being somewhat distrustfull
of their strength they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
retired, but it was not
long before they returned
with greater forces. This
beast is not onely cruell,
but also so subtile and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous,
that even when men
make curious invented Gins
to catch them, yet can they
very seldome take, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
any of them: This
beast feares the stock of a
Peece, hee shunneth snares,
hee lookes about him, hee
hearkens, considers, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
observes the least mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
all which is marvellous
to be found in a beast that
hath not reason. Poor <hi>Cyran</hi>
thinking himselfe to have
now seen the last of his daies,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:4304:162"/>
heartily recommended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to God, as a man that
was at the point of yeelding
up his Ghost; for they had
long since sented him, and
now at length began to
assaile him in troopes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to make of him
a Supper for themselves:
but suddenly, with most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
yeelling, they sound a
retreat, wherwith the whole
Wood resounded; and the
Ecchoes multiplying, made
<hi>Cyran</hi> thinke that there were
a whole Legion of Wolves
which came to devoure him:
They had now perceived the
approch of him whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
poore <hi>Cyran</hi> had long
expected; surely if his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
had been delayed but
a very little longer, his
comming had been too late;
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:4304:162"/>
and it is likely hee should
have found poore <hi>Cyran</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
by the Wolves.
But God, who sendeth aide
in tribulation, and whose assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
comes alwayes oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely,
sent him at an instant
(when his long expectation
was turned almost into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire)
to deliver <hi>Cyran</hi> not
only from the feare of death,
but also from the death of
feare; for already had ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
seazed on his heart,
and he thought there was no
way but inevitable and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
death: but behold now
the extreamity of one passion
turned into another; Griefe
and Despaire turned into
Confidence and Joy, <hi>Cyran</hi>
no sooner saw him, but he
became confident of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery;
hee had na sooner
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:4304:163"/>
conceived this latter hope,
but hee enjoyed his long
desired liberty by this good
Theefe his willingly unty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those knots which hee
had before so unwillingly
knit. I leave it to you to
judge, with what excessive
words he testified his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
to the good Theefe,
who had in one day given
him his life twice; first from
retyring him from the throat
of those roaring lions the
other Theeves, and secondly
from the ravening Wolves,
who are Theeves living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
prey. <hi>Cyran</hi> was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to make him some part
of requitall for this great
benefit; and the better to
expresse his desire, hee offers
the Souldier to use him as
his brother, if hee would
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:4304:163"/>
but reside with him, and
forsake that miserable kinde
of life, which could not but
leade him to a very shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
end, and would give him
so much of his estate as hee
should have just cause to bee
contented therewith. To
leave this course of Robbing
(replyed the Souldier) is
my full resolution, I have
long since inwardly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
such an earnest hatred
thereof, that it continually
seemes an hell unto me: My
intent is to become religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
penitent for those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mischiefes which I have
wrought in following this
accursed mistery: I never
in all my life killed any man,
but have beene present at
divers murthers, I began to
Rob, being prest thereunto
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:4304:164"/>
by necessity; but continued
in it through a kinde of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
pleasure that there is in
taking, although it served
but to feed our unlimitted
deboistnesse: now finding
no sure place of retreat in
<hi>France,</hi> where I am alway
in danger of the Law, I am
resolved to passe into <hi>Italie,</hi>
and having visited <hi>Loretto</hi>
and <hi>Rome,</hi> to cast my selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
some religious house; and
if I cannot bee there admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to retire my selfe into
some Hermitage. I humbly
intreat you to pray unto
God for mee that hee may
continue in me his inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and give me grace to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
this good designe. This
poore Theefe thinking that
the curtesie already done
unto <hi>Cyran,</hi> had not extended
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:4304:164"/>
unto a full requitall for his
former Charity, laboured to
perswade him to accept of
his part of the hundred
Crownes which was taken
from him; freely offering
unto him a hundred Franks.
But <hi>Cyran</hi> not onely refused
it, but freely forgiving him,
protested that if hee would
take the paines to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him to the next Towne,
he would inlarge his bounty
towards him.</p>
               <p>The penitent Souldier (for
I make it a matter of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to call him Theefe after
so godly a change) either
mistrusting a subtilty in the
Offer, or being fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
for what he had done,
(refusing it) heartily thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, and after their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
imbracements having
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:4304:165"/>
made a mixture of their
teares: <hi>Cyran</hi> took one way,
and the Souldier the other,
whom hee never saw after.
But the two others he saw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two moneths after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discovered by the Cloke
and horse of <hi>Cyran,</hi> and being
accused of other Robberies,
fell into the hands of the
Provost Marshall, who justly
gave them a quick dispatch,
they being fastened to the
Bough of an accursed tree,
commonly called a Gibbet,
where they never descended
but by the pendant.</p>
               <p>The good successe of Alms
shines with such lustre in this
Relation, that if there were
no other motive to exercise
liberality towards the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
then that centuple which
is in the Scripture promised
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:4304:165"/>
in this life, it were sufficient
to draw it from the hands of
Covetousnes it selfe, sithence
there is no usury so excessive
as to take a hundred for one:
to which, if you adde the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
worth of eternall life,
who will be so hide bound as
not to give with a free will
that NOTHING, or flitting
toy of things transitory, to
attaine unto that great ALL,
and that one necessary
thing, most blessed
ETERNITY.</p>
